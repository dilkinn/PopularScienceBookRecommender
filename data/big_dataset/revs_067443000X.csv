0,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/869064-jeremy,5," Given the amount of hype and misinformation around this book, I'll start by saying what Capital in the 21st century is not about. This book is NOT:1. A work of opinion journalism or punditry. Though, obviously, it does contain the views of its author 2. A prescriptive manifesto trying to explain how to utterly eradicate inequality worldwide, though its author does feel constructive steps can be taken to reduce such inequalities. 3. A work of Journalism written in response to the recession of 2007-2008 or to cheaply capitalize on the surge of public interest in matters financial in recent years, though obviously anyone interested in those topics will find it intensely engaging. 	This book is a staggeringly in-depth, wide-ranging, rigorously researched, endlessly quantified and qualified work of economic history. Thomas Piketty is interested in wealth. Where does it come from, how do we talk about, how can we understand its history in a modern context and what does its distribution at different levels tell us about our world, and perhaps most of all, how might that distribution be problematic?  In order to attempt to answer these questions, he has collected, organized and presented an unprecedented volume of data, not merely about where wealth is concentrated now, but where it has been concentrated using data from multiple countries going back to the 19th century (and in the case of his native France, even a bit further than that). The real power of this book, and I suspect one reason its been praised/condemned so militantly in recent months lies in its macro-economic, longitudinal perspective. Piketty is interested in what the broadest net of information possible tells us about capital in the modern age. And what it tells is powerful, disillusioning and ultimately humiliates economic dogma of every ideological stripe.  He's so concerned about explicating this information, with breaking it down with a litany of analogies and concrete examples, and with talking about its limitations and potential pitfalls, that at times the reader almost doesn't see the intimidatingly complete picture of modern wealth inequality he has built up. Reading this is like watching an adult walk into a room full of people who have long since forgotten how to be adults. He synthesizes the best ideas from economic thinkers as diverse as Marx, Ricardo, Kuznets, etc while at the same time utterly humiliating their worst ideological tendencies with the sort of data they either didn't have or were simply too driven by their own dogmas to even consider assembling.  The picture he paints of the state of inequality of wealth in our world is harrowing precisely because of how pragmatically clinical it's put together. There is precisely no observable economic force (no free-market, or growth rate or invisible hand) or principle or idea, that will prevent wealth from continuing its already stratospheric concentration into fewer and fewer hands at levels which we haven't seen since the 19th century. Indeed, one suspects the reason so many of the book's historical and cultural references (Jane Austen and Honre de Balzac show up in this book, much to the shock and delight of this overly-humanistic reviewer) come from the 19th century is because, as Piketty shows, we are quickly returning to a world where economic inequality resembles and quite likely will exceed the sort of stratification seen in 1800's europe. In short, all the indicators he presents show a possible future where personal initiative and hard-work will be worth nothing compared to the power of returns on super-concentrated and largely inherited securities and private fortunes.  That any sincere economic analysis could even hint (and this book goes way beyond hinting) that the future of capital would look like the hyperbolic plane of unfathomable wealth and unbearable poverty that animated so much of the 19th century, should give a pause to even the most militant neo-liberal policy advocate. Piketty's conclusions, rooted as they are in a wealth of historical data drawn over a century and a half, are dramatic, alarming and above all, profound. There is no historical example to be found of a society whose concentration of wealth has continued to grow unabated at the level ours has without inevitably facing some profound, usually gruesome sociopolitical upheaval.  Whether the extremely pro-active, and as he admits, pie in the sky, idea of a global tax on wealth is really possible will probably remain to be seen. But the real point is that meaningful, coordinated international action on transparency and taxation is worth attempting. As the book constantly reiterates with a slew of compelling data, the only other force which has ever stemmed the tide of such wealth disparities was the chaotic, murderous world war period from 1914-1945. Surely attempting to address this problem now is superior to waiting for a global blood-bath, or a French Revolution round 2 to tip the scales back. As Piketty's pragmatic reading of economic history proves, no outcome is guaranteed, but numbers can tell you a lot more than nothing.  This is a demanding book, maybe not Hegel or Heidegger-level demanding, but it requires discipline and a willingness to be lead through some very important, brilliantly elucidated data. Piketty has attempted a grand synthesis of economics and history which also incorporates ideas from literature, sociology, politics and psychology. What's more, he has done so in a way which virtually anyone with a high school diploma and a bit of patience can find accessible.  Capital in the 21st century is that rarest of things; a non-fiction book of the moment which could very well prove to be the book of its age. It will certainly haunt my perspective for some time to come. I recommend this book unconditionally."
1,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"This book is basically the Harry Potter of Economics – I mean in terms of blockbuster sales and turning its author into a rock star. He is being credited with giving new life to the left. The book is very long. I’m not sure if you really need to read the whole thing, either. Depending on what you want to get out of this, you really could get by with reading the Introduction and the Conclusion. If that doesn’t seem enough, then you could read Chapter 14 and 15 – pretty much where he outlines his ‘solutions’.I’m going to give you the layperson (that’s me) version of this book. Marx (and to be fair Ricardo before him) believed in the total impoverishment of the working class. Essentially, Capitalism works by deskilling people. Adding technology to factories removes skills from workers. The greater the amount of technology, therefore the greater the displacement of labour, thus the less labour you need to make the same amount of stuff. But that means you need more capital to make that stuff, machines and so on. As Galbraith points out in The New Industrial State, when Ford started making cars he did so from an old farm shed. If you are thinking of starting a car company today I don’t suggest you buy yourself a shed. In fact, unless you are already a billionaire a few times over I don’t suggest you even start. Production has become so mechanised that the capital investment needed is mind blowing.Marx saw this process as producing an inevitable contradiction for Capitalism – for Marx Capitalism’s problem was always over supply of goods and services. Eventually, and inevitably, the concentration of wealth in the hands of the few would mean no one would be left able to buy what was produced and this would then shut down factories – no point producing stuff no one can buy it. Marx didn’t see revolution as being morally inevitable because Capitalism was bad, but rather that Capitalism would inevitably put a limit on the growth of production and Marx believed that any system that did that would be swept aside.And while there have been clearly times when this looked like exactly what was going to happen, and not just in the 1930s or 1890s, it never quite has happened. Capitalism has proven much more resilient than Marx predicted. Part of the reason for this, as explained in this book, is that Marx based his model of Capitalism on a steady state economy. That is, one that doesn’t grow. I find this almost impossible to believe – but that is what this guy says so we’ll go with that. He does make it clear that the economy in the 19th Century didn’t grow as we are now used to seeing it grow. He talks about novels as his proof here – you know, grab a Jane Austin and people are always talking about how you can live really well with 1000 or 5000 pounds a year – and he explains that this was as true by the end of the century as it was at the start. I couldn’t dream of living on my first wage now – thirty years later – and no one really talks about millionaires anymore. So, he suggests that the steady state economy wasn’t such a crazy approximation as it might seem to us now.In the middle of the 20th century economists were predicting that Capitalism had changed its ways. All of that stuff Marx was worried about were just teething problems. In fact, once Capitalism really got into its stride it tended towards ever greater equity. The proof was in the numbers. Following the wars equity had spread about the place like a magical fairy distributing good will. All was well in the garden. In fact, these economists were certain that increasingly equity was as inevitable to Capitalism as Marx had thought revolution was. Then came 1980 and that evil bastard Reagan and his vicious twin sister Thatcher. They took as much money as they could squeeze out of the poor and gave it all to the rich in what they called trickle down economics, but that was really gush up economics. This is where the book becomes interesting. What this guy has done is track income records for about three centuries. Mostly from France, but from elsewhere too. He explains that it doesn’t make too much sense to take the US as an example over this period. Why? Because over this timeframe France’s population doubled. Over much the same period the US population grew by 100 times. Different rules apply to countries in these very different circumstances. It is also fairly unlikely that the US population is going to grow by another 100 times anytime soon. Given that, France probably makes a better model than the US does.Ok, so what do we find if we look at the relationship between income and capital over that period? This is important because everyone is currently certain that the path to wealth is through developing your ‘human capital’. That is, if you have smarts and get qualified and get a good job you will be wealthy – welcome to the joys of meritocracy. But this hasn’t always been true in human history (in fact, it has only been true for a very short time) and it probably isn’t all that true today any longer. The problem is that what happened in the middle of the 20th century – the time when society became more equal – was a direct consequence (not of Capitalism becoming inevitably more egalitarian) but of two world wars and a depression. You see, when you have a world war shit gets blown apart. Houses, factories, roads – what you would call Capital. And the people who own this Capital are the Capitalists. Them losing capital makes society more equal, but this is a sick way to make the world more equal. Large amounts of their fortunes disappeared as a consequence of these devastations and people after the war made sure that gross fortunes couldn’t be made from rents. Taxes were imposed everywhere on rent capital and this too made society much more equal.When you go out to work you make stuff and gain an income. GDP is all of the stuff that the economy makes in a year. But not all of that stuff disappears at the end of the year. Lots of it does, but not all. You know, every year we produce lots of milk and it is either used up or it is thrown out. But we also produce houses and, unless you are in certain parts of the US or Europe, those houses are still around at the end of the year and even for years to come and they more or less hold their value. The total wealth of a country isn’t what it produces in any given year, but is always much greater than that. Government are always very keen to see the economy grow. But what this guy has found is that the rate of growth of income is less than the rate of return on capital. This needs explained.Let’s say the economy is growing at between 1-2% a year. What he has been able to show is that the rate of return on capital under this growing economy can be say 5%. Right, so there is the problem. If the economy is growing at 2% and capital is growing at 5% then people who own capital are getting richer at a faster rate than the economy is growing. So, they have to be gaining more and more of the total wealth of an economy, not just income, but also the reserves from the general capital of the economy. And with this greater share of everything they are increasingly able to claim rent, rather than income for creative deployment of their capital. Rent, as he repeatedly says, is the past eating the future. This is part of the reason why we taxed it so heavily in the middle of the 20th century. When we privitise public assets we are giving these to private persons, ultimately, and if it is school buildings or roads or hospitals, you then get to pay those private person rent for the use of these assets.The lesson, then, is that if you allow it, Capital will concentrate into fewer and fewer hands. Ok, so what’s the problem with that? Well, just look at the US. It can hardly be called a democracy any more. The rich are so obscenely wealthy that they simply buy the political system. The transfer of wealth has been so extreme that there is virtually no possibility of any social mobility anymore. This has brought about the crisis of the prison system, a crushingly unequal education system, a health system that is the most expensive in the world and yet leaves millions of people excluded from it, a remarkable lack of a social safety net and the list goes on and on. Gross inequity has been repeatedly shown to cause gross social dysfunction. This book is written from the concern that gross inequity will quite literally end democracy.The solution offered is an international tax on capital. This needs to be international, as we live in a global economy and we need to make sure that those with capital don’t just shift it about to avoid paying the tax. He makes the very interesting point that the whole world is currently in debt and that this is due to us paying rents to capital. When what we ought to be doing is taxing that capital.  Now, I’m not as optimistic as this guy is. I read an article about this book today by three economists – or rich men’s arse wipes, which I believe is the technical name for them - http://theconversation.com/pikettys-b... They quite misrepresent Piketty’s argument, but that isn’t what is important. What they also do is prove that no one is giving up their own position without a damn good fight. The only way such a tax would be possible is – well – there is no way such a tax could be possible. The rich are never going to just agree to such a thing. Such arse wipes as the three gentlemen above are in over abundant supply. They will create endless reasons why equity is impossible. Eventually things will become intolerable and then, in the words of a dead Irish poet, the people will ‘take what you would not give’. This taking what would not be given, so far, has never worked out all that well. In fact, it generally works out appallingly badly. But, like I said, I’m a pessimist. I’m not proud of my pessimism, but if someone could show me anywhere where the rich have agreed to hand over even the smallest part of their obscene wealth for the common good, then I will shut up. They will go on blaming the poor while gorging themselves sick. The planet will continue on its way to wherever catastrophe unsustainable development is planning to lead us. None of it is pretty in any direction, as far as I can see.If there is one service this guy provides us, it is to see that capitalism needs to be saved from itself, much as Galbraith said in the 1950s. That democracy needs to be extended and that non-productive capital needs to have its arse taxed off it. I don’t particularly hold out all that much hope for anything of these outcomes, but at least we can’t say we weren’t warned."
2,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15698421-scotty-wardle,1,"It's amazing to me how often Marxism gets repackaged and sold as if it was something new. Piketty's book is a prime example of this. It attempts to resell the already disproven lie about post WWII growth being caused by taxing the rich when in fact very few of the wealthy elite actually paid the 70-90% tax rates. Post WWII growth was the result of the U.S. holding excess gold reserves from Europe and the Bretton Woods conference that made the U.S. dollar the world's reserve currency. Anyone who tells you any different is an idiot, a liar or both. Economic illiteracy has resulted in the rising support of socialism, even though socialism has failed over and over again. And even though no country has ever allowed pure capitalism to exist, capitalism gets blamed by those who have no idea WTF they are talking about. What we have today are central banks who micromanage the global economy, screwing over all of the small countries, setting off all kinds of market distortions, and causing one boom-bust cycle after another. Instead of allowing a nation's economy grow at natural rates, the nations of the world have allowed the ruling class to instill various forms of cronyism and corporatism while calling it capitalism. Save your money and skip over this book. Go straight to F.A. Hayek's The Road To Serfdom, a book that set the record straight back in 1944. You will learn about the roots of socialism and understand that such ideas are not new and will never work, no matter how it gets repackaged."
3,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,5,"This is my five stars of ""this book changed the way I look at something,"" not five stars of flawlessness or five stars of thinking everyone in the world should read it. Since I didn't have an opinion before, it would be more accurate to say this book gave me a way of looking at the structure of wealth in economies over time.First things first, for people who read reviews of the book rather than the book itself. This book is not about slamming the rich; Piketty doesn't talk very much about morality, instead viewing everyone as making rational, yet obviously self-interested, decisions in the environment they see before them. On the flip side, he is not as concerned about the poor as you might think, although he exhibits worry about the hollowing out of the post-war middle class, which benefitted from the capital that drifted away from the very rich, but is now losing their share. The charge that Piketty is a Marxist is risible. Part of his concern is to alleviate inequality and thus prevent the kind of revolution that a true Marxist would consider necessary. He has some unflattering things to say about Marx (Piketty's an academic, so it's not ""GODLESS COMMIE!!1!1!!"" but pretty darn scathing) and even less nice things to say about the Soviet attempt to run a Communist state.* Piketty suggests some rather utopian measures, but in principle, they're not much more than extensions of concepts and structures that already exist. And the principle, by the way, derives from 18th century documents. He refers to the Declaration of Independence, but being French, what he's really building on is the Declaration of Rights of Man. If you're an adherent of the Club for Growth and reading this book in order to be infuriated, it's going to be a long slog with very little to keep your furnace going from one stats-filled chapter to the next.On the highest level, the argument of this book is that the structure of wealth that the rich Western countries experienced in the mid 20th century was an anomaly. Unfortunately a lot of the laws of economics were formulated then and are flawed tools for analyzing the world today. Piketty explores the circumstances under which the return on capital is higher than the growth rate, and what distribution of wealth results when that (r > g, in his shorthand) is true. This is hard to explain without writing a review as long as his book. Suffice to say that when r > g, money socked away in the past earns faster than a worker can earn through his labor today, which means that wealth snowballs in the hands of a small number of people without others having a chance to catch up. G was unusually high in the 20th century due to a variety of factors: immigration in the U.S., new technology, war, inflation in the post-war period intended to melt away national debts, and so forth. Growth is likely to slow compared to the mid-20th century and returns on capital are likely to increase as wealthy people and institutions have access to more efficient investment vehicles, so Piketty predicts that capital inequality will grow, such that eventually society looks more like it did in the Belle Epoque. Despite the faith of post-war economists, ""there is no natural, spontaneous process to prevent destabilizing, inegalitarian forces from prevailing permanently."" Through the bulk of the book, Piketty's aim is to document the structure of who in society held what wealth, and what kind of wealth, when--and to systematically demonstrate how the present day is more like (say) the 1910s than the 1970s and on a trajectory to become even more so. Relatively few pages are devoted to his prescriptions for getting back on a more sustainable path, which is why I would recommend this book even if you are dead-set against his ultimate conclusion.An additional flourish on this argument is the difference between rentiers and what Piketty calls ""supermanagers,"" generally corporate leaders who earn huge salaries. Whereas in the past the most wealthy were rentiers, who owned and inherited things like land or bonds and collected rents or interest on them, the wealth of supermanagers comes through their present labor. Or at least it starts there, but their income is so large that it quickly becomes a traditional fortune, so that these people can be rentiers and supermanagers at once. I found myself wondering as I read these parts whether we in the U.S. would tolerate a non-working class of the very rich. Generally we Americans feel obliged to make a nod towards work; even Paris Hilton claims to be an actress. Do we really want our own class of Bertie Woosters? Piketty doesn't ask this question, but it quickly came to me as an American reader and seems representative of the kinds of questions of the spirit of fairness and democracy that underpin the whole enquiry. One of my favorite things in the book is how Piketty uses literature to illustrate his historical points, particularly the writing of Balzac and Austen. Since I don't personally know anyone from the 19th century outside of books, his use of familiar characters really brought those points alive for me. Piketty manages to shed light on economics and history at once. For example, there's a worthwhile discussion of how it's difficult to talk about quantities of money in the past in a way that is consistent, due to changes in the marketplace; ""French purchasing power expressed in terms of oranges increased tenfold, and expressed in terms of bananas, twentyfold."" Elsewhere, he talks about how Austen could specify a young lady's fortune and be confident that any reader would know what annual income would derive from it and what kind of lifestyle she could afford. Not only that, but the size of the fortune would mean the same thing to a reader fifty years later, due to the lack of inflation at that point in history. (Contrast that with a hilarious ad I once found in the Forbes magazine library while interning there. In a 1978 issue, a young man was posed leaning on a sports car with the bold headline: ""Can you believe this man makes $34,000 a year?"") I'm sure other readers found all the literature stuff a distraction, but I didn't, and in fact one of my favorite things about the book was how wide-ranging it was and how it caused my mind to spark off in other directions while reading. I have few critiques to offer and I don't think nitpicking individual datasets can undercut the concepts the author is trying to introduce. I would say that he is more invested in offering a data set and a way of looking at the history of wealth than he is in actually getting the reader to embrace a global tax on capital. He doesn't talk very much about the fact that a poor person in an affluent Western country today has far more material comfort than a poor person in the 19th century, which strikes me as both an interesting question and an obvious way to counterargue that present day inequality isn't hurting anyone. He also takes it as a given that the reader views Belle Epoque societal stratification as something we want to avoid in the future, which is true in my case but possibly a little lazy.At this point, I will admit defeat in my attempt to wrangle the huge variety of facts and arguments into a brief review and leave you with part of the author's conclusion: ""If we are to regain control of capitalism, we must bet everything on democracy.""* ""[Marx] probably suffered as well from having decided on his conclusions in 1848, before embarking on the research needed to justify them. Marx evidently wrote in great political fervor, which at times led him to issue hasty pronouncements from which it was difficult to escape."" And much later, both a burn and a good insight: ""Unfortunately for the people caught up in these totalitarian experiments, the problem was that private property and the market economy do not serve solely to ensure the domination of capital over those who have nothing to sell but their labor power. They also play a useful role in coordinating the actions of millions of individuals, and it is not so easy to do without them. The human disasters caused by Soviet-style centralized planning illustrate this quite clearly."""
4,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16657172-mark-skousen,1,"The Economist magazine rightly calls French professor Thomas Piketty the new Marx, although a watered-down version. Piketty’s bestseller (rated #1 on Amazon) is a thick volume with the same title as Karl Marx’s 1867 magnum opus, “Kapital.” The publisher, Harvard University Press, appropriately designed the book cover in red, the color of the socialist workers party.Piketty cites Karl Marx more than any other economist, even more than Keynes. The professor barely mentions Adam Smith. Instead of the modern scientific name “economics,” he prefers the old term “political economy,” a favorite of radical professors.And most importantly, Piketty’s focus is on the distribution of income and capital, not the creation of wealth. He’s not so much concerned with the size of the economic pie, but how it’s cut up.His main thesis is that inequality grows under capitalism, that unfettered free markets make the rich richer and the poor poorer — a standard Marxist position — and that the only solution is to tax the dirty, filthy, stickin’ rich with highly progressive taxes on their income and wealth.I don’t want to be picky, but Piketty often ignores data that contradicts his theory of growing inequality. For instance, he selectively chooses members of the Forbes magazine billionaires’ list to show that wealth always grows automatically faster than the average income earner. He repeatedly refers to the growing fortunes of Bill Gates in the United States and Liliane Bettencourt, heiress of L’Oreal, the cosmetics firm. “Once a fortune is established,” he claims, “the capital grows according to a dynamic of its own, and it can continue to grow at a rapid pace for decades simply because of its size.”Come again?I guess he hasn’t heard of the dozens of millionaires and billionaires who lost their fortunes, like the Vanderbilts, or to use a recent example, Eike Batista, the Brazilian businessman who just two years ago was the seventh-wealthiest man in the world, worth $30 billion, and now is practically bankrupt.Piketty conveniently ignores the fact that most high-performing mutual funds eventually stop beating the market and even underperform. Take a look at the Forbes “Honor Roll” of outstanding mutual funds. Today’s list is almost entirely different from the list of 15 or 20 years ago. In our business, we call it “reversion to the mean,” and it happens all the time.The professor seems to have forgotten a major theme of Marx, and later Joseph Schumpeter, that capitalism is a dynamic model of creative destruction. Today’s winners are not necessarily next year’s winners. IBM used to dominate the computer business; now Apple does. Citibank used to be the country’s largest bank. Now it is Chase. Sears Roebuck used to be the largest retail store. Now it is Wal-Mart. GM used to be the biggest car manufacturer. Now it is Toyota. And the Rockefellers used to be the wealthiest family. Now it is the Walton family, who a generation ago were dirt poor.Piketty is no communist and is certainly not as radical as Marx in his predictions or policy recommendations. Many call Piketty “Marx Lite.” He doesn’t advocate abolishing money and the traditional family, confiscating all private property or nationalizing all of the industries. But he’s plenty radical in his soak-the-rich schemes, a punitive 80% tax on incomes above $500,000 or so, and a progressive global tax on capital with an annual levy between 0.1% and 10% on the greatest fortunes.Why assess a tax of even 0.1% on wealth? It destroys a fundamental sacred right of mankind — financial privacy and the right to be left alone. An income tax is bad enough. But a wealth tax is worse. A wealth tax is Big Brother at his worst. Such a tax would require every citizen to list all his or her assets. The intent is to prevent any secret stash of gold and silver coins, diamonds, artwork or bearer bonds. Suddenly, the privacy guaranteed to Americans by the Fourth Amendment would be denied and produce an illegal and underground black market.Equally important, a wealth tax is a tax on capital — the key to economic growth. The worst crime of Piketty’s vulgar capitalism is his failure to understand the positive role of capital in advancing the standard of living in the world. As Andrew Carnegie simply said, “Capitalism is about turning luxuries into necessities.” The latest example is the smartphone. It’s the great equalizer. Virtually everyone rich and poor has one, thanks to the ingenuity of entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs. This is democratic capitalism at its best. Income inequality may be growing, but when it comes to goods and services, inequality may be shrinking.To create new products and services and raise economic performance, a nation need capital, lots of it. Contrary to Piketty’s claim, it is good that capital grows faster than income, because it means people are increasing their savings rate. The only time capital declines is during war and depression, when capital is destroyed.Piketty blames the increase in inequality on low growth rates. He says return on capital tends to be higher than the economic growth rate. Good, let’s increase economic growth with tax cuts, sensible deregulation, better training/education, productivity and opening trade.Even Keynes understood the value of capital investment and the need to keep it growing. In his “Economic Consequences of the Peace,” Keynes compared capital to a cake that should never be eaten. “The virtue of the cake was that it was never to be consumed, neither by you nor by your children after you.”If the capital “cake” is the source of economic growth and a higher standard of living, we want to do everything we can to encourage capital accumulation. Make the cake bigger, and there will be plenty to go around for everyone. This is why increasing corporate profits is good — it means more money to pay workers. Studies show that companies with higher profit margins tend to pay their workers more. Remember the Henry Ford $5-a-day story of 1914? (In honor of its centennial, I’m telling this story again at FreedomFest this July 9.)If anything, we should reduce taxes on capital gains, interest and dividends, and encourage people to save more and thus increase the pool of available capital and entrepreneurial activity. A progressive tax on high-income earners is a tax on capital. An inheritance tax is a tax on capital. A tax on interest, dividends and capital gains is a tax on capital. By over-taxing capital, estates and the income of our wealthiest people, including heirs to fortunes, we are selling our country and our nation short. You can never have too much capital.What country has advanced the most since World War II? Hong Kong, which has no tax on interest, dividends or capital.The great Scottish economist Adam Smith once said, “Little else is required to carry a state from the lowest barbarism to the highest degree of opulence but peace, easy taxes and a tolerable administration of justice.” Moreover, his system of easy taxes and natural liberty would reduce inequality and result in “universal opulence, which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people.”My hope is that Professor Piketty will see the error of his ways and write a sequel called “The Wealth of Nations for the 21st Century,” which will quote Adam Smith instead of Karl Marx. Perhaps he will quote this passage: “To prohibit a great people… from making all that they can of every part of their own produce, or from employing their stock and industry in the way that they judge most advantageous to themselves, is a manifest violation of the most sacred rights of mankind.”"
5,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,4,"“Indeed, the distribution of wealth is too important an issue to be left to economists, sociologists, historians, and philosophers.” ― Thomas Piketty, Capital in the Twenty-First CenturyThis is one of those scholarly books that seem to end up being accidental cultural markers of time and place. I'm pretty sure Piketty wanted his book to be read/discussed/debated, and Belnap/Harvard Press certainly wanted it to be bought. But, I'm pretty sure neither the author nor the publisher was expecting it to do sell like it did (whether it gets read is another matter). My guess is this book will stimulate a lot of debate about the real nature and scope of income and capital inequality AND debate about the proper roll of government in addressing these issues.What I loved about this book was Piketty's voice, his narrative style. The fact he rejected the theoretical speculation favored by a lot of modern economists and instead went with a historical and data-centric narrative, gave this book juice. He wrote an economics book that demands to be read. I loved how he used literature (Balzac and Austen) as reference points for his thesis about the challenges with income and capital disparities between the 1% and the lower 50%. I loved his boldness. I mean really, it takes some scholarly, economic balls to name your book 'Capital'. It is like walking into a Liverpool pub with a Manchester Untied shirt on. Piketty was provocative right from the start. Why didn't I rate this higher? I thought his proscriptive approach (Part IV) was a bit naive. I get what he is trying to do. He is setting the flag at the ideal point and letting the politics take care of itself, but his ideal isn't really even on this planet (not even on Planet France). I'm not sure the governing class in any of the major nations he dealt with will ever be ready for a large-scale capital tax, or a global system of taxing and studying incomes. There just isn't any stomach for that. Perhaps I'm a pessimist, but I think we are already governed by system of economic élite domination. It is more likely that a natural disaster, world war, or years of inflation are way more likely to change the current and growing capital inequality in the US and Europe than any preventative, rational, or progressive tax on wealth. We can barely politically stomach a slight increase to capital gains/dividend tax rates without shutting down government and calls to impeach our president. A one-time, double-digit tax on wealth just won't happen in my lifetime. When 97% of scientists warn us about global warming, but because of vested energy interests and media complicity we find half of our nation believing it is all hype as the poles melt, what hope do we have in preventing millionaires and billionaires from accumulating more wealth? Most will remain ignorant of the problem, apathetic about how that type of income disparity harms democracy, and mostly antagonistic about changing what is perceived to be a meritocracy for a redistributive tax solution. Just not going to happen. I can't see it happening in France, let alone Britain, China or the US.But that is just me venting my frustrations. The future IS the sole property of the future. I might be wrong. For the most part the book is already doing what he wanted. He's got FT writing and challenging his data. He has Paul Krugman giving supporting data. I'm reading his book instead of a Dan Brown novel. So, my bitching aside, his book has already done 10x what it had every practical right to do. It might just end up being the next John Rawls tome, read by economists, politicians and those tired of Dan Brown novels. I sure hope so."

Piketty explains why a tax on capital is so much preferable than taxes on income, the need for global cooperation and why inequality in America will only get worse unless policymakers address higher education affordability, tax policies, especially on inheritance, and minimum wage laws. A brutally long read, yet well worth the effort. "
7,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma,0,"This book is too big and too dense to swallow in one shot - so I am going to review it chapter by chapter. This will not sound actually like a review, but rather like reader's notes, as I try to gather my thoughts.IntroductionThomas Piketty plans to attack the knotty problem of capital - the slippery concept that has avoided the determined efforts of great brains such as Malthus, Marx and Adam Smith to collar it and place it in a compartment where it can be studied and analysed scientifically. More specifically, this is an effort by him to understand the dynamics of income inequality - the most wretched problem affecting humanity ever since it became ""civilised"". It is Piketty's aim to dispassionately study a subject, the debate on which has ""long been based on an abundance of prejudice and a paucity of fact.""The income gap was huge in the pre-industrial society; land was the source, and it was owned by very few people. Theoreticians like Malthus and Ricardo gave gloomy predictions of systemic collapse as the land got dearer and dearer. However, with the industrial revolution, the agrarian economy gave way to the industrial: and the landowners were no longer the lords of all they survived. Upward mobility was no longer hampered by accidents of birth.The industrial society, however, lead to large accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few entrepreneurs, and the income disparity began to skyrocket, setting the stage for the entry of Marx and his theory of the collapse of the capitalist society. It did not happen, as wages began to increase towards the end of the nineteenth century and the two world wars proved to be great levellers.Simon Kuznets in the twentieth century changed the Marxian horror story into a fairy tale, where the income disparity would keep on decreasing until it stabilised at an acceptable level at advanced stages of capitalism. Sadly, that also did not happen, and we are once more in the era of increasing wealth gap.On addressing this vexatious problem, Piketty has based his analysis on the conclusion he has arrived at by the study of his historical sources.1. Be wary of ""economic determinism"". The distribution of wealth has always been deeply political.2. The dynamics of wealth distribution reveal powerful mechanisms pushing alternately toward convergence and divergence.The second point, the author says, is at the heart of the book. While the focus on training and increasing skills of the populace is a force of convergence, nepotism and protectionism which exclude certain groups from acquiring skills and those who survive just by increased returns on capital, are forces of divergence. The author says:This fundamental inequality, which I will write as r > g (where r stands for the average annual rate of return on capital, including profits, dividends, interest, rents, and other income from capital, expressed as a percentage of its total value, and g stands for the rate of growth of the economy, that is, the annual increase in income or output), will play a crucial role in this book. In a sense, it sums up the overall logic of my conclusions. The remaining part of the introduction lays out the structure of the book, and is basically an exposition of how he will evaluate the concepts briefly touched upon in the introduction.Part OneChapter OneThe basic concepts presented in this chapter that of the national income and capital; and how they define the economic structure of a country. National income is defined as the sum of all income available to the residents of a given country in a given year, regardless of the legal classification of that income: it is the Gross Domestic Product (GDP - which is the goods and services generated) minus the depreciation of capital which made this possible. Capital is defined as the sum total of nonhuman assets that can be owned and exchanged on some market. Capital includes all forms of real property (including residential real estate) as well as financial and professional capital (plants, infrastructure, machinery, patents, and so on) used by firms and government agencies. “National wealth” or “national capital” is the total market value of everything owned by the residents and government of a given country at a given point in time, provided that it can be traded on some market. It consists of the sum total of nonfinancial assets (land, dwellings, commercial inventory, other buildings, machinery, infrastructure, patents, and other directly owned professional assets) and financial assets (bank accounts, mutual funds, bonds, stocks, financial investments of all kinds, insurance policies, pension funds, etc.), less the total amount of financial liabilities (debt). To summarise, income is a flow and capital is stock.The author then defines his ""first fundamental law of capitalism"" as:The share of income from capital in national income (α) is capital to income ratio (β) multiplied by the rate of return on capital(r); i. e. α = r × β. That is, if the capital/income ratio is 600% and the rate of return is 5%, then the share of income from capital is 30% (the author says these figures are typical for developed countries). The second fundamental law of capitalism is stated as: the higher the savings rate and the lower the growth rate, the higher the capital / income ratio (β). Thus higher capitalisation leads to inequality (because more income is generated from capital). Inequality is also spread across the globe because the developed countries own more capital across the globe than the undeveloped ones. According to classic economic theory, this excess capital of the rich will lead to investments in poor countries, boosting their productivity and closing the gap. The major flaw in this logic is that the increase in output in the poor countries need not necessarily lead to an increase in income, because of low wages (which is why most of the global manufacturing giants put up their manufacturing units in third-world countries).The only way the poor can catch up with the rich is through the diffusion of knowledge; by the learning of technical know-how, skills and education. This goes for countries as well as people.Chapter Two - Growth: Illusions and RealitiesThe central thesis of this book is precisely that an apparently small gap between the return on capital and the rate of growth can in the long run have powerful and destabilizing effects on the structure and dynamics of social inequality. In a sense, everything follows from the laws of cumulative growth and cumulative returns, and that is why the reader will find it useful at this point to become familiar with these notions. Saying thus, Piketty in this chapter concentrates on what is meant by growth. The two aspects he considers are: demographic growth and economic growth.Demographic growth (or population) was stagnant mostly until 1700, after which it began to rise significantly; the rate peaked at around 2% per year between 1950 and 1970. Since then, it has been declining steadily and is expected to reach less than 0.2% by the end of the century. In pessimistic forecasts, it could even become negative in the developed countries. This has an impact on the structure of capital as a growing country would have to generate than a country in which population is stagnant, because there simply wouldn't be enough inherited wealth to go around. Thus, a growing demographic profile inherently plays an equalising role. There is also the neoliberalist argument that a growing economy inherently reduces inequality by providing upward mobility, but the author says this argument has to be taken with a pinch of salt (he promises to explain it further ahead).When we come to economic growth, the corresponding spurt took place in the Twentieth Century, with substantially higher generation of wealth and considerable increase in the standard of living across all populations. In Europe, the growth peaked in the time immediately following the world wars - In Asia, a few decades afterwards. Surprisingly, neither the European Welfare State Model, nor the neoliberalist model had any specific impact on the growth spurt. Global growth rates are, however, steadily declining and the author expects it to bottom out at 1.5% at the end of this century. Significant changes that occurred in the Twentieth Century is the delinking of currency from the gold standard, and the increased contribution of services to the economy (from 13% in 1800 to 80% in 2012), with a consummate fall in the contribution of agriculture.Part Two - The Dynamics of Capital/ Income RatioChapter Three - The Metamorphoses of CapitalAs the title says, this chapter explores how capital in England and France have shifted from mostly agricultural land to buildings, business capital and financial capital invested in firms. With the collapse of colonialism following the two disastrous wars, the returns from foreign holdings of both Britain and France fell drastically. However, it did not drastically affect the capital structure - the long term change was the transformation from agricultural land to real estate and capital stock. Also, in both these countries, the capital owned by the government is negligible compared to the capital owned by its citizens (1% in Britain and 5% in France): this has not changed over the years. This is a characteristic of all free market economies.This brings us to the subject of public debt. Both the British and French governments borrow from their citizens. In Britain, the public debt rose to huge levels at the end of the Napoleonic wars in the Nineteenth century and at the end of the Second World War, because Britain chose to meet the governmental needs through debts. In contrast, France met this through increased taxes so its debt burden remained relatively the same. According to the author, this helped to enhance the power of private wealth in British economy. Also, the public debt of France was largely controlled after the wars through redistribution via inflation (around 13% per year) while in England, inflation remained relatively low (3% per year) and the debts were paid back more slowly.Also, there is the curious phenomenon in France of ""capitalism without capitalists"". The Great Depression and World War II destroyed the country's faith in moneyed individuals, and many industries and enterprises were nationalised. However, the neoliberalist wave in the 1980's resulted in many of these nationalised assets being privatised again, through the selling of shares - France has returned to capitalism without really understanding why, as the author says. (The same thing happened with India under the Narasimha Rao government in 1991. From then on, each successive government has been outdoing the previous one in aggressive privatisation. This has almost become an obsession with the second stint of the BJP under Modi.)"

Piketty likely underestimated the growth of extreme inequalityhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/w...*feed the poor. eat the rich https://www.theguardian.com/business/...*The introduction includes one of the most gratifying paragraphs ever writtenTo put it bluntly, the discipline of economics has yet to get over its childish passion for mathematics and for purely theoretical and often highly ideological speculation, at the expense of historical research and collaboration with the other social sciences. Economists are all too often preoccupied with petty mathematical problems of interest only to themselves. This obsession with mathematics is an easy way of acquiring the appearance of scientificity without having to answer the far more complex problems of the world we live in. There is one great advantage to being an academic economist in France: here, economists are not highly respected in the academic or intellectual world or by political and financial elites. Hence they must set aside their contempt for other disciplines and their absurd claim to greater scientific legitimacy, despite the fact that they know almost nothing about anything.Neo-classical economics is morally and intellectually repulsive pseudo-science. Economists are not actually experts in anything. *Not perfect but incredibly important. Every thinking person in the 21st century needs to read this book.As I read him, Thomas Piketty's major disadvantage is political. He delineates a radical problem, then offers a liberal solution. A global tax on wealth does indeed make sense - indeed it makes so much sense he can't possibly account for the fact that it doesn't exist already. He refuses to consider such things as class struggle and ideology. *Piketty claims that Marx was too apocalyptic in claiming that inequality could only be ended through revolution (ie, and not a peaceful transition). However, Piketty also acknowledges that in the 20th century wealth inequalities were wiped out only due to world war; from this perspective, it would seem Marx actually wasn't nearly apocalyptic enough in his predictions. The violence of the first and second world war far exceeded anything a Victorian intellectual could have conceived.If war is ultimately what destroyed inequality, can it also be said that inequality contributed to or even caused world war? The implications here are clearly very radical. It's a question Piketty leaves unexplored. He hints that inequality can have disastrous social consequences, but then treats the major man-made conflicts of last century as if they were random accidents."
9,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,5,The central thesis of this book is:An apparently small gap between the return on capital and the rate of growth can in the long run have powerful and destabilizing effects on the structure and dynamics of social inequality.
10,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086104-randal-samstag,4,"Thomas Piketty is a relatively young economist who has spent most of his professional career teaching at the Paris School of Economics and the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales after brief stints at MIT. He has collaborated with fellow École Normale Supérieure graduate Emmanuel Suez on comprehensive studies on income and wealth inequality. A chart of their data is a frequently-used graphic (the one that looks like the Golden Gate Bridge) in Robert Reich's current documentary film, Inequality for All. This figure shows the income of the top 1 percent of income earners as a ratio of the national income from the period from 1910 to 2010. It shows a dramatic peak just prior to the 1929 crash followed by a collapse in the years up to 1980 and then a dramatic rise back up to the same level of approximately 24 percent of national income that the one percent took home in the roaring twenties.In March 2014 the English translation of Piketty's latest book, Capital in the Twenty-first Century, hit the streets in the US. It contains over 600 pages (including notes) of remarkable data and graphics depicting the historic evolution of income and wealth in our world. It has been making quite a splash in the United States, it's English translation coming as it has on the heels of Inequality for All. It has been enthusiastically reviewed by prominent Nobel Prize winning economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman in a recent issue of the New York Review of Books and by another Nobel-winning neoclassical economist, Robert Solow, in the New Republic. Scores of other reviews have come out since it's publication by Harvard Press in March from both right and left. Martin Feldstein, the chairman of Ronald Reagan's Council on Economic Advisers, felt it necessary to attempt to debunk Piketty from the right in a Wall Street Journal column recently. Michael Roberts has been regularly working at debunking Piketty in the pages of his blog from a Marxist perspective. Someone who has raised such praise and ire from both left (Roberts), middle (Krugman and Solow), and right (Feldstein) must be on to something.Piketty's book provides comprehensive documentation of the growing inequality that has the United States and Europe in its grip. But the forgotten element in this that Piketty brings to the discussion (if you have not read Ricardo and Marx) is that extreme inequality, in Europe at least, is not new. The inequality that has now established itself in both Europe and the United States is more like a return to the normal state of extreme concentration of wealth and income that ruled in the nineteenth century. It was only the great capital destruction of the inter-war years (and the threat posed by the success of socialist revolution in Russia - not so much emphasized by Piketty) that reduced inequality in the West in the twentieth century. Since then capital / GDP ratios have been steadily climbing back to the ratios that were common in the Gilded Age. Piketty calls this new reality ""patrimonial capitalism"" in that as economic growth chronically lags behind the rate of return that owners of capital can receive on their wealth, a tiny rentier class eventually emerges over generations that controls significant portions societal wealth and influence. This picture contradicts the story told by free market economists from Hayek to Kuznets to Milton Friedman and Paul Ryan that unregulated markets open doors to everyone to gain wealth. Instead, Piketty shows, the supposed triumph of capitalism in the wake of the fall of the Soviet empire, is more likely trending towards an entrenched structure of societal control by inherited wealth.Piketty's title seems to be modeled after that of the famous book by Karl Marx, but Piketty is no revolutionary, rather a socialist of the contemporary French type which much more resembles the Democratic Party of FDR than any nineteenth century socialist party. Not that he thinks that this enormous inequality is a good thing, far from it, but his solution is rather a (modest) tax on capital than overthrow of the capitalist system. In other writings in the recent past Piketty has also recommended a return to the high top tax rates used in the United States and Europe in the period from the Great Depression prior to the Reagan / Thatcher putsch.Key concepts in the book:1) Kuznets was wrong (Ricardo and Marx were right)2) A return to simple models of the macro economy3) The rise of patrimonial capitalismA more detailed discussion of these topics is on my blog"
11,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8660033-aaron-thibeault,5,"*A full executive summary of this book is available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2014/04/04...The main argument: The unequal distribution of wealth in the developed world has become a significant issue in recent years. Indeed, the data indicate that in the past 30 years the incomes of the wealthiest have surged into the stratosphere (and the higher up in the income hierarchy one is, the greater the increase has been), while the incomes of the large majority have stagnated. This has led to a level of inequality in wealth in the developed world not seen since the eve of the Great Depression. This much is without dispute.Where there is dispute is in trying to explain just why the rise in inequality has taken place (and whether, and to what degree, it will continue in the future); and, even more importantly, whether it is justified. These questions are not merely academic, for the way in which we answer them informs public debate as well as policy measures—and also influences more violent reactions. Indeed, we need look no further than the recent Occupy Movement to see that the issue of increasing inequality is not only pressing, but potentially incendiary.Given the import and the polarizing nature of the issue of inequality, it is all the more crucial that we begin by way of shedding as much light on the situation as possible. This is the impetus behind Thomas Piketty’s new book Capital in the Twenty-First Century.One of Piketty’s main concerns in the book is to put the issue of inequality in its broader historical context. Specifically, the author traces how inequality has evolved from the agrarian societies of the 18th and early 19th centuries; through the Industrial Revolution and up to the First World War; throughout the interwar years; and into the second half of the twentieth century (and up to the first part of the twenty-first).With this broad historical context we are able to see much more clearly the causes of inequality. As we might expect, what we find is that inequality is influenced by a host of societal factors—including economic, political, social and cultural factors. However, what we also find is that inequality is influenced by a broader set of factors associated with how capital works in capitalist societies (and market economies more generally).Specifically, we find that capital (and the wealth it generates) tends to accumulate faster than the rate of economic growth in capitalist societies. What this means is that capital tends to become an increasingly prevalent and influential factor in these societies (at least up to a point). What’s more, wealth not only tends to accumulate, but to become more and more concentrated at the top (mainly because those with more capital are able to earn a higher rate of return on their capital investments). For these reasons, capitalism on its own tends to produce a relatively high degree of inequality.The natural tendency of capital to accumulate and to become ever more concentrated largely explains the high degree of inequality that was witnessed in the developed world in the early part of the twentieth century. This inequality was largely dashed, however, in the interwar years. The reason for this is that the major events of the first half of the twentieth century (including the two world wars, and the Great Depression) thwarted capital’s natural tendency to accumulate, and also destroyed large stocks of wealth. The end result was that by the time World War II was over, inequality in the developed world had reached an all-time low.After the Second World War, the natural tendency of capital to accumulate resumed. However, various political and economic measures (including progressive taxation, rent control, increasing minimum wages, and expanded social programs) worked to redistribute this growing capital, thus preventing inequality from growing as quickly as it would have otherwise.In the 1980s, though, the developed countries did an about-face, and began eliminating many of the measures that had prevented inequality from rising according to its natural tendency. The consequence was that inequality reasserted itself in a major way, such that it is nearly as extreme today as it was on the run up to the Great Depression. Furthermore, the historical evidence indicates that capital will likely continue to accumulate and become ever more concentrated, such that we will witness an even greater level of inequality moving forward.As far as justifying the growing inequality that we are currently seeing, Piketty raises serious doubts as to whether it may rightly be considered fair. What’s more, as inequality continues to grow, it is increasingly likely that large parts of the population will also come to see it as unfair and unjustified—thereby increasing the likelihood of political opposition.For Piketty, the best and fairest solution to these problems would be to steepen the progressive taxation applied to the wealthiest individuals. The problem, though, is that in a world of financial globalization (where there is a high degree of competition for capital—as witnessed by tax havens), it is extremely difficult to apply the appropriate tax scheme without the cooperation and coordinated efforts of the international community—and this is simply not something that is easy to achieve.The alternative, however, is much more troubling for it is likely that it will involve reverting to protectionism and nationalism—and this is really in no one’s interest.This book is an absolute tour-de-force. The broad time-frame that Piketty explores, and the enormous body of data that he brings together, makes this study extremely comprehensive (no one will even think of accusing Piketty of cherry picking the data). Also, the reader is struck by how dispassionately Piketty analyzes the evidence he brings to the table. Indeed, while the author does have a position on inequality, one never receives the impression that this is corrupting his analysis (I consider myself to be a pragmatist politically, and often find that writers on both the left and the right massage the truth, but that was never the case here). Finally, it should be said that the book is very long, and just as dense, with the author often delving into extreme detail, so be prepared for a challenge. A must read for anyone with a serious interest in economics. A full executive summary of the book is available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2014/04/04..."
12,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/715626-joe,4,"I will steal my short version review of this book from the fictional review of a ""Cones of Dunshire"" (Parks and Recreation) review: Punishingly intricate.What makes this book so effective is what makes it such a difficult read: Math. Piketty shows his work by going through all of the statistical, economic, sociological, etc etc etc, data he could get his hands on. He correctly anticipated the criticism he would receive from the right wing and thusly he makes no claims without laying EXTENSIVE foundation for them.That makes the book a bit of a Catch-22. For those that like his conclusions, the massive amount of foundation laid out getting there is unnecessary. Many of the recommendations he has in his introduction and conclusion are remedies that the left has been recommending for years. However, for those that don't like these conclusions, no amount of foundation would be enough. I dare say many of the negative reviews on this sight clearly didn't read the book and seemed to read only the introduction and conclusion. Here is my impression of those reviews: ""How can he possibly make these claims??!!"" To those I say, read the book. It's long and you'll be angry the whole time, but it's the only intellectually honest way to make your argument.This one was a slog at times but in this age of misinformation, I appreciate an author treating me like an adult and for once saying, here's how I got my answer, here are all of my assumptions and why. It seems like a small thing, but as this 685 page monster can attest to...it's not."
13,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,5,"In a world that is increasingly blinded by ideological polarization, where we first decide what we believe we should believe in and then try to find facts to justify our cherished ideas, Piketty’s book comes as a surprise and a reminder that there is no substitute of good scholarship. The first requirement of honest scholarship is to be suspicious of all past ideas and question every single data source. Piketty does just that. He shows respect towards past economists while critically questioning each of their conclusions. He takes advantage of the longer time perspective that he has, and lays out a compelling array of powerful data. His conclusions that are logically sound and extremely sobering in their scope.When it comes to capital accumulation, wealth disparity, and economic policies, we are as polarized as we could be. Within that environment Piketty has been able to take a few very simple ideas and build a convincing string of factual evidence and impeccable logic to build his argument. He does not have the audacity to believe that economics is a hard science that can dive into complex mathematics and pull out pearls of pure wisdom. He does not believe that economics can really stand apart from all other social sciences and history. The result is a narrative that is convincing, both intellectually and emotionally.I am no economist, and I do not have the training to say anything definitive about his conclusions. I must admit that when I read articles written by his smart critics, criticizing the book, I find their arguments also powerful and almost convincing. Real arguments should only happen between experts, those who spent a lot of time mastering the complexities of the subject, so that the rest of us can listen to both sides and make up our mind. Piketty’s book is powerful enough to unsettle the right. Unfortunately, it has also disturbed the left. The important thing is that the book reignited a debate that was long overdue. "
14,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1280889-drtaxsacto,2,"Ideally a book called Capital in the 21st Century might address two sets of questions which are very current. The first would be “what is likely to happen to capital in the 21st Century?” Two prominent economists (Robert Gordon and Tyler Cowan) have argued that the boom in technological advancement is coming to an end - we’ve “picked all the low hanging fruit” (in Cowan’s words). They both argue that those developments are a problem. The second question is even tougher. In all developed societies the last couple of decades (depending on how you count and when you begin) have witnessed a gradual increase in inequality in both incomes and wealth. Those trends have happened almost in spite of which policies a country chooses to adopt Inequality has grown in the last seven years in the US, even though the Administration is committed to reducing it.Another possible set of questions might address some issues about capital formation when much of what we are creating is tiny - in health and technology. Does our understanding of what constitutes capital and how to develop it change when things are digitized and done on the nano level? I think we probably need to do some thinking about that. But again Piketty fails to consider these questions and instead concentrates on the increasing inequality of income and wealth. Like many other Malthusians he uses linear logic elegantly. A lot of what he offers as logical chains is, at best, tautological.Let me offer ten questions about the book. #1 - Why I didn’t I read this when it came out? I thought that Capital in the 21st Century is likely to become something akin to two other economics standards (The Wealth of Nations /Theory of Moral Sentiments and Das Kapital). Both are distinguished as being the most quoted and least read books in the field. While I think most of Kapital is bunk, it has had a significant influence on the field. These kinds of books enter into discussions but often with distortions from the original that are significant. I wanted to wait until the noise lessened.#2 - Does an Economic Model Influence any Economist’s Perspective? Right after James Buchanan won the Nobel in Economics, he gave a lecture at the University of San Diego. In it, he described two ways to begin the study of Economics. The first is to imagine supply and demand curves. If the is X supply of a good then at some level of demand the suppliers and consumers will produce an optimal quantity to satisfy both. That simple model can be expanded to all sorts of complexity. But there is an alternative way to begin the study. Assume that you produce apples and I produce oranges. And that I am the better farmer for either crop. If I concentrate on the product I produce best (oranges), we will both be better off. In the first model one soon gets into the idea of scarcity - if you Google the word “economics” you soon encounter the term “scarcity.” As Buchanan argued that night, relying on scarcity instead of beginning with the idea of the benefits from trade drives you in much different directions. Most of life is better seen in a cooperative light rather than a zero-sum game. Scarcity, and indeed most of Piketty’s analysis is based on an operating assumption on the left which from my view it is not helpful to understanding complex problems because you ultimately spend more time on allocation issues rather than figuring out how to make everyone better off.Piketty is a logical successor to Thomas Malthus - whose Treatise had such an influence on much of economic thinking but began with flawed data and linear assumptions. Malthus, whose work was designed to influence Parliament’s debates on the poor laws projected the most horrible consequences to humanity because he thought food supply would be eclipsed by population growth. But his careful logic was linear and failed to project for things like the steel plow. All of a sudden a few years after his book came out the plow began to produce almost geometric increases in the food supply because it tilled the soil more effectively.Right before he goes into his policy proposals, he has a section on sovereign wealth funds and argues that if oil gets to $200 per barrel that the oil exporting countries could soon control a lot of the world’s capital. And if that does not happen (woe is me!) some of the other funds like China’s will control because of how much stuff they will accumulate. It is hard not to laugh out loud about these kinds of projections. I suspect he thinks the projections reinforce his policy proposals. They don’t.#3 - Is Piketty Uriah Heap? Piketty should be given some points for effort. This is a complex book with a lot of theory;it is nothing, if not comprehensive in its view. But it relies on a series of very shaky assumptions. The most important is his assumption about a term called “purchasing power parity” (he believes you can make reliable comparisons between times and across borders) but as Diane Coyle points out in her excellent short book on GDP “the large margin of uncertainty around this information should never be forgotten.” Unfortunately, Piketty concedes the problem and then uses the data to prove his points. He fits into the character of Uriah quite neatly. Even more annoying is his tendency to make historical comparisons which are based on the novels of Balzac, Austin, and Henry James - as if their writing involved a careful analysis of the structure of the economy at the time. #4 - Should he dismiss the Kuznets Curve so quickly? He credits Simon Kuznets for his excellent work on the development of national income data. He should. As the father of National Income Accounts one of Kuznets’ key contributions was also something called the Kuznets Curve which postulates that as the economy goes through technological development cycles economic inequality first increases, then decreases. A good example of the phenomenon started at the beginning of the industrial age (after the Civil War in the US). Large fortunes came to those who developed new technologies - the early payoffs were huge. But as the cycle progressed, income disparities began to be reduced. Some economists argue that the apparent increased concentration of wealth in many societies during the current period is partially as a result of that same kinds of trends. Early winners in technology got huge compensation. But the current inequality is not just from technology payoffs to entrepreneurs. This period is also influenced by larger compensation to stars (movies, music, sports). We also began to pay lawyers and doctors and bankers more than we did in earlier times. But the question is whether all of these higher wages will be sustained or diffused as the cycle continues. Because it has happened over the last several years (or even decades) does not mean it will continue forever. The salaries of young law associates and investment bankers have begun to plateau - if that continues those professions will attract fewer of the best and brightest. Piketty sees the world as an economist who ultimately believes we live in a zero sum world. There is plenty of evidence that assumption is false.#5 - Does he offer anything useful or reliable about the long term trends on income/wealth? The author certainly sees the world in terms of good and evil. The mix of the super-compensated has changed over time, and will change more.In California many of the very rich have two characteristics. First, they are relatively young and second they (or their kids) may or may not be in the top brackets in the future. The payoffs to technological innovators have been huge. As the Kuznets curve suggests - over time those initial payoffs disburse into the broader society. Piketty makes some speculations about what might happen as the people who were highly compensated age; but none of his scenarios are convincing unless you believe there is no economic turbulence. There is also the discussion of the Modigliani Triangle - which was used to torture Economics students and postulates a life cycle theory of investing - in essence we accumulate dough when we are young when we can so we can live through retirement. I am not a fan of how Piketty explains this elegant piece of theory but the book does present some very interesting data on how estates developed and were distributed over time. (again qualified with the complexity of doing inter-temporal comparisons) If the population is aging and wealth is accumulating - the natural transitions between generations may be disrupted. I don’t think I agree with Piketty’s conclusions but his data made me think about what might be happening.One of the odd things later in the book is the author’s lack of understanding of investment returns and the returns of hard work. He argues that it is impossible to be sure what percentage of large fortunes came from effort, theft or simply good luck (being born with the right parents). Sure that is true, but so what? Was the payoff to Bill Gates for his efforts on developing an operating system and other technology innovations justified? I honestly don’t know. Piketty wants to make those allocation decisions more “democratic” by which I think he means more political. From my view, moving those kinds of decisions into the political realm would be a disaster.Piketty argues that it is appropriate to force individuals to disclose the amount of their wealth as somehow being more democratic? I will come back to that issue in the final question, For now, just why is it a good idea to force public disclosure of income and wealth? Many of his arguments - about the long term structure of capital, about the relative distribution of wealth in a country or across borders are based on two very faulty assumptions. First, as he admits, his data is uncertain. But second, they are based on linear assumptions. Consider an argument made in the late 1970s - if the Japanese economy continues to invest in US assets, by XXXX they will own the entire US economy. That did not happen because of the dynamic effects of innovation. Configural logic is a lot harder to work with - but as we found in the Japanese example - it is often better in hindsight. When the Japanese economy began to implode and the Nikkei, which had been at 36,000, began to fall - we were able to buy back all of those assets they bought for pennies on the dollar. When writers were expressing opinions about the “Japanese way of managing” Americans were working on technological changes which began to make the organizational structure and technological structure of Japan out of date. All the smart money was on companies like Sony (Current Capitalization of $27 billion and change) not on ones like Apple (Current capitalization of $565 billion - or a cap value of almost 20X). He could have benefitted from reading Schumpeter on creative destruction.#6 Has he bothered to think about the implications of tax theory? He also seems to not understand the differences between rates and share in tax systems. Even though tax rates were considerably higher in the nineteen fifties, the percentage of GDP paid to taxes has remained about the same and the distribution of burdens has changed toward more progressivity. There is plenty of evidence from the 1986 Tax Reform Act that, at least in the US, as rates were reduced and the base broadened, the highest income taxpayers paid an increasing share of the total tax bill. (The Tax Foundation estimates that at this point the top 1% gain about 19% of total income and pay just under 40% of the income taxes in the US.) So what is a better way to do a tax system - with confiscatory rates and lots of complexity or with low rates and little complexity. He seems to think that higher rates do not induce complexity - the evidence, at least from the US, is to the contrary.In one chapter he makes the absurd assertion that a change from 0-30% on taxes on capital the main effect will be reducing inequality. Take that logic to its extreme and tax all capital at 100% and see how much we improve inequality and, for that matter, capital formation.A fundamental concept in tax theory is called the substitution effect. If you tax something, at some point, people will substitute something else for the taxed thing. Thus, if you tax root beer at 10%, and not Dr. Pepper - one would expect more people to buy Dr. Pepper. Piketty in all of his argument for a progressive tax on capital never seems to think that the highest income taxpayers would begin substituting capital preferences. Again, the evidence in the US example is against him.Complexity, which is mostly an unseen cost in the tax system - decreased through 1986 and then began to increase where we now have moderate rates and labyrinthian rules. The evidence from the Economic Recovery Tax Act (1981) and the Tax Reform Act (1986) is that the simplification of of capital structures and the lowering of capital rates offered some huge incentives to the fuel technological boom we experienced over the last couple of decades (which Gordon and Cowan now say is now nearing its end).#7 - What is the right GINI? Piketty explains the implications of relying on the GINI coefficient as an indicator of how well we are doing in promoting an equitable society. I agree with him here - GINI is a crude measure. But I think his definition of equity and mine are quite different. If you can’t hit homers then you think the distribution of income among baseball players is unfair. I do not know what the right distribution of wealth or income should be, except in very general terms. #8 - If the percentage of consumption/wealth in the world continues away from the US, is that a bad thing? He spends some time on the diffusion of spending in the world. The US is “slipping” from a predominate force in the world for consumption. More people from poorer (or formerly poorer nations) are able to get all sorts of new consumer goods. The question I always have for someone who thinks this may be bad is “are we worse off with more consumers in the world?” The answer is no. Most zero sum analysis is just plain silly. We should applaud increases in consumption in places which had little. And we should not be worried if our share of the total diminishes - so long as the pie gets bigger. He says the pie cannot expand forever and that is true. But we do not know the limits of pie expansion.#9 Should we watch out for secondary effects? Piketty makes a series of proposals to reduce inequalities which he never ultimately defines. Many of his ideas may a) not solve the problem in the direction he supports (and which most of the American people would oppose) and b) may also create externalities in other areas. A clear example, which PIketty would probably not support (based on a gratuitous comment he makes later in the book on public pensions) is what effects a program like social security has on wealth. A number of countries, including Chile, have privatized their retirement systems. Workers in Chile are required to pay into a retirement account with a limited number of options but the government role in the system is to set the rules. What would the effect on capital be if other countries did the same? In the US we are forced to contribute to a system which does not accumulate wealth although it does have a modest positive effect on incomes of retired persons (which might be even larger if we were to adopt a Chilean system). So what would be the effect on Capital in the 21st Century if we were to begin to change from the US system to the Chilean one? (He contrasts the two systems as PAY-GO versus CAPITALIZED pensions.) #10 Was the last section written first? A quarter of the book is dedicated to proposing things to solve the scourges he sees in the first three sections. At the outset of the last section, Piketty shows his cards. He wants more of everything provided by government - he keeps referring to the “social” state. And he argues that collective action is not possible without taxation. That is simply not true. Piketty conflates two issues which should always be separated. First, how much of a good do we want to provide for society? And second, what is the most efficient way to provide it? There is a good body of literature on the inefficiencies of governmental provision. Piketty seems to have missed that. Government does not always have to be the provider. One could use his discussion of pensions to prove the point. He argues that one reason for keeping the current system of “pay as you go pensions” is that the long term risks associated with investments cannot be borne by most workers. Yet he does not seem to concede that the demographics in most developed countries are against sound funding for these programs. Has he ever bothered to look at the capitalized pension systems that have been adopted around the world which simultaneously increase a country’s stock of capital, assure higher benefits and in the end assure a greater chance that savings in a country will be less concentrated at the highest income levels? In the first instance, present in many of the “developed” countries of the world - government is the provider; in the alternative or “capitalized” model, government sets the rules for the system to work and mandates how much citizens must save out of their wages. The pay-go system in almost all instances is lurching toward insolvency. His tax discussion, ultimately pushing for a worldwide progressive tax on capital, which even he admits is utopian is a mishmash of jargon and speculation. For example, he argues that the growth in executive salaries in the US began to grow with the Reagan tax cuts of 1981 and 1986. He never seems to make a distinction between contingent and salary payments. A good part of the compensation of what he calls super managers is contingent. The fault in at least some of those systems may be the point of analysis not the incentives. But he never gets to those questions.GOODREADS TRUNCATED MY REVIEW OF THIS VERY COMPLEX BOOK - SEE THE REST OF MY REVIEW IN THE FACEBOOK POST....."
15,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2704424-nick-klagge,4,"I finished this several weeks ago now, but with all of the reviews in the media, I keep putting off writing my own because I feel like it needs to be really good! I am going to avoid doing a comprehensive review, since you can read many of those on the internet. Instead, here are some of my idiosyncratic observations on the book:-First, I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the subject matter. Yes, it is long, but Piketty's writing (jointly, Goldhammer's translation) is extremely clear and very much appropriate for the non-specialist. There are only a few equations in the whole thing, and all of them are quite straightforward (3 terms at most, all in some kind of standard algebraic relationship). If you are interested but have been feeling daunted, don't!-My biggest personal takeaway from the book was how much the economic patterns of the 20th century appear to be a historical anomaly. Nearly every graph in the book shows a fairly steady state over the course of the nineteenth century, a huge downward shock in the twentieth century (due to the Great Depression and the World Wars), followed by a near-complete recovery to the steady state. It is largely thanks to Piketty's work that we can observe the 20th century in this historical context. The most significant ""interrupted pattern"" of the 20th century was the dominance of inherited capital over labor income. Before the twentieth century, there was so much accumulated capital in Europe that a striver would have no chance of reaching the upper echelons of economic resources just by getting an education and working hard (as Piketty illustrates by examples given in Balzac). In the twentieth century, there was such wholesale destruction of capital by the depression and the world wars that this ceased to be true, and a decent job and hard work could land you near the top. As capital has recovered over the second half of the 20th century, however, this is decreasingly the case. At any rate, Piketty's interesting global observation is that much of modern economic theory and empirical work has been based on observation of time series collected during an anomalous historical period, and thus it may have limited ""external validity."" We should try to make some kind of rough mental correction for this fact when looking at statistics such as, for example, the average annual return of the stock market. What is the ""average number of wars per century""?-Another finding that jumped out at me was Piketty's claim that the data clearly contradict Modigliani's life-cycle savings hypothesis. Briefly, M's hypothesis is that saving behavior is generally motivated by intent to spend down savings during retirement, so that the lifetime pattern of wealth would look like a triangle--rising from zero during a working career, peaking at retirement, then falling back to zero at death. (As a side note, Nick Rowe has perceptively argued that the phenomenon of ""retirement"" itself presents a puzzle for economic theory: http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwh...) What Piketty shows is that the lifetime pattern of wealth does not resemble this kind of triangle; rather, wealth tends to increase monotonically over the life cycle. (This type of behavior can be consistent with bequest motives, but Piketty says it also holds for those with no identifiable heirs.) In line with what I was discussing above, Piketty points out that M's hypothesis was likely consistent with the data in the immediate postwar period when M was writing, with very little role for inherited capital, but not in general. I think this is an important point, because for most upper-middle class people, M's hypothesis is consistent with their intuitive understanding of capital, because it is consistent with their own lived experience of wealth accumulation. But the fact is that the aggregate amount of capital held by the 99% is relatively insignificant, and the dynamics of capital above the level of the upper middle class change dramatically.-Piketty discusses the question: do larger fortunes earn better returns? As a small-time investor, believer in index funds, hedge-fund skeptic, etc., I am interested in the answer to this question. Do the rich really have access to ""better opportunities"" than the rest of us? (David Swensen, the investment manager for Yale's endowment, believes that the answer is affirmative--he set out to write a book about how individuals could use Yale's investing strategies, but concluded that they cannot.) Unfortunately, it is one of the areas where Piketty (avowedly) has the least data to bring to bear. The main data source he looks at for this question are the annual returns on university endowments. He sorts endowments by size and documents the pattern of returns by size category. In general, Piketty's answer to the question is affirmative, with larger endowments showing better returns. I was able to look at the underlying Excel files he has posted to his website (thanks!) and my general conclusion is that this phenomenon is probably mainly due to larger endowments being able to take more equity (or equity-like) exposure. Smaller endowments need to be somewhat more defensive, so they have higher percentages of lower-returning fixed-income assets. Historical returns are more or less consistent with near-100% equity exposures for larger endowments, and lower exposures for smaller ones. However, the main anomaly I observed, and don't have a good explanation for, is that endowments by and large seemed to avoid significant losses in the tech bubble burst (though they later had significant losses in the subprime crisis). With some casual Googling, I have not been able to find documentation of why and how university endowments were able to avoid that particular collapse--sectoral position limits maybe?Many reviewers have presented critiques of Piketty's arguments, and I think at least some of them have some validity. However, I don't think that any of them invalidate the broad arguments he puts forth. Which is all very sobering, especially since his policy prescription of a global wealth tax is (again, avowedly) quite unrealistic politically."

17,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11859986-the-american-conservative,0,"""We are now in the realm of speculation, however, and that is a world in which Piketty, notwithstanding his headline-grabbing predictions, is uncomfortable. That is the novel strength of Capital in the Twenty-First Century. Although his book is theoretically thin and concludes with a political program that is simultaneously overfamiliar and quite unlikely to be enacted, Piketty has done an enormous service simply by compiling the amount of data that he has about how the predominance of wealth has varied over time in different countries and by laying down a marker for how economists should properly investigate the world. ... Thomas Piketty is to be commended for putting the question of distribution at the center of discussion about our economic future, rather than, as is more common in the dominant neoliberal framework, treating it as important only inasmuch as it bears on questions of mobility and growth. He is to be commended as well for demanding a humbler empiricism from the community of economists. But if we are to proceed from analysis to action, we still need a more robust theory of what is actually causing the problem that we observe. And while there is a certain French elegance to single, universal solutions, it may be that a diversity of attacks, tailored to the economic situations of different countries and regions, is not only more plausible than a new, global tax regime but more optimal as well.""Read the full review here: http://www.theamericanconservative.co..."
18,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7414070-alexander,5,"Piketty will be picked apart in the months and years ahead, and his unprecedented depth of research will be turned against him where the holes in available documents exist. But he intended that criticism. The point of the book is to reshape the conversation, and that he has thoroughly achieved by forcing economists, politicians and the public to face the reality of income inequality and inherited wealth worldwide. Arthur Goldhammer deserves considerable credit for his English translation. The book may be more elegant in French, but you wouldn't know from the translation's clear, compelling language. Six hundred pages is a lot - and not for everyone, even those interested in the book's central arguments - but six hundred pages of arcane economics and history are rendered remarkably readable, itself an achievement as grand as its thesis. "
19,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/442654-andrew,0,"The majority of economics that Americans are going to encounter is fairly limited-- the names Krugman, Friedman, Smith emerge, but to what extent do we know of their actual theoretical bases. Or their underlying assumptions about the economic endeavor?Enter Thomas Piketty, who has somehow entranced American intellectual life-- not something that most authors of 600-page, data-driven treatises can do. In its practice, it's excellent social science, in that it Piketty is empirical, sober-minded, is sure to point out his lines of reasoning and root assumptions, and is willing to be ecumenical in his ideas, freely incorporating history, political science, and sociology as he sketches his (devastating) argument against the neoliberal orthodoxy.Much is made of the fact that his conclusions and prescriptions are almost hopelessly, naively impossible. That doesn't make them any less important as suggestions-- he's not a policymaker, after all-- and they form a relatively small part of the book.My only serious problems were similar to those raised by David Harvey in his review (and whose Brief History of Neoliberalism would be an excellent companion read)-- namely, that a few critical or at the very least quite helpful lenses and analytical methods, were conspicuously absent."
20,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26552534-greg-brozeit,4,"Reading this book is quite a chore for layperson not well versed in economic theory. But I think Piketty gets it right in presenting his arguments. One just has to be patient and persistent in order to reap the rewards of the message he is trying to convey. His conclusion also underscores why the first three parts of his book are so important. Globally we must work to create reliable, honest sources of data so that policy makers and citizens can accurately judge and make decisions about complex issues based on empirical information and not ideology or misinformation that is designed to benefit the few at the expense of the many. Ultimately his plea is in support of democracy, egalitarianism and equal opportunity.Those familiar with macroeconomic theory can, if they want, peruse or skip most of the first three parts and go directly to hundred or so pages of Piketty’s views on regulation of capital in the 21st century and the conclusion. These are the most readable parts. But it’s worth putting in the effort to better understand those arguments.The introduction is an overview of basic economic theory that puts the concept of capital at middle of the discussion. Part one introduces useful—and new to me—concepts of how to think about and categorize capital, mostly in Western Europe and the United States since the best records exist in those places. The notion that capital will always grow at a faster rate than income, the categorizations of wealth in deciles and centiles to better understand the nature of wealth, using national incomes and years of national incomes to compare the actual relative size of capital and the role that the social and economic catastrophes that occurred between 1914-1945 are all key to understand context of what is to come later in the text.Part two focuses on the relationship between capital, labor and income. Again, I believe the detail of the argument is intended to provide non-economists with a context to better understand part four. Part three , without being too flippant, takes about 240 pages to provide context to a lesson imparted by the character Vautrin in Balzac’s novel, Père Goriot, in which he explains to Rastignac that he should marry into wealth if he wants to be truly wealthy, work alone, no matter how successful, will not lead to the riches he desires. Piketty uses the next six chapters to drive home that argument quite successfully. As a non-economist, I also appreciated Piketty’s forays into the literature of Jane Austen to illustrate his points.In part four, Piketty considers some of the basic needs to provide for functioning “social state for the twenty-first century” and how capital might be treated to make a fairer, more prosperous state as well as one that can be productively proactive to address expected and unexpected social, political and economic issues. The fact that “The pragmatic policies adopted after the crisis of 2008 no doubt avoided the worst, but they did really provide a durable response to the structural problems that made the crisis possible, including the crying lack of financial transparency and the rise of inequality” should serve as an important cautionary tale for the future.Piketty’s recommendations—and this summary does not do them justice—include stronger policies to enact and implement progressive taxes on income and capital. He also strongly urges a global tax on capital, which is not some pseudo-Marxist panacea. Instead, he argues that such a tax would necessarily force governments to come up with relatively simple criteria to measure and compare wealth, capital and income—something that does not exist now. Additionally, Piketty addresses public debt: its misinterpretations, the role that inflation can play in lowering it and how debt functions to transfer wealth from the poor to the wealthy.As cogent and constructive as his arguments are and deserved to be debated, I fear that Picketty's views, like those of, for example, Joseph Stiglitz, will be ignored by policy makers. As we have seen with the timidity of the Obama administration's financial policies and the prevailing austerity policies being pushed in Europe, it will take a tidal wave of informed public opinion—something in very short supply today—to give these ideas a fair chance of being heard."
21,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8777275-grzegorz-chrupa-a,5,"The idea in Capital in the Twenty-First Century is that in most circumstances the return on capital is larger than the growth rate of the economy. This in turn means that wealth generates wealth faster than labor does, so the resources of a society become concentrated in large fortunes passed from generation to generation.This dynamic can be interrupted by major shocks such as hyperinflation and war, as happened in the first part of the twentieth century. More recently, however, the developed world has returned to the regime of low growth--high return on capital, and consequently in some ways the distribution of wealth at the beginning of 21st century approaches the extremes that were prevalent in France and Britain at the end of nineteenth century. To remedy this Piketty suggests a global (or at least continental-level) progressive tax on wealth.Piketty uses a variety of data in some cases going back all the way to eighteenth century to support his findings. The writing is very approachable for someone with no training in economics. He illustrates the realities of capital in the nineteenth century with examples taken from the novels of Balzac and Austen. He translates the somewhat unfamiliar and abstract concepts into real-world scenarios with actual realistic euro amounts. You can thus situate your own wealth and your own income against the wealth and income distributions of past and present societies.For a lay reader such as myself the findings seem solid, and the proposed remedies reasonable. I learned a lot from this book: highly recommended."
22,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8930751-arkha-os-rk,4,"I wouldn't want to hazard a guess at how many millions of words have been written about Picketty's Capital. Nor would I want to guess at how many copies will sit unread, right there on the shelf between Marx's Das Capital (vol I) and Joyce's Finnigan's Wake. GR doesn't need another in depth review. Basically, the book was written for the relatively educated reader who is ready to plow through 700 pages of dense, but clear, writing. The author wants to get his message to a wide audience and wrote with that purpose in mind. For me, the challenge was keeping everything he wanted to teach me in the first 4 chapters in mind throughout the book. The purpose is clear. Inequality in income and wealth is built into the system. That inequality naturally grows to the point where it creates social instability. That instability threatens everyone. Picketty's suggestion to resolve this is basically to tax wealth, not income. Picketty agrees with all of his critics that bringing this about will not be easy. Being an eternal pessimist, my inclination would be to say impossible. But then, if we were back in 1950, I would say that the creation of a globalized American economic system was impossible too. Who knows?Picketty's book has started a conversation. Let's see where it ends. Unlike many economists intent upon changing our worldview in the past, Picketty offers us no grandiose system: just an analysis, with whatever faults, and a suggestion "
23,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/679134-bryan-alexander,4,"This book has extraordinary presence on the American scene today. Reviewing it is tricky, since there are so many competitors, along with so much bad discussion. Here, I won't summarize the tome, since others have already done so (Doug Henwood does the best job I've seen). Instead I'd like to note some key elements of content and style, which might be useful for other current or would-be readers.(I already did this from a half-way point, so this post is really a revision taking into account the whole book.) I think the book's main impact is to drive public discussion about economics to pay more attention to capital, and not just to income. I'm not sure if this will take hold in American conversations for various reasons, starting with the stark horror of our tv ""news"", but such is the book's central charge.Piketty's style is fascinating, and helps enliven what could otherwise be a dry study of statistics. He writes with humor, mocking his own profession:[E]conomists like simple stories, even when they are only approximately correct (218)[T]he discipline of economics has yet to get over its childish passion for mathematics and for purely theoretical and often highly ideological speculation (32)...particularly when one belongs to the upper centiles of the [wealth] distribution and tends to forget it, as is often the case with economists (267)When we say that a distribution of wealth is a Pareto distribution, we have not really said anything at all. (368)For far too long economists have sought to define themselves in terms of the supposedly scientific methods. In fact, those methods rely on an immoderate use of mathemetical models, which are frequently no more than an excuse for occupying the terrain and masking the vacuity of the content. (574)The prose is occasionally elegant, ambitious, and even poetic:Capital is never quiet: it is always risk-oriented and entrepreneurial, at least at its inception, yet it is always tends to transform itself into rents as it accumulates in large enough amounts - that is its vocation, its logical destination (115-6)Thoughout most of human history, the inescapable fact is that the rate of return on capital was always at least 10 to 20 times greater than the rate of growth of output (and income). Indeed, this fact is to a large extent the very foundation of society itself (353)[In the 1970s] [f]or the first time in history... wealth accumulated in the lifetime of the living constituted the majority of all wealth (402)Private wealth rests on public poverty (567)Once constituted, capital reproduces itself faster than output increases. The past devours the future. (571)Yet for all of its ambitious Piketty frequently undercuts himself, qualifying and hedging his arguments. Even his ultimate call for a global, progressive tax on capital appears as utopian, in his own words.At times the book is mordant: ""The top 10% [of a future America] could therefore use a small portion of their incomes to hire many of the bottom 50% as domestic servants"" (257) OrIt may be excessive to accuse senior executives of having their ""hands in the till"", but the metaphor is probably more apt than Adam Smith's metaphor of the market's ""invisible hand"" (332).In the United States the Supreme Court blocked several attempts to levy a federal income tax in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and then blocked minimum wage legislation in the 1930s, while finding that slavery and, later, racial discrimination were perfectly compatible with basic Constitutional rights (653 n49)Key terms resonate, like patrimonial capitalism (173), society of rentiers (264), or inheritance society (351). George Lakoff should be impressed. I'm not sure if rentier (defined 422) will enter English.Capital is also meticulously organized, offering frequent organizational statements to locate the reader within its argument and materials. Its introduction neatly lays out the book's argument.One way the book makes itself more accessible to those unaccustomed to living within data is its use of literary examples. Capital repeatedly turns to Balzac and Austen novels for examples of capital-driven life. It also dives into pop culture, most entertainingly through Disney's The Aristocrats (365-6).The key image of the book is a U-shaped curve (starting on 23). It occurs through chart after chart, showing different aspects of the same story: economic inequality being high before WWI, dropping for the middle of the 20th century, then rising up after 1980. That curve is a kind of multimedia aid, heuristically helping readers through mountains of data. Re: data, Piketty stashes much of the book's research online. That's a very useful way to combine digital with analog scholarship. We should expect more of this in academic publishing.There's an interesting politics to the book so far. Piketty clearly finds gross inequality abhorrent, and wants to address it. Its first words are a quote from the 1789 French revolutionary Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen. The first chapter starts with an account of an armed battle between miners and management (39). And yet Piketty constantly distances himself from leftist thought and, with respect, Marx (8, 10) (""Marxist economists liked to show that capital's share was always increasing... even if believing this sometimes required twisting the data"" (219)) (""I was vaccinated for life against the conventional but lazy rhetoric of anticapitalism... much of which turned its back on the intellectual means necessary to push beyond [Communism]"", 31). He smacks down the liberal Gini coefficient (243) (""it is impossible to summarize a multidimensional reality with a uni-dimensional index without unduly simplifying matters and mixing up things that should not be treated together"", 266) (""statistical indices such as the Gini coefficient give an abstract and sterile view of inequality"", 267). This nontraditional politics appears in the book's final statements:The bipolar confrontations of the period 1917-1989 are now clearly behind us. The clash of communism and capitalism sterilized rather than stimulated research on capital and inequality by historians, economists, and even philosophers. It is long since time to move beyond these old controversies... (576) This isn't simply a left, liberal, or Marxist book, as some have charged. Perhaps it's a claim for a new politics based on data, an ideology for the world of 538.com.One aspect of Piketty's politics that goes against today's grain is its stance towards technology. He sees tech as powerfully shaping capital's powers (212-213), but also as deeply unpredictable. He dismisses those who see technology as democratic, arguing that new inventions can empower capital as easily as those lacking capital (233-4). He also sees tech as ultimately *not* driving inequality. The evidence for this last point is found in a brace of countries each experiencing similar rates of technological transformation, yet also seeing wildly different levels of economic distribution (321).One piece of the book's argument which hasn't won much attention is its emphasis on demographics. For all of Piketty's emphasis on two formulas about economic distribution, changes in the number of people in a nation matter deeply. ""[A] stagnant or, worse, decreasing population increases the influence of capital accumulated in previous generations"" (84) Demographic growth keeps American inequality from soaring to even higher levels (154). ""[T]he return to a historica regime of low growth, and in particular zero or even negative demographic growth, leads logically to the return of capital"" (233; emphasis mine)Predicting the future: Piketty hedges on this with every opportunity, despite the book's putative ambitions. He qualifies his extrapolations, offering multiple options at each point.[B]y 2100 the entire planet could look like Europe at the turn of the twentieth century, at last in terms of capital intensity. Obviously, this is just one possibility among others. (196)The history of the past two centuries makes it highly unlikely that per capita output in the advanced countries will grow at a rate above 1.5% per year, but I am unable to predict whether the actual rate will be 0.5%, 1%, or 1.5% (95)If the twenty-first century turns out to be a time of low (demographic and economic) growth and high return on capital (in a context of heightened international competition for capital resources), or at any rate in countries where these conditions hold true, inheritence will therefore probably again be as important as it was in the nineteenth century. (378)Who are the 1%? Piketty is clear that this is mostly C-suite executives, or ""supermanagers"", especially in Britain and the United States. Athletic or cultural superstars barely count for 1/20th of that group, and financiers only 20%. (302-303)Overall, Capital is very convincing. Piketty's meticulous attention to data, steady re-examination of his own argument, and engagement with alternative models are, together, persuasive.There are flaws and unfortunate limitations.First, the book largely focuses on three countries: France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Early on Piketty admits this is a problem, largely driven by the fact that these nations have the best data for his purposes. But this should give the reader pause when he draws global conclusions. ""In the long run, unequal wealth within nations is surely more worrisome than unequal wealth between nations"" (432) ""[I]t is by no means certain that inequalities of wealth are actually increasing at the global level"" (438) Second, while being very well organized, the books tends towards repetition. This has some good pedagogical effects, especially as policies, datapoints, and concepts pile up, but eventually the repetitions are too much."

Your feelings on this issue probably say a lot about what you feel about the economy, wealth inequality, and the merits of free markets in general. Top executives receiving huge salary packages for doing what seems like a pretty cushy job instinctively feels unjust to many - but then, no-one is forcing companies to pay such high salaries, so where exactly is the issue? This sort of highlights the tension between social justice and neoliberalism ongoing in political debates. This book is, on the one hand, a rigorous academic tome, with what is for non-economists a daunting amount of equations and terms of art. Yet it is also in a sense a work of economic history (with a smattering of references to Austen and Balzac, and the film Titanic), dating back to the political economy tradition of the nineteenth century, when the young field was (or aspired to be) more about polemic and ideology than quantitative models. That tradition also includes Marx, who Piketty seeks to emulate, though he dispenses with the former's Hegelian Grand Theories of History.Fundamentally, Piketty's platform much more resembles that of a far less divisive figure: Henry George, whose  Progress and Poverty was one of the revolutionary works of economics of the late nineteenth century. George saw the greatest source of economic injustice as the collection of rent by land-owners, whose wealth rises without any investment, simply as land becomes more useful. He proposed a land-value tax, to soak these profiteers (who comprised the bulk of the upper class of his time) and provide a basic income for all.Piketty, more cautiously, seeks to apply the same principle to all capital, be it securities, trust funds or houses in the Hamptons. Following Marx, he claims that the fundamental equation of capitalism is r > g; that is, the growth of capital exceeds that of the economy as a whole, and thus the growth of income from labour. In a sweeping look at financial records from the developed world over several centuries, he shows that - although at many times this has not obtained, due to exogenous shocks (world wars, say) or periods of rapid growth (France's Trente Glorieuses) - in periods of regular growth, capital will tend to aggregate more quickly than the rest of the economy; particularly when the wealthy are able to hire investment whizzes who can beat the market, while ""the average man receives investing advice from his brother-in-law"".Without a change in course, a new Gilded Age such as ours might continue to produce skewed outcomes, leading to increased social unrest and ultimately the system burning itself out (if capital's share of growth continues to increase, some point must be reached at which there is nothing left, and the only choices are imperialism or collapse). Piketty thus proposes a global wealth tax, which would prevent the incentives for capital flight to offshore tax havens (the reason that so many corporations are headquartered in Delaware or Dublin is not because of their love of Guinness and Riverdance).What's most notable about Piketty is how radical he isn't: no David Graeber or Harvey, he is a former MIT professor who stands firmly in the French centre, though not the American one. He understands why economists believe so firmly in markets, and his case against them is built firmly on empirical data. Of course, predictions are always inexact, and the next few decades could confound any model we could imagine. But this book is a superbly researched, clear-headed addition to the conversation on inequality, and the questions it raises demand urgent answers. It may soon to be late."
25,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1828815-anthony-buckley,5,"This is a carefully written book on the topic of inequality in the new century. The book's title contains the echo of Karl Marx’s magnum opus which it approaches with critical deference. Like Marx’s book, it does not rise to great heights of polemic. One should not look here for slogans condemning the modern world. Rather, it is a complex book, both sober and scholarly. Until the early twentieth century, he argues, those who had inherited wealth were able to invest it, primarily in land or government securities, and live on the interest and rents they generated. Moreover, because the return from capital was consistently higher than the growth rate in the economy, the incomes of this rentier class tended to grow faster than those who had to work for a living. Nobody in the nineteenth century or earlier could expect to live comfortably by working. Property was a much more satisfactory source of income.Importantly, the processes underlying the growth of capital are slow. They are influenced by political events and policies, but the more significant mechanism is the comparatively small difference, year on year, between the growth of GDP and the rate of interest and rent due to capital. In any one year, this difference is likely to be small. Its importance lies in the fact that it compounds, year after year, so that in the longer run, it enriches the rich and impoverishes everybody else. Over decades, a molehill of a mere one percent difference can grow into a mountain. And so it was until the outbreak of war in 1914, when wealth was concentrated more and more in the hands of fewer and fewer. A major blip in this inexorable march of capital, however, occurred between 1914 and 1945. Two world wars, and the disruption of inflation, social disorder and the Great Depression destroyed much physical capital and dramatically upset the social order on which the growth of capital depended. This major disruption has taken time to be overcome. Because, year by year, the difference between the rate of growth and the return to capital is typically small, it has taken decades for the progressive compounding of this difference to take effect. By the twenty-first century, however, it is plain that wealth-ownership is again insanely concentrated in the hands of the very few, and that the overwhelming majority are deprived of wealth. More than this, it is once again clear that hard work is not the path to a comfortable income. Only by acquiring wealth, largely through inheritance and marriage, can a person be sure of living well. Even those very few who gain wealth by virtue of their skills as entrepreneurs - Gates, Jobs, Branson – or the new super-managers who “earn” eye-watering salaries and bonuses, end up as rentiers, with the bulk of their income due not to their continuing work but to their ownership of capital. For the majority, however, incomes have levelled off or fallen into decline. Children now typically earn less than their parents.Piketty’s solution to this insanity seems to me remarkably tame. He suggests an international form of progressive taxation, not on income but on capital. The difficulty, of course, is that the political forces ranged against such a solution are vast. The rich will not give up their riches without a struggle. Marx’s solution was somewhat more radical. He thought the dispossessed should organize themselves and take control of capital. Unfortunately, Reagan and Thatcher did a very thorough job at crushing organized labour. So maybe serfdom beckons. Only time will tell."

But otherwise NOTHING NEW here! So do yourself a favor, download Das Kapital for free from Gutenberg.org and save yourself the 20$!Summary:""Some people are richer than others, that makes me feel jealous, I propose a global progressive tax to make things 'fairer' and even things out. Rich people suck because they make more money than I do.""Notice the framing:Inequality is bad, it must be corrected.Case in point:Christian Felber recently published THE EXACT SAME book a couple of years ago, ""Die Gemeinwohl Ökonomie"". It is the exact same thing; he goes on about how income inequality is mean and evil and how there should be a global progressive tax to ""correct"" the income inequality. He goes on to propose a new Bank, with a new global money -- the ""Globo"".So why is Pikkety's book a bestseller?Because it is really easy to manipulate people's emotions. And when it comes to emotional manipulation, income inequality is the big one, right next to racism, discrimination and gun control.Don't let all of the big names fool you, e.g. Paul Krugman raves about this book.What this book really does is reveal the biases of all the reviewers. And that it does well.Paul Krugman is a foaming at the mouth neo-communist Keynesian maniac. And of course he has a Nobel Prize, so that makes his foaming at the mouth better, right?I prefer to live in a free society.That means if I can get ahead and make a fortune for myself, then I will, and I don't want any jealous loser screaming ""That's not fair!""There is always going to be inequality, there is always going to be someone with more money than you. And that is going to put a spike in the graph.It is NOT OK to try and eliminate that spike. It is NOT ""fair"" to steal money from other people and make things ""fair"" by distributing stolen money.Progressive taxes penalize winners and award losers - that's just plain wrong.That spike in the graph is supposed to be there -- it is indicative of a free society, especially when any class can move into that spike.That is called ""INCOME MOBILITY"" and it is much, much, more important than income inequality.It is of course intentional that income mobility is not mentioned in this book.But this book was not written to give a full picture of the situation, it was written to amplify one statistic in the framework of communism and Marxist thinking in order play on your emotions. The typical modus operandi of despotism.Inequality is a lie. I don't want everything to be equal, if that were the case we would be robots ... no thanks.So if you wanna waste your 20 bucks and join the circle jerk of moron communists that still haven't woken up, go ahead and buy this book.And remember the grandaddy of them all:Robin Hood stole his taxes -back- from the King - he was the first(?) tax evader, NOT a communist redistributionist who stole from the rich and gave to the poor. It was about taxes man, NOT income inequality. And that too you can read FOR FREE at Gutenberg.org !"

""I refuse this nomination because I do not think it is the government's role to decide who is honorable. They would do better to concentrate on reviving [economic] growth in France and Europe,"" Piketty told AFP*. 

""César Birotteau,another Balzac character,made his money in perfumes.He was the ingeniuous inventor of any number of beauty products-Sultan's cream,Carminative Water, and so on-that Balzac tells us were all the rage in late imperial and Restoration France. But this was not enough for him: when the time came to retire,he sought to triple his capital by speculating boldly on real estate in the neighborhood of La Madeleine, which was developing rapidly in the 1820's. After rejecting the sage advice of his wife,who urged him to invest in good farmland near Chinon and government bonds, he ended in ruin"".in ""Capital in the Twenty-First Century""I watched Paul Krugman being interviewed by Moyers, and commenting on this book. Some notes I still retain:(a)	Moyers was puzzled at the state of things in America: dynastic fortunes, the economy growth rate (2-3%) lower than the rate of return (4-5%) on capital.(b)	Statistical data: between 1977-2007: 60% of the national income of America went to the top 1% .



(c)	Krugman acknowledged that the book was a “revelation” , because “we’ve stopped talking about capital”…:we’re heading towards “an Oligarchy”: of a few people with high income and lots of assets; patrimonial capitalism. This has (negative) consequences for democracy; as, in Roosevelt time, was recognized: they (the top 1%) “can buy the political system”. It makes me recall the Koch brothers a few years back. (d)	Moyers decried the situation saying: and yet we’re not able to provide a minimum wage, of $10.10 [to many].(e)	Krugman hinted at the solution: Redistribution; which seems to have become “un-American”. He recalled a time when France apparently “committed to equality” (before WWI) was, in practice, “dominated by a very few (group) of wealthy families”.-- Just like the USA,... now.

28,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"So, I will admit up front that I am extremely late to this party. This book was all the rage in 2014, and I'm reviewing it in 2020. Of course, I was late to the party when I read Marx's Communist Manifesto, also, but there I had the good excuse of being not born yet. I was totally alive, literate, and even interested in the topic when this book came out, I just didn't get a copy until now.There is, inevitably, some indication of this in the book itself. At the time he wrote it, the Great Recession of 2008 was the primary topic for economic thought, and the principal questions in Europe were related to that, the euro, and the rupture between the economic fates of north and south (epitomized by Germany and Greece, respectively). In the U.S., the Occupy Wall Street movement had happened only a couple years before, and the issues of ""the 1%"" were very much still in the public spotlight.Piketty's text does not suffer too much from the passage of time, though, since his perspective is very much focused on centuries and generations, not years and months. His basic thesis (to compress nearly 600 pages of text and chart down into a few words), is this:1) the return on capital, r, is normally greater than the growth rate of the economy, g2) in addition, the return on capital tends to be better the richer you are (you can hire better advisors, can reinvest more of your profits, etc.)3) this means that, in the absence of cataclysmic events like the two world wars sandwiching the Great Depression, the rich will get richer, even relative to the economy generally, until nearly all of the wealth of society is owned by a small elite4) but the first half of the 20th century was such a massive explosion to the wealthy (because they owned most of what was being blown up), that it took until now for the elite to start to approach the same level of dominance that they had at the end of the 19th century5) thus, there is no automatic process to balance this out, and unless we do something about it capital will get more and more concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewerHe doesn't mention Mancur Olson, by the way, but I was reminded of his theory that nations which have experienced a large natural disaster or major defeat in war, tend to grow faster for a time afterwards than those who did not. Olson attributed this to the disruption of the hold on society of special interests, which is not too different from Piketty's thesis here about rich elites.The cases which he looks at in the most depth are France and the U.K., because they are the ones for which you can make a reasonably informed stab at estimating inequality going back over several hundred years (which highlights how unusual the first half of the 20th century was). Once we get to the post-WW2 era, he has a lot more nations to compare, and one of his most interesting assertions is that broadly speaking, the same pattern has played out for all advanced economies, even ones like Japan, the U.S., or Sweden which have very different cultural histories than France. The degree of the changes may be different, but all of them saw a reduction in wealth inequality during the first half of the 20th century, followed by a gradual return (still incomplete) towards the situation at the end of the 19th century. So, while it is clear that he is no fan of Ronald Reagan or Margaret Thatcher, he also makes it clear that this was not primarily a result of their politics in the U.S. and the U.K. France, Sweden, Germany, Japan, etc. all have had very different political histories in the last 40 years, and in all of them we have seen wealth accumulating in higher and higher amounts amongst the top 10% (and top 1%) during this time (though perhaps not to quite the same degree).So, is this a problem? Well I think it is, but I do think it would have been better if Piketty had spent a bit more time explaining why this is a problem. Perhaps he assumed (probably correctly) that anyone who would pick up a book of this sort would already be convinced of that. But, to play devil's advocate for a bit, one could argue that the higher the levels of wealth amongst the wealthiest, the more surplus wealth is available for investment in risky ventures which may have high risk of failure but high rewards if they succeed. Perfect wealth equality might leave everyone comfortable, but no one with enough to be able to risk their nest egg on something not guaranteed to work. A society which has no wealthy, might have no venture capitalists, and thus no (or nearly no) startups, and thus no innovation. I don't necessarily buy this argument, but it is one which Piketty doesn't bother to refute, or any of the other reasons one might give for wealth inequality not being a problem.Another problem with Piketty's book is that after outlining the problem, he then goes on to say something like, ""therefore the government should use taxes on wealth to fix it"", without addressing many of the valid objections to this. Taxation systems are infamously expensive to run and maintain, easy to evade if you're rich enough to pay people to figure out how to do it, and prone to manipulation by special interests who can afford lobbyists. When comparing his proposed wealth tax against, for example, inflation (sometimes alleged to work to reduce wealth inequality), he spends a good bit of time analyzing the theoretical results of each method, but not much addressing the difference in ease of execution. It is not difficult to create inflation; governments (central banks) have often successfully done it (even when not wanting to). To get a reasonably designed wealth tax up and running is a task perhaps as fraught with difficulty and prone to failure as any other task one could imagine. Piketty never really addresses this issue; one is reminded of physicists with their frictionless pullies, or mathematicians who assume things exist as step 1 of their proof.Still and all, there is (for me at least) no denying the core of his argument, which is that money tends to accumulate, except when there's an explosion (like WWI/Depression/WWII), and we are near the end of the relatively egalitarian aftermath of that explosion. Whatever the solution, it is likely to depend on the government, and it is unlikely to succeed if we don't make a reduction in wealth inequality the actual objective. Thus, for example, I don't believe technology or meritocracy or what-have-you will automatically make the concentration of wealth go away. If we want to solve the problem, we first must admit that it will not solve itself, and this I think Piketty does very well."
29,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32553593-elliott-bignell,5,"This is one of those books that makes one feel more intelligent. Very slightly technical and with only a smattering of mathematics but a lot of graphs and a pile of evidence, the author exercises the paedagogue's talent for making clear the concepts he has to employ to make his case, and thereby makes one feel clever just for moving ahead with reading. It is unusual for an economics treatise to become a popular bestseller, and this book is unusual in a number of other ways. Firstly it is even quite witty. Not least, however, is that it is the first work of economics I have read since Adam Smith that actually seeks to place economics on an empirical foundation by working from historical evidence to find and test patterns prior to seeking predictions. This, I conclude, is a tour de force.The book's thesis is relatively simple in itself: Low growth and extreme inequality are causally linked and represent the normal state of human civilisation. The egalitarian period and universal-welfare mentality from the First World War up to the 1970s was historically anomalous and grew out of massive wartime shocks to capital and requirements to accommodate a broader population, whose cooperation was needed to win hot and cold wars and who exercised unprecedented levels of engagement. The post-1980s consensus returns the economy of most of the world to its 19th-Century status quo, and with an expectation of low growth rates of 1%-1.5% in the future we can expect a permanent return to the dominance of capital and burgeoning inequality, as returns on capital will exceed growth, especially for large chunks of capital, so wealth will concentrate in the hands of rentiers. The best way to forestall this process is a progressive tax on capital, a conclusion which I enthusiastically endorse.Some of this has a Marxian sound to it, and the author certainly has in mind to review and criticise Marx's thinking. The author, however, is not a Marxist and is in favour of free trade. What he establishes is that the market, contrary to the ideological faith of the Chicago school, will not suffice. We can expect 19th-Century levels of inequality to be first attained and perhaps then exceeded unless active steps are taken - levels of inequality that will certainly lead to revolt of one kind or another. Trickle-down, the standard justification for inequality in which most of us live off the drip-drip of the great like so many pigeons on the bottom branch of a tree full of our superiors, has not worked and will not work to reverse the growth of inequality; the growth of inequality is structural and based on a simple arithmetic inequality: The return on capital exceeds the growth in general wealth, and the greater the pile of capital the greater the difference, due to economies of scale. The Gates' stash will grow at 10%-15% a year just by existing, while the few thousand that the average middle-class bloke can save will be very lucky to earn a third of that; Donald Trump is apparently so devoid of management skills that he has earned less through four bankrupt business ventures than he would have earned by leaving the money in the bank, and yet his wealth has still grown faster than the economy. Moreover, inheritance will eventually guarantee in combination with the foregoing that there is almost no way into the upper cohort of earnings but to belong to the rentier class and be born rich, just as in pre-20th Century Europe.So far this may not be surprising, yet there were some realisations in the book that surprised even me. For a start, the Washington Consensus is itself a historical anomaly. Up to the 1970s progressive taxation was more aggressive in the anglophone world than in Europe - much more aggressive, with rates reaching 97% on very high returns. (I should have remembered this, as I was am enough to recall the Callahan government.) In the USA, once the more egalitarian society, the accumulation of billionaire-level fortunes at the expense of all around one was seen as un-American. Today this has reversed completely - the USA is today's Old Europe, with levels of inequality already comparable to Victorian Britain and an entrenched rentier class, while Europe is comparatively egalitarian and has greater social mobility. (Although social mobility is itself mainly an illusion - I have seen other sources that assert that even three generations of Communism generally left most power and influence in the hands of families that were wealthy prior to the revolutions.) Underlying levels of growth in modern economies vary little, despite nationalist chest-beating. The USA is currently growing faster than Europe because of demographic growth - the underlying per capita growth in GDP is about the same. China is currently exploding for the same reason as Europe did from 1945 to the 1970s - it is catching up to an equilibrium level. Growth, it appears, owes far more to structural considerations of the return on capital than to policy, beyond the decision to participate in markets.At the same time, and flying in the face of the above, recent hyper-inflation in upper-centile earnings are mainly driven by management remuneration in the form of obscene compensation packages for corporate directors. And debt between nations, which should amount to an accounting identity, is out of balance: The Earth apparently owes money to Mars, as when one adds up all everyone's debts to everyone else one ends up with a huge and unexplained negative number. Someone, it appears, is skimming.This is one of the best books I have read in recent years, and absolutely the best on the subject of economics."
30,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11066140-gregg-wingo,5,"Piketty has accomplished much with this work. Despite claims that it represents a Neo-Marxism it is anything but that, rather it is a return to Classical economics in the tradition of Adam Smith, Ricardo, and Marx synthesized with the rigor of 20th-century economics in the tradition of Fisher, Keynes, and Schumpeter. It is as its title implies a study of the nature of Capitalism not just economics or business but rather the whole system we find ourselves enmeshed in today. He begins the book with a critique of Classical economists and highlights the importance of Ricardo's and Marx' work in the following passage:""...the principle of infinite accumulation that Marx proposed contains a key insight, as valid for the study of the twenty-first century as it was for the nineteenth and in some respects more worrisome than Ricardo's principle of scarcity. If rates of population and productivity growth are relatively low, then accumulated wealth naturally takes on considerable importance, especially if it grows to extreme proportions and becomes socially destabilizing....In particular, the very high level of private wealth that has been attained since the 1980s and 1990s in the wealthy countries of Europe and in Japan, measured in years of national income, directly reflects Marxian logic."" Piketty goes on to establish two fundamental laws of Capitalism:Capital's Share of National Income = Rate of Return on Capital X Capital/Income andCapital/Income = Savings rate/growth rateAs he says ""The rate of return on capital is a central concept in many economic theories. In particular, Marxist analysis emphasizes the falling rate of profit - a historical prediction that turned out to be wrong, although it does contain an interesting intuition....in a quasi-stagnant society, wealth accumulated in the past will inevitably acquire disproportionate importance.""Clearly Piketty is no Marxist apologist but rather a student of Capital willing to ponder the insights of Marx the economist rather than Marx the revolutionary. This is a position that needs to be better understood in the fields of economics and business. Piketty concludes that Marx' analysis of Capitalism was a description of the Second Fundamental Law of Capitalism at the point where the growth rate approaches zero. Marx' conclusions were based on the nature of 19th-century capitalism where ""...output increased solely because every worker was backed by more machinery and equipment and not because productivity as such...increased."" However, he firmly criticizes Marx who ""...usually adopted a fairly anecdotal and unsystematic approach to the available statistics."" As he evolves his argument for a society balanced between capital and labor he cites no less a figure than Irving Fisher, the father of Monetarism. As president of the American Economic Association Fisher addressed the organization in 1919 stating when ""...2 percent of the population owns more than 50 percent of the wealth [and] two-thirds of the population owns almost nothing [there exists] an undemocratic distribution of wealth"". He also reflects on the importance of immigration to the American and increasingly the world experience:""For a fair proportion of of Americans in the bottom 50 percent of the income distribution, these inequalities are of secondary importance for the very simply reason that they were born in a less wealthy country and see themselves as being on an upward trajectory.""The author backs his arguments with a wealth of data within the book and online. His analysis of the nature of Capital ranks with David Hackett Fischer's work in ""The Great Wave: Price Revolutions and the Rhythm of History"". Piketty focuses on the internal dynamics while Fischer explains the externalites. Together with Smith, Ricardo, Marx, Fisher, Keynes, Schumpeter, and Minsky these works form the core of human understanding of Capitalism.  "

Tea drinkers would not benefit from the Scottish-Hibernian Institute for Tea having a monopoly over the U.K. market. Only those who own, or own shares in, that Institute would gain. But, Smith suggested, the alternative to private monopoly is a good one: if you let everyone invest their capital wherever they want, they will be guided, despite themselves, to help the domestic economy. The unintended consequences of their actions will benefit everyone. Smith’s hand has stayed with us, and become the centerpiece of our political-economic discourse. Libertarianism is the most intellectually respectable, consistent, and politically powerful twenty-first century version of this discourse.Libertarianism greatly expands Smith’s argument: he made a case for the invisible hand in the production of economic goods; libertarianism makes the case for it in distribution and consumption, as well. The theory holds that we are all rational actors, and we all know our best interests; if we all act in our best interests, and have access to perfect information, everything will work out for the best. But if governments intervene by, e.g., forcing Scottish tea on us, or subsidizing medical care, the natural processes of rational deciding will be interrupted, and the outcome will be bad. Therefore we can blame all problems on government intervention.In addition to the economic benefits, this view holds that doing away with government intervention would greatly simplify our moral lives. If the government’s always poking its nose in our business, it’s hard to tell whether successful people deserve their success. But if we are all free to act in our best interests, any given individual’s failure can only be caused by his own failure to act rationally; and if things work out spectacularly well for another individual, that can only be because she acted with perfect rationality. He deserved his failure, and she deserved her success. The inequalities of these outcomes are morally justifiable. This, libertarian discourse suggests, is the essence of true capitalism: markets, left to their own devices, will apportion goods efficiently and effectively; and they will also apportion them justly...

33,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35-michael-siliski,5,"An illuminating treatise on the nature of wealth and inequality in the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. Highly recommended for anyone with any appetite at all for non-technical macroeconomics.Piketty has two major contributions to offer. First, he (and colleagues) have spent years piecing together a more extensive set of sources than ever previously assembled to paint an incredibly thorough picture of income, capital, and economic growth over the past 300 years. While I have no expertise in this field, my sense, from the book and discussion of it, is that this has been done painstakingly and with much attention to detail, and is a genuinely novel contribution to the field. As a layperson, it’s the first time I’ve ever encountered such a broad view of macroeconomics, both over such long time periods and across countries.The data, by itself, I found extremely enlightening. It’s invaluable to have a framework like Piketty provides for thinking about how changes to various economic parameters will affect growth and the distribution of wealth and income. Taking such a broad view, historically and across countries, helps us step outside our national political debates and recognize the fundamental forces at work, rather than policies that often operate on the margins. It’s worth reading the book for this perspective alone. For example, taking a view that stretches back to the 18th century across the US, England, and France makes it clear what massive shocks to wealth and income the two World Wars were and how much of the midcentury trends in economic growth and distribution were aftereffects of the wars. In effect, the period from 1914 to 1970 was a historical outlier. Without this view, it would be easy to look at, say, the 1960s and mistakenly draw narrow conclusions from specific US policies, ignoring critical context.The other major contribution is the exploration of inequality, and in particular, the relationship between the accumulation of wealth (capital) and economic output growth. Piketty focuses on what he calls the major force for divergence in capitalism: for almost all of history, r > g. That is, the rate of return on capital (r), generally 4–5%, is greater than economic growth (g), which never exceeded 1.5% prior to WWI and is projected to return to <2% going forward. When capital generates income faster than economic output (and income from labor) grows, fortunes built in the past tend to dominate, and will pull away from newly accumulated income. The rich get richer.The inequality discussion is also very interesting simply for the historical data and the framework offered for making sense of it, but it goes significantly beyond that and is intertwined with policy prescriptions. The primary and most famous of these is a global, progressive tax on capital, with an aim of directly restraining the growth of inequality. While the specific suggestions Piketty has are explicitly noted as utopian and are probably unworkable in practice, I think they’re useful contributions to the conversation as idealistic starting points.While the material is pretty dry, the writing is generally excellent — structured, easy to follow, human and relatable.The charts themselves are worth spending 30 minutes on, even if you don’t read the whole book: http://download.audible.com/product_r...A few qualms:1. I think a global, progressive tax on capital is a reasonable utopian solution, and I think it’s a sound approach for Piketty, as an economist, to offer it as a starting point, explore some of the challenges with it, and leave it there as the beginning of a broader discussion. While he has a clear agenda, he is very transparent about it and it appears not to muddle his presentation of objective data. But it would be nice to have some more discussion of alternatives that address the same core issues practically, even if they’re less economically efficient.2. Somewhat more problematic is the lack of discussion of the possible downsides of Piketty’s policy proposals, other than implementation challenges. I’ve never seen a policy that didn’t at least have some tradeoffs, so it seems unrealistic on the face of it to imagine that none exist here. Policies don’t need to be cost-free to be the best path, but anyone who says there is no cost to their policy proposals deserves a good dose of skepticism. While I trust the core economic data presented here is dealt with fairly, I am less convinced by the one-sided treatment of policy.3. The section on executive pay is not very convincing. Piketty says the model he tried to build was not able to predict executive pay on the basis of outcomes, but that is not the same as proving that executive pay is entirely determined by some combination of (a) cultural norms (b) cronyism / self-set pay (c) irrationality. Though these are no doubt all factors, I think we’re missing something when we assume it’s simply irrational or corrupt for companies to pay managers what they are paid. At the very least, it’s clear that there is a competitive market for talent at a sub-CEO level, with rapidly increasing incomes (which isn’t self-determined), so one must explain why companies think managers are worth what they’re paid. Until we have that, we won’t be coming up with compelling recommendations.4. I think there’s an unresolved tension between (a) the core thesis that there a group of massively wealthy rentiers built on historical fortunes pulling away from the rest of society due to r > g, and (b) the fact that growing inequality over the past 40 years is driven by growth in labor income inequality. This doesn’t mean that there isn’t an inequality issue, but it isn’t currently the result of the returns to capital, and when focusing on the top 0.1%, inheritances seem to pale compared to income from labor. So there may be a concern that in the future, all of today’s self-made millionaires and billionaires will create fortunes that continually grow in importance. But the fact that one can propel oneself into the top 1% through entrepreneurial work is very different than pre-WWI France or England.5. I think it’s kind of crazy that Piketty refuses to even acknowledge that Gates/Buffet/Zuckerberg level philanthropy (i.e. giving away 99% of one’s fortune to charitable causes) is not a true public good because it’s done through foundations they control. I don’t see how that is justifiable on any non-prejudicial grounds.--------------------Appendix: Interesting Data PointsGDP & Economic Growth* Europe’s share of world output has been falling since WWI, from 47% to 25%. Asia accounts for all the growth, with 42% of world GDP today.* Europe’s share of world population has fallen in this time from a high of 26% to 10% now* Average global annual income is about $12,000. (US is about $50,000.)* World output grew by negligible amounts (~0.1% annually) for almost all of history, up to the 18th century. It was about 1.5% in the 19th century, then post-WWI has been about 3.0%. Half of this is population growth, half is per capita output growth. Population growth is projected to fall from 1.4% to 0.7% from now through 2050, then 0.2% to 2100. So per capita output accounts for most growth, expected to be around 1.5%.* A 1% difference in growth rates is huge. Going from 1.5% to 2.5% is like multiplying by 2.1x instead of 1.6x every generation (30y).* Western Europe grew at 4.1% per capita 1950–1970 while catching up from the shocks of the wars, * North America at 2.3%. Since 1970 they’ve grown at the same levels (2.2% 1970–1990, 1.5% 1990–2012).* World per capita GDP growth is projected to be 2.5% to 2050 then drop to 1.5% for 2050–2070. Thanks to population growth rate declines, world GDP growth is projected to drop even more steeply (3.5% to 1.7%).* There’s no way to achieve a sustainable 4–5% growth rate. Only countries “catching up” (Europe after WWII, China today) see such high growth rates. For countries at the “world economic frontier,” there is reason to believe that growth rates will not exceed 1–1.5% in the long run, regardless of economic policy.* 2/3 of people were employed in agriculture in 1800 (US, France), down to 1/50 in 2012. 1/7 were in services, up to 4/5 now.* Agricultural land accounted for around 55–65% of wealth in Western Europe and the US in 1700. It’s now near 0%, with housing having eaten that share.Wealth & Capital/Income Ratio* Public assets and debt generally cancel each other out in Western countries and public capital is ~0 (~all wealth is privately owned)* DE, FR, UK achieved 600–700% capital/income ratios on the eve of to WWI, and have not yet gotten back to that point* WWI, WWII, and the Great Depression destroyed wealth. Wars brought physical destruction of capital, nationalization, taxation, and inflation, while the Depression destroyed fortunes through capital losses and bankruptcy.* 1913–2012 is the only period in world history where the rate of return on capital after taxes and capital losses (due to wars and downstream effects) was lower than the economic growth rate.* Starting in the 1970s, the ratio of wealth to income has grown along with income inequality. Levels of wealth concentration are approaching those of the pre-war era.* Private capital is projected to grow to near 700% of world income by 2100, from a low of close to 250% in the wake of WWII and about 450% today (close to the 500% of 1910). Global wealth is accumulating.* Capital generated close to 45% of income in Britain & France in 1910, down to about 25% in the mid-20th century* Pure rate of return on capital in Britain & France has held pretty steady around 4–5% since the end of the 18th centuryInequality* Income inequality in the US took a sudden nose dive during WWII and stayed locked at low levels until the 80s, achieving pre-WWII levels in the 2000s (and now going beyond)* Share of top 10% by labor income varies from 20% (e.g. Scandinavia 1980) to 35% (e.g. US 2010). The top 1% takes 5–12% of this.* Share of top 10% by capital varies from 50% (e.g. Scandinavia 1980) to 70% (e.g. US 2010) to 90% (e.g. Europe 1910). The top 1% takes 20–35–50% of this. The bottom 50% typically own 5% of total wealth.* You have to go to the top .01% before capital income outstrips labor income in France* While the share of total income in the top 90–99th pctile in the US has crept upwards since a low of 23% after WWII to 28% today, the share of the top 1% went from 10% (and lower in the high-tax 70s) to over 20%. The top 10% takes almost half of total income (vs 1/3 in the mid-20th century US or Europe today).* Share of capital income exceeds labor income only in top 0.1%, one tenth the proportion of the population as in 1929* Top 1% take almost 2x the share of total income in US/UK as in FR/DE.* Top 1% had 60% of the wealth in France in 1910, now 25% (thanks to wars, inflation, taxation, etc.). Britain 70% to 28%. Sweden 60% to 20%. US 45% to 32%.* The annual value of inheritances in France has tripled from less than 5% of GDP in the 1950s to about 15%, not all that far from the 19th-century peak of 25%.* Inheritance made about 25% of the resources of 19th century cohorts, down to less than 10% for cohorts born in 1910–1920 (who should have inherited in 1950–1960)… but back up over 20% for those born in 1970+."
34,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/980285-ben,3,"The most amazing thing about this book to me might be that it's generated controversy. Sure, there are some things in here that would align more closely to people on the left's point of view than those on the right--the importance of inherited wealth and the spike in incomes for the wealthiest are driving inequality. But most of the book is surrounded with a lot of chapters that make perfect sense from an economist standpoint, but are less interesting than those looking for the more policy/popular piece. To that end, the first 200-250 pages are a lot of discussions about just basic trends in capital and things of that nature since the 19th century. It's not really the most interesting stuff.Where the book really does pick up is the middle sections where it starts to explain some of the trends observed in greater detail. Here again the key conclusion feels pretty obvious but also not seemingly that controversial--when the rate of return on capital is greater than the overall economic growth rate people are going to end up accumulating more capital at a faster rate. This isn't great, but it becomes even more problematic when you pair it with what we expect the growth rate to be into the future. Here's what I actually found possibly the most interesting in the book--for much of the recent past (150 or so years) the growth rate of economies really was not that high--usually around 1 to 1.5 percent. And really that what we saw in the post-WWII years is in many ways a historical anomaly that won't be repeated. That's pretty scary if you think about it in terms of what we would think a good economy growth rate looks like and the implications for future familial income growth. Pair those two things together and you have a recipe for something that's not great--lots of capital growth not super fast overall growth and big fortunates being accumulated. That does suggest a return to the 19th century European societies, which were quite inegalitarian. Clearly that's not going to be well received, but remember this is a rather complex point made across hundreds of pages and lots of charts. So is the book worth reading? It's hard to say. You can read some pretty good explainers that hit at all the issues in the book quickly. See here for example. But if you do read it, you can really skip a lot of the beginning parts.Oh also, if you like random allusions to 19th century literature, this might be for you. There's a kind of interesting observation about how novels moved away from detailed discussions of incomes and wealth."
35,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"The book makes a wonderful introduction to economics since there is an overriding narrative that explains everything the author is presenting (namely, that inequality is increasing) and touches on many facets of economic thought such as capital relative to national income, savings and growth related to capital, the role of central banking, demographic trends and how that relates to growth and so on. Who among us don't love a great story about demographic trends since 1700 or from the year zero?It's hard not to like a book where the author's most used expression is something like ""according to the data the answer is no"", or ""the data seems to support that assertion and here's why..."". Sometimes the author did appeal to anecdotal to make his points, and those points weren't as persuasive and a critical reader could fault the author. (Because Bill Gates or Harvard Endowment's return on capital was 10% or more doesn't necessarily mean that the richer earn more return on capital than others). I nitpick, after all the book is already 700 pages long and the author explains everything so nicely and maybe didn't have time to present real data in support of his point.This is book is easily well liked since the author explains difficult concepts so very well. He'll introduce a concept, he'll explain it, than he'll tell you what it means and than he'll explain it again and again. He's giving the reader very difficult concepts to grasp but the reader is never at a loss since the concepts are explained multiple times. There are mathematical concepts presented, and plenty of graphs and charts, but the author explains everything so well that the reader is never at a loss. I listened to the book through audible but was never at a lost since he was describing the charts or graphs in such simple terms that I always understood what was being demonstrated.There is an obvious reason why this book has been such a big hit. The author explains things so that almost any reader can understand.I really enjoyed the book and got to learn a lot of things I didn't know about economics and enjoyed the experience since the author explained things so well. If there are any other modern books about economics as good as this one, I would love to read those too, but until then, I feel safe in saying this is a marvelous book and deserves the accolades it has received."
36,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26237227-lucas,5,"Being in the science field, I was always deeply annoyed by the prevalence of anti-scientific thought among so many economy pundits. Many ideas seemed completely dissociated from historical facts but were said to be true just because. To me they felt more like religion than science.Piketty did a fenomenal work which completely repels that tendency. Each point discussed is thorougly based on real facts, not dogma. As in the best science cases, he shows a convergence of conclusions based on orthogonal data. Not only that, but he managed to accomplish something that can both be used as an outstanding example of science outreach (I am absolutely sure that hundreds of people got interested in economy thanks to his delightful writing, just as Stephen Jay Gould did for Biology, or Feynman for Physics, etc.), and also as an invaluable source for researchers - each and every piece of data he collected is made available in his technical supplementary material. Which, again, is how good science must be done.It is very telling that the negative reviews he received were, almost in their totality, based on ideology rather on actual flaws. As most people are already aware, it did receive some criticism from The Financial Times about errors in his database. To which his attitude was exactly what should be expected from a serious scientist - correct the errors and evaluate his conclusions thereafter. Which were shown to be still intact.Interestingly, he was also criticized for writing something that was ""too obvious"". This is exactly what I find to be most depressing about economics punditry - it is considered completely ok to perpetuate myths which are solely based on fundamentalist preconceptions, and keep giving all kinds of exotic excuses to explain why the exact opposite happens in real life. Piketty took an herculeous effort to show, undeniably, something that, if not for our media being dominated by dishonest pundits, should be just... obvious."
37,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1944947-barnaby-thieme,5,"Piketty's fascinating book is a crucial contribution to social and political debates on economic inequality, presenting an engrossing and persuasive history of capital and income distributions globally, and offering the basis for one plausible way forward. Equally uneasy with the ideologically-constrained Marxist economists of Europe and the theory-crazed mathematical economists of the US, Piketty undertakes to do a different kind of economics, explicitly more akin to the genre of political economy that dropped out of sight decades ago. He urges economists to be wary of abstractions, and instead to make judicious use of all available empirical data, and to carefully consider the role of history and politics in shaping economic outcomes. As a result, his book is surprisingly persuasive, based, as it is, on an enormous database of economic data that he has compiled for decades with his colleagues. His data are publicly available, and his arguments are copiously backed up in end notes. His theory-light style also makes his book surprisingly pleasant to read. I expected it to be a dry, arcane tome, filled with differential equations and statistics. While it is not entirely without math, in essence it tells a story - the story of the evolution of distributions of wealth, and what we can learn from it. Nor should we laypeople recoil from a little math - otherwise, we entirely cede the field of economics to mathematicians, and it's too important for that. This book sheds light on the forces driving the increased concentration of more and more resources into fewer and fewer hands, especially at the very top of the wealth hierarchy. Piketty argues that the fundamental mechanism driving inequality is described by the simple equation r > g, meaning that the average annual return on capital is greater than growth. So, for example, wealth derived from investments consistently outpaces wage increases. Year over year, these disparities accumulate at a compounded rate, and wealth accumulated in the past takes on a greater and greater role in the economy. In the absence of counter-balancing forces such as high inflation or progressive taxation, this leads ultimately to an ever-smaller number of inherited megafortunes. This is not theoretical speculation, mind you - he has persuasive data to back up his history and the principles he deduces from it. There is much of great interest in this book, such as his history of inflation, which essentially did not exist prior to the late 19th century in Europe and the United States. Or his alarming analysis of growth, arguing that in the absence of massive demographic expansion, or outside of brief periods of heavy industrialization, historical growth can be expected to cap off at about 1% annually. The big surprise for me was his policy discussion of a way forward, in which he argues for a progressive global tax on capital. At a glance this idea sounded preposterously Utopian to me, but Piketty is well aware of the challenges. Nevertheless, he makes an extremely persuasive argument that, short of this solution, we have little reason to hope for a just and democratic counter-tendency to a trend toward wealth concentration that, in the long run, will impress even the most staunch free-market ideologue as untenable. This book is rather long, and I hope that he will some day publish a short version that presents its basic ideas in a form that can be more readily absorbed by a general audience. I think this book has a vital role to play in public discourse, but many will be turned off by its heft. If you are one of the many people interested in Piketty but daunted by this book's size, I urge you to read parts of it and skim or skip the rest. Specifically, I believe any general reader could profit greatly from reading only chapters 1-4, 8-9, and 16. If you're looking for Piketty light, you may safely ignore his short ""Economics of Inequality"", published in English in 2015. It is not a condensed expression of his arguments, it is a short book first published in 1997, and barely updated. "

If democracy is someday to regain control of capitalism, it must start by recognizing that the concrete institutions in which democracy and capitalism are embodied need to be reinvented again and again.
There is patience, rigor, and impartiality... and then there's Capital in the Twenty-First Century, a book so concerned with establishing background information and painstakingly building its case that it took me about a year of on-again, off-again reading to arrive at the first actual policy recommendation. It's a bit like the Wonders of the Ancient World: an awe-inspiring testament to human dedication and resourcefulness, but probably overkill in the end (although to Piketty's credit, Capital was assembled without the use of slave labor (... as far as we know)). Anyone coming into the book hoping for a searing polemic on wealth inequality will pretty quickly run into a wall when they realize the bulk of this book actually comprises... methodical explanations of graphs. And datasets. You could almost praise Piketty as being a champion of accessibility for blind readers, in that he dedicates so many paragraphs of description to every graph that you could listen to an audiobook version with hardly any information loss.All I mean by that though is to say that Piketty is an economist first and only a ""popular author"" as a distant second, which is probably all for the best - with data this complete, any economics dilettantes (myself included) he manages to reach really ought to be considered a bonus. Paul Krugman, widely considered Way More Qualified to Talk About This Stuff Than Me, apparently called it a work of ""serious, discourse-changing scholarship"", and if you have any left-leaning sympathies (and make it past the first 100 pages), you just might be sustained by an exhilarating sense of vindication similar to the one I experienced: ""The Wall Street Occupiers really were right! There really is a sound factual basis behind the intuition/zeitgeist that wealth inequality is spiraling out of control and that the only way to preserve any sense of economic opportunity is to implement redistributive taxation!"" Capital's analysis might be guilty of being dry and repetitive, but it's certainly not stale, which for some small percentage of the population will make all the difference. I'm not sure that most people will find the added value of reading this book cover to cover compared to reading the wikipedia page and a couple reviews really justifies the extra time, but ultimately, I had just enough specific interest in the hard-economics background to ""enjoy"" it, and I look forward to the next few years of whipping out its data and arguments whenever anyone starts to expound some trickle-down bull#&*$ within hearing range.

Second this book is not so much about the 21st century as it is about the 19th and 20th. So it should really be called ""Wealth in the 19th, 20th, and very early 21st Century,"" but that wouldn't have sounded as edgy. Third, Piketty is not a Marxist he is a Keynesian. It is abundantly clear that he knows little of Marx's works and understands less. Which brings me to a complaint that I have, but is not terribly significant with regards to the book as a whole. When he says that Marx's law of falling profits of capital is wrong, he is wrong. Marx was talking about capital, Piketty is talking about wealth. Remove the parts of data that Piketty that are wealth but not capital, and you see very clearly that Marx was indeed correct. But Piketty insists that his orange is correct with regards to Marx's apple. Back to the book in general. Piketty is very long winded and occasionally arrogant sounding. It is clear that he fancies himself as the next John Maynard Keynes. His book could have been cut down to 200 pages easily. The ""solutions"" he proposes are all good and fine, but they won't get rid of inequality. capitalism is fundamentally a system of inequality. You can't get rid of the inequality without getting rid of capitalism. Which by the way isn't want Piketty is proposing to do. He wants to create a larger socially conscious capitalism. One where the rich pay some more in order to help out in paying for more social spending. So it's not anything new, nor anything revolutionary, just a long book that provides ""solutions"" that don't fix the problem, because the author fails to see what the problem really is."

Now I know why he is regarded as the most important economist of the Twenty-First Century. He does a perfect job to illustrate how economics has yet to grow out of childish passion for mathematics and purely theoretical speculation.

Capital in the 21st Century isn't a thundering indictment of grasping rich people, it's not a call to revolution, and it's certainly not the modern Communist Manifesto or even the modern Das Kapital.

This book is very readable, but it's quite dense (as indicated by the fact that most readers barely get through the introduction) and takes a while to digest, even though the main ideas are actually pretty simple. To wit, as long as r > g, or the rate of return on capital investment is larger than the growth of the economy, then inequality will continually increase. This seems to be part of the nature of capitalism, since it's been true for the majority of human history for which we have detailed statistical models. The only period of time that it wasn't true was the period 1914- ~1980, and that's because of the catastrophic destruction of wealth and property due to two World Wars and the Great Depression (which reduced r) and the subsequent rebuilding (which increased g). It was these disasters, not any inherent property of globalization or modern industrial capitalism, that reduced the proportion of global wealth owned by the top 10% and allowed the rise of a real middle class in the developed world.This was why social progress has occurred to a degree previously unseen. Not because capitalism is innately benign, but because the means to combat the devastation of the war--high marginal tax rates, large estate taxes, inflation, public pension systems, public health systems, and so on--all contributed to reducing inequality. These trends are currently reversing themselves, however. While the post-war years saw a bare majority of new fortunes in the surveyed countries (primarily Britain, France, and the United States) coming from entrepreneurial wealth instead of inherited fortunes, that's no longer true. Furthermore, those entrepreneurs convert to rentiers through investments, and lowered estate taxes mean that they will pass on their fortunes to their heirs, possibly leading to a new Belle Époque. Piketty doesn't indicate that this is inevitable--indeed, he repeatedly states that predicting the economic future is basically impossible--but he does say that trends are certainly pointing in that direction. The global growth rate in the developed countries is now slowing, as is population growth, and the developed countries are catching up due to knowledge diffusion and once they reach an equivalent level, their growth will almost certainly slow as well. That will reduce global growth to a level around 1-1.5%, which is still much higher than the ancient rate of 0.1%, but nowhere near the rates achieved in the post-war period. And when growth is that low, it's much easier for capital to find a high rate, thus increasing the concentration of capital and inequality. There's no innate process in global capitalism to combat this, and it's possible for it to simply increase without limit until the top 10% owns 90% of the wealth and the top 1% owns 50-70% of the wealth, as it did in developed nations before World War I.One point Piketty makes that I thought was interesting is that this kind of inequality undermines the entire point of work. He refers to Le Père Goriot as an example repeatedly, pointing out that Rastignac couldn't earn nearly as much from work as he could from marrying a wealthy heiress, and in such circumstances, why work? Developed economies are nowhere near that point yet, but they might get there again if the dismantling of corrective measures continues.He also deals with why the notion of the self-made man persists in America, and points out the well-founded roots it has. America had extraordinary population growth over the last two centuries, from around 3 million to currently ~310 million--compare France's going from 30 million to 65 million--and had extremely cheap land for reasons that are obvious to anyone who's studied the history of the Native Americans. The first greatly increased g and the second reduced r. Indeed, America instituted progressive taxes in the early 20th century due to a fear of inequality approaching levels seen in the Europe of the day and thus of losing our economic dynamism. Though he does also mention that American inequality is in some ways worse, because this legacy means that the well-off invoke a moral justification for their fortunes and deride the poor as simply lazy.So, how to deal with these trends? Piketty's solutions are actually quite simple to describe: a progressive estate tax, a very high rate on top incomes--80% is the given number--a global tax on wealth, and financial transparency between nations. He admits that all of this is extremely unlikely to be enacted due to the current race-to-the-bottom on tax policy among states as they compete for capital investment, but the point is that it can serve as a standard to compare proposed plans to or as an ideal to work toward.Considering the data, Capital in the 21st Century isn't nearly as pessimistic I would have expected. Everything seems to point toward increasing inequality and a return of the late 19th century social divide, but Piketty points out that World War I and the Great Depression both came as a surprise. In addition, countries were taking steps to institute social services and progressive taxes before the war, and it's unclear what direction that would have gone in without the shocks of 1914-1945 to completely change its dynamics. There's certainly a warning, though, since high enough inequality undermines democracy:When the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of growth of output and income, as it did in the nineteenth century and seems quite likely to do again in the twenty-first, capitalism automatically generates arbitrary and unsustainable inequalities that radically undermine the meritocratic values on which democratic societies are based.Some amount of inequality isn't a problem for Piketty. It's when there's a nearly-unbreachable class divide and meritocracy becomes even more of a sham than it already is that we really need to worry, and without government action, there's no natural way to stop this. Without action, inequality will destroy democracy.I'm pretty sure that's where we'll end up, actually. It seems pretty clear from political discourse that corrective measures will never be imposed to the right degree, and things will get worse and worse until global warming and the wars it causes create as much of a reset in the 21st or 22nd century as the World Wars did in the 20th century. Capital in the 21st Century will be endlessly bashed by the reactionaries as a new call for the workers of the world to unite until capitalism destroys itself, because endless growth can't work in a world of finite resources. But hey, we can't say we weren't warned."
43,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9402537-preston-kutney,5,"I put off reviewing this because it took me so long to type up my notes into Evernote...but I am finally done and have organized a few of my thoughts on the book. As everyone should know, the book is Piketty's unified theory of inequality. Its historical approach to the topic and unfettered transparency (each table in the book has a link to the dataset on his website) are very impressive and it's difficult for a layman like myself to argue with his evidence. The essence of his theoretical framework is that there are convergent forces, or, forces that reduce inequality, and there are divergent forces, or, forces that drive the divide between rich and poor. The key force for convergence is knowledge and diffusion of skill. This makes sense, since egalitarian Scandinavian countries have very equal access to higher education while in inegalitarian countries such as the U.S., the average family income of students at Ivy League schools like Harvard is over $400,000 per year. This is...worrisome, especially taking into account the student debt problem in the U.S.The key forces for divergence are ""associated with the process of accumulation and concentration of wealth when growth is weak and the return on capital is high"". This idea is summarized by the now famous inequality, r > g, which has got to be, hands down, the mathematical inequality of the decade. The inequality represents the relationship between r, the rate of return on capital, and g, the economic growth rate. It says that if the rate of return to capital is significantly larger than the rate of growth of the economy (which is a stand in for an increase in wages and standard of living), then ""the past tends to devour the future: wealth originating in the past automatically grows more rapidly even without labor, than wealth stemming from work"". This is also worrisome because it appears that we have just left the period of the highest economic growth mankind has ever experienced (in the 1930's - 2000's - a growth rate that, with the world's environmental problems, food and water shortages and resource scarcity, would clearly be unsustainable over the long run) and return to the pre 1930's levels of much lower growth rates. This leads Piketty to conclude that we may have just left the golden age of income equality, and are about to return to Gilded Age/Robber Baron levels of extreme wealth inequality. I've already been more long-winded than I intended, but here are a few more of my important takeaways:-Capital has historically grown at a relatively consistent rate of about 5%. Interestingly, this rate - relinquishing money today for a 5% increase one year from now - may be an inherent psychological threshold of risk that humans are willing to bear.-""There is no historical example of a country at the world technological frontier whose growth in per capita output exceeded 1.5% over a lengthy period of time""-""What primarily characterizes the U.S. at the moment is a record level of inequality of income from labor (probably higher than in any other society at any time in the past, anywhere in the world)"". This is not as bad as it sounds, since it means that the inequality in the U.S. is not primarily from inherited wealth - something the entrepreneurial, socially mobile sensibilities of the ""American Dream"" would abhor. -As for those American 1%ers: ""Another force for divergence that is more political in nature: the decrease in the top marginal income tax rate led to an explosion of very high incomes, which then increased the political influence of the beneficiaries of the change in the tax laws, who had an interest in keep top tax rates low or even decreasing them further and who could use their windfall to finance political parties, pressure groups, and think tanks"". Scary.-Inequality is not inherently evil, and there is assuredly an optimal level of inequality that would serve the common utility. However, inequality at higher levels tends to compound its own power and erode democracy:""Our democratic societies rest on a meritocratic worldview, or at any rate a meritocratic hope, by which I mean a belief in a society in which inequality is based more on merit and effort than kinship and rents. This belief and this hope play a very crucial role in modern society, for a simple reason: in a democracy, the professed equality of rights of all citizens contracts sharply with the very real inequality of living conditions, and in order to overcome this contradiction it is vital to make sure that social inequalities derive from rational and universal principles rather than arbitrary contingencies. Inequalities must therefore be just and useful to all, at least in the realm of discourse and as far as possible in reality as well.""Easily 5 stars. The most important book of the year, even if you disagree with it. "
44,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1398873-frank-stein,2,"I knew I was not going to be sympathetic to some of Piketty's policy recommendations, so I knew parts of this book would irk me, but I also was highly appreciative of his and Emmaunel Saez's pathbreaking data sets on international inequality, and thought some of the surrounding statistical and qualitative evidence in this book would provide a worthy context for them. Unfortunately, much of this book beyond the basic stats is almost shockingly sloppy and tendentious. Although one can appreciate the detailed raw empirical work, almost everything surrounding it is discussed with few citations, little thought, and not a few errors.For those areas that I was familiar with, I was surprised how little Piketty seemed interested in getting exact dates or facts right and how little interested he was in engaging in the existing literature. For instance, Piketty spends about ten pages in the book dealing with central banking, and claims again and again that everyone agrees that the prime purpose of central banks is to protect the financial system. Besides trying to dispose of a topic that fills libraries without practically any research or citations, his gesture to consensus is absolutely wrong, with most economists still believing the job of central banks is to control fluctuations in inflation and output. Likewise, with little evidence Piketty claims that wages were stagnant in Europe until about 1870, when the consensus again is that they were perhaps somewhat stagnant until at the latest the 1840s, and some of Piketty's own graphs seem to demonstrate this, pace his argument in the text.Piketty's treatment of simple facts and dates also leaves much to be desired. For instance, he falsely attributes vastly increased US taxes to the period 1918-1919, instead of 1916, and attributes increases in taxes to Roosevelt in 1933 instead of Hoover in 1932. These minor mistakes are somewhat concerning for a work so based on tax data. Piketty also misquotes Hoover as supporting the ""liquidation"" of financial assets (not surprisingly without citation, since this is actually Hoover's supposition about what Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon felt). These and many other minor mistakes might be forgiven if so much of the book did not try to stand on its empirical contribution, and if the mistakes just always seem to support some minor or major point Piketty is making, as opposed to the actual facts which contradict it.Much of the critique of this book in public presses and economic journals focuses on Piketty's lack of concern with capital depreciation (again dismissed in a few sentences, despite the vast literature) and how the fact of depreciation contradicts his increasing accumulation of capital argument. Others have noted how all the supposed increase in ""capital"" that Piketty finds in the past 50 years comes from increase in land values, especially residential housing (Piketty includes such ""capital"" in his definition because it provides ""housing services"" but the definition of capital is that which provides profit, not services, the latter is a consumption good of a type, or at least a type of ""asset""). These and many other critiques of the main argument could be noted. But most importantly, Piketty's graphs contradict his central argument, r > g, or that returns on capital are greater than growth over the long run, leading to more and more capital relative to other types of income. His own graphs show that the after tax-return on capital has been below growth for the past 100 years, and, like many other graphs in the book, the supposed ""tendency"" he describes in the text come entirely from ""projected"" rates over the next 100 years. This is simply not how social science is done. Overall, the book gives one the impression of a man supremely self-confident of his own rectitude, one who can play with facts and arguments without checking sources or engaging with alternative explanations. For this reason, the parts of the book on policy recommendations actually turned out to be my favorite part (besides the basic empirical data) since they were honest, straightforward, and fairly well-argued. It was the rest of the book that ended up getting on my nerves, since it did not seem to be seeking truth but merely to be grinding axes and making snide asides. As a book as opposed to a collection of graphs, one has to say that this an ambitious but ultimately failed effort. Despite the hoopla surrounding its release, it is perhaps for the best that its star in the economic firmament has been falling fast."
45,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,5,"The hype is justified. Piketty's book is very good. However, it is important to be clear about what the book is and what it is not.First, it is an intricate economics book that presents interrelated arguments around ideas of capital, growth, inequality, and government policies. It is very well written and fairly clear. It is also fairly accessible as economics books go. There is very limited use of abstract symbols, models, and detailed quantitative results. References to these are more in the footnotes and can be found in Piketty's papers and related references. The technical details are there for those who are interested but do not impede a more general reader. If a reader is not familiar with economic thinking, however, this book may prove to be a bit of a slog.Second, this economics book involves historical time series and data and there are over a hundred figures and exhibits. If you can follow the figures and tables, you can follow much of the book, but if you do not like lots of tables ... then there may be a problem.Third, this economics book tells a rich tale of history and politics and is replete with references to various historical and cultural developments, political history, and even references to Jane Austen. For all of the richness and contextual detail, the book is a joy to read.What the book is not -- at least in my opinion -- is a number one NYT nonfiction bestseller. This tells me that it will join other famous popular but unread classics, such as ""A Brief History of Time"", ""Godel, Escher, Bach"", and ""The Origins of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind"". Whatever this book is, it is not a book for a mass audience. Indeed, it seems like a book that could motivate a full semester course at a university -- as I suspect it will.There have already been attempts to shoot the book down -- the FT criticisms are the most prominent. I would urge any potential readers to follow the press on those criticisms. I don't believe the criticisms have proven substantial or damaging. This is the regular stuff that researchers need to go through to publish major papers in top economics journals. There is likely more publicity now but the types and level of scrutiny are not new to Piketty and I am sure he will respond to all of the criticisms - as he has already started to do."
46,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29326783-daniel-demaret,5,"Before I started reading, I read some previews.I was amused to see that all the one star ratings I read were by people who had not even read the book.The book is quite scientific. It contains lots of diagrams from a staggering amount of newly gathered data that the author and his collegues have painstakingly gathered over many years.The way the sources were chosen and the way the data from these sources were handled is explained in detail, which adds greatly to the confidence one can have in the data. It does not contradict earlier science, it merely follows through and expands on it. What Kuznet, Keynes and Friedman did with limited data over only a few years, they have extended to a wealth of data going back, in some cases thousands of years, and in all cases , with more depth, up untill the time of publication of the book.One can read it as a long series of mythbusters. For example , expanding the Kuznet curve over a longer time period certainly gave a new view to the development of equality. Kuznet showed that during a short period of time, equality increased. This was a well measured fact. However, when the same method was extended over a longer period it was shown to be be an anomaly. Ienequality largely increases outside of such anomalies.One can also read it as a history book. How many today remember that from the thirties into the eightees, a time of considerable growth in the US, that country also had some of the highest taxes in the world?One can also read it, especially the chapters in part four as a blueprint for how to save the countries in the Euro zone from collapsing. He has a lot to say on this. He suggests a number of things to do to increase transparency in countries and banks, since the opaqueness of these is one of the major difficulties that has lead the politicians into darkness , and prevented them from knowing what to expect and what to do.To date it is perhaps the best book in Economics and Economic history that I have read, and I have had the opportunity to read quite a few ones over the last half century."
47,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1537840-brian,4,"I won't pretend to have understood this book in its entirety, and I had to skim over large sections of the dense data analysis, but I do appreciate the thorough presentation of Piketty's argument concerning the direction capitalism has been heading in this century, and his suggestions for solutions to the problem of income inequality. He does a convincing job of explaining why the unregulated, ""free"" market (the ultimate oxymoron) approach and the ""trickle down"" theory of economics does not work. He brings a much needed moral dimension to the study of economics, and does so in a fashion that does not rely on a particular political ideology (and, although I'd be fine with him declaring one, he'll probably reach a wider audience without it). His basic analysis of the problem of income inequality hinges on the following: ""…private rate of return on capital, r, can be significantly higher for long periods of time than the rate of growth of income and output, g. … Growth can be encouraged by investing in education, knowledge, and nonpolluting technologies. But none of these will raise the growth rate to 4 or 5 percent a year (the average rate of return on capital)…. there is ample reason to believe that the growth rate will not exceed 1-1.5 percent in the long run, no matter what economic policies are adopted…. The right solution is a progressive annual tax on capital."" Piketty concludes with: ""When one studies the twentieth century… a quick glance at the curves describing income and wealth inequality or the capital/income ratio is enough to show that politics is ubiquitous and that economic and political changes are inextricably intertwined and must be studied together. …all citizens should take a serious interest in money, its measurement, the facts surrounding it, and its history. Those who have a lot of it never fail to defend their interests. Refusing to deal with numbers rarely serves the interests of the least well-off."""
48,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1432709-julie,3,"People who read this book tend to either love it (5 stars) or feel like it is Marxism revisited and totally bash this book. I'm in the middle on this one. I love that this book has gotten so much attention and has had a meteoric rise to the bestseller list. And even more, I love the conversations everyone is having about this book. But I have a few criticisms. First, the book is incredibly disorganized. I slogged through the entire book, in both audio and print, and I found it difficult to follow. First he will introduce a concept like the inequality of return on investment for the wealthy and the not-so-wealthy. And then he jumps to something totally off topic. Simple, easy to follow points, would much better serve his cause. But my biggest complaint is that I don't know if I completely agree with his solution. Yes, I definitely think that the wealth divide, and especially it's rapid growth is a serious problem. But, we need to look at the reasons behind the problem. Just saying that we should put a tax on capital will reduce the wealth at the top, but I think there are bigger issues on why not everyone has the same opportunity to become wealthy. Although Piketty does touch on issues like the cost of college education and healthcare, maybe the solution shouldn't just be to have a heavy tax on the wealthy, but how the money could be used to help give the people at the bottom of the economic pile a boost up. Free child care, better education, health care - the issues are much bigger than just taxing the wealthy. Another complaint about this book, is it feels like a rant against the wealthy. To bash people like Bill Gates does not promote his cause. But, very glad about the conversations that this has started."
49,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,"This book concerns a hunch that I've had since the 1990s that the 30 years at the end of world war II was a great economic period of high growth, a strong middle class and rising expectations due to heavy taxation and government intervention to hold back the steady concentration of wealth that capitalism tends to push economies towards. The mid twentieth century was an age sometimes referred by economists as the Great Compression. The rich were not as relatively rich or the poor so relatively poor as they were before or would be after. Picketty lays out the history of capitalism tendency to concentrate wealth and how it was reversed through political interventions during the global emergencies of the two world wars. During the long relative peace of the second half of the twentieth centuries capital was able to undue some of these interventions in western economies as neoliberal policies were enacted during the stagflation of the 1970s. Wealth has since begun its natural tendency to concentrate yet again. Picketty goes on a long exposition of this process and the relation between Capital and income in this long book. He also sees higher rates of progressive taxation as a remedy but only if enacted in a global concert between nations. Capital flight is one reason for the political pressure to enact low taxation and neoliberal policies in the first place. Picketty lays out an economic program to counteract the undesirable effects of inequality and wealth concentration but getting the hands of the public onto the levers of power to enact these recommendations is a tall order. Great diagnosis of the problem with a handy antidote if we can get it done in politics."
50,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25058417-jim-fix,5,"This is a superb study, entirely understandable by someone outside the field. I know, I'm someone outside the field. The book provides a thorough presentation of painfully-gathered economic data for long periods throughout the world. The book will become a classic, and I expect it to someday help the author win a Nobel prize. The book is not a treatise; it is a scientific analysis of data. The author is entirely open to any re-analysis, or to all efforts to amass new data that might lead to alternate conclusions.Before ordering the book, I read the Goodreads reviews. There were a few one-stars at that time; so many of them urged not to read the book because the author ""is a Communist."" There's an ad hominem argument for you--don't assess the content. Instead, call the author a name. Anyone who reads even the first three chapters will find how disparaging the author can be about Communist theory. Then, there is this in the final chapter: ""All of our conclusions are . . .tenuous and deserve to be questioned and debated. It is not the purpose of social science research to produce mathematical certainties that can substitute for open, democratic debate in which all shades of opinion are represented."" (p. 571)"
51,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8525332-andrew,5,"I vacillated between four and five stars, but it was always going to be five. Thomas Piketty's writing is above average for an academic, but not always spellbinding. Which it should be because he has important things to say.This is a seminal book. I do not call it a seminal economic book, because it is about history, and politics, and society, and economics. So it is simply a seminal book. The data series Piketty collects are staggering. they are monumental. Any academic will tell you it's all about sources. And Capital is without peer in this regard. Then, slowly, carefully, patiently, Piketty takes your hand and walks you through his thicket of numbers and graphs and ideas. Every argument is anticipated. Every hypothetical explored. And in the end?Over the long run, and we're talking centuries here, capital is an insidiously powerful force. Wars and disaster shock its system, but capital always wins out in the end. Inequality grows and so, in a democracy, regulation is needed. And despite criticisms levelled at him for his policy conclusions, Piketty proposes sensible, data-based restrictions on runaway capital, all while acknowledging the political impossibility of his suggestions.And always remember, r > g."

The book has a revolutionary perception which is completely justified as the author has presented an alternate view of the science of economics. And in doing so he must be classified as a Whistle Blower. He even challenges economics as a science and wants it branded as as a social subject instead. The analysis is pretty bleak, basically wealth breeds more wealth in a Capitalist system which can only be challenged by governments enforcing radical controls which the author believes it cannot. I loved the way comparisons were routinely made with the revolutionary Europe of the 19th century. The accumulated wealth in the early 20th century was blasted in the Great Wars which heralded a new phase of merit based wealth which in the author's opinion is hogwash. Real wealth is inherited which unfortunately has a very bad reputation although it is still prevalent in our society. The author is spot on as developing countries still value inheritance as very privileged luxury indeed. This book is long but an extremely read in the current climate."
53,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2692551-steve-hart,5,"Refreshing to have a relatively comprehensive, data-driven analysis of economics over a significant period of time that can inform the discussion and counter people's gut-feeling, tribal talking-point driven water-cooler discussions (""derp, we'll deal with it by just printing more money! ... doesn't matter cause china is gonna own us all soon anyways! ... seems to me we should just be putting our money in gold""). Not that I really think it will help. In any case, it seems like there might be some debate over the assumptions on how the data sets are constructed---and thus the conclusions that seem apparent---but seemingly less important then the initial Financial Times disagreement. Sad to say that the only real (constructive) criticism seems to be coming from the left, while the cranks on the right are just dismissing it outright cause it has the same name as another book they don't like. Hope to see more long-form analyses of the sort, and patiently await vols 2 and 3 (edited by Picketty or whomever)."

I agree with this GR review:Piketty believes in democracy, and that's beautiful, but he also believes we can salvage some ethical version of capitalism from the current neoliberal wreckage. Capitalism and democracy are mutually exclusive. We will never be able to institute the kind of global tax on capital that he proposes here, for the very fact that those who own the most capital have too much power.I recommend reading the Verso book Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty First Century: An Introduction to get a better sense of the context of this book, as well as the criticism it's received since its publication."

58,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7264087-scott,5,"The right-wingers have come out in force to denounce this book as Marxism, which could not be further from the truth. When Piketty mentions Marx, he almost invariably mentions the shortcomings of Marx's research, such as Marx having drawn generalizations from the books of one factory (anecdotal evidence) rather than a dozen factories (229), and that he ""missed entirely the work on national accounting that was developing around him"" (230). His aim is hardly Marxist. It is simply demonstrating that since the eighteenth century, Edmund Phelps's ""golden rule"" of r=g (r being the return on capital and g being growth of national income) is at all periods of history false, and that the ratio that reflects all of human history is r>g, which unchecked, causes a widening gap between rich and poor, which, at their greatest peaks, 1929 and 2007, caused the biggest global economic crashes in history (297). The fact that he acknowledges the time an investor spends on his investments as work (205) does not sound at all like a Marxist position to me. Indeed, he is not even a Keynesian leftist, calling Keynes's claims of the stability of the capital-labor split ""hasty to say the least, since Keynes was essentially relying on data from British manufacturing industry in the 1920s, which were insufficient to establish a universal regularity"" (220).His primary solution for democratizing the gap is an end to tax havens through a global progressive tax on wealth to replace property taxes. Seeing globalization, an enemy of true progressives, as inevitable, he sees this admittedly Utopian solution as the only one that will completely alleviate the problem, following his discussion with the shortcomings of such solutions as protectionism and inflation. He amusingly sums up the problem as Earth owing a debt to Mars, because global debt is higher than known global wealth as a result of these tax havens. He proposes that it be begun in Europe, and then expanded. This would tax the wealthy in a fairer manner, eliminate public debt, which is far exceeded by private wealth, and generally make the playing field better. He gives a wide range as to go about doing this, because it needs to be done in a democratic fashion, rather than the in the non-representative republican fashion we have in the United States. He notes that wealth taxes have previously failed historically as a direct result of excessive exemptions and tax havens. It all comes down to morals. ""It is not right for individuals to grow wealth from free trade and economic integration only to rake off the profits at the expense of their neighbors. That is outright theft"" (522).The book is not at all arid (to use Goldhammer's word, at least). He draws heavily on comparing literary and cinematic sources to history, in particular the works of Jane Austen and Honoré de Balzac, but also Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained and Wolfgang Reitherman's The Aristocats, to name a few cinematic examples of art reflecting life in a particular period of history. 
Père Goriot
 and 
Sense and Sensibility
 are his primary go-tos for artistic representations of economic issues.One section of the book that is particularly impactful for me is his exploration of the delusion of meritocracy. As someone who was raised middle class, with my first four years of higher education paid for by a mutual fund that my grandmother started for me when I was small, to earning a bachelor's degree with a double major in 1999, to earning a master's degree in 2005, to becoming a resident of the New York City homeless shelter system in 2012 due primarily to lack of interviews for jobs at a livable wage. Piketty disagrees with the point of view that economic growth shows the true talents of individuals in society. ""The plain fact is that this argument is often used to justify extreme inequalities and to defend the privileges of the winners without much consideration for the losers, much less for the facts, and without any real effort to verify whether this very convenient principle can actually explain the changes we observe"" (85). Barbara Ehrenreich titled one of her chapters in 
Bait and Switch: The (Futile) Pursuit of the American Dream
 ""Downward Mobility,"" and this seems to be a universal truth for the majority in our time. Piketty goes into this reality on page 229-30. ""[I]n the US case, government data allow us to measure the evolution of wage inequality with mobility taken into account: we can compute average wages at the individual level over long periods of time... And what we find is that the increase in wage inequality is identical in all cases, no matter what reference period we use. In other words, workers at McDonald's in in Detroit's auto plants do not spend a year of their lives as top managers in US firms, any more than professors at the University of Chicago or middle managers from California do. One may have felt this intuitively, but it is always better to measure systematically wherever possible."" He also goes into what I know from experience to be true: that education does not explain the wealth gap at all. The increase in the numbers of people with higher education has had ""limited impact on the explosion of topmost incomes in the United States since 1980"" (315). He notes that Raghuram G. Rajan's 
Fault Lines: How Hidden Fractures Still Threaten the World Economy
 is incorrect in stating that college has increased income inequality more than the explosion of the 1%. ""The reason for this is probably that the data normally used by labor and education economists do not give the full measure of the overperformance of the top centile (one needs tax data to see what is happening)"" (609). Throughout, he notes that little empirical analysis has been done to analyze incomes above the 90th centile.The fact that income inequality in the United States in 2000-2010 attained a level higher than that observed in the poor and emerging countries at various times in the past--for example, higher than India or South Africa in 1920-1930, 1960-1970, and 2000-2010--also casts doubt on any explanation based solely on objective inequalities of productivity. Is it really the case that inequality of individual skills and productivities is greater in the United States today than in the half-illiterate India of the recent past (or even today) or in apartheid (or postapartheid) South Africa? If that were the case, it would be bad news for US educational institutions, which surely need to be improved and made more accessible but probably do not deserve such extravagant blame (330). On page 332, he correctly notes that the ""invisible hand"" of Adam Smith is a myth, as is ""pure and perfect"" competition, but identifies that top executives very often have their ""hand in the till"" by setting their own salaries or having it set by a committee of others with like pay. He considers this terminology excessive but closer to the truth than those other expressions. He goes on to note research by Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullianathan,  Lucian Bebchuk and Jesse Fried (335), and by himself, Emmanuel Saez, and Stefanie Stantcheva indicating that top executives are paid primarily for luck (512): ""In practice, the return on capital does not depend solely on the talent and effort supplied by the capitalist."" It's both disheartening and reassuring to know that research backs up what we have intuitively known: that hard work and effort more often than not go unrewarded, while luck runs away with the bulk of the spoils, trouncing those with true talent.That inequality is very unstable is denied by ""Pareto's law."" Vilfredo Pareto was a fascist who ""hailed Mussolini's accession to power...clearly had no evidence to support his theory of stability...above all wary of socialists and what he took to be their redistributive illusions,"" and his information showed ""a slight trend toward higher inequality, which Pareto intentionally sought to hide"" (367). Any right-wing use of said ""law"" is clearly dishonest and full of fascist bias.I'm not sure that this statement is true: ""In North America, there is no nostalgia for the postwar period, quite simply because the Trente Glorieuses never existed there: per capita output grew at roughly the same rate of 1.5-2 percent per year throughout the period 1820-2012"" (97). Assuming the last part is true, it seems like there is heavy nostalgia for the 1950s and early 1960s, particularly on the right of the spectrum. He later notes liberal Paul Krugman's nostalgia for this period. In Capitalism: A Love Story, Michael Moore noted that top marginal tax rates in the ""good old days"" were above 90%. Piketty notes that ""[T]he reduction of top marginal income tax rates and the rise of top incomes do not seem to have stimulated productivity (contrary to supply-side theory) or at any rate did not stimulate productivity enough to statistically detectable at the macro level"" because per capita GDP in the United States and Britain have not grown faster than in Germany, France, Japan, Denmark, or Sweden, where top executive salaries have not taken off at the rate they have in the US and UK (510).Most people who are below the middle class pay rent (unless they can't afford rent and end up in the shelter system). On pp. 422-4, he details the way the term ""rent"" acquired a pejorative meaning, and not in the way I expected, which would be to stigmatize those who pay rent rather than own their homes. He describes rent as ""the enemy of modern rationality."" ""There is something astonishing about the notion that capital yields rent, or income that the owner of capital obtains without working. There is something in this notion that is an affront to common sense and that has, in fact, perturbed any number of civilizations..."" Linda Tirado in 
Hand to Mouth: Living in Bootstrap America
 excoriates those who oppose a tax on capital gains on the grounds that it has previously been taxed--so has payroll tax and unemployment insurance, but ""fiscal conservatives"" are never heard calling for a repeal of those taxes. As Piketty says, ""Is it useful and just for the owners of capital to receive this marginal product as a payment for their ownership of property (whether their own past work or that of their ancestors) even if they contribute no new work? This is a crucial question, but not the one I am asking here"" (215). Says Piketty, ""I should also point out that these international positions are in substantial part the result of fictitious financial flows associated not with the needs of the real economy but rather with tax optimization strategies and regulatory arbitrage (using screen corporations set up with countries where the tax structure and/or regulatory environment is particularly attractive)"" (194). Piketty describes life in the era of Jane Austen, who was herself a victim of primogeniture laws whose repeal eliminated some inequality, how the lack of refrigeration and heating and so forth made it such that only a small number of wealthy people (100,000 or so in Britain) could sustain the culture, and that this is the reason the inequalities were accepted, but the sense of entitlement among the wealthy that they externalize onto the educated poor he believes to have been largely absent and recognized for the arbitrariness and anti-meritocratic system that it was. It does seem laughable when he discusses ""the latest tablet"" as a ""legitimate need"" for wealthy people today (482). (I was given a tablet recently, and it's so slow and hard to type on that it's largely a toy, although I can see my e-mail if I've timed off the library computers for the day and am still in the building.) While inheritances were largely lost in the two world wars, he argued, inherited wealth is returning to the position it had in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The fact that the average Harvard student is in the richest 2% is one example he cites that reflects this. Private wealth causes public harm. ""In all the rich countries, public dissaving and the consequent decrease in public wealth accounted for a significant portion of the increase in private wealth (between one-tenth and one-quarter, depending on the country). This was not the primary reason for the increase in private wealth, but should not be neglected"" (185).These meritocratic myths perpetuate in the health care crisis, which Piketty touches on: ""[I]f a private health insurance system costs more than a public system but does not yield truly superior (as comparison of the United States with Europe suggests), then GDP will be artificially overvalued in companies that rely mainly on private insurance"" (92). The reasoning seems to be that those with money have earned the right to better health care. Towards the end of the book, he also touches on climate change. He covers welfare briefly on 478-9, and comments on the ire its recipients also receive, in spite of it taking up less than 1% of national income (I myself get about $500 a year in government welfare (about $0.0000001 per taxpayer), Wal-Mart gets $9 billion a year in government subsidies (about $27 per taxpayer), but the right-wingers choose to complain about me and not Wal-Mart), preferring that I take a menial job that my doctors say I shouldn't be doing and that cannot be lived on. It's not as though the wealthy are, as Mitt Romney put it, ""job creators."" ""[I]f the number of workers is one too many for the available capital stock, the extra worker cannot be put to use in any productive way"" (217). The Bureau of Labor Statistics is still showing that there are currently 2.5 job seekers for every available job, about 4 million job openings and 9 million job seekers. One right-wing friend said that private charity eliminates the need for public welfare. He needs to see Josiah Wedgwood's 
The Economics of Inheritance
. ""He showed that charitable giving was of little consequence. His analysis led him to the conclusion that only a tax could achieve the equilibrium desired"" (638). ""Real democracy and social justice,"" Piketty states, ""require specific institutions of their own, not just those of the market, and not just parliaments and other formal democratic institutions"" (424).""In terms of the theoretical model, as well as in the historical data, an increase in the tax on capital income from 0 to 30 percent (reducing the net return on capital from 5 to 35 percent) may well leave the total stock of capital unchanged over the log run for the simple reason that the decrease in the upper centile's share of the wealth is compensated by the rise of the middle class. This is precisely what happened in the twentieth century--although the lesson is sometimes forgotten today"" (374). This is why it angers me so much that the non-rich vote in conservative politicians that support legislation that has the effect of eroding the middle class, which The New York Times reports is steadily happening. The Republicans won the 2014 midterm elections because people enjoy being lied to by Fox News, and are coached to support policies that are to their detriment. When you don't properly tax the rich, the middle class falls into poverty. In his conclusion, he says that ultimately all of the social sciences, not just the economists, need to deal with these issues because they revolve around concepts of good and evil (he puts it that bluntly) that all citizens understand. He also encourages people not to be intimidated when numbers, which were never my strong suit (and some say this is good reason for me to be homeless, while I know plenty of people who are not great with numbers who have good jobs), become involved. Piketty establishes in his introduction that he is striving for narrative, but it is mostly one of group characters and an occasional politician or economist, or characters from literary classics (hence I didn't add a character list as I typically do on Goodreads), such that the concepts, and formulae when he includes them, are accessible to the general reader (and he goes over them enough that the concepts eventually get easy to follow).As a professional proofreader (or former one, if you think the skill and identity goes when the position does), I did notice many typos of the sort a spell checker cannot possibly find, such as a then/than gaffe at the top of page 564, although I failed to make a written note of most of them. The book also uses ""wealth countries"" and ""wealthy countries"" seemingly interchangeably. The former seems to connote a definitive characteristic of said country, while the latter seems to be establishing the characteristic we are discussing, without implication of overall intrinsic importance of the characteristic versus that characteristic's salience to the discussion. Since the Paris School of Economics presumably has no history department, Piketty's repeated references to a fictitious ""year zero"" can be forgiven... sort of.""[T]he force for divergence at the top of the wealth hierarchy would win out over the global forces of catch-up and convergence, so that the shares of the top decile and centile would increase significantly with a large upward redistribution from the middle and upper-middle classes to the very rich. Such an impoverishment of the middle class would very likely trigger a violent political reaction... only a progressive tax on capital can effectively impede such a dynamic"" (439). One can only hope one of these two possibilities comes soon, and preferably the non-violent one. "
59,067443000X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7896718-patrick,5,"Of taxes and capital, of billionaires and povertyA review of Capital in the Twenty-First Century by Thomas PikettyJDN 2456946 EDT 13:15.I finished the book several days ago, but I wanted to give it a really thorough review because it is such an important book—and so closely linked to the kind of thing I do research on. I will abbreviate its name as Capital henceforth, which is also a nod to Marx's Das Kapital. Many have accused Piketty of being Marxist, but actually most of what he says would draw agreement from Adam Smith. Competitive markets, transparent regulations, progressive taxes. The economic system Piketty wants is not the 1930s Soviet Union; it is the 1950s United States.	Indeed, one of his central points is that the period from about 1945 to 1965 was the time of lowest inequality, most progressive taxes, and highest economic growth in any developed nation in history. Growth in Europe was especially rapid due to the catch-up after WW2, but even in the US growth was substantially higher then than it is now. It was the Golden Age of Capitalism, and we could go back there with just a few simple changes.	And this is important to keep in mind as you read Capital and its many reviews and responses; Republicans and the likes of Forbes would have you believe that Piketty is some kind of far-left totalitarian Communist, but the truth is quite the opposite: Piketty is a moderate center-left economist, and the only reason he seems so far from mainstream is that our ""mainstream"" has veered astonishingly far to the right. 	We live in a nation that has privatized prisons and soldiers. If there are any functions of government more basic than these, I can't think of them; the whole point of having a government is that it handles your law enforcement and military defense—it monopolizes violence to reduce violence. In fact, when we say we've ""privatized"" them, that doesn't even make sense; a privatized service is one in which revenue is earned from customers subject to market forces. If you're paying with tax revenue, you can't privatize it, no matter how far you remove it from accountability or how many rich old White men you put in charge of it. In real economic terms, the US Postal Service—which makes all its revenue from customers, not taxes—is privatized; and no prison or military could ever be. All you can do by ""privatizing"" it is make it less efficient, less accountable, more corrupt. Again, I remind you: this is something that Adam Smith and Milton Friedman would agree with; there is nothing socialist about government control of military and law enforcement (or if there is, then there is nothing wrong with socialism).	Privatization does make sense in some cases; and indeed when I wrote a development paper on Venezuela, one of the core themes was that Venezuela urgently needs to privatize most of its industries. When you are making a physical product that is bought by customers, privatization is only sensible; that's the situation for which free-market capitalism was expressly designed, and it is the situation in which it shines. Obvious on the other side are forms of violence, like law enforcement and military; those must necessarily remain under government control. The only debate we should be having is about the intermediate cases, the service industries: banking, insurance, healthcare, software development. Since there is no physical product to be bought and sold, the standard rules of capitalism don't quite work; this is especially obvious in the case of software development, in which a single ""product"" is actually a piece of information—really, a gigantic integer—that can be copied, modified, and redistributed indefinitely. I tend to favor more nationalization of these intermediate cases, as does Piketty; that is what makes us center-left. Favoring more privatization is a reasonable view to be argued, and that would be center-right. 	Indeed, there are features of Piketty's Capital that may annoy some on the far-left, the most extreme Occupy Wall Street folk who demand a total dismantling of capitalism. Piketty is not anti-free-market; on the contrary, many of his complaints are about ways in which our free market is distorted by a taxation and regulatory system that favors the rich and powerful. One of the most worrisome is the way that the return on capital in our system actually increases with the amount of capital you have, which is inherently unstable. It's supposed to be constant or decreasing; under this sort of increasing returns, once someone is richer they will continue to get richer by an ever-growing fraction until they own the whole economy or (more realistically) the system falls apart.	This is why the central equation of the book (which has been made into a t-shirt) is r > g, the return on capital is greater than the growth rate of the economy. As long as this is true, capitalism will not be stable; the owners of capital will capture an ever-growing portion of the economy. 	Actually even this wouldn't necessarily be bad, if capital endowments were evenly and fairly distributed. A prolonged period of r > g could in fact be a world in which manual labor is made obsolete by automation—and to some extent this is actually true. The problem is that our endowments of labor are relatively equal (some are smarter or stronger than others, but never by a factor larger than 10), while our endowments of capital are wildly unequal (some people literally own 1,000,000 times as much as other people!). As Piketty discusses in detail, much of this inequality is perpetuated through inheritance, in a system Piketty calls ""patrimonial capitalism"". Personally I think this term is too soft; a system in which the rich and powerful today are the heirs of the rich and powerful yesterday isn't capitalism at all, it's feudalism. We speak as if the left is ""socialism"" and the right is ""capitalism"", but in fact we've gone so far right that it's more like the left is capitalism and the right is feudalism.	If these capital endowments could be somehow equalized, the fact that r > g would be no cause for concern; and Piketty has a recommendation for how we might do this. He recommends a high progressive tax on capital directly; not on returns to capital, which are easily disguised by clever accounting, but on capital itself. And lest you fear he'll raise your property taxes, actually he intends to lower them; he wants the tax to be on net capital, so if you have a house worth $200,000 with a mortgage balance of $150,000, he would tax the $50k you have, not the $200k you'd have if the house were paid off. If you were underwater, your property tax would drop to zero under Piketty's system. Moreover, the very high rates he envisions would only apply to very large incomes; I think his example is about 5% above $1 million and 10% above $10 million. That's quite high for a property tax; keep in mind that return on capital is usually in the realm of 7%, so if you are taxed 5% on capital stock that would be 71% of your capital income. Taxed at 10%, you may actually pay out more than you take in; but this is exactly the point, because Piketty does not think anyone deserves to maintain stocks of capital in the hundreds of millions or billions. 	And I must say... I'm inclined to agree. The only people I can think of whose contributions to the world were large enough that I would say they might deserve $1 billion were not billionaires; and contrapositively all the billionaires I know of are not people who made anywhere near that kind of contribution. Perhaps if our billionaires were Jonas Salk and Alan Turing instead of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs I would find the distribution more justified. Don't get me wrong, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs contributed a great deal, and I think it is entirely fair that they be millionaires; but billionaires is something else entirely.	This failure to distinguish millionaires—the merely rich—from billionaires—the mind-bogglingly wealthy plutocrats—is something that grates me, a symptom of our national innumeracy that goes all the way to the top. Obama will say things like ""millionaires and billionaires should pay their fair share""; if you don't see what's wrong with that, that's part of the problem. It would be like saying, ""starving people and millionaires should pay their fair share""; while I suppose this is true, the fair share starving people should pay is probably zero if not negative. Don't believe me? Well, the UN extreme poverty level is an annual income of $450 per year; anybody below that, it's fair to say, is starving. A millionaire making 7% would have an annual income of $70,000 per year. Meanwhile, a billionaire making 7% has an annual income of $70,000,000 per year. The ratio between the starving child in Africa and the millionaire is 156:1. The ratio between the billionaire and the millionaire is 1000:1. To be fair, we still call someone like Mitt Romney a ""millionaire"" (or the awkward term ""multi-millionaire"") if their net wealth is say $200 million, which is closer to the billionaire range. I think we should probably try to speak in terms of logarithms: A starving child lives on three figures (10^2), a sweatshop worker makes four figures (10^3), a middle-class American makes five figures (10^4), a doctor makes six figures (10^5), the inventor of Photoshop makes seven figures (10^6), Mitt Romney takes in eight figures (10^7), anyone in the Forbes 500 receives nine figures (10^8), and Bill Gates receives ten figures (10^9). So far, nobody takes in eleven figures, but the very richest billionaires are getting close.	Piketty of course would never make such an error; indeed he meticulously distinguishes different levels and sources of wealth, and catalogues them all for over two centuries of history across the US and Europe. The book is absolutely a tour de force, and it is remarkable that a 700-page tome full of numbers and graphs has nonetheless managed to achieve bestseller status. At the very least, Piketty struck a nerve; and I think more than that, he finally gave people the rigorous economic analysis to prove what they had suspected all along. 	One of the choices Piketty makes that I found oddest is his tendency to focus on the ratio of capital stock to income. I think he did this because it's easy to get good data on it—which is vital for the sort of large-scale long-term historical analysis he wanted to do. This always felt to me like not quite getting at the issue we really wanted to get at, sort of like how real GDP doesn't capture the true prosperity of a society because it leaves out things like volunteer work, leisure time, psychological stress, and environmental impact. If the capital to income ratio is say 8 years, what does that mean exactly? Well, it means that it would take 8 years of the whole economy's income to equal the amount of capital. If all income went to capital (no labor income at all, thankfully not a situation we've ever been in), this would necessarily mean that the return on capital is 1/8, i.e. 12.5%. That's pretty high; if we assume instead the 7% ballpark I mentioned earlier, this would mean that 56% of the economy's income is going to capital, which would still be horrible (this is about the state of the antebellum South if you count slaves as ""capital"" because their income goes to their owners). 	In the US today, about a third of our income is due to capital, which at 7% means our capital to income ratio is about 5 years. (And indeed it is; Piketty has some very nice graphs of this over time. The extremes: the US ratio has gotten as low as 3 years in 1940, while the Europe ratio was as high as 7 years in 1880.) I've heard many an economist declare that the 2/3 labor and 1/3 capital mix is some sort of fundamental law of capitalism, but Piketty demolishes that notion completely; the proportion of income that has gone to capital has varied from as low as 20% to as high as 50%. This ""law"" is in fact the contingent result of 20th century geopolitical events and government policies. Those same economists often try to make excuses for why the proportion of the economy going to wages has been falling since about 1970 (it's always Reagan, curse his name); usually their excuse involves ""labor costs"" that include all sorts of benefits, but think about that for a minute: Where do benefit payments go? Not to the worker, that's for sure; they go to hospitals or insurance companies. And if you think that workers get that value back in the form of healthcare, think again: The US spends twice as much on healthcare as France and our life expectancy is shorter. 	So as you can see, the capital to income ratio does tell you something about the distribution of income in society, but in a very indirect way. Theoretically one could have a very high capital to income ratio and still have most income go to labor, so long as the return on capital were low enough; in practice the capital to income ratio varies much more than the return on capital does. 	Piketty wants to tax all this capital away, and that's the part that makes the right wing red with rage. He has no qualms about saying that the taxes are confiscatory; he explicitly wants to redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor. It's rather refreshing, really; where so many liberals dance around the issue, Piketty just comes out and says that he thinks our distribution of wealth is unfair and needs to be changed. 	I actually think the tax rates he recommends may be too high; taking above about 70% of income (which a 5% capital tax might, and a 10% capital tax definitely does) actually puts you on the wrong side of the Laffer Curve and reduces your government revenue. The right wing tries to pull out the Laffer Effect when talking about hikes from 20% to 30%, which is absolutely ludicrous; but when it comes to hikes from 30% to 80% it's actually a very reasonable concern. That's the thing about economics; it's quantitative. Everything is a matter of degree.	Then again, these very high rates would directly reduce the inequality of wealth, and in particular pull some of the wealth from the very top of the distribution where a handful of billionaires own as much as entire nations. There definitely is something wrong with that state of affairs, and the Laffer argument also doesn't seem all that compelling either. 	For those who think that say a 90% tax on all income above $10 million would damage the economy, I offer a challenge: Name me a profession that satisfies all three of the following constraints. 1. The work produces some real benefit to the world. This doesn't have to be a physical product, or even anything particularly important; it just needs to be some real good or service that is beneficial to someone. Feel free to include art, music, research, software development, even insurance. 2. The income received by an individual worker can be in excess of $10 million per year. 3. If their income were significantly reduced, the worker would substantially reduce the amount of work they do. 	I can think of jobs that satisfy any two, but never all three; and all three is what you'd need to justify the Laffer argument. Software developers satisfy 1 and 2, but free software proves they don't satisfy 3; likewise for professional athletes, actors, and musicians, because the vast majority of people in sports, acting and music make very little money at it, and just do it because they love doing it. Most jobs—take your pick, from coal miners to physicists—satisfy 1 and 3, but get nowhere near 2. And there are jobs like hedge fund managers and derivatives traders that satisfy 2 and 3, but I think you'd be hard-pressed to say they satisfy 1. 	If I am indeed right that there are no such jobs, or only a handful of them that aren't particularly important, then here is what mathematically must happen under such a tax: Money that previously went to these rich workers now goes somewhere else (either the government or the rest of the economy, depending on how exactly things shake out), and the total amount of real goods and services in the economy does not change. The pie remains the same size, and they get a smaller piece of it; therefore the rest of us get a bigger piece. The Laffer Effect only happens if the pie gets smaller, and with a cutoff of $10 million I just don't see that happening. Make the cutoff $100,000 and it would; call that 2B: An individual worker can receive more than $100,000 per year. Now there are jobs that satisfy all three of 1, 2B, and 3; for instance, neurosurgeons, university professors, engineers. But at $10 million? I just don't see it.	How much money would such a tax put back into the economy? It's estimated that the super-rich take about 20% of our nation's income, so that 90% tax would be like an 18% increase in GDP, or about $2.7 trillion. Yes, trillion with a T, yes, 10^12 USD, yes, enough to cover basically the entire federal budget on its own. We could eliminate taxes entirely for 99.9% of the population and still have a smaller deficit than we do now. That is how insanely unequal our income distribution has become.	Hm... maybe this Piketty fellow is onto something after all?"
