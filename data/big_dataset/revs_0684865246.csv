0,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"I’ve done what I never do – before starting this review I’ve read some of the other reviews on this site. I’m quite surprised at the negative reviews this book has received. Someone has even complained that this is quite an ‘anti-Christian’ book. I guess this is because the author was clearly less than impressed with the ‘Dark Ages’ which he introduces by discussing Hypatia. So, yes, I can understand why that might annoy a Christian. But this would be like a Marxist complaining when people mention Czechoslovakia in 1968 or Stalin’s purges. Complaining that people point at the bones in the cupboard hardly makes those bones disappear.Another says that it is an odd book because it is a book on geometry and yet it has virtually no diagrams. Again, I can see why this would seem odd, but I thought the writing was so clear and so engaging that the somewhat surprising lack of diagrams hardly seemed to matter.Others complained about the humour – and yes, I can also understand this. But compared to the ‘humour’ I’ve read in other pop-science books, this guy is Douglas Adams. I mean, The God Particle If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is the Question? was considered a funny book according to the blurb… God, save us…I’m going to tell you why I really liked this book.The thing that I liked most about it was that it started by saying that many people really have negative memories of high school geometry and the author thinks that this is a real pity. His point in writing the book is to explain why geometry is interesting and what is its place in science and mathematics. This is why the criticism about the lack of diagrams somewhat misses the point – this book isn’t really seeking to teach geometry, but to inspire readers to go back and learn more about geometry themselves.Basically, this is not only a history of geometry, but also a history of our understanding of space itself. It starts in the ancient world with Egyptians and Babylonians marking out the ground, building pyramids and calculating approximations for Pi. It ends with a discussion of string theory and the possible multi-dimensional space that is predicted in that. He takes us on this grand tour in a light-hearted and easy to follow narrative. You literally do not need to even remember any of your high school geometry to enjoy this book. It fits into that class of books, like The Pearly Gates of Cyberspace A History of Space from Dante to the Internet or Fermat's Enigma The Epic Quest to Solve the World's Greatest Mathematical Problem that take quite difficult scientific and mathematical ideas and presents them in a way a general audience will understand.This also did something else I love – it gave lots of background to the lives of many of the scientists and mathematicians mentioned. I thought this was a wonderful introduction to the history of the development of geometry and one that provided simple to understand summaries of the main ‘questions’ in the development of geometry. Here is a guy who understands that science progresses with questions, rather than answers. For instance, the discussion of the question of whether there is a law of parallel lines and if so is it possible to state this law in a way that is not circular – was simply phrased and the many ‘attempts’ to solve this problem given in the history of the subject was done with both humour and intelligence.This book is worthwhile just for the information on the lives of Gauss and Riemann. Parts of this book, particularly the chapter on Gauss’ life, would almost make you weep. There is a beautiful and beautifully simple explanation of non-Euclidian geometry and why these ‘spaces’ became necessary – and also how Einstein used these ideas in his General Theory of Relativity.Naturally, the section on string theory is the hardest part of the book – I had hoped to be able to report that the author’s exceptional skills at presenting complex ideas in beautifully simple prose would extend to this most complex of ideas, but that was far too much to hope for.This was still a wonderful introduction to geometry and one that does more than make you think about triangles and such things – but that really helps non-specialists (and even those with virtually no knowledge of the subject at all) get an idea of just why having a means of describe space is so important not just in mathematics and science, but in philosophy as well.This book also has some lovely throwaway lines on science that I really enjoyed and which can’t be said too often. For example, at one point he says that Occam’s Razor (the idea that a theory should try to use as few ‘bits’ as it can get away with to explain what it is trying to explain) is referred to as science’s chief aesthetic principle – isn’t that lovely? The other thing I liked was at the end when he asked (in reference to String Theory) if science was about pointing a searchlight at the world to discover its ‘truths’ or if it was about building a tower with as many blocks as possible to see if it will stand or fall. The conclusion he seems to draw is that it is a bit of both.So, will you come away from this book being able to solve complex geometrical problems? Well, no. Will you come away from this book amused and with a much better understanding of the role played by geometry in the history and development of science? Absolutely. If you are after the first you might want to find another book, otherwise, this really is worth a read."
1,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4987219-holly,5,"Well, I loved this book (reading it as a layman who knows very little about geometry, physics and mathematics in general!)It broadened my horizons - I want to read books about physics now. I want to read about Feynman and Gauss and string theory. I loved how the author interwove other parts of history with the discoveries in geometry. I appreciated the way in which he explained complex mathematical concepts in an almost anecdotal style.I noticed how when describing theoretically what a physicist might notice or discover at different times he switched between sayng 'he' and 'she'.The last few chapters on string theory lost me almost completely and blew my mind. I swear, it's taken me 5 months to read this book on and off. I'd read for 10 seconds, then gaze off into space for 10 minutes thinking about what I'd just read.I can't comment on accuracies or anything like that, but I have a base understanding and enthusiasm to build on now. Who would ever have thought that a book on geometry could open up so many doors of thought and stimulation for someone once mostly indifferent to the ideas and studies within its pages?That's deserving of 5 stars from me."
2,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1717479-terry,2,"Euclid's Window is an unremarkable tour of a very specific line of reasoning that is neither refreshing nor fleshed out. The narrative is supposed to span the progress of ideas coming from the advent of space as a notion to modern multidimensional brane theory but the path drawn by the author is not clear.Writing - The writing itself is fine. The prose is concise, the jokes are acceptable, and the anecdotes are quaint. Definitions are usually good with periodic reminders.Organization - Strictly chronological. There is little tying back of concepts to their origin as well as indicating where an idea will go except for a rapid change back and forth regarding events at the turn of the previous century. It is not obvious why a given topic is include or why others excluded.Breadth - This is where the book falls flat. Whole tracts of geometry are excluded liked most of Islamic math, Vedic math, and large bits of contemporary geometry. Embedding, manifolds, and compacting are very briefly mentioned."
3,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1836077-lightreads,3,"History of math more than actualfacts math, with a minimally annoying authorial voice as these things go. Except for the teeny weeny culture/race centrism problem – I’m neither a historian nor a mathematician, but even I know it’s pretty freaking suspect when your history doesn’t include the advancements of, um, the Arab world, the South/Central American empires, or, you know, Asia, except for that one paragraph that one time. I mean, write a history of European geometry, by all means, I did like it, but let’s maybe call it that next time so as to look less like clueless Eurocentric twits, yeah?Anyway. Last third of the book swung into modern physics, and convinced me yet again that in the absence of advanced math, it really does sound like these guys are just making shit up. I mean, vibrating strings? Oh rilly. Shame I stopped at calculus, because no matter how many metaphors you throw at me, I still have a hard time taking this stuff seriously without the fundamental grocking I don’t have the tools for."
4,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive,5,"Firstly, a disclaimer: as the author was a writer for ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" (which I totally loved), I am naturally inclined to give a favourable review to whatever he writes :).Back to the book: basically, this book is a history of our understanding of the structure of space (dimensions, curvature etc., in other words its ""geometric"" properties) starting from the Ancients (usual culprits, Pythagoras and Euclid) up to the latest scientific developments.This book provides beautifully simple explanations of non-Euclidian geometries and how they have been used in Relativity and subsequent physical theories. His lucid and clear explanation of how the mass/energy distribution relates to the metric of four-dimensional space-time is really nice. The section on string theory is also a great pleasure to read, and equally explained in a very nice manner. His explanation of how in string theory the most basic properties of space (such as the number of dimensions) determine the laws of nature and the properties of matter/energy is outstanding.And his enthusiasm for science and understanding of the Universe is totally contagious (the short epilogue is beautiful), and I am very happy that I had the opportunity to read this book.The author's sense of humour is also quite good (but, being myself a bit of a nerd, I am probably not greatly qualified to judge other people's sense of humour), and this makes the reading of this book even more pleasurable.The only (small) sin of this book is in the naïve and outdated treatment of the so-called ""Dark Ages"" - here the author really should have received advice from a real historian.But, apart from this small sin, this book is an absolute pleasure to read. 5 stars.   "
5,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5193815-jerry,4,"Interesting discussion of history of geometry from the time of the ancient Greeks through geometry's role today in String Theory and M-Theory. It covers what it considers to be the major events of the history of geometry, starting with Euclid's organizing Greek knowledge of geometry into the Elements, Descartes bringing the coordinate system to geometry, Gauss and Riemann moving geometry beyond Euclidean space, Einstein with his theory of relativity, and finally Ed Witten and his contributions to String and M-Theory. I felt like the book might have been a little rushed at the end, but that is probably because String theory and M-theory are both still young and in the process of being developed."
6,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7258306-trever,4,"Book was great from the beginning with small stories that engage and keep you interested. When the book goes further on it takes too much time to describe Einstein and String Theory and moves too slowly. Half the book is the history of geometry, the other half is Einstein. It turned me off at the end."
7,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/832180-jeremy,1,"An extremely poor approach to the historical development of mathematics. The book is replete with historical inaccuracies and a clear anti-Christian bias throughout. Try Kline's ""Mathematics for the Nonmathematician"" instead."
8,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3971887-rebecca,3,"Mlodinow tackles what some people would think would be a dry topic and manages to infuse some wit into it. You can tell that he really loves his topic and wants the reader to as well. He explains the math and gives you examples to help you understand. And they are very helpful (although I must say that his examples using his sons start to get a little annoying after a while.) He explains the beginnings of geometry and how it progressed and reasons why it was, at times, held back due to politics and religion and other things (which puts a lot of history in the book that you normally wouldn’t think of as having anything to do with math.) It starts out with things I learned in school, like the Pythagorean Theorem and coordinates on a x/y graph and other things I recognized and then moved on to more complex things like string theory which I had no prior knowledge of. I started out fine and could follow well enough but as the book went on and the theories got more complex I had a harder and harder time keeping up and often had to reread a passage to understand it (and sometimes never totally did.) It is obviously a book for a particular audience and is not for everyone but if you are interested enough to pick up the book in the first place I don’t think you will be disappointed. It is well written and Mlodinow knows his stuff and his love of the topic comes through and infects the reader."
9,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42270195-ishmael,3,"It's called Euclid's Window, but the view isn't really so inspiring in the opening chapters. My version had a glaring mistake on the first page! The previous borrower had helpfully (and amusingly) annotated my library copy. Makes me wonder if I could perhaps make it as a professional editor. I mean, how hard can it be? Typos aside, this is a fairly pedestrian stroll through the key (European) developments in geometry from antiquity to the 20th century. The anecdotes are quite dry, and the explanations aren't immediately elucidating. To me, popular science books should be easy enough to understand in a single pass. Once I find myself having to re-read a page several times to work out what the author is trying to say, my enjoyment level begins to decline rapidly. If you want to feel inspired by mathematics or physics, I can heartily recommend Fermat's Last Theorem or Alex's Adventures in Numberland. However, this book does spark stutteringly into life at the turn of the 20th century. It's readily apparent where the author's interests lie, and I found the sections from Einstein's paradigm-shifting theories to string theory to be entertaining and educating in just the right proportions. "
10,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2674867-lynn,2,"I read Mlodinow’s The Drunkard’s Walk and thought this would be a great book on the history of mathematics. It started out good and then just fizzled out for me toward the end. His explanations were sometimes a little hokey and sometimes confusing. I think if you worked hard you could probably make sense of what he was trying to explain, but I’ve read better explanations of relativity, quantum mechanics, and string theory so I skimmed through the last half of the book pretty fast. It just didn’t seem worth it to spend a lot of time on poorly thought out narratives. I got the feeling he was more interested in promoting string theory than explaining the history of mathematics."
11,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12015040-murali-behara,5,"If you have a background in math & science, this will surely move you. Many stories of extraordinary individuals and their invaluable insights. I laughed and cried. Leonard Mlodinow is a great story teller. "
12,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2413885-shashi-martynova,5,"charming, inspite of sometimes a little bit too much of unceremoniousness.and yes, it makes the brain work and get amazed. and excited.and all in all: a person loving his|her subject just can't possibly write a vapid book, i believe."
13,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18360016-tony,2,Probably the worst popular science/math book I've read. He distorted and sensationalized history in an effort to be shocking and entertaining. It's less a history of geometry than a tabloid like account of the lives and discoveries of famous mathematicians and physicists.
14,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5281535-dubravka,4,Interesting. Funny. At times too cutesy for my taste. 
15,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44530411-vijayaraghavan-s-n,3,"In passing, Mr Moldinow mentioned the art perfected by schools and colleges in presenting Geometry as one of the most boring subjects. And also how he is going to change that view for his readers. That too with the help of minimal number of diagrams. Before I start, let me say that I belong to the same category of people who have been bored with Geometry. And so, when I read this passage, where he promises to show how interesting a subject Geometry is, I was naturally very excited. Even though I am not a big fan of Geometry, elementary and high school Maths was always my go to subject. When I fared poorly in other subjects, I could point at Maths and be contended.And my modest proficiency in elementary and high school maths helped me rush through the first few chapters. The details on how Greeks were the forefathers who laid the cornerstone for Maths and about various day to day activities for which they employed Maths. Then he talks about the great Pythagoras and other well known Greek mathematicians. The way he explained Pythagoras theorem in words were commendable. It awed me when I found that this was the way how Pythagoras came up with the all famous equation. I felt some sort of electricity passing through me when I realized that I was made to think the same way Pythagoras did albeit he did it a couple hundred decades back. At times, the book gave the vibe of the ever famous book Cosmos by Carl Sagan. There were even same incidents mentioned in both the books.Till now all was well. Then came the Euclidean theory. The author pens down his postulates and starts explaining it one by one. I could stay up with him till then. Then he starts talking about other mathematicians who later found flaws in these same postulates. Some are easy to understand while the rest make up for this easiness by making it much more difficult to comprehend. I was left open mouthed not knowing what was going around. I thought this would get better. But it went from worse to a complete train wreck. Author started explaining the high end stuff in mere words and I was completely bamboozled. He went from one mathematician to another (Descartes to Gauss to Einstein and finally at Witten) and I was still stuck in Euclid's parallel postulates. Then I decided to let it be and started picking up words and how these eminent personalities lived. This attitude was what carried me till the end of the book. Or else I would have left the book half way. This lasted till he finished off with string theory, super string theory and M theory.In spite the book remaining something too much to understand, there were instances when I was left reeling on the floor laughing. The author is so good and spot on with his humor. When you feel dejected about not being able to follow what he is trying to say, he cracks a well timed joke which rejuvenates me and fuels me to read the next few pages. And the fact that he is an atheist was another factor which kept me going. There were a couple of instances in which he takes swipe at ""GOD"" and its so fucking hilarious. He even gave roles to his sons Nicolai and Alexei.P.S. Paul Curry's trick was magnificent."
16,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4027539-audrey,5,"It may not be an overstatement to say that I learned more science from this book than I did in my secondary education. (Big picture, key concept knowledge...not little details like distance equals rate times time.) Gravity is a matter of perspective? Space and time, in one sense, don't really exist? There is no absolute distance...of anything. Space may actually have 11 dimensions? Oh yeah, and time is different on the earth than it is on the sun. Since I graduated after this book was published, it seems like someone really should have mentioned this. Thanks to further studies in math, I did know that space is curved and that the geometry of high school doesn't really describe the universe (only locally, at some level). A triangle in space doesn't have 180 degrees in its angles...imagine that.However, in the event that these are new ideas for my students, I'm looking forward to assigning this book this semester. The writing was incredibly entertaining, and I loved the author's sense of humor. Some reviews accuse the book of an anti-Christian, Euro-centric bias. As a Christian, I bridled at a few statements, but there's no reason not to enjoy the book just because some statements were written from a different worldview. Instead, there's room for discussion here. As for the Euro-centric perspective, this is probably correct. Sadly I am the product of a Euro-centric education, so I can't really say whether or not other cultures' contributions to geometry were minimized.Other criticisms of the book attacked its historical inaccuracies and tendency to sensationalize key characters' biographies. I didn't find this to be overly true. I've read worse, and I felt like the author did a good job qualifying his interesting stories (""legend has it,"" ""he may have remarked something like""....). This style certainly suits my purposes: assigning the book to a group of non-math-major, possibly disinterested, undergrads in an attempt to introduce the larger historical narrative of geometric progress.Favorite aspects of the book: a host of interesting biographical anecdotes (some of lesser known mathematicians), a clear structure broken down into manageable parts (five revolutions in geometry), literally laugh-out-loud invoking descriptions, the most beautifully written epilogue for a math book that I've read to date.Least favorite aspects: some wordy descriptions of difficult concepts that REALLY could have used a picture or diagram, excessive family illustrations featuring Alexai and Nicolai over and over and over (apologies to the author, as his love for his sons is admirable). Also, I really hoped to see a stronger connection in the last chapter between string theory and non-Euclidean geometry. This is just my own personal wish, as I'm using the book for a geometry class.While the book isn't perfect, I absolutely loved it and would recommend it to anyone wanting to learn more about geometry: the real story, including messy complications and unanswered questions and possibly shaky philosophical foundations, not the nicely packaged everything-is-proved sort you may have previously learned."
17,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7696647-becky,5,"I listened to this as an audiobook, and thought it was fascinating. All of the historical anecdotes were relevant to the mathematical topics. Though geometry may seem objective and unquestionable, I learned a lot about how the development of this field has been very contentious and intimately tied to changing paradigms of reality in european/western thinking. As some other reviewers state, this book unapologetically leaves out mention of the development of geometry in other parts of the world. However I don't think that diminishes the quality of the material that is presented. It is certainly a history of the geometry that is most commonly taught and accepted in schools today - for better or worse. I am not a mathematician and I am just becoming interested in learning more about math, and I thought this was a good introduction. If I ever get a hold of the physical book, I'll probably flip through it to get a better grasp of some of the concepts that were difficult for me to understand in the audiobook.Favorite quotes:""Euclid transformed our intuition of space into an abstract logical theory from which we could make deductions."""" 'Because of Lawrence contraction, in a reference frame that rotates relative to an inertian frame, the laws that govern rigid bodies to not correspond to the laws of Euclidian geometry' - Einstein.""""Not long after Thabit, Islamic support for the sciences dwindled. In one locale a scholar even complained that where he lived it was legal to kill mathematicians. (This was probably due less to a disdain for nerds than to the mathematicians' habit of studying astrology, which through history was often connected with black magic and considered dangerous rather than amusing as it is today.)"""
18,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15337067-nadia,2,"This is a cute piece of pop-science that takes us through the history of the human understanding of space, from the Ancient Greeks to modern theories of quantums, strings and numerous dimensions that sound mysterious and strange. And mysterious and strange remained even after reading the book, since the author doesn't do a great job at putting the ""popular"" in ""popular science"" as the things he's talking about grow more and more complex (and seem to focus more on physics than math or geometry as I expected initially). It's hard to blame him though- perhaps there truly isn't an easy way to explain string theory for the uninitiated. A thing that ended up annoying me to no end, however, was the writer's habit of using the names of his sons (Alexei and Nicolai) in pretty much every example and anecdote and description of an experiment. The first time he does it, it's sweet, but it gets really old really fast. Relativity? Oh, it's just like that time when Nicolai was in a small car and he bumped into Alexei and said Alexei got in the way and basically they are both right. A dispute between Einstein and another scientist? Oh, it's like that time when Alexei wanted to have blue hair, because disputes between scientists are essentially calls for attention. It just goes on and on with tons of silly details about Alexei and Nicolai, two boys about which, frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn. Mr Mlodinow is like the worse kind of Facebook parent who won't stop posting pictures of their kid. Overall a fairly enjoyable book but nothing to write home about."
19,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4478101-mark,4,"I've read a number of 'science for the layman' which work through the discoveries of quantum mechanics, special and general relativity, and string theory. This offering covers that ground as well but starts much farther back with the foundational discoveries within mathematics, which I enjoyed.Looking at the development of mathematics and physics through the lens of geometry is a novel approach and led me to some better understanding of the subject matter than I brought in to the book. I've been able to grasp the roughest understanding of time dilation predicted/required by Einstein's relativity, but the linkage between space and time and the curvature of space-time has always been tougher for me to internalize. Approaching this discussion from the point of view of geometry was helpful: how one measures the distance between two points, how this might change if the measured and measure-ee are moving relative to each other, and the difficulty in achieving simultaneity of the measurement with respect to both frames of reference.Mlodinow's writing style is clear and accessible with a nice dose of nerdy humor thrown in. He care's deeply about the subject but is concerned about telling a good story more so than hitting the reader over the head with how profound each new theory was."
20,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33543977-sam-bledsoe,2,"It's not the first Leonard Mlodinow book I've read, but it's not my favorite, either.First, when it comes to pop-math books, I love that he attempts math, even if it is rhetorical. I can wish for someone to write a book with really hard stuff, but for now I appreciate that explains the logic and reasoning behind math. He also explains techniques well.His humor is good. Some jokes fall flat, I thought, but overall I smiled and chuckled at some.He talks about his sons a lot. Like, every example he gives uses his sons. I was completely sick of the two by the end during the ""dream sequence"" when they were Einstein and Schrodinger arguing. It's supposed to be a funny scene, but god, his kids aren't that special. At their age, their biggest accomplishment is that they are alive.As a pop math, it commits the usual flaw of covering centuries of math and science too much, then doesn't really explain the new stuff, like string theory and curved space, all that well.A small nitpick. The idea that ""if wasn't for the dark ages, we would be on the moon"" is euro centric. It ignores that other cultures exist and were in their golden ages, with Asian cultures discovering a lot of technology and math centuries before Europe. This isn't a big gripe, just blaming the church for being the reason why civilization not being farther along seems like a waste of breath."
21,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16133372-ziqi,2,"Incredibly funny and cheeky; Mlodinow gives a broad overview of (a very Eurocentric) history of geometry, profiling 5 major figures: Euclid, Descartes, Gauss, Einstein and Witten. Truth be told, the biographies fell short and were very spotty. The author is very easily distracted and feels the need to insert a joke at every turn. The Witten chapter was extremely disappointing; we only get a sliver of his work (M-theory is mentioned, like, twice), and it is corrupted by Mlodinow's own personal perception of him, rather than actual research. Again, to be fair, he is trying to be funny, but it gets very annoying towards the end.On a first read, it seems wildly refreshing--a readable math book with sass! Yet, the jokes lose their shininess as the book wears on the prose grows ever tawdrier by comparison. But, I'm very glad that the book managed to cover many bases, including hyperbolic and elliptic space, and discussed relativity in detail. For a general and accessible (and again, Eurocentric) view of mathematical history, I highly recommend it. But Euclid's Window is not an authoritative text; it is a fun and light conversation with a knowledgable and funny author with mathematical experience. "
22,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4962899-tim,4,"Overall, an excellent book that covers geometry all the way from Pythagoras (so not just Euclid) to modern day String Theory. It's probably not a good choice for a pop science book, but for someone interested in the history of mathematics/science, it's very well done.There's a lot in this book. He covers early geometry by Pythagoras and Euclid, on to others like Descartes (and his predecessors), then on to people like Gauss and Riemann. He then discusses the impact of their work on Einstein which leads into String Theory and M-Theory where he ends up.There's some interesting revelations early. Most notably, that Pythagoras effectively had a cult around him and many of the things that Jesus was said to do in the Bible (like walking on water), were attributed to Pythagoras by his cult members (and this all happened years before Jesus). So, did Jesus' followers borrow from Pythagoras when writing the New Testament? It's certainly a point that many Christian fundamentalists wouldn't like, but I find it interesting that Pythagoras whom most people only know because of formula was a cult figure back in Ancient Greece."
23,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2794644-nathan-glenn,5,"This book was a completely fascinating read! It follows the history of mathematics and particularly geometry from the very beginning all the way to modern research in physics (which is heavily tied to geometry). It gives an account of the time before anyone thought of numbers by themselves, divorced from the length of a rope or a country's boundary. It recounts the revolutionary idea of Descartes that numbers can be drawn on a graph, with up being a bigger number and down being lower. These are such basic ideas to us now. Besides illuminating the knowledge we take for granted, it discusses less commonly known but still very important ideas, including metrics and curved space, special and general relativity, quantum mechanics and String and M theory.I started to get lost nearer towards the end of the book, where I wish the author had used more of the helpful illustrations that were employed for the simpler concepts of geometry and for special relativity. Sometimes he would describe a picture in words (""imagine two lines intersecting like so, with a curve here and there"", etc.), but it left me wishing for something concrete to look at."
24,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1167923-patrick,5,"Amazon review:Through Euclid's Window Leonard Mlodinow brilliantly and delightfully leads us on a journey through five revolutions in geometry, from the Greek concept of parallel lines to the latest notions of hyperspace. Here is an altogether new, refreshing, alternative history of math revealing how simple questions anyone might ask about space -- in the living room or in some other galaxy -- have been the hidden engine of the highest achievements in science and technology.Based on Mlodinow's extensive historical research; his studies alongside colleagues such as Richard Feynman and Kip Thorne; and interviews with leading physicists and mathematicians such as Murray Gell-Mann, Edward Witten, and Brian Greene, Euclid's Window is an extraordinary blend of rigorous, authoritative investigation and accessible, good-humored storytelling that makes a stunningly original argument asserting the primacy of geometry. For those who have looked through Euclid's Window, no space, no thing, and no time will ever be quite the same."
25,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5012269-siby,4,"Euclid's Window is a book tracing the evolution of Geometry over thousands of year; the story of the people, the brilliant mathematicians who developed it and the resistance that they faced, first from the church and then from within their own small mathematical community itself.This book brings to life the names we have heard during our school days and some that we have not; Thales, Pythagoras, Euclid, Archimedes, Galileo, Descartes, Gauss, Riemann, Einstein, Feynman and many others. Their lives and the stories behind their monumental genius would be far more interesting to most than their discoveries, but even students of mathematics or physics would love learning about these great men.The book gets a little heavy when the author tries to explain relativity and string theories, but otherwise it is light reading for those with a love for mathematics. Not recommended for those who hated maths in school though :)"
26,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19725552-satinder-hawkins,5,"I loved this book! As a teacher (history, not math) students often complain about having to learn math and how it seems to have no connection to the real world and this book elegantly refutes that complaint. I loved traveling back to the ancient world where geometry originated because the author, Leonard Mlodinow tells the story with such delightful anecdotes. It was fascinating to learn about the contributions of some of the greatest mathematical thinkers and to learn about them as individuals. He also explains the math in a way that I think most people can understand (although admittedly towards the end when he moves into physics it was challenging for me to keep pace). But his obvious joy in his discipline overrode any confusion I had and gave me a new appreciation for the role of geometry in decoding the secrets of the universe. "
27,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10856627-murph-hutson,2,"Very mixed bag. The mathematics was quite interesting. I'm a math teacher; thus, the subject fascinates me. However, Mlodinow is an atheist and just can't stop ridiculing the Bible and Christianity. If I was interested in that view, I would have read the book he authored with Stephen Hawking. I was looking for a history of Geometry. What I got was a man's take on why mathematics could disprove the existence of God. Yet, I'm more in line with Galileo who said, ""mathematics is the language with which God has written the universe."" Mlodinow is certainly entitled to his opinion, but he should've made it more clear in the title that this was his aim. As i stared before, my inference from the title was that this was a math history book only. "
28,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3239706-gordon,4,"I enjoy Mlodinow's style of narration and wasn't disappointed. Although billed as the ""story of geometry"" it's really about man's ability to explain the physical world from macro to micro, from universe (or multi-verse) to the subatomic. Mlodinow takes us through the age of the Greeks to modern day explaining how Euclid's historical postulates set the stage for men of math and science across the ages to advance our knowledge of and our ability to shape the physical world. Mlodinow highlights the major revolutions (from Euclidean to non-Euclidean geometry, to relativity, to String Theory & M-Theory) and explains the contributions of Descartes, Gauss, Reimann, Einstein, and most recently Witten. "
29,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1059018-sacha,2,"I read this despite tepid reviews because I so liked Drunkard's Walk. Turns out the reviews were correct. This was not nearly as good as Drunkard's Walk. The story was more familiar to me, so not as compelling and there were several examples I had just read in DW. I expected to learn more toward the end of the book: relativity and string theory. I've seen better overviews of relativity. (Lillian Lieber for example.) The string theory part was nearly all new to me, but by then... Sigh. The book also included a few too many examples involving the author's children. Drunkard's Walk was much better."
30,0684865246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,3,"The book goes off-topic. The premise is excellent and the book starts off well. However, the standard tendency of such books of the era to bring everything to relativity, quantum physics and superstring theory - may be because of far easier availability of topics in the space - means the book loses its interesting and unique subject quite quickly. As a result, when it is compared with other books on either history of maths/science or that try to explain cosmology theoretically, it comes up with neither too many new things nor interesting insights. Good introduction for anyone into the first few books on the subject, all that said."

Here is the upshot folks, the universe is incredibly complex to describe - and keeps getting more complex to understand. Obviously, it would be be great to travel into interstellar space.

And I am glad I did, for the last two sections (on relativity and string theory, respectively) were the best. I knew nothing about string theory before, so this was a gentle introduction to what is clearly a very difficult subject."

However, his manner is too informal, and the examples involving his children get boring (and irritating) very quickly. He's tried to avoid equations, but that leads him to have walls of text explaining each example, perhaps fitting because until recently, that is how math was done. Weakly recommend reading it.

The book tends to look at classical work through a modern and distorting lens, and the historical component leans toward lurid tales.Rather than raising the subject matter to the height I think it deserves, it is diminishing. I found myself more frustrated by this than anything else. Given what an easy audience I am, there is no reason for me to pick a math book that I find frustrating."

Then Mlodinow went extensively into physics, and I gave up at Einstein's general relativity and strings. I lost the geometric thread, and would need more convincing that all of the physics at the end was relevant. I would prefer to have had an expansion of the earlier sections, and indeed, reading this book encourages me to look for another book on the history of mathematics."

Each topic was broken down into digestive chunks, which I devoured (like the pun? :)). While some may not like to read books about math, I would definitely give this book a chance. The information was very factual, and fun to read. "

With a little dosage of humour, a good storytelling starting from ancient Babilon till nowadays, while science still has many dilemas and needs for new genious ideas and breakthoughs."
