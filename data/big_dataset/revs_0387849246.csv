0,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/811928-forrest,5,"I passed 10th grade biology . . . barely. My friend James and I had the two cutest girls in the class as lab partners. I can't remember their names, but they were both pretty gorgeous. I ended up in that lab group mostly because of James' charm and good looks. I was not particularly charming. I can prove it:James and I hung out a fair amount. We had fun. You know, teenagers. So when it came time in our biology class to dissect pig fetuses, we had a good time with it. James made the incision and we had fun moving the pig into different . . . positions. One thing led to another and after a while we had the sliced-open pig dancing to Hello My Baby. Problem is, its guts didn't want to stay inside.And we had very slick formica tabletops. So all kinds of innards spilled out during the chorus and splayed out across and off the tabletop, right into the laps of the girls in our lab group. They were not impressed.Our teacher, who, it was rumored, was a cocaine addict (though no one could substantiate the claim), turned toward our table and shouted ""James! Forrest! Get the hell out!""So we did. We left the classroom and wandered the halls. I mean, it was kind of like permission, wasn't it?The next day, we walked into the classroom and no sooner had we crossed the threshold than the teacher pointed at us and simply said ""out""!After a couple of days of this, he figured out that we were just wandering the halls, so for the rest of the semester, we were sent across the hall to spend time in another teacher's empty classroom. BIG mistake! We learned about science, alright. Like how many bags of gummy bears, stolen from the teacher's desk, did it take to fill up two teenage boys. Or whether the buoyancy of balloons on a windy day was enough to keep a teacher's metal in-basket aloft over the schoolyard (it wasn't). Or how many different topological forms could stacked desk chairs take.The teacher passed us with a ""D"" so that he wouldn't have to have us in class again.The joke was on him. I moved to England as soon as the school year was done. I later ran into James in England - he had moved there (to a different air base) a few months after I had gone. There was no chance that teacher would have ever had us as students again.Fast forward to today. My middle son is studying microbiology at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. He wants to go to medical school and become a doctor. And I, because of my mis-spent youth, am playing catch up. I've always loved science, just sort of missed out on the whole formal training aspect of it (until I got to college). Now, I'm diving in. Heck, the only magazine subscription I have is to Discover Magazine. So I heard and read a bit about this book and I must say that it's outstanding. Yes, it could use a little bit more depth, but it's a primer, really, a layman's introduction to cells and how they work on the molecular level. Very cool stuff. Some very scary stuff. HIV, for instance, is brutal on the molecular level, snipping out strands of a cells RNA and replacing them with its own, making itself virtually undetectable by the body's defense mechanisms. It's nasty stuff. I learned a lot about how cells work, particularly those in the human body. Did you know that the reason rigor mortis sets in is that the body, upon death, releases calcium from each muscle cell, which causes the muscles to contract. Normally, the living cells would almost instantaneously reabsorb the calcium, causing the muscles to relax, but the reabsorbing mechanism is shut off upon death. The calcium eventually reabsorbs and the body does relax, but only after a while. Or did you realize that the reason spicy foods are used as a sort of folk remedy for colds is because rhinovirus (i.e., the common cold) resides most comfortably in the mouth and nose, where there is not much acidity. Many spicy foods are highly acidic, which breaks down the cell walls of the rhinovirus, exposing its guts to the world, much like my experimental pig.The illustrations are extremely helpful for me, a visual learner. Now, since I've ""seen"" how cells work, I can get on with some more specific studies and add some scientific rigor to my studies. Someday, I'd like to take a shot at some DIY biology.And, in case you're wondering, James and I lost contact a long time ago, but I did find this little bio about him a couple of years ago. Seems he was someone very important on the USS New Orleans, a ship capable of delivering a battalion of 700 fully-armed marines into battle in short order.If that doesn't scare you, nothing will."
1,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59682834-jerry-pogan,5,"Absolutely fascinating! Goodsell discusses the mind-boggling complexity of cells, explaining the actions that occur for even the simplest task. Over fifty years ago, when I was in college, I don't remember studying anything like this in my biology classes. The advancements that have been made in science are astounding. There is an overload of information in the book but Goodsell's writing is very accessible and easy to understand and the book is filled with wonderfully drawn illustrations to help clarify the subject. In our everyday world it seems to us that turning a page in the book we're reading is the simplest thing we can do but when you see what is actually happening at the cellular level it seems almost impossible."
2,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/266149-michael,5,Written for a person like me - no real experience in molecular biology beyond school bio and pop culture. Amazing illustrations. 
3,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35914958-reinhardt,5,"Fascinating, informative, and beautiful. I learned more about cell mechanism in these 160 pages than in years of reading. Clear illustrations that are tightly linked to the text show in a visual way how the processes in cells work. It is filled with huge words - I mean huge - which usually means I’m getting completely lost in the vocabulary. Not here. The close link to the illustration and the very clear writing make learning almost automatic. Visualizing the processes is a game changer. If you have any interest in cell mechanisms, how cells make proteins, build structures, reproduce and die, how DNA works at the molecular level, how vitamins, poisons and pain relievers work at the molecular scale, this is the book"
4,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4674645-stijn,4,"An impressive overview of the field of molecular Biology. It goes into much less detail than The Processes of Life goes, but manages to give a broad intuition that has to leave one in awe for what is going on in our bodies. Who knew!? I feel that precisely the combination of starting with the dense The Processes Of Life and following up with this one works very well (and that ordering might be precisely the reason this one catches on so well: most of the needed vocabulary one already encountered)."
5,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7402577-dimitri-yatsenko,5,"Textbooks on physiology are replete with cartoons of interacting molecules that attempt to convey only the relevant information without preserving detail, proportion, or scale. ""The machinery of life"" is a simple and visual primer to cellular physiology that conveys an accurate sense of proportion and relation between the major molecular ingredients of life."
6,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8888352-kinan-diraneyya,3,"I appreciate how much effort was spent creating this book, but I have to admit that it didn't work as well as planned.The book filled with amazingly detailed (and seemingly very accurate) micro shots that gives a great idea about how things look on a molecular scale, however, reading the related paragraphs and connecting their points to what is in the image (which is only done by tiny black letters hidden in the many details of that image) is often a huge pain, many of these points are yet only naked scientific names like ""protein OmpA"". I have read books made for common readers (which I am) before, and I pretty sure they did a better job at explaining concepts and mechanisms without this extensive use of terms, in my opinion, a book like this one should be talking about how things work, not what is responsible for making them work this way.After all, the book doesn't say how or why protein FhnA transfers the ions of iron, it just says: here is the protein that does this process, its scientific name is the follwing, it is located there and this is how it looks like. Why would I want to know that? I just want the general idea on what is happening!Now it still gives a general idea on what is happening, and it deserves some praise, but I believe there are books out there that do the job more efficiently."
7,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1847371-michael-scott,5,"TODO full review:i The Machinery of Life is a book about the cell and its processes, focusing on visualization. The book covers the main molecular machines; the main processes of living, aging, and dying; the (prokaryote) bacterial cell; the (eukaryote) human cell; the specialization of cells constructing the human body; and viruses, toxins, and antiviruses and antitoxins. Overall, amazing drawings, and a simplistic but very interesting introduction to cell biology, written in accessible language but with conceptual depth. Take it as a helpful university refresher. Key insight: I liked everything about this book, including how short it was--read it in just a few hours, as preparation for my excursion into the borders of the sciences around the theory of evolution. The detailed visuals are for novices such as myself absolutely essential to understanding how cells work. Also, the excitement: Ever wanted to zoom 40,000,000x into a part of a cell? Wonderful!Trivia: The author is an associate professor of molecular science and graphic artist of the same topic, and has helped redesign the education part of the RCSB Protein Data Bank. (The RCSB is one of the entities collectively curating over 100,000 descriptions of key atomic structures in molecular science; see for example the structure, reports, data, and 3d objects available about Hemoglobin 2hhb. In plain English, David S. Goodsell is the kind of scientist with real impact on our society. Some details: +++ High quality, high resolution, high zoom-in (max. 40,000,000x, Figure 2.5, 3.1, 7.3); + 30,000,000x used once, to depict instability of ATP (Fig.3.7); ++ 20,000,000x used for detailed molecular machines, mainly in Chapter 2, and for detailed use of vitamins, mainly in Chapter 9: DNA vs. RNA views (Fig.2.4), protein structure (Fig.2.7), lipid bilayers (Fig.2.9), polysaccharids (Fig.2.10), ATP reaction (Fig.3.8, combined with a 5,000,000x view of the result), cytochrome c oxydase ued in respiration (Fig.7.7, combined with a 5,000,000x view of the result), Vitamin A use to sense light (Fig.9.2, combined with a 5,000,000x view of the result), use of Vitamin B in enzymes (Fig.9.3, combined with a 5,000,000x view of the result), Vitamin D production from cholesterol (Fig.9.4, combined with a 5,000,000x view of the result), cell-killer cyanide (Fig.9.5, combined with a 5,000,000x view of the result), Cytochrome P450 used to eliminate poison from the body (Fig.9.6, combined with a 5,000,000x view of the result), use of Penicillin to eliminate bacteria (Fig.9.8, combined with a 5,000,000x view of the result), drug resistance in HIV (Fig.9.9);++ 10,000,000x used to emphasize transformations of and links between enzymes/proteins, show views of smaller components such as sterols; +++ I liked very much the 1,000,000x and 5,000,000x zoomins, for cell-level views and for views of enzymes/proteins/molecular machines (esp. in Chapter 9), respectively; Figure 3.5, on forming the mature protein for human insulin); + the smallest zoom, 1,000x, is used once, but with good reason: to depict muscle tissue (Fig.6.1), whose operation which cannot be understood only from visualizations of individual cells (albeit, Chapter 6 hosts plenty of more zoomed-in figures, down to the Sarcomere micron-level contraction, which I suspect is a 40,000,000x zoom)."
8,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10767262-mansour-sadhan,5,"Most molecular biology text books dissect molecular biology into small digestible mouthfuls. That is understandable, indeed one can argue that this is what academic textbooks are meant to do. But that can have a negative side effect; missing the whole picture! A subject as complex and tangled as molecular biology can be an issue. One needs to read most of the 3kg book to get an all round grip on the subject! Enter David Goodsell! The Machinery of Life is a great book for anyone who wants to obtain a general idea of life at the molecular level. But there are many such books, so what makes this one special? Instead of listing the basics, Goodsell takes the reader into a journey inside an eukaryotic and a prokaryotic cell. This is done by an engaging text and what Goodsell is famous for, great Art. Thats right Art with a capital A! Goodsell's art can fit perfectly in a Tate gallery, yet its as technically scientific as it can be! I have never seen such detailed illustration of cells. The illustrations alone are worth getting this book for. Whether you are a veteran biologist, a biology student or just someone who wants to understand life, this book is a must read."
9,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9184648-mike-de-la-flor,4,This is one of the best popular books avaiable on cell biology. Though the book is brief the illustrations by David S. Goodsell speak volumes. The terrific illustrations along with the written descriptions give the reader insight into the invisible world of single celled organism and the cells in our bodies. I highly recommend this book to the cell biology student or to anyone interested in learning about the cell.
10,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7069868-john,4,"This book is all about the illustrations, which are remarkable, though the front cover is really the masterpiece, and the rest of them are much more diagrammatic, less beautiful but perhaps providing more insight. With these diagrams, one definitely gets a feeling of density within the cells, the sharp proximity with which the chemical and mechanical machinery of the cell interacts. The text is just fine, written with clarity and consistency at an accessible level. The writing definitely has the feel of a textbook, covering what is clearly known without journalistic or scientific straying into the new or speculative. Despite that, it is not too dry, always maintaining an appropriate brevity to keep an engaged pace.For the most part, the book proceeds hierarchically, starting from the nature of the chemical interactions that allow biological components to do their work, to some of the basic components and processes of every living cell, to the cells of E. Coli (as a representative of bacteria), to the multi-component cells of humans (and other eukaryotes), to the varying architecture of different tissues; but then moving to the molecular boundaries of humans as seen from interactions with viruses and other chemicals.If the book presents any frustrations, it is that it remains fragmentary, at the level of a tour, rather than really digging in to many of processes step-by-step in a way that reveals their machinery. If a given protein is for cutting, then how does it do the cutting? If a given system can detect and destroy a parasite, how do the components of the system work together to do so? The book proceeds along the lines of: here is an engine cylinder, here is an engine, here is a hydraulic pump, without getting into that step-by-step understand that really reveals how it works. This book is ""The Machinery of Life: A Tour"" as opposed to ""The Machinery of Life: A Step-by-Step Guide to How It Works"". This is a fair trade-off: the book covers a lot of ground without much complexity or difficulty.Overall, this is a nice tour of the machinery of life from chemicals to tissues, giving an illuminating view of the parts, if not the processes, by which it all works."
11,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57473547-katie,5,"This book is combines what makes a great popular science book and what makes a great coffee table book into something entirely new and wonderful. The illustrations, the primary focus of the book, are immersive and educational. The accompanying essays are written for the lay person but an undergraduate could also easily learn something new about molecular biology from them. This style of book makes a really great gift. I recommend this (and Goodsell's other works) as a gift for anyone who loves microbiology or who is a person with a curious nature."
12,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82567563-moritz-munzinger,5,"Should be mandatory material for all biology and medicine slides that students get to see in their lectures and books, as Goodsells illustrations are as informative and intuitively graspable as they are beautiful. With this book understanding what goes on in cells has never been easier. I think this is a tenfold improvement to traditional graphics. Save yourself the time and effort and read this instead of other illustrated works whenever you can."
13,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343721-becky,4,"So beautiful! I was surprised that the text was written for a general audience, but this makes for a great introduction to the molecular world. Close perusal of the figure captions introduced me to a group of proteins I knew nothing about! I’m thrilled to have something else new for my cell bio class. The illustrations are amazing; I bought this book after buying three full-sized posters for my office. "
14,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10449329-peter,4,"Wow! An amazing look deep inside human cells down to the molecular level. Two things I found amazing: the incredible electro-chemical processes that go on inside our cells; the fact of how much knowledge we have gained on how our bodies work at the deep molecular level. The diagrams are incredible, paintings of cell function magnified 1+ million times."
15,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30363107-mike-lisanke,5,"Another great biochem book... this one has a lot of great detail on the interaction of biochemicals and pictures which give good insight into the structure of the molecules ... and as we learn, structure equals function in biochemistry. It is Not a biochemistry text book but goes into enough detail to add a lot of background to its understanding. "
16,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7487616-peter-aronson,5,"A short, concise, readable work about the microscopic machinery that keeps us alive. The 2nd edition's illuminating color diagrams and paintings of the cellular machinery is what pushes this book to five stars."
17,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68056575-kristina,5,"Beautiful illustrations with complementary writing. Simple and easy to understand the basic wiring of life. I would be very proud to have achieved work on a similar level, as a scientific illustrator and researcher."
18,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71938424-nicholas-su,2,"Nice imagery of the biomolecular composition of life. Text is clearly dated (ie pre-internet): personally the most relatable language were mechanical descriptions, but other parts are dense with terminologies and isn't instructive as much as it is the writer's documenting of his own knowledge. "
19,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2170150-sheng-peng,4,Some really cool nuts-and-bolts level explanation of how life works. Makes one appreciate just how amazingly complex being alive is.
20,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29688207-sudhipunathil,4,Good book to have a visual experience of the interiors structure of cell and life itself 
21,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18837634-darko-doko,4,"Well, I rated it 4 star but honestly I do not know much about subject to rate it properly. I should read this again."
22,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39361907-alexander-leo-swenson,5,"Graduating with a biology degree, I realized that while I was familiar with the independent parts of a cell- protein pumps, ATP synthase, etc - I wasn't confident linking them to the classic organelle-level depictions we were introduced to in Bio 101. I knew the cell was a crowded place, but how so? David Goodsell is a master of transforming the complex, crowded reality of cells into legible and elegant watercolors. Though star of the show here is Goodsell's illustrations, the text does a great job condensing textbook content into sections that prop up the text as a whole. A must-read for anyone interested in structural biology, but accessible enough that I can recommend it to all biologists."
23,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7110041-arend,4,"The illustrations are amazing--very well thought out, great consistency of scale, sensible color schemes. You get a real sense of how crowded cells are, how complex some cells are and how there are vast differences in complexity between organisms.I would have given this 5 stars if not for the text. The sometimes exhaustive listing of names of enzymes and proteins can be exhausting, especially when it doesn't pay off later in the book. For a textbook it's too lightweight, but for a general reader it feels like too much jargon, which can kill off the sense of wonder from the earlier chapters. "
24,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46779062-julian,0,I really enjoyed reading the machinery of life because event though it was short it still helped me visualize and understand the bio molecular realm better. I also like teh water color pictures though for me I can gain information by reading alone it does help some people understand the inside of a cell after all there are very few microscopes that can see that small of an object.
25,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4913869-volodymyr,5,"Incredibly well-written explanation of basic molecular biology that keeps you thrilled more like great sci-fi book. Except, this is real and happening right now in you.One important thought that came to me was, that cell/molecular machinery is organised not like our man-made machines, but machines and systems work like molecular systems of living world."
26,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7291786-alexi-parizeau,4,"Right to the point with beautiful full-colour illustrations of the molecular machines inside our cells. My only frustration was that the illustrations were poorly labelled, making it a game of ""Where's Waldo"" just to find the items being discussed in each image."
27,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12217675-lisa,4,Very nice introduction to cell biology for beginners and the interested layperson

31,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50344979-samu-vi,4,A nice book that can teach someone like me who's not so interested in biological studies of new ways to look at the world. I think I like biology now :)
32,0387849246,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3549893-clifton-franklund,5,An informative overview of sub cellular structures. I read this one just for the pictures :-)
