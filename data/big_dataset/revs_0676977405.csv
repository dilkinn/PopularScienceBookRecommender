0,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17744555-blackoxford,5," Why Do We Do It ?Addiction is a purposeful activity, not a disease or even a condition to be cured. The purpose of addiction is to compensate for trauma, often experienced in childhood, that has produced an emotional deficit and real physical and psychic pain. Addiction succeeds in compensating for this deficit and in reducing the pain involved. Addiction also has undesirable physical side effects which are amplified by social stigmas and legal prohibitions. This, I think , is a fair summary of Maté’s medical philosophy. I agree with it. But it is precisely that - a philosophy, that is, a way of looking at the world which verifies itself. There is no way to ‘prove’ that Maté’s philosophy is correct. One either accepts it or does not based on what one considers as ‘rational.’ Historically there have been two forms of rationality that have dominated human thought - and the social policies resulting from it: causality and teleology. We habitually use the rationality of cause and effect when talking about inanimate objects and human beings whom we don’t hold responsible for their actions - children, victims of natural disasters, and those with diseases. Implicitly, we presume that these people are victims of their condition. They are either guilelessly ignorant, physically or mentally unable to respond to conditions, or simply too overwhelmed to do anything about their fate. Causality is simultaneously condescending and non-judgmental: ‘How sad, too bad, never mind.’On the other hand, teleological rationality, that is the ascription of intent, is the mode we tend to employ when we want to blame someone (or take credit for something ourselves - an interesting asymmetry). Teleology is the realm of responsibility rather than accident. Whatever state people find themselves in, they have actively participated in creating it - or so we presume. Our judgment kicks in: ‘They should have known better,’ indicating not just ignorance but error. ‘They had options but didn’t take them,’ suggesting a certain personal incompetence. ‘They are just self-indulgent,’ pointing toward a more profound moral defect. Teleology, when applied to others, is smug and uncompromising. Neither rationality works very well when it comes to addiction. We flip back and forth between them in public debates and in personal efforts to deal with addiction - in ourselves, our families, and our friends. The fact that the two rationales give entirely opposite implications for dealing with the problem of addiction creates as much stress as the condition itself. Should we ban the stuff that people use, thus eliminating a cause? Or should we counsel people who are addicted in order to create alternative motivations strong enough to overcome physical dependency? The choice is unpleasant; so we do both. With little positive result.Addiction, it seems, has its own rationality according to Maté. It involves unconscious psychic and obvious physical causality with equally unconscious purposeful intent. In this sense addiction may be considered a total physical commitment of body and mind. As such it is difficult to imagine any legal strictures or any therapy with a significant chance to mitigate it. The logic of commitment, as in marriage, religious vows, or even sexual identity - doesn’t allow half-measures. One is either in or out of commitment. Getting in is relatively easy, as many find in marriage; getting out is far more awkward, also as many find in marriage.As Maté is keen to point out with many examples, the logic of addiction as destructive commitment is relational. The object of that which is in relationship with an addict can be almost anything - other people, reputation, food, power, and, of course, a range of substances which affect body chemistry, mood, and feelings of ‘wholeness.’ The important point is that it is the relationship rather than the object of the relation which is the focus of the commitment and therefore the addiction (My own dominant feeling twenty years ago when I quit smoking 2 packs of Marlboroughs daily was one of loosing my best friend).Committed relationships are always networks. This is why they are so difficult to unravel. Addiction is in a sense a nexus of people, places, group behaviours, and symbolic objects, as well as whatever chemicals might be around. The programme in which Maté practiced in British Columbia didn’t even attempt to penetrate these networks. Its mission was to make addicts as safe as possible not cure them or ease them back into ‘normal’ society. This, I think, is an implicit recognition of both the causal complexity and the committed solidity of addiction. No therapy keyed on substance-abuse has a hope in hell of ‘fixing’ anyone.The clear implication of Maté’s experiences is that addiction is an issue of the society in which it occurs. Addiction is neither a choice nor a disease. It is a rational adaptation to that society by members who have been traumatised by circumstances. Such traumatisation is much more widespread than among those involved in illegal drugs. Addiction to sex, consumption, popularity, religion, politics, computer games, and power are much more common, and could easily involve most of the human population of industrialised countries. None of these are less destructive than substance abuse; although each has their own form of damage.All these addictions have the same ultimate source, and the same prognosis: None will be overcome without an almost mystical self-revelation about the commitments one has made simultaneously with the removal of causal ‘triggers.’ Maté is straightforward about the solution, which is just as mystical as the condition:  “Addictions arise from thwarted love, from our thwarted ability to love children the way they need to be loved, from our thwarted ability to love ourselves and one another in the ways we all need.” I’m not sure if this leads to hope or to despair. But it is at least worth considering."
1,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10841164-brenda---traveling-sisters-book-reviews,5,"Dr. Mate is a physician for The Portland Hotel Society in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside that provides housing and care to addicts who are in the last stages of addiction. He gives us a powerful and fascinating look into the science of addiction, and the addiction process. Dr. Mate also shares with us heart wrenching personal interviews of addicts he has worked with. These stories left me with feeling empathy and some understanding of individuals with addicted brains. There are no recoveries here. Even though these are important stories I did skip over some and when I am ready I might go back and read them. I was glad to see Dr. Mate address addiction and mental illness. Which I feel is important to understand addiction. The information in this book doesn't just apply to drug addiction but all addictions. Dr. Mate also tells us of his own addiction which is not a drug addiction. There is so much good information in here that I can't even begin to say in a review. I borrowed the Ebook from Overdrive but I am also going to purchase the book as I found it a very valuable source of information that I will be referencing back to. I will admit the spiritual and 12 step program wasn't something I was interested in. I would of liked more information on evidence-based therapy like CBT and Motivational enhancement training for treating addiction. I would recommend this book to anyone with a loved one who you think might or has an addiction or to anyone looking to understand addiction or just want to challenge their views on addiction."
2,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,5,"This is a wonderfully written and comprehensive description of addiction, written from a liberal and compassionate perspective, by someone who has experienced problems with addiction himself.Part of Vancouver is dedicated to housing and helping people with serious addiction problems. This is Downtown Eastside, where about five hotels are now used to provide accommodation for these people. Dr Gabor Maté is their doctor and has a surgery in one of the hotels. He is also a highly respected practitioner in the field of addictions.The book starts out by giving descriptions of some of Maté's patients, so we get an idea of them as people, and we get an inkling of the issues that cloud their lives. It goes on to explore a wealth of other areas relating to addiction: (view spoiler)[
  The relationship between caregivers and their clients:This is less about curing people and more about just being with them and respecting and supporting them. ""I soon discovered that, in fact, I had very little to give - I could not rescue people from their pain and sadness. All I could offer was to walk beside them as a fellow human being, a kindred spirit."" Liz Evans, nurse at The Portland Hotel.Why people become addicts:This is usually due to childhood trauma, or even trauma experienced by pregnant mothers and passed on to their children in the womb. Human children (as opposed to other mammals) are particularly vulnerable, as they do so much of their brain development outside the womb in the early years of their lives. A child needs to be in an ""attachment relationship"" with at least one reliably available, protective psychophysically present and reasonably non-stressed adult, in order to develop healthily.A hierarchy of addiction:There is a continuum of addiction, from those who inject heroin to high functioning addicts who shop too much, or who are workaholics. Maté says ""I have come to see addiction not a a discrete, solid entity - a case of 'Either you've got it or you haven't' but as a subtle and extensive continuum. It's central, defining qualities are active in all addicts, from the honoured workaholic at the apex of society to the impoverished and criminalized crack fiend who haunts Skid Row. Somewhere along that continuum I locate myself.The worse the addiction and more dysfunctional the lifestyle, the higher the levels of distress that caused it.The more you take drugs, the less pleasurable life becomes without them:Just as we turn down the volume on a radio that is too loud, the brain of someone who misuses drugs adjusts by producing fewer neurotransmitters in the reward circuit, or by reducing the number of receptors that can receive signals. As a result, the person's ability to experience pleasure from naturally rewarding (i.e., reinforcing) activities is also reduced. Not everyone becomes an addict if exposed to drugs like heroin, barbiturates or amphetamines: 20% of soldiers in Vietnam took these drugs. When they came home, 19% were able to stop using them. It is only those who had other problems who became addicted.Relapse rates amongst recovery addicts are high: Chronic drug use remodels the brain's chemical structure, its anatomy and its physiological functioning. It even alters the way the genes act in the nuclei of brain cells. Vulnerability to cravings can continue for years.Drugs and genetic theory:Maté thinks that the genetics theory for alcoholism has been disproved.Most chronic substance abusers are likely to have cross addictions:About 70% of alcoholics are also heavy smokers compared to only 10% of the general population. About half of compulsive gamblers are also alcoholics, and most are addicted to nicotine.Any passion can become an addiction: How can you tell when it goes from one to the other? It is possible to stop with a passion, but not an addiction.Effects of drug withdrawal or stopping a compulsive behaviour: A generally glum mood, restlessness, aimlessness. No doubt this has chemical components - with diminished dopamine and endorphin levels. The journey from self-indulgence to depression is rapid and inexorable.Personality Traits of addiction prone personalities:*A lack of self-regulation, instead they rely on external support to quell their discomfort and soothe their anxiety. These things take the form of chemicals & compulsive behaviours.*An excessive need for attention, approval or love.*They may seek outside activities to trigger elation or a sense of risk.*They are dependent on 'outside things' to change their mood.*They have a poor hold over sudden feelings, urges or desires. These come from the lower brain centres, and are meant to be inhibited by the cerebral cortex.*An absence of differentiation. They find it all too easy to pick up moods from other people.Addiction and romantic relationships:These have a great effect on people's moods if going well or badly, and are often reflected in level of drug use. People are often unable to engage in a process of recovery because their partner is unwilling to join them. Their relationship is seen as being more important than their health.What causes an addiction to one thing and not to another? Often it is the first thing a person encounters that is able to soothe difficult feelings, or that suggests affection in a barren world, eg as the baby of a depressed mother, you will be held while being fed, and food may therefore come to mean more to you than just physical sustenance.Higher rates of alcoholism among native peoples from various countries: This is due to loss of psychological, social and economic integration into family and culture. A sense of exclusion, isolation and powerlessness.The cost of buying drugs: A cocaine habit can cost $200 - £300 or more a day. Heroin is much cheaper, at about $30 a day. Funding often comes from stealing or prostitution. With stealing, you only get about 10% of the goods' value when you sell them on.Why some people manage to recover from hardcore addictions:Self knowledgeStrengthSupportive environmentGood fortune LuckCapacity to endure pain and suffering.Fortuitous circumstances.A new relationship.A flash of insight.A sudden opening to faith.And we shouldn't judge those who can't recover: Some people manage to recover from hardcore addictions. Just because one person succeeds we cannot judge another person for failing. It is even more nonsensical to judge addicts by criteria derived from the experience of people with relatively normal lives. ""It is unjust to hold a traumatized and neurologically impaired adult to the same standard as one not so afflicted."" says brain researcher Martin Teicher.How much actual freedom to choose does any one human possess? There is only one answer - we cannot know. There is no way of gauging the burden of emotional suffering weighing down one person's psyche against another's.... that is why it is facile to demand that anyone should be able to ""just say no"" and to judge them as morally lacking if they can't.""This aberrant behaviour has traditionally been viewed as ""bad choices"" that are made voluntarily by the addict. However recent studies have shown that repeated drug use leads to long lasting changes in the brain that undermine voluntary control"" Dr. Nora Volkow, Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse in the U.S.Judging the addict:We cannot help people when we put ourselves in a position of judgement. Addicts, all but the few completely sociopathic ones, are deeply self-critical and harsh with themselves. They are keenly sensitive to judgemental tones in others and respond with withdrawal or defensive denial. A prayer on wall of one of the clients, called Kim""Oh, Great Spirit, whose voice I hear in the Winds and where breath gives life to all the world around me, hear our cry, for we are small and weak.... Help me make peace with my greatest enemy - myself.""The decriminalization of drugs:Maté is in favour of this - not least because of all the stealing/prostitution that has to be done to raise the money to buy drugs. Also the jails get filled with people with addictions. He stresses that decriminalization is not the same as legalization. With decriminalization, people are allowed to carry small amounts of drugs for personal use, but the manufacturing and selling of drugs is illegal.He believes that drugs should be given to confirmed users under safely controlled conditions, via doctors prescribing drugs to people addicted to them. If they didn't have to spend exorbitant amounts on drugs that, in themselves are inexpensive to prepare, addicts would not be forced into crime, violence, prostitution or poverty to pay for their habits. Ideally there would also be publicly funded rehab facilities with after care, to help those who may be able to stop their habits.Some people can function well if supplied with drugs at a level to meet their base needs:Dr William Steward Halsted, who did incredible work at John Hopkins University in the early 20th century, was also a morphine addict for over 40 years. Most hardcore addicts couldn't function at this level, even if their substance needs were met. They have too many problems. Even so, they would be much less of a burden on society if their basic needs were met.Decriminilization and crystal meth/methamphetamine: Here Maté shows reservations. He says there is no safe way to use it. The only solution is to try and help people wean off it.Mindfulness as a path to recovery:In this section Maté talks quite a lot about his own addiction to buying classical music cds, and how mindfulness can help those whose problems are amenable to recovery. He talks about the brain being plastic, therefore open to change, about people who have had strokes or depression, Tourettes or OCD, who have managed to improve their functioning. ""Arduous effort is required on the part of any addict - not least because their compulsions promise pleasure and reward."" But with some people and circumstances change is possible.Mindfulness and 'Bare Attention':By consciously observing the workings of our mind, we are gradually able to let go of its habitual, programmed interpretations and automatic reactions.In a mindful state one can choose to be aware of the ebb and flow of emotions and thought patterns instead of brooding on their thought content. eg someone may notice that feelings of resentment and a desire for vengeance keep flooding their mind. Rather than just having the feelings, they will observe them.'Bare Attention' is the clear and single-minded awareness of what actually happens to us and in us at the successive moment of perception. It is called ""Bare"" because it attends just to the bare facts of a perception as presented either through the five physical senses or through the mind - without reacting to them.Although 'Bare Attention' was developed as a meditative practice, its use is not limited to formal meditation. It is the conscious attending to what occurs in the mind as it takes in physical or emotional stimuli from within and outside the body.Meditation for the over-active mind:Maté has always wanted to meditate, but has found it impossibly difficult "" My addiction-prone ADD brain always wants to look to the outside to get away from itself. As a result I tend to oscillate between excessive, multitasking, busyness and a proclivity for 'vegging out', in ways that leave me non-rested and dissatisfied. Meditation, with its demand for stillness and self-observation has not been an activity that I have joyfully embraced.""He says that at a meditation retreat, Maté had a breakthrough. He realised that one doesn't have to be good at meditation, achieve anything, or look for any particular result. As with any skill only practise leads to improvement - and improvement is not even the point. The only point is the practise. ""When I do practise meditation, I find more ease in my life. I'm calmer, more emotionally present, more compassionate to others and I am far less reactive to external triggers.""Recovery and honesty:He talks about exposing one's addictions to the light of day - much easier when you are treating yourself with 'compassionate curiosity'. ""Even before I stopped buying compact discs, for months I would tell Rae (his wife) about it. I had nothing to hide, my compassionate curiosity discovered.... Exposed to the light of day, the addictive compulsion does not develop power and heft. I had much less of an urge to binge, and the occasional visit to the music store did not evoke a helpless desire to go back the same day, or the or the next. My advice to anyone with addictive behaviours is to begin telling the truth"".Addictions and stress:If you live a life full of stress you are unlikely to be able to break your addiction. Addictions - in the short term - act as stress relievers.People often take on chronic stresses because of ingrained beliefs of how we 'ought' to behave.For friends and family of the addict:Motivation has to come from the addict. No-one outside can do that. Love and kindness though work much better than 'tough love' interventions. It's fine to set your boundaries with an addict, but not in order to control or blame them. Instead you need to communicate what you can and cannot accept.If you have to choose between staying with an addict and feeling resentment, or leaving and feeling guilt, opt for the guilt. 
(hide spoiler)] I can't think of a better book to be read on the subject. Whilst I still have a few questions (most of all....surely the sudden rise in opiate addictions via medical prescriptions, cannot all be explained in the the theories put forward by Maté?), I nevertheless feel I have learnt an enormous amount from this book."
3,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7158-stephanie,4,"I read this for a master of social work drug and alcohol class. The professor said we would likely become enthralled and breeze through it's 400 plus pages in a weekend as she did. That was not my experience. I took a really long time reading this book, highlighting as I went. It was an excellent introduction to the field of addiction, blending tender humanity with hard science. I found Dr. Mate's critiques on the horribly flawed legal system to be spot on, his personal vingetes and descriptions of the addicts he knows and treats to be intimate and engaging, and most especially I loved the end of the book- where Dr. Mate breaks down the force behind the addiction and what personal healing entails. Once addiction is opened up in this way, it becomes apparent that all of us function on this continuum, which makes empathy a little easier to come by and understanding a little closer to home. "
4,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/430758-meaghan,5,"Written in clear, lucid prose any reasonably intelligent adult could understand, without a lot of confusing jargon, Dr. Mate explains the forces behind addiction and why so many addicts fail time and time again to get clean, in spite of all the incentives for doing so. This book gave me a lot to think about regarding the brain, and I also found his cautionary points about adoption studies and twin studies very interesting and relevant. Mate conclusively demonstrates that addicts are not ""bad,"" that they have very little control of the actions surrounding their addiction, and that kind and loving parents can produce an addict just as easily as indifferent or abusive parents. (On the last point Mate uses his own experiences as a child Holocaust survivor as an example: his parents loved him very much and cared for him as best they could, but the stress and deprivation of his infancy left an ineradicable mark on this brain development.) Finally, Mate sets forth a sensible ""harm reduction"" social policy that could potentially make life easier for everyone, not just addicts and their families, by reducing the problems drug abuse causes in the community.Everyone in Congress should read this book, as well as everyone who has to interact with addicts on a regular basis. Dr. Mate is a wise, forward-thinking man."
5,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50386907-tricia,0,"I'm not much of a fangirl until it comes to doctors or scientists that step out of the box of the limited view of their academic training and start learning and teaching from their experiences. Open-mindedness is S-E-X-Y.So I fangirl all over the place when it comes to Gabor Maté. Not only is he from my home country (Canada), he has spoken on trauma as being at the root of addiction, mental illness and a number of other behavioural ""disorders""--trauma as defined as a disconnection from oneself--which in my experience with such, is bang-on TRUTH. He affirms my experiences, he opens me up to different perspectives, and I love him for it.I cannot wait to dive into this book."
6,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7133444-sandra,2,"To a hammer, everything looks like a nail. And Maté is one dedicated hammer.The first part of the book (patients' personal histories) is the best and only good part. The rest is painfully repetitive and unnecessary stretched out development of the author's Grand Theory of Human Addiction. The whole thing is almost preposterous.For example, p233: ""If children today are at greater risk for obesity than those of previous generations, it's not simply because they're less physically active as a result of being absorbed in TV or computers. It's primarily because under ordinary peacetime conditions there has never before been a generation so stressed and so starved of nurturing adult relationships."" Seriously, this is what we are going with here? It's such an incomplete and incompetent argument, and it's hardly the first or the last one. It was the final nail in the coffin of my patience with this book.I get it, Maté is endlessly compassionate and wants the reader to come on that trip with him. Unfortunately, if you separate the compassion from the model he's advocating for, you realize that compassion and lazy thinking are the only glue keeping his ragtag theory in one piece. Also, it is hard not to get fed up with Maté's many dramatic accounts of his own so-called-addiction - compulsive purchases of classic music CDs. Really, he's completely serous about that. He even goes to AA meetings and tells his addiction story, to have other attendees as well as his patients ""confirm"" to him that what he experiences is totally the same addiction mechanism at play as theirs. Jesus H. Christ on a bicycle. At one point, you might catch yourself wondering if everyhing is okay with Mr Maté. Ten years later, is he still spending hundreds of dollars on CDs, or has online streaming provided some relief (and savings)? You might even wonder how he would cope if his ""addiction"" is taken away from him. We might never know.It is obvious there might be something to some parts of his theory, but this hot mess (I didn't say dumpster fire) of a book is not it."
7,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1614402-lumumba-shakur,5,"This is a fascinating look at the chemistry of addiction and a call to a more progressive public policy. Dr. Gabor Mate's style of writing is captivating and he is masterful at explaining specialized knowledge in laymen's language. My own mother, a recent graduate of medical school, when I summarized some of his arguments, commented on how Dr. Mate made connections for her that she could not quite make herself during her medical training (due to the emphasis on ""treatment"" over cause with respect to mental disorders) and she agreed with his criticisms of the way in which doctors are educated in the West. She also was amazed at how I was able to explain things to her that she herself had spent the past 8 years of her life learning based on Dr. Gabe's explanations.Stylistically, Dr. Mate draws you in by giving you the biographies of several of his patients at the harm-mitigation facility that he currently works for. Most, if not all, of the stories are of people who were severely abused as children and as a result of the pain, turned to substance abuse as a form of self-medication (and perhaps more importantly for his purposes: why this self-medication is actually an effective short-term solution) - stories of which I am all to familiar with in my own professional life as a youth counselor. Just as you feel you've been beat over the head one-too-many times with such heart wrenching stories, Dr. Mate switches themes and slowly takes you through the process of addiction and eventual self-recovery. As this is not a propaganda piece - very few of those initial stories have entirely happy endings. People are people and the story which stuck with me the most is of a man who called his sister in Ireland to tell her that he would not be flying home and that he instead would make arrangements for his body to be sent to the family plot. Other stories are perhaps more profound, but this particular one that he more-or-less ends with highlights the unfortunate reality that the lives of most hardcore addicts end in early death - something my family knows all too well. Far from being a simple tract on addiction, Dr. Mate demonstrates how drug addicts are just an extreme end of a continuum of behavior that applies to large segments of society. By weaving together the connections between early childhood development (in ureto and post-natal) and the effects of trauma on the human psyche, Dr. Mate makes the case not only for a more comprehensive and compassionate health care system, but establishes the fact that the rising levels of addiction among modern (and I would say modernizing nations) is little more than a symptom of a larger social ill that is increasingly becoming more and more malignant: the breakdown of the traditional family and community social structure. That being so, no amount of ""tough love"" or criminal justice involvement is going to cure the problem. Instead, our approach (the American approach that we have unfortunately successfully forced down the throats of most other nations) only further punishes and ostracizes the same victims of abuse that we all felt compassion for at an earlier point in these same peoples' lives.In keeping with the themes of his previous works (which I have not had the good fortune to read yet, but have heard numerous interviews Dr. Mate has given in American media), this is a book that should be essential reading for anyone involved in the health care industry - especially mental health and youth behavioral management - as the rate of substance abuse in those communities is incredibly high. I would also recommend this to anyone with young children, victims of abuse and young couples seeking to have little ones. Even more so, this is also a must read for anyone who suffers from any type of addiction. One particular chapter is of vital importance: ""A Word to Families, Friends and Caregivers"" in which he offers very realistic and practical advice to the families and loved ones' of addicts. The phrase, ""Choose guilt over resentment"" was profound and likewise was the self-critical analysis Dr. Mate prescribes for this group of people - most notably that we (as family, loved ones or caregivers) often make the process of recovery that much more difficult. The fact that in addition to being a youth counselor who worked with the very same sorts of people that eventually found their way into the Portland ""Hotel"", that I am also the son of a recovered drug addict and alcoholic made the book that much more meaningful to me.After Dr. Mate establishes the causes and the physiological factors that lead to addiction - he gives advice on how to achieve sobriety. In terms of my own religious persuasion, I could see clear parallels between Dr. Mate's recommendations and my own religious spiritual tradition. His methods of self-help reflect the techniques recommended by a savant I am affiliated to as the most tried-and-true techniques for the breaking bad habits and removing sin from one's life. This is particularly true is his ""Four Steps: Plus One"", his adaptation of a self-help program designed by UCLA, which is in lock-step with the tarbiyah of the Darqawi-Shadhili Order and the famed ""Muraqaba Durus"" one of its contemporary Hashimi branches (which was adopted and expanded as a part of the practical spirituality contained in Agenda to Change Our Condition). For instance, in regard to the first step, ""Relabeling"" Dr. Mate gives the following insight, The point of relabeling is not to make the addictive urge disappear - it's not going to, at least not for a long time, since it was wired into the brain long ago. It is strengthening every time you give in to it and every time you try to suppress it forcibly. (p. 377-8) Upon reading this, I was reminded simultaneously of the Sufic insights regarding khawatir (thoughts) and how they turn into obsessions (i.e. ""behavioral addiction""), Mawlay al-Arabi's elucidations on hawa (""vain caprice"" - which is precisely what Dr. Mate is talking about when he identifies addictive behaviors as things we all know are not good for us in the long run, even as they serve some short-term purpose) and of the advice that in respect to spiritual self-discipline intended to rid oneself of such problems, one should not go overboard, ""lest the nafs kick-and-scream in revolt"". As another example, on ""Refocusing"": Rather than engage the addictive activity, find something else to do. Your initial goal is modest: buy yourself just fifteen minutes. Choose something that you enjoy and that will keep you active: preferably something healthy and creative, but anything that will please you without causing greater harm. (p. 379-80) I.e. ""Ours is not a way of rigorous spiritual struggle. Rather, ours is a way of diplomacy. We give the nafs what it wants within the convinces of the Sacred Law on the condition that it is going to work for us when we need it to."" And the entire chapter ""Sobriety and the External Milieu"" can be summed up with the words of Abu al-Hasan al-Shadhili, ""Do not stir your feet except where you expect the reward of Allah; and do not sit except where you are likely to be safe from disobeying Allah."" Or as Dr. Mate put it, [C]reating an external environment that can support one's move towards conscious awareness is one essential feature of the recovery process. (p. 388) I could go on and on as I found myself able to fill in the gaps explicitly for Dr. Mate in this part of the book, as he clearly has studied Buddhism and his spirituality is rooted entirely in that world-view. Also being a Jew, he is familiar enough with the Old and New Testament - but seems to have little to no familiarity with Islam and its spiritual teachings (though I do appreciate his referencing of the Qur'an). Due to this, perhaps the only chapter of the book that I was not incredibly fond of was his attempt to relate the religious message of AA's ""12 Step Program"" to a wider audience - which undoubtedly involved a certain world-view and theological relativism. This is perhaps the weakest chapter of the book, though I would imagine that those who share his philosophy may disagree with me. And as it is fairly short, you do not get the impression that you are being preached to. Rather, Dr. Mate is clearly trying his best to articulate his spirituality to a general audience that may not necessarily agree with his personal theological conclusions. And in that, he succeeded, as I found myself agreeing with the overall message of this particular chapter. In sum, from cover to cover, this is a fascinating book that I highly recommend to everyone as there are few of us who to one degree or another is not addicted to something - whether it be methamphetamine, prestige, attention or power. Everyone who is honest with themselves will see something of themselves between the covers and will walk away a better person for it. And those who know, love or have loved someone addicted to life-debilitating and/or illegal substances will walk away with a more profound understanding of their struggles.Wa-Llahu `alim wa musta`am"
8,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9281934-louise,5,"If you live or work in a city, every day, you see people like those described in the first 100 pages or so of this book. Dr. Gabor gives you their back stories. They are the author’s drug addicted patients. After you see how much people are willing to lose to get the next hit, you learn of the brain chemistry, social policy, how addicts can be treated and Dr. Gabor’s own socially accepted addictions. Gabor cites research that validates common sense for anyone who is observing. Addiction (and I presume a lot else) can start in the womb when 17% of the brain is formed. If the mother is stressed (living in poverty, violence, with abuse) the stress of her life will be transmitted. The result for the fetus is that the systems for producing two important soothing agents – dopamine and endorphin – will be underdeveloped. After birth, if the stress continues as the brain more fully develops its circuitry the soothing systems will remain underdeveloped leaving the child at risk for taking anything that will produce these agents. For these children and the teens and adults they become, the drug experience is a well being, previously not experienced. Gabor shows how the body develops systems to implant a habit and embeds triggers that create a “hungry ghost”. As the ghost is fed with its required drugs, the area of the brain governing impulse atrophies leaving the person disabled in the ability to stop taking drugs..Gabor uses his own experience to illustrate. As a Jew born in Hungary in 1944, he was born into stress. To save him, his mother gave him to a gentile family. Regardless of all the love his mother gave him, and that of the caregivers, his own brain, knowing only of the stress, did not develop soothing systems. Unlike his patients, he had a middle class family and guidance and became a workaholic… his work and his love of classical music feed his “hungry ghost” to the neglect of his wife and son. He shows how this “social” addiction (like gambling, shopping, sex, power, etc.) are all generated by the brain in the same way as substance addiction.While his profession is set up to give the addict hope and a means to breaking free, Gabor shows how the odds for a long term user are low to impossible. At some point the brain is wired to require the drug and disable restraint systems. The evidence can be shown scientifically in the brain and in merely observing how much the addict is willing to lose to have it.With this background, Gabor takes on the “War on Drugs” and how it plays out on the street and the havoc it wreaks on the families of the addicted without solving the problem. He poses common sense solutions and shows how difficult they are to implement with current priorities.The book is sweeping in outlining the problem and its personal and social costs. While published in 2008, this must be a classic. I was wait-listed for one of our library’s 5 copies for 4 months. If you are interested in this topic or have an addicted love one, you will want to read this book."
9,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6623786-jansen-estrup,5,"Dr. Mate's book is one of the most important of our age. Throughout he documents the plague of our time, addictions ranging from drug abuse to work-a-holism. He cites study after study, experience (he is a serial addict himself) as a drug counselor and researcher. It is stress, he argues, prenatal and as infants, which causes the childhood brain to wire itself in self destructive ways. These efforts are essential to survival as children but devastating in adolescents and adults. As a fetus his stress was caused by the Nazi extermination of Jews and later by being passed from one frantic 'safe house' to another. Warfare severs infant bonding and such children never recover to gain a sense of trust in their environment. But it doesn't take warfare to cause this disconnect. Spousal abuse, hunger, a parent's own emotional baggage (all symptoms of Western culture) and the demand for ever more 'work' and 'things' make for a wide range of unsettled children, teens and adults. Individual assurance gets short shrift and accounts for the endless variations of magical, 'positive' and wishful thinking which attract us to charlatans of various talents.Mate's recommendations are insightful and even possible, if civic and medical leaders would examine them. They are compassionate, workable and even much less expensive than our never ending 'war on drugs' ...Tremendous piece of work!"
10,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1312884-andrew-m,5,"I cannot say enough good things about ""In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts"". It is informative, well-written, touching, and inspirational. I have already started recommending it to friends and family as a must-read. The information is timely and important; our behaviour (collective and individual) towards addicts is at best of minimally useful and at worst counter-productive. “In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts” should be a wake up call for individuals and society to think differently about this pressing social concern.“In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts” is at its best when it is personal. Mate tells his own story and the stories of dozens of his patients in great detail. Some of these stories can be hard to read, but there is always an undercurrent of hope and love in the words that Mate writes. He sees his patients as people, and asks us to do the same. But more than that, he also acknowledges his own humanity and imperfection; he does not shy away from admitting his faults and his biases, and how they impact his work with patients. In doing so, Mate is modeling for the reader what he sees as one of the most important aspect of mental health and freedom from addictions: mindful awareness of one's self and inner experience.After the first few chapters of stories about himself and his patients, Mate discusses the neurobiology of addiction and then the problems with the way society currently fails to deal with addiction. Although these chapters are very important to the book and to a full understanding of addiction, I find it hard to comment on these sections. I already had a fairly decent understanding of the neuroscience that he discussed, and so while I found it a bit tedious and slow moving, I suspect that a reader less familiar with these topics would find them more interesting. Similarly, I already agreed with political stance that Mate takes with respect to the “War on Drugs” and so I am not sure how convincing his arguments are. What I can say is that this is not meant to be a comprehensive account of the problems with the “War on Drugs”, and Mate wisely directs the reader to more complete resources. One of the aspects I enjoyed most about “In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts” was the way Mate tied together spiritual teachings with science and medicine. While he certainly does not promote any particular dogma or religion (in fact, quotes from most major religions can be found in one place or another), Mate understands that great teachers of any tradition often have insights that can be usefully applied to modern problems. Furthermore, the truth of much of this wisdom has been borne out by recent scientific studies, so Mate feels free to use either argument (or both) to make his point. While I suspect his writing in these chapters may be a bit tough to follow for a reader who has not studied some form of mindfulness, “In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts” is probably the best book I have read for drawing links between ancient and modern wisdom.My only complaint with “In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts” was that there could have been more discussion of why some substances or behaviours are more addictive than others. In his pursuit of the conclusion that drugs aren't the cause of addiction (a void in an individual's life is the real cause), Mate tends to blend all potentially addictive substances and behaviours together. While it is true that anything can have addictive properties, there are clear differences in the ease with which addictions can arise. “In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts” is not just a book for addicts or people who work with them; it is the kind of book that everyone would benefit from reading. As Mate writes, how we treat addicts is a reflection of our entire society, and anyone wanting to make a positive difference in the world can start by taking a good look at the way we think about drug addicts."
11,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12620745-debbie-dj,5,"This is the most comprehensive, thoroughly studied look at addiction I have ever read. Gabor Mate is a physician who works in one of Vancouver's roughest areas, The Portland Hotel Society, a building housing for the unhousable. Mate begins by introducing us to some of his patients, their horrific backgrounds, current addictions, and survival on the streets. Many are so heartbreaking I had to stop reading for awhile. Mate then goes into a very scientific look at the brains of addicts. He details how our minds are wired during the first three years of our life. Addicts are set up for addiction during this time, often because of the environment they are born into. The amount of stress and dysfunction the mother was under during this time can actually rewire a child's brain to a predisposition for addiction. I found the amount of research on this fascinating, completely debunking the genetic theory. Mate ties this in with how addicts are often treated as the lowest of the low, when in reality the brain was set up for it in it's wiring.America's ""war on drugs"" is also looked at very closely in this book. Mate's research proves it doesn't work. He looks at other countries who have decriminalized drugs with great success and explains why we seem to be so stuck on old ideas that don't work. He leaves us with many options for recovery and a chance for addicts to find sobriety.I was amazed by the many areas that Mate goes into with such depth and clarity. I learned a lot about the root cause of addiction, that addicts are just people whose very brains were rewired in an attempt to survive outward stresses. If our society could offer compassion instead of ""war"" the amount of suffering for all would decrease. The costs involved in offering true help far outweigh it's alternative where addicts are forced to steal for money, where dirty needles kill, medical treatment soars, and we can't build prisons fast enough. We could have a world of compassion and true help for those who want it. I can't say enough about a book so packed full of information other than it takes awhile to read, but it is well worth the effort."
12,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1235793-reid,2,"This book about addictions of all types has much to recommend it. Maté has a wealth of experience with severe drug addiction, and he has obviously done his homework. But he has a tendency to go on and on (an addiction of its own!) and the book becomes tedious. He belabors many of his arguments and piles documentation upon documentation until one is bewildered by the sheer volume of the verbiage. What the author could most benefit from is a strict editor who could make this book about 2/3 its current length.Dr. Maté also seems to have several axes to grind here, and makes a case for a particular approach to the treatment of addiction that is far from proven. He also takes issue with the genetic source of addictions and spends an inordinate amount of time making this case, although there really is no question about this issue; there is a proven genetic basis to addiction, and his argument that there is not is mostly a waste of time, not merely because the science is not with him, but because it really doesn't matter much. The case he makes for environmental causes of addiction is compelling and whether there is any genetic component is, in the final analysis, mostly irrelevant.Unfortunately, such digressions and jeremiads are rife in this book. Had he merely stuck to what he knows, supplemented here and there with some support for his pet theories, both he and the reader (not to mention addicts) would have been much better served. One wishes him well in his chosen work with hardcore injection addicts in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, and in battling his own addictions, minor in comparison, but still a real struggle, which he has the honesty and courage to reveal. Still and all, what one mainly ends up wishing for him is an authoritative editor with an outsized red pen. "
13,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2160001-jack-hart,5,"This is a book about ""the social origins of addictive drives."" Its argument, in a nutshell, is that we get hooked on stuff because our brains don't get what our brains all need and can come to crave: To know and be known by others, beginning in the family. That's a very bald statement of the thesis of a wonderfully deep, far-reaching, and honest book. The author is the staff physician at the Portland Hotel Society in Vancouver, Canada--an experimental treatment program for drug addicts which provides, in addition to food and a place to stay, a ""clean injection site"" where addicts can take their street drugs in a well lit place with clean needles provided by a medical staff which is also on hand to treat the horrific consequences of long term drug addiction. ""The core intention is to take people as they are--no matter how dysfunctional, troubled, and troubling they may be."" So Dr. Mate lives with these all too human humans, and this book flows out of that experience. But it's a wide, wide ranging book. He tells the unvarnished stories of the lives of some of his patients, while also revealing the inner life, sometimes ugly, he leads as their physician. He then puts addiction on a spectrum, from substance addiction to ""high status addictions"" like workaholism--and explores contemporary brain science to reveal what is coming to be understood as the the social-developmental-neuroscience of addictive drives. There's an clear position taken concerning ""the war on drugs,"" and while I think his fear of drug legalization as a beginning policy remedy is unfounded, what he does have to say is wise and compassionate and reveals a heretofore undiscovered viewpoint in a heretofore unheard voice. A few reviews complained that the book meanders, and if you're someone who only reads books for classes you might find that to be the case. The reader has to be a bit patient with Dr. Mate, but I rate him highly as a prose stylist. Every couple of pages you'll probably find an offhand sentence that sizzles your brain. And the argument, to my reading, never looses itself as it goes all over the place to bring its soft flooding light to an old and seemingly all too familiar problem. I put this book on my Buddhist shelf because to my mind it's informed by exactly the intensely practical insights and vulnerable stances produced by secular Buddhist spirituality at its best. But that said, except for the title allusion to Buddhist cosmology and a few scattered references to Buddha as kind of the brand name for mindfulness, it's not a book by a Buddhist or in any direct way about Buddhism. But if one can be a Bodhisattva without being a Buddhist...then oh my gosh he is."
14,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13639920-erin,4,"E. suggested I read “In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts” as part of my introduction to Vancouver, and gosh but was he right in recommending it.The book’s author, Gregor Mate, is a doctor who works in Vancouver’s notorious downtown eastside - a neighbourhood known for being a drug zone. Mate uses interviews and character sketches of his patients as the individual grounding for his discussion of the causes and outcomes of addiction, as well as the detrimental drug policies that currently govern drug addicts’ behaviour. The chapters vary among first person reflections on his own addicted behaviour, reflections on the life experiences of his patients, accessible descriptions of brain science and development and exhortations for evidence based addictions/drug policies.The book is, simply put, brilliant. Mate methodically lays out his argument all the while drawing in personal narratives that make the science not only accessible but entirely compelling. The reader cares about addictions science and drug laws because we are made to know the addicts - ourselves! - as people. The demand that we reserve judgement because we too, find ourselves in addicted patterns, or because we begin to understand the lack-of-choice inherent in addicts’ actions, persuasively asks us to reconsider our long held judgements about those addicted to X or Z.I’m anxious for someone I know to read the book, too, so that I might discuss the ending - a suggestion that the ‘cure’ for addicted behaviour might be meditation and mindfulness - and the overarching premise of the book that addiction isn’t so much a choice as a set of circumstances thrust upon that must be chosen against, refused, rather than actively sought. My local library is hosting a book club night on the book, and I’m eager to go and hear what others in my community thought of the book, but I’d really (really) like for you to read it, too, and let me know your thoughts.Given how much I’m struggling to sort out how to reconcile the gross inequality I’ve been encountering in Vancouver, and given my own (relative) addictions, the book has been incredible in provoking thought, challenging assumptions, and arguing for a kind of generosity to the self and to others that is otherwise unspoken."
15,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/808339-kony,5,"An engaging and eye-opening education about addiction’s psychosocial, neurological, biochemical roots — and its destructive consequences — and the folly of our country’s military/criminal approach to what's really a social, emotional, cultural problem.What’s impelled me to stay engaged with this fat paperback, reading for 3+ hours at a time? Not the bare desire to learn the facts, nor the shock value of these facts — but rather the author’s voice, his personality, the world of memories and regrets and tragedies he’s constructed through vivid characters, interactions, street scenes.It’s with an anecdote that he opens the book, and it’s with a personal confession that he hammers home a central point: that no one is above falling prey to addiction. (Not even a bestselling author-doctor whose fame derives from treating addicts.) This notion — that there’s a potential addict in all of us — might be harder for readers to swallow if not encapsulated in such a daring act of self-exposure.Vulnerable truth-telling invites enlightened listening — and perhaps further acts of vulnerable truth-telling — which might then snowball…Maybe *this* interpersonal process is the real key to social change."

18,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7406091-missy-j,3,"Finally finished this book. For some reason, I thought that my sister highly recommended this book to me (she doesn't recall this) and I saw that one of my GR friends named it the best book she read in 2012. I liked Gabor Mate's work, but it's not mind-blowing nor the best thing that I read this year.Gabor Mate, a doctor in Vancouver and has worked intensively with drug addicts and in this book gives us his thoughts and findings about addiction in general. ""Addiction is often a misguided attempt to relieve stress, but misguided only in the long term. In the short term addictive substances and behaviours do act as stress relievers.""""...definition of addiction: any repeated behaviour, substance-related or not, in which a person feels compelled to persist, regardless of its negative impact on his life and the lives of others. The distinguishing features of any addiction are: compulsion, preoccupation, impaired control, persistence, relapse and craving."" I found his dealings with his drug addict patients very interesting and Mate is more of the opinion that environment has a greater influence on humans than simple genetics.Almost all addicts that Mate came across, suffered some kind of sexual abuse as children. Mate also points out that mother's who are stressed during their pregnancy have a negative impact on the baby's brain development. He also explains that the loss of traditional culture has made indigenous people more susceptible to addiction to soothe their pain. Mate himself was born in Budapest during WWII and was separated from his Jewish mother at a very young age so other people could take care of him outside the ghetto. Unfortunately, I didn't find his music addiction or workaholic attitude to be very good comparisons to the addictions suffered by the drug addicts. Overall, I think I did get a few new ideas and information regarding drug addiction. But some of it was written in a somewhat messy way that I feel I didn't get all of it. Sometimes his way of reasoning was very strange and just a subtle way of saying something different. I didn't like that. And it's a long book so I lost track of the names of the drug addicts. Some quotes below:""If I've learned anything, it's that I have to be responsible for my own fear of emptiness."" - Daniel, son of Gabor Mate.""Being able to lighten up is the key to feeling at home with your body, mind and emotions, to feeling worthy of living on this planet...In addition to a sense of humor, a basic support for a joyful mind is curiosity, paying attention...Happiness is not required, but being curious without a heavy judgmental attitude helps. If you are judgmental, you can even be curious about that. -Pema Chodron"""
19,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8621857-crystal,5,"I highly recommend this book to anyone who knows anyone with substance abuse or OCD issues. Somehow Maté makes this work of nonfiction feel so much lighter than other nonfiction works about addiction and neuroscience. His humanization of the real-life characters and acceptance of his own reactions and behaviors as a person is admirable. As a fan of pop-neuroscience books, I have to say that this is perhaps the most valuable one I know of.Through the true stories of individuals in his care, Maté reframes the idea of addiction and how we treat people who suffer in its grip. Never gratuitous, the tales function as illustrations of his research and findings, as well as conclusions drawn by other doctors and scientists. It is sad, but it all serves a purpose: to educate the reader and require us to consider how we think about and treat other people.Maté is no saint. Part of the admirable humanness of the nature of this book is Maté's willingness to reveal his own thoughts with sometimes brutal honesty. He admits to being fed up with his patients, being angry with them, and at times losing his cool. But he continues his work, and uses his position as an opportunity to help people who have refused or are unable to help themselves, as well as a vehicle to instill understanding in others. He even recognizes symptoms of his patients' behaviors in himself, albeit in a much less debilitating form. Through reading this book, I have gained knowledge about neuroscience and scientific research into the cause and effect of addictive behaviors. I have also gained a bit of patience and understanding toward my fellow man, which is perhaps more valuable than all the facts and data, at least in my everyday life. While I don't work directly with drug addicts, I have worked in fields that put me in close contact with some very frustrating people. People I have tried to help but who were unwilling or unable to create lasting change in their lives. So even though my work was somewhat unrelated, this book has given me some peace of mind as well as the calmness to digest and react to difficult people without judgment or undue stress.I am currently reading it for the second time, and I continue to be awed by the relevance and usefulness of the book. It's not for the faint of heart, but I would argue that it should be required reading for anyone working in public service. It's easy enough to read that almost anyone could comprehend it, and the subject is only growing in importance."
20,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57539558-noah-graham,1,"Maté wants to be a Liberal/Jewish/Buddhist saint. I want to get true and interesting information about drug addiction. For much of the book our goals were in conflict. He discusses how he was no better than the junkies he treated. Because he was addicted. To.Classical. Music. He does incredible mental gymnastics to believe in free will while simultaneously claiming that 100% of addiction is due to stressful childhoods (including prenatal development). Checking over historical hard drug use rates in the UK I did find spikes occurring as children born or conceived during the second world war came of age, consistent with his claim that early life stress was a factor. I however was also able to confirm that the vast majority of people who had been through childhoods far rougher than those of many modern north american drug addicts did not in fact get addicted to drugs, hinting at genetic factors(or ""free will"" ;-P ).  He promotes a vision of mental health as being a person who observes their own mental state with a sort of impartial compassionate curiosity. Which essentially means living life constantly wasting the vast majority of your brain power second guessing your own thoughts and feelings. Recovering schizophrenics need to do that. It's part of the reason they seem slow and emotionally dead when you talk to them.  His proposal to end the war on drugs and refocus societies efforts on harm reduction seems sensible based on the data he provides. But based on the rest of the book he is a total 白左 who would rather virtue signal than think, so I have to wonder what our grandparents who'd seen a world before the war on drugs, yet voted for the war on drugs election after election, knew that he isn't telling."
21,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12112147-colin,5,"Gabor Maté has empathy for the people so many of us feel justified in fearing, hating, patronizing, and certainly not giving spare change to: hard-core injection drug users. His book tells such sad stories, for they are gut-wrenching stories that have led people to use, even when it brings lifelong debility and utter isolation. What the book does next is join these stories with clear and cogent accounts of the neurology involved in addiction. And interwoven throughout is a remarkable story of self-discovery on the part of the author.I'd heard Maté speak publicly in Seattle once, and I was utterly drawn in. I wept that evening. This book leaves me more hopeful, because it offers the one thing that can move beyond the personal tragedies of addiction, namely understanding.The book is not perfect. There are times when I wish Maté would talk less about himself. There are some things he might address more explicitly, too. He refers several times to sociological studies of the effects of the War on Drugs while referring the reader on to other sources for the hard data. That is appropriate, but not entirely satisfying. However, these features of the book don't detract from the basic insight it provides into how the mind works, and how close (""but for the grace of God"") any of us could come to it all going wrong. I think they make that message more prominent."
22,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1457751-jesse,5,"Far and away the most insightful, intelligent, and illuminating thing I've read on the subject of addiction-- especially drug addiction, but also behavioural addiction. I drew out the process of reading it for days in the hopes that I'd absorb it better-- particularly details about the neurophysiology of addiction and the chain of influence that leads an individual to become addictive. The book's only weakness is Maté's tendency to discuss his own compulsive and addictive behaviour (work addiction and compulsive shopping) as though it's in the same league as the life-destroying addictions of the patients he treats on Vancouver's downtown east side. Still, he has a point: that addictions (small and relatively harmless, like his, or huge and cataclysmic, like the people he profiles through the book) all stem from the same neurological and emotional sources. In the end, the book is an integral document for those interested in understanding addiction as a complex medical, social, and psychological issue rather than holding (and, inevitably, shouting) a baseless moral opinion about it. Absolutely necessary for any person with an opinion on drugs, drug addiction, drug law policy, addiction policy, harm reduction, or recovery. For everyone else I strongly recommend it as well."
23,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12022539-david,5,"This book totally transformed my understanding of addiction and especially injection drug users and crack smokers.

24,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56665414-michael-mulligan,5,"It's no coincidence that a foster kid with ADHD, who gets shuffled from home to home to home, and doesn't form any lasting bonds with anyone, and falls behind every year in school, might turn to cocaine. Dr Maté’s first hand descriptions of clients he has personally served, working first hand with the poor and addicted, are devastating. He draws from twenty years of experience working on East Hastings and Main, in downtown Vancouver (a locus in Canada that draws homeless addicts from all over the country, largely for its unique tropical geography, and for its progressive slant on drug policy). He describes cages of the mind. There is often seemingly no where for for homeless addicts to go. Dr Maté describes the problems that plague the life of an addict living on the streets. Paying for an addiction like heroin or crack-cocaine is a full-time unconventional job that becomes all-encompassing, and results in a life that reinforces shame, persecutory delusions, and a deterioration of health. Dr Maté also rightly discusses our historically misguided approach to treating addicts. Misguided is an understatement. The war on drugs been disastrous. He points out that Canada spends three dollars on law enforcement of drug crimes for every dollar it spends on treatment services, and argues this is completely backwards. It's hard to disagree with him. Now, the withering effects of a life of street drugs can take their toll, and many of the most impoverished end up endangering their own life, and sometimes the lives of others. And remember here, many addicts suffered childhood trauma many of us would find unimaginable. Things disintegrate, and sending people with chemical addictions to prison denies addicts the support they need to put their lives together. We need an alternative intervention, other than just locking people up, who desperately need help.I appreciate Dr Maté pushing back against genetic determinism in conversations about addiction. Now, I personally believe people could have inclinations of one kind or another, and understanding these inclinations might help to understand what intervention might be best suited for them. But that's aside the point. In too many conversations about the role of genes in human behavior, there's an implicit genetic stereotyping, an over-playing of genetic determinism, and the overall effect creates too many glass ceilings of the mind. Many people are tired of being told they are not capable of something based on their genetic constitution. So I appreciate him pushing back against the limiting roles such conversations often cast.  Dr Maté discusses the impact of addiction on Indigenous communities. Many have been stripped of authorship of their life and culture, and have suffered displacement and violence. Dr Maté discusses the role this suffering plays in addiction for members in Indigenous communities in Canada. It serves to better understand fraught relations between some members of the Indigenous community with the RCMP. While there have been many improvements made in Canada’s drug policy, emphasizing more care and concern, imprisoning members of historically oppressed minorities is not a good way to build trust and reconciliation. And all for the crime of what historian and author Yuval Harari calls in his book Homo Deus, the “biological pursuit of happiness.” Dr Maté does not leave the reader on a hopeful note. In the book he discusses his own unique unconventional addiction and alludes to painful circumstances in his own childhood that contributed. A lot has improved since Dr Maté published his book in 2008. He has rightly gained the attention and appreciation of many people and authorities interested in changing our intervention style, on the personal level, and the systems level. Safe injection sites are opening in big cities across Canada, and there is growing empathy for the lived-realities of addicts. A great follow-up read is Chasing the Scream by Johann Hari. It dives into the over 100-year war on drugs and examines legalization and decriminalization in countries like Switzerland and Portugal and examines the staggering improvements such countries made when switching their policies from criminalizing addicts, to finding them the help they need."
25,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10790800-katie,5,"This book clearly articulates how addiction is a complex biological chemical, neurological, psychological, medical, emotional, political, economic and spiritual issue. Dr. Mate illustrates that in order to understand addictions, we must first begin to understand the culture that helps to create them. We must look at the systemic oppressions and injustices that lay the foundations for addictive behavior and the cycles of abuse and neglect that perpetuate them. In the US, drug addiction is considered a criminal problem. Addicts are criminalized, and have limited to no access to medical treatment and care. The studies show that evidence for the effectiveness of detoxification is poor and that methadone efficacy is high. As a country, we are denying the facts in order to push forth with the illusion of ""the war on drugs."" The war being against the drug addicted, the disenfranchised, oppressed and most neglected and abused of our population. Dr Mate States that ""So long as a society ostracizes the addict and the legal system does everything it can to heighten the drug problem, the welfare and medical systems can aim only to mitigate some of its effects."" This book is an incredible read and powerful testament to the work we have to do as a society to heal our culture of addiction."
26,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7831534-john-dutt,5,"A really important book for anyone affected by addiction. I thought it was well written with the personal stories a nice mix in with the more scholarly information. I do think at times the info is a bit repetitive and could be condensed a bit. I felt I learned quite a bit more about the true causes of most addiction and that we almost all struggle with some type of addictive behavior. Personally the quest to avoid suffering and hold too strongly to pleasure had become the basis of how I was living. Better understanding that my brain is not my mind/consciousness and that freedom comes from being able to work to make my automatic mental mechanisms subject to my conscious awareness is huge for me. Mr. Mate did a great job of solidifying this concept for me in this book. The concept of “compassionate curiosity” has also been a game changer for me. I wish more policy makers understood addiction as explained in this book as it really could positively change the communities in which we live. “The addict abhors the present moment, the burden of the past and fear of the future. Most of us resemble the drug addict in our efforts to fill the spiritual black hole in our consumerist, acquisition-, action-, image-mad culture.”"

Here's who should most urgently read this book:-- lawmakers & policymakers-- anyone working in the criminal ""justice"" system-- law enforcement officers-- anyone considering conceiving or adopting a child-- parents of babies & children-- anyone working in child care or child education-- anyone with addicts or alcoholics in their life-- anyone trying to understand their own addictive behaviorHowever, I feel strongly that everyone could gain a lot of knowledge and understanding from this book, not just addicts and those closely affected by addiction."
28,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43138169-d-iugas-babenskas,5,"This book was a beautiful opportunity to stare into my own abyss for longer than usual without fear or shame. As a young adult with an unpleasant upbringing, lack of potential fulfilment and being formerly rejected by a loved one after half-decade relationship I, too, carry a void inside—nothing exotic, just an ordinary human despair-fear-anxiety factory. That leaves me free to use the addictions for self-soothing and to justify doing so by citing my “unmet” needs. In other words, the consequences of my own wilful refusal to be a mature, self-regulating adult became my rationale for pursuing addictive behaviours.And I struggle with my craving for expanded consciousness and bliss. It's a natural, human desire. And addiction ""is the lazy man’s path to transcendence” as well as “a poor substitute for love"". I remember words from David Lynch, that I desperately want to believe in:""Besides, far more profound experiences are available naturally. When your consciousness stars expanding, those experiences are there. All those things can be seen. It's just a matter of expanding that ball of consciousness. And the ball of consciousness can expand to be infinite and unbounded. It's totality. You can have totality.”""Maybe what matters is not the features of our character or the drives and instincts per se, but rather the stand we take toward them. And the capacity to take such a stand is what makes us human beings."""

Because let’s be honest: if I urged you to read it, would you? Probably not. You’re not an addict; you don’t even know any. It’s simply not a factor in our lives. But oh, yes, it is. And this book is so much more besides.If I was forced to describe this book in one word, I’d go for two: compassion and reason. Reason, because Maté repeatedly demonstrates what works for addiction prevention and treatment, and what shows hope, with years of evidence to back his assertions. (He also shows what doesn’t work: the moronic US ""war"" approach. But you knew that already). Compassion, because every page brims with it. The hard stuff, requiring self-knowledge and inner work, not smarmy feel-good platitudes. And if I could add one more word, it would be “early childhood environment is crucial”. (There’s probably a language somewhere in which that is one word. I wish all languages were thus.)And, can he ever write. It’s a long book, and not quick reading, but it’s exquisite reading."
31,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38669514-robert,5,"I think this is an important book. There’s lots of great stuff in here, although I also believe there’s some serious overreach and too many distractions. There’s no doubt that there is excellent clinical guidance about relating to people with addiction problems. However, there’s some questionable claims about science. And remember, the greater the claim the grafter must be the evidence. It is way too early to tell whether all trauma is rooted in adverse childhood experiences. Also, the claim that anxiety exists without an object (not tied to a specific cause) is ambitious at best. The distractions are attempts to relate clinical observations to sweeping sociological cause that are also weakly based in science or evidence, in the most generous reading. Additionally, there is a paternalistic almost fetish fawning for aboriginal culture that cherry picks a few examples without considering a broader examination.However, go back to the clinical guidance that addiction must be examined as a whole life problem, not just a narrow issue of genes or physical compulsion and you get to the heart and strength of this book. And all that good outweighs the dross for me."

Anyone who deals with addicts or addiction. This book is beautifully and insightfully written. With level of compassion that I have rarely before witnessed. Mate makes an inarguable case for the position that addiction is not in fact a genetic problem, throughout his work with addicts and examining his own addiction, Mate details sound reasoning of how addiction is the result of societal influence that often begins even in utero. It's just a wonderful read, not only for those I mentioned before, but for anyone wanting a little inspiration to be more compassionate out there in the world. After reading it, I understood how addiction is so pervasive, not just substance abuse, but that so many of us are addicted to what are considered every day things or to certain ideology or trains of thought. And it made me want to understand that about people and treat them with more compassion, even when they seem to deserve it the least. "

"
34,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/544623-ellen,0,"This book by a Canadian doctor describes addiction as a human response to trauma and an attempt to fill painful emptiness from the outside. The author says that most of his patients suffered terrible trauma in childhood and that such trauma can change the way the brain develops and affect later responses to stress. He argues against the hereditary theory of addiction. I find this interesting because in my experience working with mentally ill adults, I have also learned that most of them suffered extreme trauma as children. The doctor also recognizes behavior addiction such as obsessive hobbies or compulsive striving as stemming from the same hungry ghost syndrome. He confesses his own addiction to classical music, which is kind of laughable in that not many people would see this as a bad thing, but he does demonstrate how it causes problems."

Dr. Mate is a physician that serves the homeless and often drug addicted population on Vancouver, BC's eastside. This book is about his experiences there. The first few chapters literally rocked my world. I am working with a research study that often involves addicts or former addicts. And what he said, and how he said it, rang completely true. It turns out, addicts are people too. It turns out, addicts are us. It turns out that there is hope, but the hope comes from compassion, not judgement. Not the War on Drugs. I really think everyone should read this book to deeply understand the anxiety-ridden life of those that are addicted. There are, truth be told, parts that are a bit of a slog and the writing is sometimes repetitive, but the goods parts are truly worth it. "

He does present compelling and heartbreaking accounts of addiction and helps you understand the psychology of addiction which has bearings in pain (even though he doesn't delve into or brush on what pain may have brought about his addiction or the unresolved issue at the core of his binge spending). In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts also does get a bit repetitive. I'm still a huge fan of Dr. Mate's work. "

Lots of good nature v. nurture discussion too. If there's one take away for me it's the reinforcement of the common sense notion that raising children in a supportive, nurturing way would spare or at least mitigate the vast majority of problems so many of us humans experience later in life."

It connects so many dots, from addiction, to the War on Drugs, to child sexual abuse, to childhood development, to brain chemistry, to psychology, to social service cuts, and much much more. Reading this book is an education in humanity and in the horrors of capitalism. As Mate says, looking at drug addicts is like looking in a ""dark mirror"" that reflects exactly what is wrong with our society.After reading this, now I see that we are ALL addicted to capitalism, and we need not ""economic recovery,"" which is impossible, but recovery FROM capitalism, to re-gain our self-sufficiency and self-determination."

This cycle continues with self help, introspection, harm reduction, active curiosity to practical advice how to deal with addicts. And myriad other topics related to addiction.I really like the style because it starts from reality and then explains the theory. Addicts are people and their background and stories form this complex web of causalities taking us to their addictive behaviours. Their behaviour isn't just to be judged, but to be understood.

Some medical nonfiction material but mostly a narrative of his encounters with those lost in the realms of hungry ghosts the people suffering from addiction. The author humanizes his patients who are so casually dehumanized by most people as junkies and dopers. It is as if opening one's heart to the level of suffering and trouble surrounding is too much for most people that we shunt them of as depraved losers makes it much easier to turn away from such trouble.

Perhaps the perfect book to read in Canada on October 17th, 2018.It expired before I could finish it but I'm still comfortable giving it a 5/5. The first third is vignettes from working in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, but after that it is an excellent treastise on addiction, pain, the human condition and early childhood trauma. I'll even recommend it as a parenting book as the section talking about the role of attunement on child development helps motivate me to put down the phone and look my children in the eyes.In the introduction, the author addresses complaints that he compares his own white collar addictions to the life destroying addictions of his patients but I appreciated that he did so because made it easier to relate his words to my own life. When I was younger I have described myself as having an ""addictive personality"" and this book helped me re-word this to it being my own response to developmental trauma. I've lost myself in video games, reading, internet, social media, blogging, food, coffee, etc. All very socially acceptable addictions but I've hurt people who cared about me and taken advantage of people's trust while following addictions.One useful mindshift I got was thinking about ""what am I doing to get my dopamine hit and how does that affect my life"". For me, In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts integrated well with the ideas I got from ""Capture: A Theory of the Mind"" by David Kessler that (from my other review)Of particular interest is the last part of the book where he posits that the way to cure a negative capture of the brain is by replacing it with a positive capture (what the Buddhists would call an antidote). Examples of curing capture through replacement include alcoholics anonymous replacing addiction with religion/community, the buddhist practice of replacing anger with metta/lovingkindness. He has various examples of people whose lives are damaged by trauma who eventually find a cause/service and use that to escape the traumaWhen I look at my own life, have I dealt with my trauma and addiction or have I found antidotes by converting my addictions into healthy passions and self-care?Excellent narration from the author's son, which added an interesting dimension to it.“There is no addiction centre in the brain, no circuits designated strictly for addictive purposes. The brain systems involved in addiction are among the key organizers and motivators of human emotional life and behaviour; hence, addiction’s powerful hold on human beings.” “In the cloudy swirl of misleading ideas surrounding public discussion of addiction, there’s one that stands out: the misconception that drug taking by itself will lead to addiction—in other words, that the cause of addiction resides in the power of the drug over the human brain. It is one of the bedrock fables sustaining the so-called War on Drugs.” “The war [on drugs] mentality represents an unfortunate confluence of ignorance, fear, prejudice, and profit. ... The ignorance exists in its own right and is further perpetuated by government propaganda. The fear is that of ordinary people scared by misinformation but also that of leaders who may know better but are intimidated by the political costs of speaking out on such a heavily moralized and charged issue. The prejudice is evident in the contradiction that some harmful substances (alcohol, tobacco) are legal while others, less harmful in some ways, are contraband. This has less to do with the innate danger of the drugs than with which populations are publicly identified with using the drugs. The white and wealthier the population, the more acceptable is the substance. And profit. If you have fear, prejudice, and ignorance, there will be profit.” “The question is never “Why the addiction?” but “Why the pain?” The research literature is unequivocal: most hard-core substance abusers come from abusive homes.” “Being cut off from our own natural self-compassion is one of the greatest impairments we can suffer. Along with our ability to feel our own pain go our best hopes for healing, dignity and love. What seems nonadapative and self-harming in the present was, at some point in our lives, an adaptation to help us endure what we then had to go through. If people are addicted to self-soothing behaviours, it's only because in their formative years they did not receive the soothing they needed. Such understanding helps delete toxic self-judgment on the past and supports responsibility for the now. Hence the need for compassionate self-inquiry.” “Not all addictions are rooted in abuse or trauma, but I do believe they can all be traced to painful experience. A hurt is at the centre of all addictive behaviours. It is present in the gambler, the Internet addict, the compulsive shopper and the workaholic. The wound may not be as deep and the ache not as excruciating, and it may even be entirely hidden—but it’s there. As we’ll see, the effects of early stress or adverse experiences directly shape both the psychology and the neurobiology of addiction in the brain.” “It is impossible to understand addiction without asking what relief the addict finds, or hopes to find, in the drug or the addictive behaviour.” “In the real world there is no nature vs. nurture argument, only an infinitely complex and moment-by-moment interaction between genetic and environmental effects” “At the core of every addiction is an emptiness based in abject fear. The addict dreads and abhors the present moment; she bends feverishly only toward the next time, the moment when her brain, infused with her drug of choice, will briefly experience itself as liberated from the burden of the past and the fear of the future—the two elements that make the present intolerable. Many of us resemble the drug addict in our ineffectual efforts to fill in the spiritual black hole, the void at the center, where we have lost touch with our souls, our spirit—with those sources of meaning and value that are not contingent or fleeting. Our consumerist, acquisition-, action-, and image-mad culture only serves to deepen the hole, leaving us emptier than before. The constant, intrusive, and meaningless mind-whirl that characterizes the way so many of us experience our silent moments is, itself, a form of addiction—and it serves the same purpose. “One of the main tasks of the mind is to fight or remove the emotional pain, which is one of the reasons for its incessant activity, but all it can ever achieve is to cover it up temporarily. In fact, the harder the mind struggles to get rid of the pain, the greater the pain.” So writes Eckhart Tolle. ""Vulnerability is our susceptibility to be wounded. This fragility is part of our nature and cannot be escaped. The best the brain can do is to shut down conscious awareness of it when pain becomes so vast or unbearable that it threatens our ability to function. The automatic repression of painful emotion is a helpful child's prime defence mechanism and can enable the child to endure trauma otherwise be catastrophic. The unfortunate consequence is a wholesale dulling of emotional awareness.” “What seems like a reaction to some present circumstance is, in fact, a reliving of past emotional experience. This subtle but pervasive process in the body, brain, and nervous system has been called implicit memory, as compared to the explicit memory apparatus that recalls events, facts, and circumstances. According to the psychologist and memory researcher Daniel Schacter, implicit memory is active “when people are influenced by past experience without any awareness that they are remembering.… If we are unaware that something is influencing our behavior, there is little we can do to understand or counteract it. The subtle, virtually undetectable nature of implicit memory is one reason it can have powerful effects on our mental lives.”Whenever a person “overreacts”—that is, reacts in a way that seems inappropriately exaggerated to the situation at hand—we can be sure that implicit memory is at work. The reaction is not to the irritant in the present but to some buried hurt in the past. Many of us look back puzzled on some emotional explosion and ask ourselves, “What the heck was that about?” It was about implicit memory; we just didn’t realize it at the time.” “The other mind entity is what we call the impartial observer. This mind of present-moment awareness stands outside the preprogrammed physiological determinants and is alive to the present. It works through the brain but is not limited to the brain. It may be dormant in many of us, but it is never completely absent. It transcends the automatic functioning of past-conditioned brain circuits. ‘In the end,...I conclude that there is no good evidence… that the brain alone can carry out the work that the mind does.”Knowing oneself comes from attending with compassionate curiosity to what is happening within. Methods for gaining self-knowledge and self-mastery through conscious awareness strengthen the mind’s capacity to act as its own impartial observer. Among the simplest and most skilful of the meditative techniques taught in many spiritual traditions is the disciplined practice of what Buddhists call ‘bare attention’. Nietzsche called Buddha ‘that profound physiologist’ and his teachings less a religion than a ‘kind of hygiene’...’ Many of our automatic brain processes have to do with either wanting something or not wanting something else – very much the way a small child’s mental life functions. We are forever desiring or longing, or judging and rejecting. Mental hygiene consists of noticing the ebb and flow of all those automatic grasping or rejecting impulses without being hooked by then. Bare attention is directed not only toward what’s happening on the outside, but also to what’s taking place on the inside.‘Be at least interested in your reactions as in the person or situation that triggers them.’... In a mindful state one can choose to be aware of the ebb and flow of emotions and thought patterns instead of brooding on their content. Not ‘he did this to me therefore I’m suffering’ but ‘I notice that feelings of resentment and a desire for vengeance keep flooding my mind.’... ‘Bare Attention is the clear and single-minded awareness of what actually happens to us and in us at the successive moments of perception,’... ‘It is called ‘Bare’ because it attends just to the bare facts of a perception as presented either through the five physical senses of through the mind without reacting to them.” ""Intuitively we all know that it’s better to feel than not to feel. Beyond their energizing subjective change, emotions have crucial survival value. They orient us, interpret the world for us and offer us vital information. They tell us what is dangerous and what is benign, what threatens our existence and what will nurture our growth. Imagine how disabled we would be if we could not see or hear or taste or sense heat or cold or physical pain. Emotional shutdown is similar. Our emotions are an indispensable part of our sensory apparatus and an essential part of who we are. They make life worthwhile, exciting, challenging, beautiful and meaningful. When we flee our vulnerability, we lose our full capacity for feeling emotion. We may even become emotional amnesiacs, not remembering ever having felt truly elated or truly sad. A nagging void opens, and we experience it as alienation, as profound as ennui, as the sense of deficient emptiness…”“We may not be responsible for another’s addiction or the life history that preceded it, but many painful situations could be avoided if we recognized that we are responsible for the way we ourselves enter into the interaction. And that, to put it most simply, means dealing with our own stuff.” “It’s a subtle thing, freedom. It takes effort; it takes attention and focus to not act something like an automaton. Although we do have freedom, we exercise it only when we strive for awareness, when we are conscious not just of the content of the mind but also of the mind itself as a process.’We may say, then, that in the world of the psyche, freedom is a relative concept: the power to choose exists only when our automatic mechanisms are subject to those brain systems that are able to maintain conscious awareness. A person experiences greater or less freedom from one situation to the next, from one interaction to the next, from one moment to the next. Anyone whose automatic brain mechanisms habitually run in overdrive has diminished capacity for free decision making, especially if the parts of the brain that facilitate conscious choice are impaired or underdeveloped.” “people jeopardize their lives for the sake of making the moment livable. Nothing sways them from the habit—not illness, not the sacrifice of love and relationship, not the loss of all earthly goods, not the crushing of their dignity, not the fear of dying. The drive is that relentless.” “Much of what we do arises from automatic programming that bypasses conscious awareness and may even run contrary to our intentions, as Dr. Schwartz points out:The passive side of mental life, which is generated solely and completely by brain mechanisms, dominates the tone and tenor of our day-to-day, even our second-to-second experience. During the quotidian business of daily life, the brain does indeed operate very much as a machine does.Decisions that we may believe to be freely made can arise from unconscious emotional drives or subliminal beliefs. They can be dictated by events of which we have no recollection. The stronger a person’s automatic brain mechanisms and the weaker the parts of the brain that can impose conscious control, the less true freedom that person will be able to exercise in her life. In OCD, and in many other conditions, no matter how intelligent and well-meaning the individual, the malfunctioning brain circuitry may override rational judgment and intention. Almost any human being when overwhelmed by stress or powerful emotions, will act or react not from intention but from mechanisms that are set off deep in the brain, rather than being generated in the conscious and volitional segments of the cortex. When acting from a driven or triggered state, we are not free.” ""There is no such thing as a good addiction. Everything a person can do is better done if there is no addictive attachment that pollutes it. For every addiction—no matter how benign or even laudable it seems from the outside—someone pays a price.” “What we call the personality is often a jumble of genuine traits and adopted coping styles that do not reflect our true self at all but the loss of it.” “But as we have seen, hard-core drug users do not wait to be “enabled,” and there are few harsh consequences they haven’t yet experienced. There is no evidence from anywhere in the world that harm-reduction measures encourage drug use. Denying addicts humane assistance multiplies their miseries without bringing them one inch closer to recovery.” “Any passion can become an addiction; but then how to distinguish between the two? The central question is: who’s in charge, the individual or their behaviour? It’s possible to rule a passion, but an obsessive passion that a person is unable to rule is an addiction. And the addiction is the repeated behaviour that a person keeps engaging in, even though he knows it harms himself or others. How it looks externally is irrelevant. The key issue is a person’s internal relationship to the passion and its related behaviours.""“Be at least as interested in your reactions as in the person or situation that triggers them,” Eckhart Tolle advises.” “Not only do we avert our eyes from the hardcore drug addict to avoid seeing ourselves; we do so to avoid facing our share of responsibility. As we have seen, injection drug use more often than not arises in people who were abused and neglected as young children. The addict, in other words, is not born but made. His addiction is the result of a situation that he had no influence in creating. His life expresses the history of the multigenerational family system of which he is a part, and his family exists as part of the broader culture and society. In society, as in Nature, each microcosmic unit reflects something of the whole. In the case of drug addiction, the sins of entire societies are visited unevenly on minority populations.” ""for all the valid reasons we have for wanting the addict to “just say no,” we first need to offer her something to which she can say “yes.” We must provide an island of relief. We have to demonstrate that esteem, acceptance, love and humane interaction are realities in this world, contrary to what she, the addict, has learned all her life. It is impossible to create that island for people unless they can feel secure that their substance dependency will be satisfied as long as they need it.” “A sense of deficient emptiness pervades our entire culture. The drug addict is more painfully conscious of this void than most people and has limited means of escaping it. The rest of us find other ways of suppressing our fear of emptiness or of distracting ourselves from it. When we have nothing to occupy our minds, bad memories, troubling anxieties, unease or the nagging mental stupor we call boredom can arise. At all costs, drug addicts want to escape spending “alone time” with their minds. To a lesser degree, behavioural addictions are also responses to this terror of the void.” “Free choice only comes from thinking; it doesn’t come from emotions. It emerges from the capacity to think about your emotions.” "
48,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76428110-marion-roux,5,"A comprehensive, informative and enlightening crash-course on addictions. It really is a powerful, eloquent and very readable book on the biological, chemical, neurological, psychological, medical, emotional and social impacts in the process of addiction.During my reading I made copious notes which I am going to include in my review for my own edification.The book starts with interesting case studies. Then it moves on to 'what is' this complex, chronic brain condition of addiction. Is addiction a futile attempt to fill a sensed emptiness/void at the core of a being; underdeveloped self-regulation; lack of basic differentiation and self-worth or poor impulse control? Thus is the 'addictive personality a personality that hasn't matured?The grey matter of the brain consists of the nerve cells and the white matter is the cells connective fibres. With maturation/ development of the brain cells, more active connections are developed = more white matter. Dopamine (a 'feel good' chemical) is a key brain 'messenger'/neurotransmitter and is important for motivation, incentive and energy. The receptors are molecules on the membranes of the cell surfaces. A Dopamine molecule is released by a neuron/nerve cell to ""float"" across a synaptic space to the receptor of a second neuron. Once the ""message"" has been transmitted, it, this molecule, passes back through the synaptic space to the original neuron for reuse/re-uptake. So the greater re-uptake, the fewer active neurotransmitters there are between neurons. Addiction/ chronic use of drugs alters the anatomy and physiological state of the brain - there are fewer normal dopamine receptors and physical energy is reduced. Stimulants (drugs) effectively increase the amount of dopamine available in the brain and a ""high"" is produced by a rapid chemical shift. Physical dependence on a drug leads to tolerance (when the benefit of previously enjoyable doses of a drug is no longer felt) and so the addict craves more and more. Drug users present with less grey matter density and white brain mass. This in turn results in reduced rational thought, and loss of learning ability.3 Factors are needed simultaneously for substance addiction to occur - a susceptible organism, a drug with addictive potential and stress. Addiction is not a natural state, but its power arises in the regions of the brain that are the key organisers and motivators of human emotional life and behaviour - the opioid apparatus, the dopamine system and the self-regulation systemThe Opioid Apparatus = the endorphins which sooth physical and emotional pain; regulate the autonomic nervous system; are catalysts for emotional bonding; responsible for pleasure and joyful excitement experiencing (chemical happiness system).Dopamine - the incentive/motivation apparatus. The dopamine system is active during the learning of new behaviours to be incorporated in ones life. It also modulates attachment and aversion.Self-regulation circuits are in the frontal cortex - particularly the prefrontal portions act as the CEO of the brain (the final say on appropriate/ non-appropriate behaviour.) The Orbitofrontal Cortex (OFC) is abundantly supplied with opioid and dopamine receptors and is regarded as the apex of the emotional brain. Maintaining a reasonably stable internal emotional state (self-regulation) and maintaining a sense of self while in emotional contact with others (differentiation) equates to emotional maturity. Maturation which is vital for balanced reasoning, self control, emotional balance and normal social interaction.New brain science advocates that environmental influences on the development of brain functioning and personality are as important as genetic factors. The expression of genetic potentials is contingent on the environment. Hence, there is no specific gene for alcoholism/ addiction, but there is definitely an infinitely complex and on-going interaction between genetic and environmental factors. (""Genetics - that neutral, impassive, impersonal handmaiden of Nature - would absolve us of responsibility and of its ominous shadow, guilt."" An infants early years will define how well its brain structures will develop and how the neurological networks of human behaviour will mature - the organisational and functional status of the mature brain.""Neural Darwinism"" involves selective synaptic pruning - choosing neurons, synapses and circuits to adapt brain to a particular environment , discarding others.3 environmental conditions essential re nutrition, physical security and consistent emotional nurturing. ""Emotional nurturance is an absolute requirement for healthy neurobiological brain development.""

Tense situations, feelings of uncertainty, lack of information, loss of control, conflict and isolation from emotionally supportive relationships"" may strain rational thought and the addict self-medicates/soothes with his drug of choice.Practises of the 'War on Drugs' are a waste of money and are a failure in preventing and discouraging drug use, curtailing worldwide drug trade and suppressing drug cultivation.""Drugs do not make the addict into a criminal, the law does""The War on Drugs is a failure because it is directed only against some drug producers, traffickers and users, not against the root causes of drug addiction and the black markets in drugs. Unforceable laws, moral preaching and medical practises cannot encourage addicts to abandon their compulsions. Drugs damage the parts of the brain exercising conscious will - the freedom of choice.The system of approach to addiction needs transformation. Free choice emerges from the capacity to think about your emotions. Thus treatment of addiction needs:- a complex and supportive social environment with transformed opinions towards addicts;- decriminlization of substances and safely controlled provision thereof. Even crystal meth/tik, the most harmful chemical, needs physical, psychological and social support to aid reducing its appeal;- devilify drug addiction - establish safe and predictable environments, acceptance,and belonging .The chapter on ""The Power Of Compassionate Curiosity"" is packed with information and is thus easy to simply summarise Needs to be read slowly and very thoughtfully.Other thoughts I am left mulling over are;Who is in charge - the individual or their behaviour? It is possible to rule a passion, but when an obsessive passion rules a person it is an addiction.The differences in addictions are only a matter of degree of the same neurological and psychological malfunctions;""The obesity epidemic demonstrates a psychological and spiritual emptiness at the core of consumer society"" and familial dissociation (TV and computers as substitutes for nurturing adults, lack of sense of community - family, clan, tribe, village);Reading of how high cortisol levels, for many months, in the placenta due to tremendous stress on the mother impacts on the developing fetus. A possible consequence could be a proclivity for addiction. This, for me, presents a strong pro-argument for abortion following a rape.The statement - ""The burden of the past and the fear of the future - 2 elements that make the present intolerable"" and ""To know the true nation of a society we need to look at its achievements as well as its shortcomings""Benefits for me in reading this book:Understanding addictions and the sufferer betterand being more cautious of shirking / not accepting responsibility of assigning or doing some constructive assisting and not just blaming the genes/wiring of the mind and the body."
49,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53506640-joseph-valoren,4,"Despite some imperfections, Dr. Mate's treatise on the causes and machinery of addiction is not merely one of the best books on addiction that I've read, but one of the best books on mental health that I have ever read, full stop.With his wide breadth of experience in treating the most desperate of addicts and the robust research that he has done for this work in fields spanning psychology, philosophy, neurology, biology, genetics, and cultural studies, he presents a thesis as timely as it is necessary -- that the root causes of addiction, and indeed the overwhelming majority of mental health disorders, are the result of malformations in a complicated, multifaceted complex of influences, and that the way to address addiction is, broadly, by following the Rogerian model of empathy and unconditional positive regard.Mate begins this ambitious work by providing us with his [i]bona fides[/i], both as a physician treating addiction and - as we eventually learn - as someone who struggles with addiction, himself. The first step on this journey is to candidly discuss the lives of many of his patients, all of whom assented to have their stories told. In this, our author sets the groundwork for the humanization of the population he wishes to address, illustrating what should be obvious to all of us -- a healthy person does not [i]choose[/i] to be a junkie.Instead, addiction of all kinds are the manifestations of some other serious discord in the life of the individual. Trauma in childhood is almost certainly involved, he posits, citing compelling scientific evidence to back this claim throughout the second portion of the book. Here he discusses how addiction affects the brain, what purpose addiction serves to the addicted brain, how addicts react to having their addiction denied them, and the antecedent causes of addiction and how it is related to trauma in childhood. Trauma, stress, and biology (largely dictated by [i]in utero[/i] causes) all have a hand in creating and exacerbating a vast emptiness in the mind of the addict. Addiction, he suggests, is a coping mechanism used to compensate for a deficiency of love, comfort, security, or stimulation in early childhood.Advancing this notion, Dr. Mate broadens the scope of addiction to encompass a broad spectrum of non-narcotic substances, such as shopping, sex, gambling, television, or, in his own case, work. This prompts a frank and well thought out discussion concerning the abject failure of America's 'War on Drugs', in ideological boondoggle that many before him have thoroughly demolished, but which Dr. Mate does a serviceable job of tearing down on his own. His argument hits most of the big arguments against prohibition, and I won't enumerate them, here, except to say that the author pays special attention - as one would expect - to the human toll of the Drug War, pleading for an emphasis on harm reduction as the keystone strategy in a drastic pivot he proposes from our current course.Finally, Dr. Mate discusses the close, social aspect of addiction, offering some practical advice to those struggling with addiction, or to those whose loved ones do. He dissects the ways in which family support systems can enable or aggravate addiction and advises on how to turn away from this course, much of which is interpreted through his own self-confessed struggles with addiction.This is an overwhelmingly well-researched, well-thought out indictment of our society's current attitudes towards addiction and addicts. It has tremendous value as a guide to treating not only addiction, but all mental health issues, so many of which, he provides, are the cause of problems experienced in childhood. The way he advocates treating addicts and the advice he provides to addicts in overcoming addiction can easily apply to almost all mental health issues -- treat the patient with empathy and provide them support if they want to change, and as addicts looking to overcome addiction, practice mindfulness, seek help, avoid your triggers, and accept that the path out of Hell is long, perilous, and will be walked for the rest of your life. This is all truly exceptional advice that should better inform the way our government and our society treats the afflicted.Unfortunately, Dr. Mate also seems to suffer from a mild case of the same problematic thinking as otherwise respectable individuals such as Neil Degrasse Tyson, Bill Nye, Richard Dawkins, and the like. Specifically, he seems unable to ""stay in his own lane"", as it were. Dr. Mate is unquestionably a gifted, dedicated, and thoroughly experienced practitioner and researcher into the field of addiction and all it encompasses, but his own struggles with addiction and writing this work lent him to color various sections with cheap spirituality that speaks more of his personal experience than it does of objective facts or vetted research. At many points in this book, he quotes Eckart Tolle, and while the quotations are not misused - they're not bad quotes, as far as Tolle goes - they are necessarily misplaced by virtue of what they are. Likewise, Dr. Mate seems to place a great deal of faith in the '12 Step' model of addiction recovery, but this faith seems to be based entirely on personal, anecdotal experience rather than on good science. This is probably because the best science that we have indicates that 12 Step programs are not meaningfully more successful at overcoming addiction then pure chance. For all the love that Dr. Mate keeps on this model, he himself indicates that he attended only one meeting to address his own addiction, and then stopped, recognizing that this model of addiction treatment ""wasn't for him"".You, reader, are free to disregard my misgivings. Indeed, considering Dr. Mate's impressive pedigree and the rigor with which he researched and wrote the rest of this book, and my own humble status as a still-developing academic in this field, I would probably disregard myself, were I someone else. I don't expect that Dr. Mate will be kept up at night with my criticisms towards his airy, baseless, feel-good spiritualism, nor his hypocritical endorsement of the Anonymous model of addiction counseling. However, Dr. Mate gets viscerally personal at several parts of this book, and something that he takes pains to explain at every turn is that he, too, is a human animal, prone to faults in thinking and judgment. As someone who finds the overwhelming, unfulfilling religiosity of 12 Step programs to be no comfort it all and the spiritual mutterings of New Age gurus like Tolle to be nauseating at worst and a good deal short of prescient at best, I submit that the entire seventh section of this book likely could have been jettisoned without losing anything of merit or worth.Overall, despite these criticisms, I cannot praise this book enough for delivering on a message so long overdue. I would recommend it highly to anybody interested in studying or overcoming mental health issues of all kinds."

52,0676977405,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4777812-lucie,4,"""To see addiction as the only problem is to leave intact the context that triggered the addiction in the first place.""The name of the book is all wrong. It should have been called Compassion 101.Before I read this book, I've heard about Gabor Maté's uptake on addiction, which doesn't only include substance addiction, neither does it only include the less traditional, but still quite accepted gambling, overeating or sex addictions. For him, addiction is anything that gives us a short-term relief from whatever is causing us some pain or distress, but it inflicts harm in the long-term perspective - and we keep coming back to it despite. I thought that's pretty interesting and I wanted to know more, especially given discovering lately, how hooked I am to pleasing people (you know, short-term, it gives me pleasure, because people are happy with me, but long-term, I'm suppressing the person on the inside). I thought that the substance addiction is not my problem. Oh boy. All the caffeine and sugar that I crave and the more stressed I am, the more I crave it... Well, anyway.This is an exceptional book about addiction. The more theoretical parts are interweaved with stories of dr. Maté's patients from the Downtown Eastside, Vancouver. I loved the stories, if I can say so about something quite as horrific. You get to peak into lives of people who have suffered immense, unimaginable traumas in childhood and ended up on the street, shooting up all sorts of addictive substances, cheating and stealing to get money for more of it. But the way the author portrays them is just heart-melting. In a very graceful manner, he step by step explains how addiction arises, how it works in the brain and who is more prone to it. In a very kind and open-hearted way, he helps the reader to see that any addictive behaviour has its roots in soothing the pain, loneliness, fear or feeling of abandonment on the inside. And disregarding people as junkies creates even more hurt than they have already suffered.I thought I was reading the book for myself, to reflect on my own issues and it indeed helped a lot. But I got much more than that from it. It has completely changed my mindset about addiction and people battling with it. (And to be honest, as it seems to me at the moment, most of us have that something that helps us feel better.) It's not genetics, it's not a choice, it's not about willpower. It's about hurt and healing it with compassion.I have highlighted more quotes in this book than I have in almost any other book ever (maybe with the exception of Daring Greatly). Here are just some of them that caught my eye when writing the review:""In our civilized times we are punishing and tormenting people for having suffered trauma.""""I could not rescue people from their pain and sadness. All I could offer was to walk beside them as a fellow human being, a kindred spirit.""""From the Latin word vulnerare, ""to wound"", vulnerability is our susceptibility to be wounded. This fragility is part of our nature and cannot be escaped. The best the brain can do is to shut down conscious awareness of it when pain becomes so vast or unbearable that it threatens to overwhelm our capacity to function. The automatic repression of painful emotion is a helpless child's prime defence mechanism and can enable the child to endure trauma that would otherwise be catastrophic. The unfortunate consequence is a wholesale dulling of emotional awareness.""""Also characterizing the addiction-prone personality is the absence of differentiation. Differentiation is defined as ""the ability to be in emotional contact with others yet still autonomous in one's emotional functioning."" It's the capacity to hold on to ourselves while interacting with others. The poorly differentiated person is easily overwhelmed by his emotions, ""absorbs anxiety from others and generates considerable anxiety within himself.""""And a war against parts of the self -- even against non-adaptive, dysfunctional parts, can lead only to inner discord and more distress.""""When we don't have to defend ourselves against others or, what's more, against ourselves, we are open to seeing how things are.""""Knowing oneself comes from attending with compassionate curiosity to what is happening within.""All in all, I really loved the book. The only reason for giving it 4 starts instead of 5 is that I found some of the more theoretical chapters less engaging (though some of them were very interesting). This is not a quick and easy read, at least it hasn't been for me. But I know I will be coming back rereading it, especially the first chapter with the stories of Downtown Eastside people and the very last chapter on healing.For anyone potentially interested in the book, I also recommend listening to this podcast episode with the author: https://tim.blog/2018/02/20/gabor-mate/."

Having already learned about the biochemistry of addiction (in large part due to the advocacy and research of people like Dr. Maté), I found that the middle of the book dragged. I also found his own example of his record-buying behaviour as an addiction ringing a bit hollow. He took many pains to ensure there was no equivalence between what he experiences and those of this patients, and I overall think his point of addiction being a behaviour that exists on a spectrum that many of us have experienced is valid. But I also felt the contrast between his example and that of severe substance use too difficult to reconcile in my mind (even if that wasn't the point he was trying to make) and including his example seemed to lessen the overall drive of his thesis for me.

Well, I offered to 'buddy-read' this last fall with a book group friend who is professionally involved in combatting addiction, and I think she gave up long ago. It's a 500-page memoir by a doctor in Vancouver who works with the homeless population on a daily basis. Dr. Mate compassionately explores addiction against the backdrop of his own and his patients' lives and behaviors over time. (Unfortunately, his own addictions are to buying CDs of classical music and working too hard to help other people, making it hard for this reader to take super seriously.) I used the book for insomnia reading, and it served this purpose well, wandering from science and spirituality to Joseph Campbell and Eckhart Tolle, and ending by espousing a Five Step Self-treatment Method developed at UCLA to treat OCD: relabel, reattribute, refocus, revalue, re-create. As addiction books go, it's not Dr. Mate's personal story that will grip you, it's his breadth of study and his compassion for the human condition.I'll probably go back to my highlights when my brain needs something to hang on to in the middle of the night.

His words caught my interest so much that I ordered this book. Here, Dr Mate focuses on the general concept of addiction starting with stories of his patients, many of which are quite painful to read. He later describes the biology and pathology of the addicted brain, the person, and the many losses caused by the so called ‘war on drugs’. Throughout the book, Dr Mate presents his own addictive tendencies and his own shortcomings, as a doctor, father and as husband. He has a very analytical thinking and a powerful writing style. There were some sections that were not very convincing for me though. For example, his arguments dismissing twin studies and their findings are not particularly strong. And the twelve steps, described in the appendix, definitely is not for everyone. But overall, I very much enjoyed reading this book. I think it goes into the philosophy of human existence and is so much more than just about addiction."

I have had it on my ""to read"" list for quite some time, but kept thinking to myself that I'm not overly interested in addiction, so I was forever putting it on hold. However, while this book is about addiction, and the stories of addiction that Dr. Mate tells are at once tragic and heart wrenching and yet also inspiring examples of courage in the face of massive trauma, at its core this book is really about humanity. Common humanity, connection, trauma, love, the search for meaning that we all, as humans, experience. I found it so relatable, so rich and well-written. The level of personal vulnerability and openness expressed by the author is incredible. It made me really look inward at my own challenges, and my own biases, and re-evaluate some of these. If I could give this book more than 5 stars, I would. I feel changed, somehow, having read it, and that is the mark of an excellent book. "
