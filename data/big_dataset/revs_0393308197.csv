0,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,4,"Stephen Jay Gould is a pleasure to read. No writer I know can so seamlessly combine the cultural sophistication of belles-lettres with the rigors of scientific explanation. Gould is singularly able to frame scientific controversies and hypotheses within a larger historical context, showing the human side of the scientific endeavor while in no way minimizing its brilliance and legitimacy. Science emerges as both deeply human—colored by a thousand irrational biases and prejudices—and yet remarkably effective at getting beyond these human failings.I would even go so far to say that Gould is worth reading simply for the writing alone. His prose is excellent—full of personality, and yet never self-indulgent. If you are looking to write non-fiction, you could scarcely find a better model of clarity, wit, and intellectual seriousness.All this being said, I must admit that there are some irritating aspects to Gould’s writing. Or perhaps I should say to his thinking. Arguably Gould’s favorite topics is how culture and personality can warp the scientific enterprise. He gives excellent examples of this, such as Paul Broca’s controversy over brain size, or the racist theories of John Langdon Down. Gould insists that everyone has cultural biases, and he is surely right. But Gould was no intellectual historian—even if he often dipped into the field—and the way that he wields these supposed biases can be frustrating and superficial.Perhaps the most irksome example of this is Gould’s preoccupation with gradualism vs. catastrophism—whether things happen bit by bit, or in rapid bursts. Gould styles himself a catastrophist, and is quick to invoke the “Western bias” for gradualism in characterizing his opponents. Yet I think it is inaccurate to call gradualism a “Western bias”: throughout European history, invoking catastrophic events (such as Noah’s flood) as explanations has been extremely common. It is not even quite fair to call gradualism a “bias,” since there are some good arguments for preferring it. In any case, I think that Gould’s labels set up a false dichotomy. Surely there is a continuum between slow and steady and fast and jerky. Besides all this, Gould’s description of some processes as “sudden” or “fast” can be very misleading for the non-scientist, since he is still talking about many thousands of years.This is just one example of Gould’s penchant for moving scientific questions into the realm of cultural clashes; and I think it is not a fair way to argue. To be fair to Gould, he was a serious scientist and quite capable of making his points on purely empirical grounds. And it is surely legitimate and useful to examine how culture influences science. I mainly object to the way Gould uses this historic truism—that scientists have been guided by biases—to support his own conclusions.Gould was, of course, a man with his own preoccupations. Aside from the gradualist-catastrophist controversy, he is drawn to stories of scientific racism and sexism, the imperfections of evolution (as in the title essay), the science of allometry (the study of size), and the relationship of phylogeny to ontogeny. This may seem like quite a wide field—and Gould was a man of eclectic interests—but his essays have a family resemblance: they examine how biases have distorted the truth of evolution. Of course, what constitutes the ""truth of evolution"" is open to debate, and Gould has quite particular notions in this field.Some of Gould’s pet theories have not gained general acceptance in the intervening time. But considering how much this field has evolved in the last forty years, it is remarkable that these essays have aged so well. They can still be profitably read by the curious amateur. And, as I said at the beginning, even if the information in these essays were entirely obsolete, the essays would still be worth reading for the quality of writing alone. Few science writers have gained this distinction."

I also enjoyed his somewhat internal debates about dinosaurs. I still haven't latched on to his writing as much as I would have liked. The content is really good and he has a great sum up near the end about a lot of ""points"" other science writers have made that really comes through with some fervor about the way that bats and bees see and what the world is to us. The sexual and racial issues surrounding Evolution in scientific history is a subject I detest but he still was able to keep me interested during that portion as well. Its not a book I would re read but it was a good once over. "
2,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14247078-maitrey,5,"This was a hugely enjoyable book by an extremely talented writer. The thought most running across my mind when I was reading this book was: ""Where can I get more Stephen Jay Gould books?!""Since it is a collection of essays, I don't really want to review any of them personally. Sure, some of the science here is 30 years old (Gould was always sharp on the uptake though), some of it is out of favour (say Gould's ideas on the gene-centric view of evolution), but you'll still enjoy reading every bit of it. There are ideas about the evolution of dinosaurs, magnetic bacteria, South American marsupials and even Mickey Mouse. Themes such as racism and sexism, as ever, continue to play a major role in his examination of the past. What was most enjoyable was the fact that Gould is such a sympathetic writer, yet his work is full of wit and consideration. The Panda's Thumb made for an excellent book to pick up, regardless of what I was doing or what my mood was and immediately get lost in whatever world Stephen Jay Gould transported you to."
3,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9811549-jim,4,"This wonderful book is a collection of 31 short articles that appeared in the magazine ""Natural History"" in the late 1970's ('77-'79)...each 'chapter' is an independent read (for the most part) that, if you are a patient pooper, can be finished in a single seating. The topics range from discussions about Darwin's ""Origin of Species"" to Agassiz unenlightened racism to the length of a year 500 million years ago to Mickey Mouse's head size. Gould is a great writer with full command of natural history and a knack in making a difficult subject both informative and entertaining.The only reason that I 'dinged' the rating is that some of the articles...those involving paleontology and general geology...are very much dated and out of step with the current thinking of earth's history. I know that that is somewhat unfair, but, hey, this review is intended for those potential readers who might assume that the science presented represents the cutting edge some aspects of the earth sciences. It does not. There have been huge advances in both discoveries (e.g. feathered dinosaurs) and evolutionary philosophy...there is no way SJG could have predicted all of that.The book is highly entertaining...I recommend it!"
4,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/373703-adrian-colesberry,5,"The greatest modern voice for the neo-Darwinian synthesis. He and a colleague, whose name I forget, re-purposed Kipling's term ""just-so stories"" to describe evolutionarily plausible but unprovable explanations for things. An amazing critical thinker, Gould realized that if you didn't establish some way of critiquing evolutionary explanations, they would become the equivalent of folk explanations, overpredicting to the point that they could never be disproven. Once evolutionary explanations became non-disprovable, it stops being a science and starts being a belief, like believing in god. So he spent a lifetime not just doing his own research but in popularizing disciplined neo-Darwinian critical thinking in this series of essays in Natural History magazine or Nature magazine, I forget. Most of my understanding of the neo-Darwinian synthesis comes from reading Gould. "

The format of his ""Reflections..."" produces bite-sized meditations on evolution and natural history topics. My only concern is with the constant movement of science, that insights of the seventies may be stale in the current thinking. I wonder at times if I am reading a time capsule of a particular mode of thought, or the dawn of the accepted way of thinking.Things I thought were interesting:1) The terms Idiot, Moron, and Mongoloid once had Scientific Relevance. Gould had to write an essay advocating the use of Downs' Syndrome over the still accepted Mongoloid Idiot.2) The idea that Birds should be reclassified under a Family of Dinosaurs captures my imagination. Since it's been forty years, I wonder where that ended up.3) Finally, the way Gould captures the impact of size as an environment for adaptation breaks up most of the science fiction tropes of big vs. little (""The Fly,"" ""The Fantastic Voyage"") while opening whole new doors in understanding of nature."

11,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4485647-joni-baboci,3,"The Panda's Thumb is an overall interesting book dealing with the curiosities of evolution through a compendium of articles written by Gould mostly in the 70s for Nature magazine. The 1992 edition even goes over some clarifications which have come into light in the two decades since the articles have been published. I think the book is a fairly readable popular natural sciences book, although the fragmentation that comes from it being an anthology of articles does make it seem aimless at times. I think the genre has advanced in terms of content and readability by leaps and bounds in the last two decades and while Gould is still a good read, I do believe there are lots of equally good books available which have a bit more structure than the Panda's Thumb. As for anthologies I am a big fan of The Best American Science and Nature Writing yearly series."

I like his ability to blend science, history, literature, and culture without over extending himself too much--mainly sticking to his area of expertise and adjacent disciplines. Each essay contains an epiphany moment that are useful for illuminating how the world and its living inhabitants got here, and how humans came to know. Save for a few slow parts dealing with truly ancient and simple life or Victorian naturalists, I found all of them engaging, entertaining, bite-sized reads. I have read some of his other work and will continue to read more."
22,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1938544-michael,4,"This is a book of essays originally published by Gould in Natural History magazine, during the time that he was its editor (one of several such books, in fact). As such, it is an effort on his part to appeal to an educated popular audience with snippets of information about current research, particularly into paleontology and evolutionary science (his specialties), but also into other areas of biology and even geology and related sciences. Often, he is responding to then-current media fads, by trying to provide corrective information to misrepresentations of science in the popular press. This may partially explain the odd choice of title – the panda’s “thumb” doesn’t seem as sensational a topic to me as dinosaurs’ relationship to birds or the comparative measurements of male and female (human) brains, but perhaps it was the headline-grabber in 1980, for whatever reason.The essays are grouped into eight categories, explained nicely in a very well-written introduction, but without a final conclusion to tie them all together into any kind of grand theory. This leaves the book feeling a bit disjointed, and uncertain of purpose – Gould seems to have a point in each essay and even each section, but not really a “big idea” for putting them together in one volume. It is therefore best approached as a kind of exercise for the brain, and not a serious undertaking to comprehend evolutionary science. It is well-written and easy enough to follow that science teachers might be able to select single essays to demonstrate points to students, and Gould is amusing enough that students would find him readable.I’m a pretty good audience for this sort of book, because I don’t know that much about the specialized area Gould works in, but I’m smart enough to keep up with him and nerdy enough to be entertained by stories about science. I was especially interested in some of his historical essays, especially those that demonstrate that discarded theories were not results of irrationality or bad procedure on the part of their originators, but rather changes in overall paradigm. Gould is very good at demonstrating the social and cultural biases that have stunted scientific inquiry, and draws lessons from past mistakes that can be applied to more recent science.Being unfamiliar with the field and with Gould in particular, I was a bit surprised at how “traditionally” Darwinian he appears to be in these essays. My impression (possibly false) is that over the time since Darwin there have been many newer concepts added to the mix of random mutation and natural selection to explain how life forms develop and change, but Gould seems to be more interested in presenting an unsullied version of Darwin than in complicating that picture. This could have resulted from his concern over the vocal arguments of Creationists (as bad now as they were then), and a desire to keep things simple in a public forum. Or, it may be that evolutionary science was exactly as he presents it in 1980, which is now some time ago. I was also interested to learn that he strongly disagrees with Richard Dawkins’ argument from The Selfish Gene, also on my reading list, and I will have to remember to come back and check his points when I get around to reading that book. Until I do, I cannot comment on the debate.Overall, this is a very good book of scientific essays for anyone interested in the subject, and may open up new lines of inquiry to the attentive reader. "
23,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,4,"I bought this second hand over 13 years ago and, after reading it, should not have put it off for so long. The topic of evolution has interest for me for two reasons, the first being that biology is the one core area of science I've not studied formally and the second that it (evolution) has become such a flash-point issue in disputes between science and religion. Written as a series of vignettes about various topics, each was an entertaining and enlightening read, although I'm not sure if I'm any better off in terms of my knowledge about how evolution works. The opening essay concerns the Panda's Thumb, and Gould suggests that in evolution, exceptions rather than norms often prove the rule. However, with each essay comprising an 'exception' (of sorts), I'm not sure that a cohesive picture is drawn as a result. Indeed, I can see how some might take snippets of various essays and use them 'against' evolution. This would be unfortunate, as I think instead we are presented with an area of science that was, and presumably still is, undergoing healthy critical thinking and application.Many topics are discussed that would have popular appeal. Gould's issue with Dawkin's selfish gene idea is outlined. The evolution of humans, both biological and cultural is considered, with the latter an example of 'Lamarckism' and operating much faster than genetic based changes. Catastrophism and punctuated equilibrium are explored, the latter not suggesting change takes place more or less gradually, but the evidence we have for it in fossils does occur 'rapidly' due to a previously isolated group becoming the dominant and more fossilised species. Dinosaurs, mickey mouse and the inferiority (or otherwise) of marsupials are also covered. Since Gould was overt in separating the domains of science and religion as mutually exclusive (as I found out recently when reading Sam Harris), the weaving of the Arts, including religious arts infuses his writing, adding to the readability, but offering little in terms of the 'debate' between the two. It certainly makes the read a less confrontational one and those with a religious bent, like myself, will probably find themselves adopting a less defensive stance as they explore what can be a threatening area of science. As far as furthering the discussion between science and religion, I will need to go elsewhere."
24,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1510857-heman,5,"Stephen Gould must be the most charming science writer I have ever read anything of. His style is remarkable for witticism and digging the amusing facts.His essay on Darwin vs. Wallace is one of my favorites in this book.Wallace who had independently reached the theory of evolution before Darwin published his Origin of Species, and whose letter to Darwin caused a slimmer book to be published than what Darwin originally had in mind in order to establish Darwin's priority, eventually balks at the notion of human evolution, but Darwin alone champions the cause of evolution by recognizing there is nothing beyond nature in human intelligence.As Gould says in another part of the book about the brief victory of Craniometry, it is not right to view history as a tale of progress and if the human intelligence has not changed much over a 1000 years or so, there is more than naiveté on part of intelligent people to be accounted for when we see how much time and effort they spent on matters that may seem ludicrous to us today. We simply don't understand their world without paying attention to the context of the systems and world-views they conjured. Genomics and Anthropometry where based on assumptions that were socially and philosophically condoned at the time and well over half of the past century and years and careers were spent finding evidence on their behalf. The idea of European, and more specifically Western European, intrinsic superiority, is traced across western scientific history in a good part of this book. Racist views of men like Dr. John Down, of Down's syndrome fame who coined the phrase Mongolism, in 19th century that were fitted with ""scientific"" evidence are astounding parts of science history that we might have been too ready to forget.

There’s several interesting essays here, including my favorite one in which the evolution of Mickey Mouse is discussed.One of the essays here dealt with Richard Dawkins’ controversial stand (in The Selfish Gene) on genes in which he states that a person is just a gene’s way to make another gene. (This is different from normal evolutionary thought in that genes there are the subject of random variation which then is subject to the environment and tested.) Gould is not convinced by Dawkins’ theory, mainly because, he says, there is no evidence that genes can be linked to specific attributes, i.e., there isn’t an “eye” gene. Gould wrote this some years back, so it will be interesting to see if he revisits this subject now that researchers have indeed discovered the “eye” gene (through testing on flies).Gould also covers Robert Bakker’s theories about warm-blooded dinosaurs (later written up in Bakker’s The Dinosaur Heresies) and the link to birds, a good essay for people to review prior to the hullabaloo that will follow Jurassic Park 2 (it’s always fun to check up on an author’s source material)."

Until the last few chapters I would have sworn Gould is an atheist. After reading the last few chapters I wonder if that is so. I taught biology at 3 different college campuses and the students at one were astounded to learn I am a Catholic. One student eventually did say that I had convinced him plants had evolved, but not animals and certainly not humans. Of course, at that same school some students were either offended or confused when I referred to humans as animals.

Gould is differential to the work of other scientists, carefully considers views contrary to his own, and even points the virtues of the faulty science he criticizes. Those who say contemporary science is dogmatic should reconsider that view after carefully reading this volume or any of the others in Gould's series.

In the ensuing remainder of the book, only the second collection of his long-running column in Natural History journal, he defies this modest claim by writing on a wide variety of scientific subjects, using an even wider variety of cultural reference points. The Panda's Thumb even has a theme, of sorts, described by Gould as a 'club sandwich' of topics on biology and history. A less explicit theme of the book is error and imperfection and their role in science, not just as an unavoidable side-effect of human enterprise but also as its essential driving force. Gould uses his wit to create lessons out of one forgotten and bizarre idea that all rock is actually fossilized microbes, the discredited field of craniometry, and previous generations' misconceptions about the intelligence of dinosaurs, showing us that making mistakes is proof that we are learning."

He takes complicated subject matter and writes about it in such a way that it seems like the simplest thing you've ever read. This book is a collection of essays about natural history, just like most of his books are. This is the first collection of his essays that I've read (I've only read two other books of his, which is absolutely shocking!).There's not really much you can say about his work - it's easiest just to say: read it yourself. Not only does he say everything far better than I ever could, it's totally worth it and you could never regret reading anything he's written (and if you could, then I don't really want to know you)."

What a delightful little book of science essays! Each essay is an edited version of his monthly columns at Natural History magazine. Subsequently, the essays are intelligible to the general intelligent reader, but Gould does not thereby sacrifice an appreciation for hard facts and subtle reasoning. Gould makes science come alive with his anecdotes, wry humor, and gentle argumentation about topics ranging from the Panda's thumb to hopeful monsters and everything in between. Nothing is too big or small for Gould to think worthy of an essay. All in all, I highly recommend this book for any student of biology or lover of science."

He's not as acidic as another famous evolutionary biologist (cough* Dawkins cough*); so he's got an enthusiasm for new ideas and gusto that as well as an open mind that can be lost in the cold calculus of academia. Some of the essays are outdated, which is the risk of any scientific research but like Rachael Carson's ""Silent Spring"" there is definitely value in taking a look at the perspective of the past."
35,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2563224-peggy,4,"A TRUE ""bio-nerd"" book. ;) I had to read this I think freshman year for a bio class? It was great ... even though I ""had"" to read it!) If I remember correctly, each chapter is a separate story/antecdote so its another book, where if you get bored, just skip to the next chapter and you didnt miss a thing! It includes chapters such as: ""Nature's Odd Couples"", ""A Biological Homage to Mickey Mouse"" and, ""Were Dinosaurs Dumb?""Its all about Natural History/Evolution so you have to at least partially subscribe to Darwin's reationale to truly appreaciate...but I read it at my Catholic University if that tells you anything! "
36,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565673-nicholas-whyte,3,"http://nwhyte.livejournal.com/1378076.ht...Some of these pieces are a bit dated (not so surprising in a book published in 1980); his rather daring efforts to finger Teilhard de Chardin as a participant in the Piltdown Man hoax were easily refuted by the first researcher to check the documentary evidence. But his thoughts on punctuated equilibrium are pretty convincing, as is his (less developed here) criticism of Dawkins for obsessing about genes rather than individuals. And his essay on heartbeats and breaths in the lifespan of a mammal was very sobering."
37,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"I'm rereading all of Stephen Jay Gould's works. They are well worth it for pure scientific entertainment. The Panda's Thumb was written in 1980, so it is a bit old. Yet it still stands up well. The pands has five digits plus a ""thumb"" that is not really a thumb at all. It does show how a thumb could form since there is no gene for a thumb. Gould argues against the slow change theory of evolution. Rather he argues for dramatic sudden changes. I believe Dawkins and others still continue this argument. I was fascinated by the magnetotactic bacterium. They build a magnet in their bodies made of tiny particles. "
38,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13784911-paul,5,"OK, my favorite part?Where Gould explains the evolution of Disney's Mickey Mouse and how Mickey seems to be the original ""Benjamin Button"" de-aging thru the decades. And Goofy is probably the only real ""adult"" in the entire cartoon gang. Poor Goofy, I'd never thought of him as being either a widower or a divorcee or maybe even a single parent before reading this book.By the way, Pandas don't actually have thumbs, they have, ahhhh, but I'll let you go read the book and find out for youselves :-)"
39,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,4,"Gould's second collection of articles from Natural History. Like the first, very interesting and fun to read, if now somewhat dated. I think that in some of the articles, he tries a little too hard to be a ""gadfly"" and generalizes his conclusions too much, but he always provokes thought. I enjoy reading articles on evolutionary theory that don't get bogged down in arguing with creationists, but take the facts for granted and discuss the more interesting questions of How and Why things happened the way they did."
40,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/667766-cindy,3,"Mostly interesting if older, outdated essays on evolution. The guy is curious about many things I've never thought to be curious about and covers a lot of ground. Someone actually did a study on the heart rates of spiders? This is about the only place I'd ever hear about it. The postscripts were nice but the book is so old the postscripts need postscripts. Early on in the book there are a few places where the author let strong feelings for a topic get the best of him and a touch of arrogance shows through, but most of the essays are unaffected."
41,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1430634-brian,3,"Evolution is not a constant march towards perfection, it is throwing out multiple possibilities and the most successful one in that environment remains. Evolutionary change is not slow and continuous, but happens in short spurts when a group is isolated from the larger species; meaning, in a business, to allow a group to ‘think differently’ they need to be separated from the normal culture and be allowed to create a new environment for success."
42,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1028489-collin,2,"This is a collection of essays by Gould, all on the general topic of evolution. As all collections, whether short stories or essays, it is hit or miss. Fortunately there are many more of the former than the latter; only 2 of the essays either bored me or went over my head (sometimes it's hard to tell which, you know?). Gould intelligently and pointedly makes his...um, points, though I wish he had spent a bit more space explaining his own theory of punctuated equilibrium."
43,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2446806-mike-davis,4,"This is another collection of essays written in 1980 as reflections on natural history. In this book, Gould addresses human evolution, scientific errors, punctuated evolution and other sometimes controversial topics revolving around the legacy of Charles Darwin. It is classic writing, but relevant nevertheless to modern discussion which is renewed with the advent of DNA analysis and our increasing understanding of relationships between living and historical life forms."
44,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13484533-joshua-pressel,4,"A very interesting read. A mixture of essays on evolution, biology, paleontology, and other matters pertaining to the natural world, it gave a unique insight into the history of these fields. Not only did the author examine the actual histories of some of the issues and key figures in science, but the book is also about 30 years old. As a non-scientist, I still found it very accessible."
45,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5416028-jake-berlin,4,"gould brings his characteristic humor to a wide variety of (largely) biological subjects, and makes things (generally) accesible to non-technical readers. he incorporates a lot of cultural references outside of science, which really brightens things up. i enjoyed some essays more than others, but that's always going to be the case in a book like this."
46,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16546962-chris-dudding,5,"Top-notch writing on natural history, steeped in literary and cultural acumen -- yet eminently accessible. The world's a poorer place without Gould. Followed Dawkins' The Selfish Gene with this one, in which Gould voices his disagreement with Dawkins (though a bit unconvincingly to my mind), in addition to exploring many other topics in his various essays. "
47,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6460358-earl-bayer,3,"d Gould several years ago and I waited this long to try again. I find his books to be very educational and interesting but rather difficult to slog through. His insight is fascinating and the small details he uses to flesh out large, important matters is very illustrative but I must admit to having a tough time staying focused through each essay as they seem a bit too technical."
48,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3441158-mary,4,Stephen Jay Gould was an awesome writer regarding natural history. It is our collective loss that he died so young. I highly recommend this book if you want to learn more and understand better Darwin's thinking regarding natural selection.
49,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5597323-robert-taylor,5,"Although dealing with the minutia of evolutionary theory, it rarely leaves the layman scratching his or her head in confusion. Instead, you are fascinated with the history of life itself, and our stumbling study of it over the centuries. Brilliant collection from a brilliant man."
50,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10904994-sarah,3,I just finished a Biology class last semester so this one wasn't exactly a page turner for me. When I cracked the book open I noticed my deceased uncles initials and a note from my grandma; that inspired me to keep reading. I didn't finish the book but gave it a better home to my sister.
51,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6882315-kevin-carlo-artiaga,5,"Gould's essays are meaty morsels. I like how he writes, what he writes about, and what sort of ideas he puts into the table. I don't agree with him on all his opinions though, but that's secondary to the intellectual enjoyment I got from reading this book."
52,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5210788-andy,3,"A bit dated but still interesting. Professor Gould had quite a way with words and explaining Darwinian evolution. Even if new discoveries have made some of his essays past their prime, they are still fun."
53,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40534498-debjyoti-bardhan,5,"Stephen Jay Gould being his quintessential self. Get to know why the Pandas have an opposable ""Thumb"". Or why the sex-ratio of most animals is 1:1. Or the brilliant tale as to how the evolution of Mickey Mouse closely resembles the growth of a child into an adult. Simply Marvellous!"

58,0393308197,http://goodreads.com/user/show/827988-perry,4,Current bedtime reading. The author can make evolutionary theory sound like the most reasonable idea in the world--because he does not misuse the concept.
