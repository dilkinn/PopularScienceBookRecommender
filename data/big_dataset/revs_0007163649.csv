Is there anyone else in the world who understands photosynthesis at this level of detail from its intricate quantum mechanism to its interplanetary implications? but this book is far more than just description of science or biography of scientists - there is a cinematic, lyrical, positively transcendent quality to the writing which is so rare in any kind of 'science book'.Inevitably, with a book about energy at this moment in history, there are messages too: but although Oliver's investigations and hunches have led him to firm conclusions, there's nothing preachy, and less that's conventional.Its not an easy book to finish but its definitely worth it."
1,0007163649,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237879-elaine-nelson,3,"A much heftier read than I was expecting, honestly. Other reviews describe the first third as being the most science-detail-heavy, but I found the whole thing a little overwhelming in both scientific and science-historic detail. I had to make the choice to let some of the particulars wash over me: the names and inter-relations of scientists. I think I could've gotten more of that, and retained it better, if I'd had a book group or class to read this with, to talk over the particulars, draw pictures, etc. On the OTHER hand, some parts were absolutely fascinating, both the quirks of science history, the arcs of biogeography over billions of years, and the strange details of the innards of plants, algae, bacteria, etc., etc. Lovely visualizations, plus I think I have a better understanding of plants and the atmosphere and the geological cycle.Recommended, but with reservations: be prepared to be periodically overwhelmed. If you are easily distracted, find a quiet place to read."
2,0007163649,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,2,"I really wanted to like this and get on with the science in it. It is, after all, supposed to be popular science, and the biology of plants is something I'm really not well versed in at all. I did manage to understand some of the concepts -- the flow of electrons and how that drives energy production -- but overall, I found that it was a bit too high level for me. Although, it's odd, because parts of it were very pop-sciency in the way they focused on the careers of scientists and how they untangled the mysteries of plant respiration. The first few were fascinating, but then it got bogged down in the detail.Overall, I think someone with more of the basics than me might get on with this a lot better, but I didn't have the focus for it -- and Oliver Morton's writing wasn't as strong for me as, say, Richard Fortey's. I'd read Fortey writing about paint drying and still be interested, while Morton's writing was about on the level of watching paint dry."

The book is divided into three sections, one describing the history of the discovery of how photosynthesis works on the chemical/atomic level, covering rather more than a century but reaching a climax in the second half of the 20th C., the second lightly covering evolution of plants, the third looking at the present and future and discussing global warming on a planetary scale, in terms of estimated terrawatts.As the author himself points out, lots on the molecular and planetary level, not much on actual plants. Having made three tries at finding a book that addresses the evolution of plants with the sort of detail usually reserved for organisms that kill and eat each other and have sex, the Hollywood movies of evolution as it were, I have broken down and ordered a book titled, duh, The Evolution of Plants https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1... which I hope will have actual plants in. I shall report on it in due course.I realized, reading this, that something I value in fiction also applies to nonfiction -- that the author's voice or headspace be a congenial place to dwell in for umpty-hundred pages. Morton and Nick Lane https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6... both have good headspaces, though I think Lane has the edge in incisiveness and a passion for teaching the details in a lucid way (not a man to waste a captive audience, one senses) -- Morton is more discursive. Interestingly, Morton appears to be not only a science fiction reader, but incautious enough to admit it in print. That's not something one sees every day. Fits in with my theory about SF supplying needed metaphors for our times, though.He mentions reading Annals of the Former World, too, which I plowed through last winter -- I suspect if I continue to read enough of modern pop sci, it will all start to cross-connect in a pleasing knowledge-net. Or it would, if it didn't all flow out of my head these days almost as fast as it flows in -- but happily, I have no quiz next period. Ta, L."

Up to then the book is basically a history of science, & I got impatient. Came due, & no real hurry to try again. So take my 2-star rating with salt. I'm likely done (unless I'm not).See LM Bujold's review, nearby, which is the one that caused me to try it."
5,0007163649,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4339777-mark,4,"An excellent piece of science writing about plants: their evolution, their biochemistry, and their influence on the planet. Eating the Sun is not just a random title picked by a publisher--it captures how perspective is driven by starting with the 6000K sun and describing how plants make use of all that heat and light. So there's a lot about photosynthesis and metabolism, rather less in details about leaf shape, flowers, insects or seeds. When the book does bounce up into the macro scale it goes very macro, talking about the whole planet, and how plants change what happens to sunlight and redistribute water and carbon. There's even notes about how different our planet would look from a distant telescope as plants change not just the atmosphere the color of the reflected radiation.The book contains the typical biographical snippets about interesting and eccentric scientists but is fairly detailed on the science itself, especially for the first third. Goes quite well with some other recent reads (The Emerald Planet and Life Ascending) at capturing the wondrous complexity of life (and especially plants) and makes me wish I'd paid a lot more attention in biology class."
6,0007163649,http://goodreads.com/user/show/583900-bill,4,"This book is way too in-depth and technical to be considered ""popular science."" It made me wish I were back in high school--when I was a lot more familiar with the terms and ideas explored in this book. However, it is an amazing work, and, by the end of it, you will know a helluva lot more about photosynthesis and its importance than you would've ever cared to know before. It is well worth the time and exploration of the dictionary to dig into this one. The global warming stuff--which is the book's punch line--is incredibly frustrating, though. It makes you want to reach out and strangle every politician and global warming denier."
7,0007163649,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7124797-taylor,3,"Morton’s prose serves as an enjoyable buffer for the complex processes he describes, making them out as a symphony of various players, notes, and techniques, all harnessed under the great conductor of balance. In his well-supported and logical account Morton is able to communicate major schools of thought surrounding the climate crisis and to instill a sense of urgency in his readers. Despite this, some may find the extent of prose and description of the processes long-winded. While his claims about photosynthesis and the general role of plants in the climate crisis are well-studied, it is his solution to this crisis that is contested. As the current mode of economy emphasizes profit over other considerations such as human health and need, and ecological preservation, I question his willingness to solve the crisis within this system as he admits himself, it relies heavily upon the whims of the market (willingness of investors) and political will. However, what he considers to be political will, I consider the interests of capitalism as lobbyists dominate neoliberal politics. It will likely not be within the interests of capitalism to solve this crisis until it is “too late”, as some argue it already is, as the average consumer will continue to be willing to degrade the environment for a cheap product (or a product at all) unless they are able to directly witness and/or understand the impacts of its production. As climate awareness is often a reflection of individual privilege and access (or of individual oppression for those directly facing impacts of the crisis in the global south today) awareness is unlikely to become widespread without more holistic change."
8,0007163649,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69786715-loza-boza,5,"This is a beautifully written book. The content is extremely technical at times and can be difficult to follow if, like me, you don't have a background in biology or chemistry. The book is split into three parts with each part being able to be read in isolation if you prefer. My interest in the subject led me to read the whole book as one and it was mind-blowing.If you ever want to understand how our planet came into existence (hint: it is driven by plants eating sunlight!) and why this is both remarkable and fragile then read this book. The author is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the subject but, as other reviewers on here have said, it is written with a humility that puts the content of the book first and foremost. It has obvious relevance to the politics of climate change and yet the book genuinely stays completely objective even through the concluding chapters which provide some forecasts for our planet.This book is truly one of the best books I have ever read. The author has done himself and the subject matter a huge credit. I highly recommend this book, it takes effort but you will be richly rewarded."
9,0007163649,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69497417-vicki,4,"The information overall was complete and well presented, with section 1 acting as book about the discovery of photosynthesis, section 2 acting as a book about the broader geological implications of plant life on earth's climate, and section 3 being the book about human impacts. There were a lot of biographical stories about the scientists involved. These stories worked well in section 1 but got muddied and distracting later in the book. However, I didn't realize the book was written in 2007 until reading the climate change section, as some of the outstanding questions about the impacts of warming that the author brought up are clearer now than they were 12 years ago. Would like to see a more updated book delving deeper into the wedge approach to climate change with updated details on our current technological state for carbon containment."
10,0007163649,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10831886-nico,5,"I really enjoyed reading about the history of the scientists who actually figured out the photosynthesis process down to the molecular and electron-photon level. Starting with the research in a lab in California in the early twentieth century , which got interrupted by the Manhattan project and took of again after the war with the breakthroughs happening fast and furious since the latter part of the 20th century. Similarly the insight into the genetic evolution of plants from algae was amazing. "

13,0007163649,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113745730-brown-robin,3,"I learned a thing or two from this book. Morton can't commit to writing either pretty or practical, erring too much on the side of pretty for my taste. Still, though too long, recommended, especially if you want to understand the physics of life."

15,0007163649,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8464281-darnell,4,"Surprisingly in-depth and dense for a pop science book. Focus varies a little and it occasionally goes in some strange directions, but a good read overall if you're interested in its subject."
16,0007163649,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875081-arvind-balasundaram,4,"In this book, science journalist Oliver Morton, provides a lucid explanation of the basic process of photosynthesis, and why this plays a fundamental role in the sustenance of life on the planet. The technical level of this book starts at an advanced level in the first chapter, and then maintains an intermediate level for most of the book. Its greatest achievement is in the articulation of basic earth systems and cycles that make life possible, and how the thermodynamic principle of entropy so essential to life on earth is maintained.Invoking the Gaian hypothesis and subsequent theory, originally expounded by James Lovelock in the 70s and 80s,the author reiterates the inherent connections that exist between the biosystem and the geosystem, and why both systems are needed by the planet to stabilize itself in specific states. In this context, Morton makes the case for why photosynthesis is not just something plants do, but what our planet does, and argues why this is an important distinguishing feature from other planets in the solar system. This book introduces the reader to the various geological ages such as the Archean and the Proterzoic , to important events in geological time like the Great Oxidation Event, the Cambrian and the Devonian Explosions, and ultimately to the chemistry of photosynthesis. We learn about photorespiration versus photosynthesis, the enzyme Rubisco that powers the Calvin-Benson cycle, the basic process by which photosynthetic energy is used to reduce carbon dioxide. Morton provides an understandable explanation of the two-stage Photosystem process that first uses light energy to take electrons from water and eventually to feed other chemical reactions. In this manner, the author convincingly makes the case for why plants are really beautifully designed ""photosynthetic machines"" that supply and re-supply the basic needs of our planet.In conclusion, Morton explains the climate crisis in terms of what elements in this cycle have been thrown off-balance, but paints an optimistic undertone on the feasibility of possible novel solutions for the impending overheating from excess carbon in the atmosphere. Overall, this is a passionate account of a basic process that happens day-in and day-out, that most of us take for granted. After understanding its inherent beauty in its engineering, one is guaranteed to never look at a plant the same way again."
17,0007163649,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7069868-john,5,"""Eating the Sun"" contains beautiful writing, a pace driven by the human lives of scientific discovery and discussion, and successful explanations of a number of complicated systems microbiological and ecological systems. ""Eating the Sun"" is a book about photosynthesis: how it was discovered to work, how it came about and the role it played in Earth's history, and how human activities are manipulating its functioning. These points are covered in turn, organized according to timespans: * lifespan of a man (so far): the history of discoveries in molecular biology is told with respect to the lifespan of one of the participants* lifespan of the Earth (so far): the role photosynthesis played or failed to play in such events as the Great Oxygenation Event and ice ages, as well as evolutionary changes in the plants and photosynthesis itself (i.e. C4 metabolism)* lifespan of a tree (so far): the scientific changes leading to the Industrial Revolution and its ongoing effects in global atmospheric balanceI've now read this book twice. This book will be appreciated by anyone with a reasonable level of science in their background. The first time, a number of these topics were new to me and I found it understandable but suitably challenging. This time, I found it completely readable without any serious effort. For those with an appreciation of science and interested in developing a better understanding of the natural world, but with limited formal background in biology or geology, this will be an excellent introduction.The pace is both the book's challenge and it's joy: the book's the human stories encourage a quick reading, while the scope of the material deserves closer attention and study. Yet, by being so light, it was easy to understand the ideas at hand, though I would would be hard-pressed to explain all of the interactions. The book had some illustrations, but could have had more, particularly in terms of feedback diagrams for the second two sections, to help keep these various factors straight.From now as compared to when I first read it, the enjoyment of the third section declined considerably. There are a lot of infrastructural challenges to meet and though never fun, that's always a more pleasant prospect when it looks like people will rise to those challenges.

18,0007163649,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1266630-richard-williams,5,"popular science tends to be written by one of two types of people. scientists who have decided that telling the world about science is as important as working in their lab and writers, usually journalists from magazines that got interested in some aspect of science, wrote a longish piece and then thought enough to make it into a book. this author is the second type but he writes, especially the first 1/4 of the book, on chlorophyll like a passionate scientist.the first part reminded me of crystal fire, another popular science book that approached the topic both historically and by making the people come alive as in a good novel. neat trick, rarely done well, which makes my first reading recommendation either of the first 3 chapters, to decide if you want to pursue the whole thing. it's on the higher side of science, potentially a bit of a slough for some, stick with it, finish one chapter before you give up.the second 1/3 of the book is the level up from chlorophyll, the plants and how they interact with the environment. a lot less science, a lot more speculation and i must admit my enthusiasm waned a bit here. however i could see his big idea and really wanted to understand the whole thing. for this reason, if you decide to read the whole book, read it front to back, some of the meaning is in the relationships built up sequentially. the last roughly 1/3 is about global warming. unfortunately somewhere here my attention continued to wane and reading became looking a words on paper and lost that absorption that was so present earlier. if the author releases another edition it would be nice to see if this could be rewritten to the same level as the first 3rd.it's a good book. important and timely topic, but best of all it is a good jumpoff point to recommend to get everyone up to speed on these crucial issues: mankind and our effects on our environment. i could see it as a textbook or reading group choice. "
19,0007163649,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7358-jen,4,"This was not a light read for me...uh, sorry, no pun intended. I spent all Christmas break working though it and still had to return it to the library half-finished. The author is an editor for Nature, I believe, and seemed to have more of an insider perspective than the everyday science writer. Generally, quite poetic passages sandwiching in technical explanations of the discovery and implications of photosynthesis. Like many science books (Short History of Nearly Everything, Ocean of Air), a good part of the focus is on the scientists themselves. It is truly amazing to see what it took to (fairly recently) develop the model of photosynthesis that is standard in biology textbooks today. Of the parts I read, I most enjoyed the portion on early Earth history - how and why oxygen increased in the atmosphere, etc. It also gave me a better perspective on Gaiam and James Lovelock - that theory has never really clicked with me, but it was interesting to hear it from a fresh perspective and see how it has perhaps changed and moderated. It was really nice to have a biology book with fresh information (rather than, say, another evolution book rehashing things I know fairly well) - and that isn't supposed to sound all smarty-pants, just that I tend to read pop science books and sometimes they cover stuff that might not be new to someone with a science degree. This book was also interesting as it aligns well with our new biology curriculum (since matter and energy flows are pretty much all it includes), although is just too tricky for me to incorporate into class, beyond my own professional development. This is also the 2nd book I've read in a year that cites experiments by Katja's former PhD advisor - looking forward to the day I can see her research in a book ;)"
20,0007163649,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8156215-ann,4,"This book is an excellent introduction to photosynthesis, plants, and the current energy and climate crisis. Though without technical language, Morton's presentation of the process of photosynthesis may be a bit heady for some but the book is worth the effort. Morton writes well, even lyrically, situating the current science in its history and philosophy, highlighting many important historical figures. He brings this understanding, history, and current research to bear on the path ahead developing new ways to ""eat the sun."" Though not directly related to his purpose in the book, I found several things problematic: he misrepresents plant evolution; refers to three kingdoms when he means domains; presents cell size as only an issue of surface area to volume, neglecting the essential compartmentalization necessary for the simultaneous, complex chemistry that eukaryotic cells do; and suggests that microbes are bacteria when all microscopic life forms are microbes. He is just wrong to suggest that the chloroplast precursor colonized its host as nice as this may be stylistically, current structure does not support this view. Finally, again perhaps nice stylistically, he makes much of plant use of carbon dioxide and water because these are used in great quantities and belittles essential minerals because they are used in small or even tiny quantities -- this is misleading even if it writes well. Those peeves and a few others aside, this book is mostly a delight to read making sense of a complex topic and providing good background -- scientific and historical -- that bear on our current crisis. I recommend the book to those sorting through our climate crisis and students in biology and environmental sciences."
21,0007163649,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5006146-beeb3,0,"The cycle of photosynthesis is the cycle of life, says science journalist Morton (Mapping Mars). Green leaves trap sunlight and use it to absorb carbon dioxide from the air and emit life-giving oxygen in its place. Indeed, plants likely created Earth's life-friendly oxygen- and nitrogen-rich biosphere. In the first part, Morton, chief news and features editor of the leading science journal, Nature, traces scientists' quest to understand how photosynthesis works at the molecular level. In part two, Morton addresses evidence of how plants may have kick-started the complex life cycle on Earth. The book's final part considers photosynthesis in relation to global warming, for, he says, the Earth's plant-based balance of carbon dioxide and oxygen is broken: in burning vast amounts of fossil fuels, we are emitting more carbon dioxide than the plants can absorb. But Morton also explores the possibility that our understanding of photosynthesis might be harnessed to regain that balance. Readers should persevere through (or skim) the more technical discussions in the first part, for what follows is a vast, elegant synthesis of biology, physics and environmental science that can inform our discussions of urgent issues."
22,0007163649,http://goodreads.com/user/show/334225-steve,3,"I had my hopes that this book would do for chloroplasts what  Power, sex, suicide did for mitochondria. Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way. A poor start made it slow going for me.Split into three parts, subtitled ""a man's life,"" ""the planets life,"" and ""a trees life,"" it covers the discovery and comprehension of photosynthesis by people, the development of photosynthesis and how it affected the planet, and the implications of current changes on photosynthesis on plants (I.e., climate change). The first part is the weakest, focusing primarily on scientific feuds and personalities rather than the actual science (at least in my reading), which made it a real slog. The second part, dealing with the impact of photosynthesis on life on the planet is correspondingly very strong and interesting. The third-part brings interesting viewpoints on climate change – in particular, talking about planetary energy budgets, and the effect that increasing levels of CO2 will have on photosynthesis in plants that we depend on, in particular. But somehow, I just never really engaged with the book. This is obvious from the fact that it took me considerably longer to finish this book than  the manga guide to biochemistry. Even accounting for differences in length and style."
23,0007163649,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3363047-karel-baloun,5,"Best earth science book that I've read this decade.  The first section describes the details of photosynthesis in exquisite detail, exactly as I wish had my high school biology class, from the z-scheme, to rubisco, to The historical atmospheric levels of various gases that evolved it. Last section outstandingly summarizes energy and material flows in the modern world, including and surpassing Smil's detailed accountings.Plants grow from the air, with their carbon from CO2, not soil.  Nitrogen from air via soil microbes.  Transpiration from trees is stunning. Deforestation station has reduced the amount of water the plants put in the atmosphere by about 3000 cubic km per year, especially around eastern Brazil where the coastal forests basically water the Amazon.Without human intervention, all photosynthesis on earth would end in 100 million years, due to a starvation of carbon dioxide (p304).  Heat speeds weathering, as does mountain building, and vocanoes can't keep up. C3 plants would end first, so grasses overwhelm.  Without photosynthesis, all life does. We already are dramatically Geoengineering the planet. When we choose to do that systematic way, who will decide the priorities among the outcomes?"
24,0007163649,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7227227-tori,4,"This was a dense book. The first part was an in depth look at the scientists working in the last century that discovered the interworkings of photosynthesis. Morton does not shy away from the scientific details, which were a bit over my head but I really appreciated their inclusion because I feel they are lacking in a lot of books. There is a lot of history and names included, and while interesting I didn't feel that Morton talked about them with the same wit as Bill Bryson does (I'm thinking of A Short History of Nearly Everything, but what bothered me about that book was the lack of scientific detail, so I can't win). The second section was about how the development of photosynthesis affected the atmosphere, and how the atmosphere and photosynthesizing plants evolved together. The last section was on climate change (or climate crisis as Morton prefers) and a call for increased investment in solar power development. I liked the section divisions, and felt that very few stones were left un-turned. Morton's writing was best when he was philosophizing about plants and our world. Those bits were fewer and far between, but they were lovely. "
25,0007163649,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4215702-jenny-brown,3,"This is an important and frustrating book. The topic is of immense interest, but Morton simply isn't able to explain in in a way that makes sense to someone who doesn't already understand many of the things he understands but doesn't get around to explaining.I made my way through Nick Lane's books on oxygen and mitochondria and came away feeling like I had learned a great deal. The science discussed here is similar, but I found myself baffled at every turn, and found especially annoying the many analogies that Morton used to supposedly explain things. They usually just made me more confused.So I was left with a great desire to learn more about the science behind photosynthesis and the CO2 cycles, and about possible ways in which similar processes could be harnessed for energy use and to damp down global warming, but rather disgusted that I couldn't explain any of the relevant processes based on what I'd read here. "
26,0007163649,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10834299-elvira,0,"When i studied botany there existed only two pathways of photosynthesis. Now i have some catching up to do. I am thoroughly enjoying reading about the human stories that accompanied the discoveries of photosynthetic pathways. Learning about the scientists, their joys, frustrations, doubts, and fears makes the world of discovery come alive. It makes my career in research and academia seem trivial compared to most of these people. Yet, I can also empathize with many of the hurdles and frustrations they experienced in academia, which suggests that the world of science cannot be dissected from human culture and society.Additionally, Oliver Morton, the author, eloquently explains the physics and chemistry in ways that any reader can understand and relate to in their own lives. I wish this book was written when I went through my courses in chemistry and physics many decades ago."
27,0007163649,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36347870-kenneth,4,"In short, this is a 400 page book on photosynthesis. In the larger scope the book asks if we can somehow imitate and invent ways of copying the process of photosynthesis and develop methods and devices that can capture and store power and perhaps transfer carbon from the atmosphere.You do not have to have a degree in chemistry to understand this book, by you should have an interest in chemistry. This book starts with the best introduction of any book that I have read in the past three years. It does get a bit heavy toward the middle, but it finishes both clearly and strongly with the concluding chapters, “Humanity” and “Energy”. I feel that the writer achieves his objective in how this book is laid out."
28,0007163649,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5997264-james-howard,3,"This is an interesting book which covers an extremely relevant and important topic - the environment and our attitude towards it. It describes photosynthesis in a way that most of us have probably never thought of it. I didn't read the book in one sitting, and have still not finished it. Where the book fails for me is it covers both the science, and the history of the science and the people behind it. It's a little much to take in all at once if you're not well versed with the subjects at hand. I would have preferred to read two seperate books - one about the sceintific discoveries etc, and one about the actual processes."
29,0007163649,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11931925-matthew,2,"There's a balance in science writing between talking about the science, and talking about the people doing science, and Eating The Sun does a rather poor job handling them both. Talking about the history of a whole discipline necessarily requires a lot of scientists, and they all gradually bleed together after a while. The author also spends pages and pages talking about the Gaian theory, which is an unnecessary hypothesis at best, and pseudoscience at worst. Photosynthesis is a complicated subject, and it may just be a very difficult subject to cover in a book that only has a handful of illustrations and a focus more on ecology and history."
30,0007163649,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1296248-jane,4,"Reading this book deepened my appreciation and awe of plants and of the interconnections within Earth's climate system. That humans are only beginning to understand these connections and how they relate to each other, makes a book like this even more important to be widely read. Although the description and history of how photosynthesis ""works"" and varies was a bit dense ultimately it was fascinating. I thought this author did a great job of making cutting edge science and future visions of renewable energy accessible and readable to the lay person. "
31,0007163649,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1912237-anne,5,Don't let the 1st few chapters deter you from getting to the big picture parts(parts 2+3).
