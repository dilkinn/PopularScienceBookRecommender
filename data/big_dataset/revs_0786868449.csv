Though it does not explicitly put down any equations, it is not an easy read simply due to the topic as well as the mind-blowing nature of its revelations. I would highly recommend this book to readers looking for something a bit challenging in physics while keeping the subject down to earth. I feel the addition of some equations would have made this book a bit more readable. :-)"
1,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is a very entertaining book. I enjoyed every chapter of the book. I was especially intrigued by the biological rhythms--fireflies and human sleep cycles. And I thoroughly enjoyed the step-by-step history of how the mathematics of coupled oscillators was worked out. As previous reviewers have mentioned, the book could have been helped by additional charts and diagrams--and even perhaps some equations. It is difficult to imagine some of the patterns the author describes, without some concrete reference. It would have been especially helpful in the chapter on chaos, when describing coupled strange attractors. The chapter on networks seems like a summary of a much more detailed book, Linked by Albert-Laszlo Barabasi.So, if the subject of networks intrigues you, I highly recommend that book, too."

Terrific stuff!"
3,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7612171-mac-hull,5,"A great multi-disciplinary introduction to the idea of complex systems obtaining order in a spontaneous way. It's funny that it seems like, at least to me, about half the reviews say they couldn't fully grasp all the ideas in the book while the other half claim it isn't technical enough. Some of the descriptions can be slightly hard to follow, but i think he does an outstanding job of helping the reader to visualize incredibly complex concepts. Personally, I'd rather the book be for the layman in the hopes that it could peak the interests of anyone despite their mathematical backgrounds. By making the book accessible to all, anyone can revel in the beauty of the universe that is often overlooked by the naked eye, despite the complexity of the concepts. These are concepts that, IMO, everyone should be aware of on some level because they permeate every scale and corner of the universe and are applicable to every discipline, concept, system, or part of everyday life. It's just a wonderful way to think... If it isn't technical enough, or even too technical, you can always use it as a launching point to explore whatever interests you the most since the book covers such a wide range of spontaneous order. Some math background (high school) definitely helps but is not completely required.This book might but a 4 star, but i decided to be generous. Yea, yea, many of the analogies do not convey the true complexity of the theories they are describing, but that's because they simply can't. As I already said, you can always choose to dig deeper into any concept he presents. Generally, the concepts discussed are all tied together well, if not for a couple momentary lapses, and he writes clearly. I'm generous with my rating simply because I really enjoy concepts like sync, complex systems, chaos theory, etc. that seem to permeate reality at all levels. It's my belief that everyone, no matter their walk of life, should have some kind of awareness of pervasive natural laws that describe ourselves and everything around us as it can lead to understanding and acceptance, as well as insight into almost any issue. The multidisciplinary approach of this book really helps bring out that pervasiveness and highlights the idea of some fundamental connectedness between all things that can be formulated. The far left and right of a distribution of people based on scientific knowledge just may find themselves bored at times, but an open minded approach to this book opens many doors for subsequent research and, most importantly, new ways of thinking."
4,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,4,"This is a great multi-disciplinary science book!The reader is introduced to phenomena from many disciplines.These phenomena are well-modeled by similar mathematics using non-linear oscillators.The book requires little math knowledge, but it helps.I plan to write my own computer simulations for some of these phenomena, and will link them to this review when I'm finished! :)I do have one heated criticism of this book:Strogatz defends Josephson's regurgitation of the most certainly incorrect view that quantum mechanics can somehow explain the para-normally supposed (and repeatedly experimentally verified to be non-existent!) phenomena of telepathy.There are so many things wrong with this digression, I hardly know where to start.Josephson did good work and was awarded a Nobel Prize. He's wrong about telepathy and all the other pseudo- and anti-science he's been dabbling with since.Strogatz argues that the ""allergic"" response by the scientific community is a fault.He couldn't be more wrong.It's a virtue, and an important one.To use a hyperbolic analogy (the likes of which Strogatz seems quite fond of), this reaction by the scientific community is indeed analogous to an immune response.In this case, however, it is the body of science fighting off the infection of the cancerous mysticism.So, reader beware, Strogatz has made a huge mistake here!"
5,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38238221-aditya,4,"A great discussion of the all-pervasiveness of synchrony born out of non-linearities in systems. The anecdotes and occasional words of advice made the book all the more fun to read. This book would be liked by people interested in dynamical systems, inter-connectedness of apparently disparate scientific fields, and having a unified scheme of understanding the universe."
6,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37606149-panz,5,Probably the best book I've read this year. So many OMG moments
7,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,3,"So, what is this ""Sync?"" What is this book about? Good question! I'm still not sure, to be honest... Based on the synopsis, I was expecting it be more in the typical line of complexity theory, but I ended up learning more about things that I knew very little about, including the syncing habits of fire flies and the circadian rhythm of humans. I guarantee that this book contains some new information for every reader who is not called Steven H. Strogatz. The central idea is that the phenomenon of ""sync(hrony)"" is a key driver of complex organization. It enables animal societies to communicate, the brain chemistry to function in harmony, etc... And there is certainly a lot here to digest, some of it very interesting indeed. Behind the central idea of sync lies mountains of interesting science across multiple disciplines and across multiple decades. For good or ill, the book takes a deep dive into deep science - sometimes to the point of impenetrable jargon. And this also poses a problem for the reader, since a lot of the mathematical and physical terminology is very technical and hard to grasp. It demands a lot from the reader, even though the author does a pretty good job explaining things with down-to-Earth metaphors. I would recommend this book for people are mathematically not just literate but semi-advanced. At the same time, I feel that the connecting tissue between the different phenomena from fruit flies to quantum computers is not quite as strong as the author would like to convince us. Some of the bold claims about the relevance of sync for a unified theory of everything do not pan out. It more feels like a potential network of interesting connections rather than a substantial revelation.Although I wasn't fully convinced by the author's bold claims, and although it sometimes bogs down into an endless cavalcade of scientific studies that seem loosely connected, I did enjoy my time with the book for the most part. For someone interested in complexity theory and the phenomenon of spontaneous orders, I would recommend a few other books, including Complexity: The Emerging Science at the Edge of Order and Chaos and Thinking in Systems: A Primer, over this one. However, if you are still craving for more, Sync contains tons and tons of fascinating facts, tidbits, and suggestions that should interest anyone who is convinced that the natural world contains a hidden order. Although it barely scratches the edges of a unified theory of everything, and although it ultimately oversells its premise, Sync is a bold little exercise in thinking (and syncing) outside of the box."
8,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29825333-varad-deshmukh,5,"Steve Strogatz has gained popularity with his textbook, ""Non-linear Dynamics and Chaos"". I would say that his non-academic work, ""Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order"" is an equally smashing hit. ""Sync"" explores the idea of how spontaneous synchronization arises in the chaotic turbulent lives/non-lives of diverse entities. Why do fireflies synchronize their flashing in the dark or how do crickets chirp in unison? Why do we wake up at almost our usual time, even after an all-nighter? Why do certain fads gain popularity in the market, while some die down quickly? Why did the Millennium Bridge start shaking when an unruly group of people stampeded it on inauguration day? These are some of the questions that Steve Strogatz addresses in this book. I was really impressed with this book on so many fronts. As a computational science enthusiast, this book was a special treat for me. Strogatz fills the chapters with narratives where computers are used extensively for modeling various phenomena -- coupled biological oscillators, Josephson junctions, sync across social networks, chaotic synchronizers. The idea of a computer model seems almost banal by now, but Strogatz's experiments go way back when they were not so common. Strogatz's narration style is very gripping, and he generates sufficient suspense through his various experiments before giving the reader the thrill of successful result outcomes. The applications covered in the book are diverse -- synchronous flashing of fireflies, the alpha rhythm of the brain, the circadian body clock, planetary and quantum sync, communication security, sync across the human network, to name a few. Since the applications and underlying mathematics is diverse, Strogatz handles the basics of each topic before he connects it to a sync problem. The descriptions are pretty layman, even to the point that not a single equation is provided in the book. My only complaint is that the book lacks pictures sometimes where they are necessary. At some points, I felt a diagram would have relieved the burden of description both on the writer and the reader. Strogatz hopes in the epilogue of his book that he's given the reader a sense about how thrilling it is to be a scientist. I think he has. For starters, this book straddles across the boundaries of so many ""fields"", giving it a heavily interdisciplinary focus. For a problem in any application, Strogatz recounts many problems in other fields that exhibit the same behavior. He then shows how mathematics serves as the means to describe such problems, allowing scientists to then feed these problems to computing engines for visualization and assist them in discovering new theoretical avenues. Essentially, Strogatz demonstrates how scientists often need to see the unity in disparate problems of diverse fields, to express them in a common language, and cross-apply concepts to get solutions. Secondly, he focuses for a significant part on his own experiments and collaborations in the area of sync. He gets the advantage to narrate the story of his simulation crusades, impressing on the reader the enjoyment to be gained through pushing unexplored waters. And lastly, through the fun, he stresses the importance of scientific bravery where no fruitful applications are in sight. He's scattered sufficient examples through the narration where seemingly fun experiments for the sake of curiosity lead to crucial applications for mankind. "
9,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1507845-kc,4,"Wow. What a terrific book. You would think that heavy tome written my a mathematician would either be an incomprehensible melange of words, or a complete bore. This was both cogent and fascinating.Although published over 15 years ago, it still feels fresh, despite a few detours about the ""good old days"" of running computer simulations on what we now would consider hopelessly outdated hardware.The premise that order arises in nature from non-intelligent sources is a provocative one. The youtube video showing spontaneous sync occurring with metronomes illustrates the phenomenon quite well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5v5eB...Other really interesting examples included: the wobble of the millennium bridge, Asian fireflies blinking together, and examples from both astronomy and quantum mechanics.I can't say I grasped the entirety of the message, but this was a really fun ride through math, physics, biology, and philosophy. I look forward to reading more from Strogatz, who further endeared me with mundane descriptions of wandering through MIT campus, an experience that I could relate to on a surprisingly personal level."
10,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8284707-louisa,5,"The spectacle of synchrony in nature is one of those mysteries that strike a chord in us. Fireflies blinking on and off in unison. Schools of fish moving gracefully as if they were only one. Pacemaker cells in a heart working all together to make that heart beat. Menstrual cycles of female roommates and co-workers starting to match each other over time (yes, it's true!) And then there's the synchronization between things that aren't even alive: photons that align to form a laser beam; electrons marching in step in a superconductor; the moon turning on its axis at precisely the same rate as it circles the earth; and pendulum clocks that hang next to each other adjusting their periodic swaying, as Christiaan Huygens observed, ""in a kind of sympathy"". Mindless, lifeless things can sync spontaneously, says Steven Strogatz, because the capacity for sync does not depend on intelligence, or life, or natural selection. It springs from the deepest source of all: the laws of mathematics and physics. Using math, Strogatz shows why synchrony is likely to happen in nature, and why in some cases it is inevitable. This is wonderful, fascinating stuff, and perhaps the best part of all is that there is still so much more to discover. We can't explain it all, admits Strogatz in the end: maybe we instinctively realize that if we ever find the source of spontaneous order, we will have discovered the secret of the universe.Yes, maybe."
11,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"I enjoyed this book every bit as much as Gleick's book on chaos. Strogatz is an excellent writer. Able to convey complex concepts of chaos and synchronicity to the general reader, this book is for anyone with interest in the topic. If you don't fully understand chaos from one perspective, don't worry. Storgatz provides many. With discussions of his own work as well as the work of mentors, students, and others in the field, Strogatz addressed the broad application of sync in the world and universe. Skilled at capturing the various personalities of people he has worked with, Strogatz also included interesting stories about many researchers in the field as well as interesting stories about the inner workings of academia. With examples from biology (ie., neurons, heartbeat, and sleep/circadian rhythm), to physics and engineering (ie., metronomes, super conductors, power grids, and the bridge in London), to social connectedness (ie., 6 degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon/small world model), and the future of sync studies (consciousness, evolution, immune system, the universe as a computer, and more), there are many fun things to learn about. I was also happy to learn about the lesser known role of Stanley Milgram in uncovering the 6 degrees of separation principle. Who knew what the study of fireflies would bring? Excellent book."
12,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1669347-jeff,4,"This book is an interesting look at a number of phenomena that aren't as curious as the author makes them out to be.The book focuses on instances of ""spontaneous order-seeking"" in nature. Cases where things start irregular, but tend towards an equilibrium which is ordered. Now, before you go jumping about the Second Law of Thermodynamics, he's claiming this for living systems, and at the macroscopic level -- he's talking about things like certain species of fireflies which spontaneously synchronize their flashes, or about how women will begin to cycle together if they live in close proximity. So there's agency involved in here, he's not claiming that some types of pottery shards, when dropped, will spontaneously rearrange into a dish.He doesn't get terribly in-depth into these subjects (it's not a journal article), but he does have lots of interesting examples, and discusses the kinds of information/communication problems that have to be overcome for this kind of syncing-up to work. I'd recommend this book."

It is a fascinating subject though and I have seen getting dismissed as coincidence or data fluke, but inspected closely it reveals some astonishing patterns about everyday phenomena."
14,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2379625-andrew,3,"I’d like to see an updateThis book was quite good, don’t let my three stars make you think otherwise. I liked many parts of the book - the history of the study of coupled oscillators, the parts related to circadian rhythms, small-world networks, and some other biological systems. I really liked most of the book, and while I thought this book had good figures in it, I thought it could have benefited from additional figures and equations. Mostly Strogatz chooses to use prose (for a non-technical audience) to describe systems that could otherwise be simply described by equation or depicted in a figure. I’d love to see how the ideas in the book have been applied to the last 15+ years of social media and the internet in general. Maybe there could be an updated edition?"
15,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55006635-karan-kurani,4,"Great insight into the phenomenon of sync and how hard it is to decipher non linear dynamic systems.The part before the final couple of chapters is a slog to go through and not as interesting as the rest of the book.

16,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14734538-roberto-rigolin-f-lopes,4,"Strogatz goes around showing us synchronization everywhere. He means everywhere in the whole universe. From small fireflies to big moons. Atoms and humans are also mentioned. For example, superconductivity and water freezing are just synchronization of atoms. Hey, you will feel his passion for the subject throughout his book; he is madly in love. Sometimes even throwing mind-blowing ideas around fun explanations on how order arises from chaos."

That is more like man made peer pressure. Humans like to be included. belong to some groups.However with the non living thing like metronomes, it still reach sync after they were placed on the same unstable surface. Similar to the hanging Bridge in London that walkers all walk in the same pattern.Some part is easy to read, while some more deeper physics or math part, need more basic

没错，都是真实的。此书从这些绚丽而又令人着迷的自然景象着手，讲述 了宇宙中的同步现象。热力学定律表明，大自然会无情地走向更无序、更混乱 的状态，然而，种种同步现象却又表明，秩序会从混沌中自发产生。 萤火虫的同步闪烁，人体生物钟内部的机制，女性经期的互相影响，超导 体中耦合电子的同步振动，有节奏循环变化的神奇化学反应，伦敦千禧桥的 垮塌，交通中节奏频率因素对道路畅通度的影响，歌剧院中观众在同步和无 序之间不断摇摆的掌声，甚至社交中著名的“六度分割”理论……作者从生物 讲到物理，又讲到人类行为和社会学，简直无所不包。不同于很多忽悠人的书 籍，作者的例证基于大量研究数据，不用一个公式，却把其中的原理解释得极 其具体生动，令人如痴如醉。 书中有很多地方非常有趣，在此仅举几例。例如，作者认为，同步科学的 源头是17世纪荷兰科学家惠更斯在研究钟摆运动时误打误撞发现的双摆同 频共振现象，这表明同步的能力不依赖于智能、生命以及自然选择，而是源于 数学和物理定律。再如，讲人体生物钟时作者提到了一个实验，科学家让受试 者按23.5小时一天过日子，受试者经常无法入睡，难以忍受，但是如果按23小 时过日子却反倒好了很多；后来科学家又让受试者过1.5小时一天的日 子……最终，科学家从中得出结论：我们什么时候入睡并不取决于之前醒了 多久，而是取决于人体的体温变化。又如，英国物理学家约瑟夫森在因发现隧 道超导电流获得了诺贝尔物理学奖后，却放弃了研究主流物理，全神贯注于 超自然现象：顺势疗法、遥视，甚至用意念弯曲勺子。然而，数年后，伦敦千禧 桥意外垮塌，众人不解其中缘由，他却立即给《卫报》编辑写信，阐明了大桥垮 塌的原因……总之，这是一本跨学科的科普著作，是了解复杂性科学、混沌现象、小世 界现象的入门书。同时又贯穿着科学工作者们的生活点滴、趣闻逸事，读起来 令人兴致盎然。另外，作者在TED上也做过关于同步的演讲，有兴趣的读者可 以一看。..........................螺旋波最惊人之处是，它们似乎是有生命的。它们可以自维持，不需要起 搏器：螺旋波本身就是起搏器。如果你在激活的B-Z反应的薄层中观察到了 螺旋波，它看上去就像一座旋转的风车，永不停歇地追逐自己的尾巴并自我 再生。 在某种程度上，旋转只是偶然而已。更根本的问题是，波正在传播，传播 方向垂直于波前的每一个点。我们的困惑是，因为螺旋线的几何形状中存在 突然弯曲：波的传播看上去酷似旋转。请想象老理发店的旋转杆的幻觉。旋转 杆上画的螺旋线似乎是向上传播的。但很显然它根本没动，它仅仅是随着杆 子旋转而已。这里，旋转伪装成了传播，与螺旋波中相同的效应相反。 然而，我们会感到螺旋波的旋转是真实的。周围介质中的每个点周期性 地振荡；每当波穿过时，它都被重新激发。因此培养皿中的每个点都会循环经 过激发态、耐火态和静止态，然后再回到激发态这几个熟悉的阶段。这里的新 奇之处是，螺旋波创造了同时构建于空间和时间上的振荡。此时不是步调一 致的同步（别洛索夫在他最早的实验中看到的空间均匀性，烧杯中的溶液立 即改变颜色），现在的振荡好似足球场观众席球迷发起的“人浪”，随着球迷在 恰当的时刻起立和落座，“人浪”围绕着球场循环。 我们再作一个更形象的比喻，请想象1	000张多米诺骨牌在地板上整齐 地摆了一圈。假设我们拥有一名动作敏捷的助手，他会在每张骨牌倒下后立 即将它重新立起来。我们推倒第一张骨牌，骨牌翻倒的波浪开始沿着圆环传 递。助手紧随其后，疯狂地将骨牌重新立起。此时，正在翻倒的骨牌对应于激 发态，已经倒下的骨牌对应于耐火态，直立的骨牌对应于静止态。这样的波会 不停地循环，直到动作敏捷的助手崩溃。 相同实验的生物学版本已由生物学家迈耶（A.G.Mayer）在水母的帮助 下于1906年完成。他用水母伞形圆顶的边缘塑造了一个神经肌肉组织环，然 后在一个点上用电刺激它，注意，他只允许波沿一个方向传播。神经冲动循环 了6天，大约传播了50万圈。很明显，波可以围绕着应激介质的一维环持续循环。但是，将相同的思想 扩展到二维上则存在问题，这是螺旋波的特殊之处。在上面的讨论中，我们含 蓄地假设，到了波返回时，介质已经从耐火阶段恢复。如果循环足够大或波速 足够慢，那么这个假设就是有效的。但在螺旋波的中心附近，这个假设不再成 立，因为激励所经历的循环变得太小了。 其结果是，螺旋线的中心并不像介质的其余部分那样振荡。它并不显示 出颜色有节奏的变化，或光强的波峰和波谷以及任何振荡的迹象。此处的循 环振幅下降到零。这一点被称为相位奇点，意味着周围振荡的相位在此处无 法被合理地定义。相位在此处变得模糊。这个令人费解的情况类似于发生在 北极和南极的事情。在地球表面的那些奇点上，所有的时区都汇聚于此，白天 和黑夜的循环被瓦解。太阳既不升起也不落下；它只是沿着地平线循环。在地 球两极，时刻是没有意义的。它既是所有的时刻，又不是任何时刻。 但对于螺旋波而言，相位奇点远超过了一个遥远而又奇特的地理位置。 它是驱动波的引擎。令人惊讶的是，只要核心完好无损，整个螺旋波可以自己 再生，无论它的外围旋臂受到了怎样的损害都无妨。螺旋波很难根除还有另 一个原因：它们发射波的速度几乎与介质允许的速度一样快。所以它们能够 挡住其他侵入波，例如遥远的起搏器射来的同心圆。侵入波在与旋臂的碰撞 中湮灭，它们无法取得任何进展。相反，较快的波无情地朝着较慢的起搏器前 进，霸占它们的领土，最终扼杀它们。因此，从长远来看，培养皿中的B-Z反应 看起来总像是充满螺旋线的佩斯利花纹(20)，看不到圆形波，只有螺旋线才可 以相互抵挡（见图8-1）。.........................我注意到了一个绝妙的现象，之前从未有人提及。把两个摆钟 挂在一起，中间只隔30〜60厘米，它们就会精确地保持一致，进而毫 无变化地一起振荡。欣赏了一会儿后我终于明白，这种现象是通过 某种同步发生的：把两个钟摆的摆动节奏搞乱，不出半小时，它们总 是会趋于一致，并一直保持下去，直到我让它们停下来。然后我将它 们分开，一个挂在房间的一端，另一个挂在4.5米开外，在一天之中， 它们之间有了5秒的误差。因此，它们先前的一致在我看来是由钟摆 运动造成的空气轻微扰动引起的。钟表总是被关在盒子里，每个都 有将近45千克重。当二者一致的时候，钟摆并不是平行振荡，而是以 相反的方向彼此接近和分离。惠更斯有了自己的答案。尽管每个时钟都被放置在36〜40千克重的铅制 盒子内，但钟摆的摆动使盒子产生了轻微的运动，从而使得木梁发生颤动，木 梁又使得椅子发生颤动。当两个时钟同步的时候，即它们的钟摆刚好彼此朝 相反方向摆动的时候，此时大小相等、方向相反的力作用在木梁上，二者相互 抵消，椅子得以保持静止。反之，当惠更斯扰乱同步的时候，两个方向上相反 的力不再保持平衡。二者合力中的一部分拖拽着木梁来回移动，椅子随之发 生颤动。正如惠更斯所言，“同步一旦实现，椅子就不会再移动，只是在阻止时 钟脱离‘同步状态’，因为钟摆一旦要脱离同步，椅子微小的移动便会使它们恢 复到先前的位置”。用现代术语讲，惠更斯发现了通过负反馈实现稳定的现 象。 ..............这就是激光背后的关键过程，被称为“受激发射”，你可以看到，它提供了 一种增加沿着特定路线飞行的光子数的方法。每一次，一个光子撞击一个被 激发的原子，光子就会进行自我复制，放大该方向上的光量，这正是激光的英 文LASER首字母缩写代表的含义：受激辐射光放大（Light	Amplification	by Stimulated	Emission	of	Radiation）。辐射是被激发的，而不是自发的，因为射入 的光子引发了激发态的原子射出新的光子。 最重要的是，发射的光子与衍生的光子是无法区分的。如果你认为这些 光子不是粒子，而是一种微小的光波，那么它们就是完全同步的。它们所有的 波峰和波谷都是一致的，这意味着它们携带着相同颜色的光，处于同一方向 和同一相位。 没有常识性的方法可以理解受激发射是如何形成的，或者说为什么新的 光子会是旧光子的副本，这种现象是量子力学奇特逻辑的结果，原子和亚原 子世界中的物理学会打破我们日常生活中的直觉。1917年，爱因斯坦发现了 受激发射在理论上的必然性，后来人们又花了43年时间才想出如何利用这一 原理创造出第一道激光。 .........无生命的同步的力量延伸到了广阔的太空，范围远远超出了全球定位系 统中的人造卫星。我们往往没有意识到宇宙尺度的同步，因为宇宙涉及高深 莫测的距离和时间。但是，当天文学家发现了围绕格列泽876（Gliese	876）恒 星运行的两个小行星时，他们注意到的第一件事是，两个行星都处于轨道共 振状态。轨道共振仿佛优雅的舞蹈，在相同时间内，一个行星环绕它的恒星两 圈，而另一个行星环绕一圈。地球的卫星——月球的情况则更为引人注目：月 球自转的速度与围绕地球公转的速度相同，这也就是为什么我们总是只看到 月球的同一侧，即有“人脸”图案的那一侧，而永远看不到“后脑勺”的黑暗一侧 的原因.月球的公转与自转之间的同步可以直观地进行解释。为了简化问题，我 们假设月球围绕地球公转的轨道是圆形的。圆的大小由两个力的平衡所决 定：来自地球的万有引力和月球做圆周运动时产生的离心力，离心力使得月 球有飞离地球的倾向。（当你乘坐汽车遭遇急转弯时，把你推向车门的力就是 离心力。）这两种力，即引力和离心力，在月球的中心完美实现了平衡。但要记 住的是，月球是一个巨大的球体，并不是一个点。月球中心以外的点的受力并 不完全平衡。在月球的近地侧，引力更强；远地侧则离心力更强。这种不平衡 造成了月球上有两个小凸起，一个在近地侧，一个在远地侧。地球上也是如 此，月球的引力是导致海洋中产生潮汐的原因。在月球上，由于没有水，“潮汐 效应”并不明显，但仍然很重要，正是它将月球从球形变成了雪茄的形状。由 于地球的引力作用，雪茄总是想径直指向地球的中心。即使月球绕着地球转 动，它也要固执地始终对准，同时，月球也在以一种非常精确的方式自转，它需 要在地球的吸引下准确地旋转它的自转轴。这就是如今月球自己发现的运行 条件：即所谓的1：1自转轨道共振，或称潮汐锁定。 ..........一个重要的线索出现于1866年，当时柯克伍德将这个难题改写成了一个 时间问题，而不是距离问题。他想知道一个假想的小行星在空隙中绕太阳公 转一周需要多长时间，通过调用开普勒第三定律（天体与太阳之间的距离和 天体公转周期之间的数学关系），柯克伍德可以计算出每一个空隙的轨道周 期。例如，在最大的空隙中的一颗小行星围绕太阳公转一周需要大约4年时 间：这是一个有趣的数字，因为它正好是木星的轨道周期12年的1/3。同样，另 一个空隙中的小行星围绕太阳公转5圈与木星公转2圈的时间相等。事实上， 所有的空隙都遵循同一个完美的规则：它们的轨道周期与木星的轨道周期总 是满足整数比，例如3：1，5：2，7：3，2：1…… 这些数字不是巧合。这些空隙现在被称为“柯克伍德空隙”，它们是天文 同步的迹象。它们暗示木星的引力是“始作俑者”：木星的引力会与任何误入 这些空隙中的小行星产生“共振”，有节奏地扰动它，并最终将它掷出小行星 带。 以上便是共振机制的运行原理。我们可以假设，一个公转周期约为4年的 小行星，它的公转速度是木星的3倍，对应于3：1的柯克伍德空隙。木星遵循着 几乎呈正圆形的公转轨道庄严地行进着，小行星从木星旁边开始前进，然后 沿着细长的椭圆形轨道朝太阳冲去。太阳强烈的引力会将小行星吸引到近日 点，然后迅速将它送回木星，在相同时间内，小行星公转3圈，木星只公转1圈。 在小行星公转第3圈的末尾，它又回到了位于木星旁边的初始状态。换句话 讲，小行星与木星的最接近点总是出现在二者轨道中的相同位置处。 这些亲密接触对于小行星有极强的干扰效应，木星体积巨大，当二者最 接近的时候，木星的引力对小行星的吸引最明显。此外，因为相互作用总是出 现在轨道上的同一点，因此同样的干扰效应会加倍累积。几百圈后，周期性的 拉扯积累到扭曲小行星路径的程度，就会使之变得无序，这大大增加了它离 开小行星带的概率。（相比之下，如果小行星不处在3：1共振状态，它最接近木星的点会随机分散在轨道上，从长远看，其整体效果会相互抵消。） 计算机模拟表明，从小行星带上甩出的小行星倾向于飞向太阳或飞出太 阳系。偶尔，它们会与一颗内行星相撞。如果那颗内行星恰好是地球，且这颗 小行星比珠穆朗玛峰更大（基于埋在墨西哥尤卡坦半岛下的撞击坑的大小， 可以推断出谋杀恐龙的杀手显然是一颗飞向地球的行星），那么你便会发现 天文同步对于我们是多么的重要。。柯克伍德空隙太窄，无法解 释所有疑似从小行星带中丢失的质量，认为木星的吸引将其全部弹出的解释 似乎极为不可能。天文学家约翰·钱伯斯（John	Chambers）和乔治·韦瑟里尔 （George	Wetherill）最近提出了另一种解答。他们提出，在太阳系诞生初期，几 个行星胚胎——有的有火星大小，合并成了小行星带中的岩石（正如它们在 其他地方所做的一样，最终形成了我们今天看到的行星）。这些原行星会搅动 小行星带中的其他岩石，将它们推入共振地带，主要是弹出，因而使得小行星 带变细的速度远快于木星引力单独作用的结果。随着时间的推移，部分甚至 所有胚胎行星就会自己进入这些空隙中，它们的结局只能是被弹出小行星 带，永远消失。 天文学家亚历山德罗·莫尔比代利（Alessandro	Morbidelli）和乔纳森·卢 尼勒（Jonathan	Lunine）更进一步推测表示，这些固执的行星胚胎中可能有一 个曾经撞上过年轻的地球，撞击导致洪水泛滥，形成了海洋。而关于地球的水 来自何处仍是个谜。其他内行星上都没有水，或只有极少量的水。鉴于地球在 太阳系中的位置，我们拥有的水似乎远比应得的多。 传统的解释是，彗星上拥有比其他已知天体更多的水，在地球形成的晚 期，有彗星撞击了地球，将水带到了地球上，形成了我们今天看到的江河湖 海。但天文学家们也对这一观点提出质疑，因为彗星中的水的化学成分与地 球上的水有很大不同。彗星含有较高比例的重水，重水中的氢原子拥有一种 罕见的变异，普通的氢原子原子核中只有一个质子，而重水中的氢原子原子 核中有一个质子和一个中子。另一方面，人们发现在一些被认为是小行星碎 片的富含碳元素的陨星上发现的水与海洋中的水更匹配。..........宏大的同步可以发生在宇宙这个最大的尺度上，而在最小的尺度上发生 的同步可能会更惊人。在物质的深处，此时的振子是电子，它们就像是微观世 界中的萤火虫。但与为了寻求数学上的简便而假定萤火虫完全相同不同，这 些量子粒子是真的相同。宇宙中的每一个电子都是无法区分的。它们没有年 龄，不会破裂或缺损，它们的完美超越我们见到过的一切群体行为。 在日常生活中，我们习惯于无序形式下的电子，即不合群的惊慌孤立的 粒子。驱动烤面包机的电流就是无数狂奔的电子，它们快速冲过灯丝，用它们 的“怒气”加热着灯丝。但如果我们取出相同的电子，并对它们进行协调，你便 得到了科学界已知的最引人注目的现象之一：数以万亿计的电子步调一致地 前进，没有电阻的阻碍便通过金属，没有以摩擦或热的形式耗费任何能量。这 种难以想象的光滑导体今天被称为超导。与钟表的同步类似，超导也是偶然 之间发现的，在研究温度接近绝对零度，电会发生什么现象时，科学家发现了 超导。........."

I selected, after several minutes of debate, Sync because I thought it was about chaos theory, which I had seen in an episode of CSI: Original Flavor, which made it some what interesting to me. I am pretty sure that in some ways Sync is indeed about chaos theory. At least the author began discussing chaos theory about a third of the way through the book. But I don’t really know for sure what Sync is about. This is, I’m sure, through no fault of the author, I just have no real understanding of science. I do wonder though, why Sync is in generalities rather than science. Is it because they wanted to introduce some chaos to the Dewey decimal system? Or, more likely, is there some flaw in the book similar to the one in my 001 book? I picked up on that flaw instantly because, after all history is my subject and I know the rules.Despite my lingering questions, Sync was interesting. The author did a very good job of using metaphor to explain what was happening with the science and math so instead of spending nearly three hundred pages confused and lost, I spent three hundred pages almost grasping the concepts. This fault is fully my own. I suspect that this metaphor heavy approach turns off the specialists while making the book more approachable for the general audience.I did come close to gaining practical applications from reading this book. For instance one chapter is dedicated to the cycles of sleep. I have a very dear friend who suffers from some level of insomnia and as I read this chapter I kept coming this close to having a practical idea from the ideas presented in the chapter, and yet it remained elusive. So, dear friend, you don’t suffer quite the scientific inability I suffer from, should you have the time or inclination, you could borrow Sync from the library and see if you can figure it out for yourself.The review is taken from my blog bibliophilebet.blogspot.com"
19,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38623347-simon-eskildsen,3,"I found this book fairly fascinating. Strogatz has been in applied mathematics for decades, with special interest in quantum physics and biology. The former I skipped many chapters on (they were incredibly abstract and hard to understand, and it's not something I have a special interest in), but the latter was fascinating. The chapters are about how fireflies sync, crickets sync their chirping, the heart's pacemaker syncs all the cells, and many other biological processes that sync with little information passing between the individual actors. While this is the name of the book, the book is largely an autobiography on a scientific journey spanning many decades. Strogatz describes to us the process of writing a paper, the frustrating lows, and the powerful sparks that strike at unlikely moments, in conversations with co-workers, or at home. One of the most influential papers Strogatz has co-written, is that of small-world networks. This relates to sync, and essentially it describes the power of graphs that are highly clustered with a couple of random connections to other tight clusters. For example, you are tightly connected to your friends, and their friends. That's a tight cluster. But that random person you met in Thailand 4 years ago and still keep in touch with is a random bridge to another tight cluster. This is what causes us to only be few links away from most people. When Strogatz was thinking about this problem, he realized how common these ""small-world networks"" were everywhere in biology, and how effective they are at getting tasks done.In general, I walk away with 3 big insights: (1) how academic work gets done, (2) the fascinating process of sync between many small entities, and (3) small-world networks, and the vocabulary about ""density"" and the power of just a few random bridges. While I enjoyed the book overall, I ended up skimming and skipping a fair bit of things that I just didn't find particularly interesting. "
20,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180785-ryan,4,"I read this book on the advice of an old friend who studies neuroscience. I have occasion to deal with synchronization problems in my own life, so I thought it would be fun to read about the science of it. And it was!If you've ever wondered about why your sleep patterns are they way they are, or why when you try to go to bed early you end up with terrible insomnia, or how fireflies all flash at the same time or the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon, this is the book for you. It's the kind of book with surprising enough stuff to tell your spouse or lunch friends about (as I did). The information is presented pretty clearly, with decent metaphors to deal with the inexpressible (at least w/o mathematics). Chaos lovers will find a lot of discussion about non-linear dynamics, as Strogatz is a leader in that field. It helps to have some basic exposure to modern physics topics in places.My '4' rating is really for the information in the book. The writing is pretty good for a Math professor, but there are places where it gets a little awkward. (probably would give it a '3') I've read enough ""popular"" science books to no longer get all excited with stories about the ""search"" for something. Sentences that begin ""I then called my buddy, so-and-so at Harvard. We spent summers together blah blah blah..."" are not my favorite. But there's not much of that here. All-in-all a pretty fun read."
21,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56710-ariel,5,"This book is eccelent. At the end of each chapter I found myself saying ""wow"", Strogatz has an engaging not too sciency writing style and frankly, it has made me appreciate math more.Studying math I always felt that the deeper point of it was shrouded for me. I think if I had read this and realized how deeply math was interconnected with everything (I guess I knew that, but seeing how it works on the outer reaches of science really makes it clear) I probably would have done better at it. The book runs all over recent scientific history alternating between scientific explanations, autobiography and history of the field. We learn about circadian rhythms, heart cells, lasers, and fireflies flashing in sync among other things. Strogatz has certainly done some amazing work but whenever he mentions work by other he always seems to acknowledge in a very positive way everyone who was involved, down to the lowly grad student.I also got an introduction not only to sync as a scientific field but it's relationship to chaos, quantum and complexity theory.Did I mention that I think this book is amazing?"
22,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6967393-nicholas,3," For the most part though,it reminded me of James Gleicks' Chaos book in the way that the Sync story is conveyed with tales of maverick characters on the fringes of established science, making serendipitous discoveries that lay around waiting for someone to slot them into a framework.Within this there are numerous enlightening insights and quirky facts about the rhythm and harmonies that universally pervade the fabric of existence,which make it well worth the effort. Although I did enjoy this book,I didn't find it as thrilling and inspiring as some other people seemed to do.It does roll along pretty well until it hits part 3,where the ability of language and metaphor to convey non linear concepts of encryption and 3D sync left me needy in some respects.Although I was able to follow the general principles,it was still frustrating not to be able to fully comprehend some of the finer points involved. Overall an entertaining popular science book,with a few moments of conceptual difficulties for non mathematicians,which can be circumvented without any deleterious effects to the whole. "
23,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,3,"Like many other books that try to prove that the world is not exactly linear/gaussian/causal that we learn in schools, this book too spans multiple fields, reveals surprising aspects of seemingly everyday life and shows the limits of normal scientific theories. But the book is no ""The Black Swan"", ""Chaos (Gleick)"", ""Linked"" or ""The Tipping Point"". Some of the key points are covered in the previous books. And the concept of ""Sync"" is not truly as encompassing as network effect, avalanche or chaos used by others. Sync is effectively spontaneous coordination - which is truly worth admiring in the case of fireflies, but appears like an artificial application when used for network effect (power law), many aspects of the Circadian rhythms and electrical grids. Even though the concept is not as radical as in some more famous books, the advocation of non-linear complexity in simple language is well presented in an engaging manner. "
24,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1950709-derek-davis,4,"(Strangely, the subtitle is slightly different in my Kindle edition. So is somethign slightly different? Dunno.)After a shaky start full of ""my gosh"" and too many fireflies, Sync settles down in the second half to a serious scientific study of how almost everything across the scientific spectrum (physics, chemistry, biology) shows spontaneous development of synchronized order, usually after reaching a ""tipping point"" of coherence. Some of what's presented (especially in the earlier parts) may seem obvious and unexceptional, but the overall idea that things get together and do their thing together because of physical laws is fascinating.I got the feeling that about a third of the way through the ms. Strogatz either fired or hired a ghost writer. Either way, the improvement was dramatic, from little-kid confusion to full-front understanding. So if you get turned off initially, plunge ahead. He's a good guy who thinks around corners."
25,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,4,"The book is not an easy listen. Be prepared for statements like ""the coherence of the neurons in our brain are best thought of as solving a differential equation to determine the equilibrium solution involved in the non-linear system...."".The book covers many diverse topics, from why does the face of the moon always face towards us to how does a laser work. The author ties all of the topics together by showing how each of the constituent parts acts to produce the whole system.Each of the different topics was exciting, but I did not understand the topic well enough to explain it to others after having listened to the topic. That probably means he didn't explain the topic at a simple enough level for me to understand.Any high school student or college beginner who is thinking about majoring in mathematics should listen to this book. The author presents the exciting diverse fields available for the math practitioner. "
26,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20572109-sergey-antopolskiy,4,"This must be the best pop-sci book I've read this year. The reason I liked it is simply because it is deep and well written. Author really dives into details of how a particular research was done and how a particular phenomenon works. He provides metaphors, which are helpful, if somewhat obscure at times (though this provided a rich source of laughter for me). Being a scientist myself, I found his analogies quite precise and revealing.Books like this one are rare. Most pop-sci books are 80% personal stories or anecdotal evidence, and only 20% science (good example is ""The Talent Code"" I read just before this book). This one is 20% stories, 80% science. And in this ratio case stories are actually enjoyable and funny.I said it once and I'll say it again: leave the content of pop-sci books to actual scientists. They'll almost always do a better job than journalists."
27,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4249244-michiel,5,"This is a marvelous book! Strogatz has the gift to explain complex mathematical theories with simple and clear analogies. He gives us examples from biology, sociology, modern physics, cosmology, traffic science etc to prove chaos theory is not some abstract idea only useful to keep some pale eccentrics busy but is an intrinsic part what makes our universe tic!His descriptions of the colorful people who laid the foundations of sync were very fun to read. I will most certainly read his other work based on his lectures!"
28,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14526893-koke,3,"Though call, 3.45 I suppose. Steven Strogatz seems a truly bright and interesting multidisciplinary thinker, often entertaining and witty.It is pitiful Strogatz implications and intentions throughout the book are not clear. I can't seem to decide if there is scientific grounding in nature or if the 'stories' are just marvellous to us, humans. Unpleasant reading as a consequence. It is slightly corrected in the epilogue, enough for a shift in appreciation for him and the book.To me it seems the book has a lot of potential but needs thorough editing. "
29,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47957786-vivek-kotecha,5,"Highly recommend this book to anyone who understands that Scientific reductionism on it's own doesn't / won't completely explain the universe. That there is something else that explains why we are not just random atoms who happen to be randomly organized into beings of spectacular order and complexity. With this new perspective of complexity science, we can scientifically know why the whole can be greater than the sum total of it's parts. "
30,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7519506-mani,5,"Worth the read!Strogatz brings wave theory, chaos, complexity and sync together beautifully with an occasional hint at a search for consciousness. A lot of deep physics concepts are well contextualized for deeper individual exploration in this book. He avoids overdoing it with the math. I'll be headed back to ""Our MAthematical Universe"" after this read."
31,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5118691-eva,3,"Couldn't bring myself to finish, although there were some good quips and anecdotes. Simulation is no substitute for math—it could never provide a proof—but if Peskin’s conjecture was false, this approach would save me a lot of time by revealing a counterexample. This sort of evidence is extremely valuable in math. When you’re trying to prove something, it helps to know it’s true. - location 314 The latest theory is that synchrony reflects competition, not cooperation: Every firefly is trying to be the first to flash (because females seem to prefer that), but if everyone follows that strategy, sync automatically ensues. - location 554 Groups of male fiddler crabs, each of which sports a single, comically huge claw, take best advantage of their natural endowments: They flirt with a female by surrounding her and waving their gigantic claws in unison. (The ritual looks like many maestros conducting a single musician.) - location 557 mathematicians love to tell stories about Wiener. Short and spherical, with thick glasses and a penchant for smoking cigars, he could often be found riding his unicycle through the corridors of MIT. Even in a profession whose members are not known for their athleticism or common sense, Wiener stood out. After failing to return dozens of consecutive serves from his tennis partner, Wiener suggested that they switch rackets. He was so absentminded that when he and his family moved from Cambridge to Newton, his wife wrote out their new address and directions home from his office, knowing full well he would forget they had moved. Sure enough, Wiener used the note as scrap paper for some calculations, threw it away, and walked back to his old house. When he arrived, he realized he no longer lived there, so he stopped a little girl on the street and asked her if she knew where the Wieners had moved. She said, “Yes, Daddy, come with me.” - location 627 Winfree discovered an unexpected link between biology and physics. He realized that mutual synchronization is analogous to a phase transition, like the freezing of water into ice. Think for a moment about how astonishing the phenomenon of freezing really is. When the temperature is just 1 degree above the freezing point, water molecules roam freely, colliding and tumbling over one another. At that temperature, water is a liquid. But now cool it ever so slightly below the freezing point and suddenly, as if by magic, a new form of matter is born. - location 824 Similarly, sync occurs abruptly, not gradually, as the width of the frequency distribution is lowered through the critical value. - location 828 He refused to fall victim to what T. H. Huxley called “the great tragedy of science—the slaying of a beautiful theory by an ugly fact.” - location 1068 This weird phenomenon is called spontaneous internal desynchronization. Its implication is that two circadian rhythms (sleep and body temperature) can run at different periods in the same organism. - location 1188 They could chat with the technicians and often befriended them. Of course, the staff had to be careful not to disclose anything about the time of day. For example, the male doctors and technicians always shaved before entering the apartment so that their five o’clock shadows would not be a tip-off. All staff members greeted the subject by saying hello, not good morning or good evening, and a computer assigned them to work at random hours, so the subject couldn’t tell what time it was by who was on duty. (Given their crazy schedules, it might have been equally interesting to study the staff’s circadian rhythms.) - location 1219 Of the first 12 subjects that Czeisler and Weitzman studied, 6 of them internally desynchronized. For whatever reason, these subjects repeatedly stayed awake and asleep for extraordinarily long times, just as Siffre had done in Midnight Cave. A few maintained that odd schedule indefinitely, resulting in sleep-wake cycles that were 40 hours long, on average. Others regularly alternated between long cycles and more conventional ones, while still others would systematically lengthen their cycles as the experiment progressed, until they were sleeping only once every two days, without realizing it. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason to any of this. - location 1235 Whenever the subjects happened to go to bed near the peak of their temperature cycle, the subsequent sleep episode was always very long, averaging 15 hours. Conversely, when they fell asleep near the time of minimum temperature, they slept much less, about 8 hours on average. - location 1277 The ramp implies something counterintuitive. When subjects go to sleep later in their body temperature cycles, they actually sleep less, even though they have been awake longer. The same peculiar pattern has been observed in the irregular sleep of train drivers and other night-shift workers, and you may have noticed it in your own sleep after a late-night party. When you finally get to bed, hoping for a long recovery sleep, you’re exasperated to find yourself waking up after only 5 or 6 hours of tossing and turning. The problem is that the body’s internal alarm clock is ringing. - location 1283 these time-isolation data predict that during 24-hour entrainment, minimum alertness should occur around the time of the temperature trough, namely, 4 to 6 A.M. That’s a notorious time of day. The accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear-power plant occurred then, with a crew that had been on night duty for just a few days. Chernobyl, Bhopal, Exxon Valdez: All those disasters occurred in the middle of the night, and were tied to human error. Field studies show that from 3 to 5 A.M., workers are slowest to answer a telephone, slowest to respond to a warning signal, and most apt to read a meter wrong. It’s a bad time to be awake, especially if you are required to do something monotonous and important. Shift workers call it the zombie zone. - location 1307 In the 1970s, other researchers pinpointed the clock even more precisely. Guided by the fact that cycles of light and dark could entrain circadian rhythms, they injected the eyes of rats with radioactively labeled amino acids, hoping to trace the neural pathways from the retina back to the putative clock. - location 1368 A second peak occurred about 9–10 hours after minimum temperature, corresponding to siesta time, 2–3 P.M. in the outside world. The intriguing suggestion is that we become sleepy in the mid-afternoon, not because we have eaten a big lunch, or because it is hot outside, but because our circadian pacemaker demands it. - location 1449 even people without sleep disorders may sometimes find themselves trying to fall asleep when it’s most difficult. If you’ve ever gone to bed a few hours early, perhaps because you need to wake up early to catch a plane, you may have noticed how hard it is to fall asleep. The problem is not only that you’re excited about the upcoming trip; you’re also trying to sleep at the worst time in your circadian cycle. The same thing explains why Sunday night is the worst for insomnia. By staying up late and sleeping in on the weekend, you may have inadvertently allowed your circadian pacemaker and its evening forbidden zone to drift later and possibly intrude on your regular weekday bedtime. - location 1512 A candidate for the worst schedule ever is that used by the U.S. Navy on nuclear submarines. The sailors are assigned to 6 hours of duty followed by 12 hours of rest—in other words, they are required to live on an 18-hour day. The pacemaker cannot possibly entrain to such a short cycle, and the sailors live in a perpetual state of desynchronization. The navy’s rationale is that an 8-hour shift is too long to maintain vigilance, and there is only room on the sub for 3 shifts of men, hence the 18-hour (3 times 6) schedule. The medical consequences of life on an 18-hour day are unknown, but some indication of the problem is the tremendously high turnover of enlisted men in U.S. submarine crews (about 33 percent to 50 percent per voyage), with only a small number returning for more than two or three of the 90-day missions. Meanwhile, the officers typically live on a 24-hour schedule and tolerate submarine duty much longer, often spending years on active duty. - location 1525 80 percent of blind people have chronic sleep disorders. - location 1541 But among that special subpopulation of blind people who somehow manage to sync to the 24-hour day, the light turned off the melatonin secretion, just as it does in normally sighted people. The implication is that there are two pathways from the eyes to the brain: one for conscious vision and the other for circadian entrainment. - location 1555 one of the first applications of lasers was for surgery of the retina in the eye to prevent blindness from retinal detachment. Neither Charlie nor I had ever heard of surgery for detached retinas to try to prevent blindness, and if we had, we probably wouldn’t have been fooling around with stimulated emission from atoms. - location 1685 the power plants at Niagara Falls and other hydroelectric stations favored 25 cycles per second, because the turbines in the generators could be designed to run more efficiently at those speeds. That frequency had a curious drawback, not on engineering grounds, but on psychological ones: It caused incandescent bulbs to flicker at a rate that most people found noticeable and disturbing. (Today, the standard frequency for alternating current in North America is 60 cycles per second, while 50 cycles per second is common throughout the rest of the world.) - location 1781 When the verdict in the O.J. Simpson trial was read, the entire power grid sped up from a sudden drop in consumption, presumably because millions of people turned off their television sets simultaneously as soon as they heard the verdict. - location 1812"

Unfortunately, throughout his book of describing experiments, scientific collaborations and breakthroughs, he failed to explain the significance or application of all these discoveries. There are no big innovations in this book, the endings of chapters come with publication of articles or science awards. Not exactly Earth-shattering outcomes. For laypersons it is a series of esoteric laboratory curiosities that don't seem to have relevance to the real world. I am sure they do but he never articulates what they are.Some of the chapters were interesting but I never sensed a connection between them. It is sync or synchronized events, of course, which is an interesting topic by itself, but you can't go on and on for hundreds of pages about experiments where sync is found in physics, electronics, biology, chemistry, etc., and not spend a little time explaining why it matters. What is the connection between chemical soups, electrical fields, and fireflies all seeming to behave as if synchronized or orchestrated by some composer?After over 200 pages plus, Strogatz just never gets there. It is one anecdote after another with no clear connection.Strogatz can write. That's for sure. This book is accessible to laypersons. He is a natural storyteller and humanizes scientists and their relationships reasonably well. The problem is laypersons don't read science books for this. Scientists often write about this ""insider baseball"" stuff, which is nice background and helps humanize these often obscure geniuses, but in the end that is not why anyone buys the book.Gets 3 stars for being accessible, containing some interesting chapters, and generally a well-developed and annotated work. Since I lost interest before finishing and never grasped the unifying thesis of the book, it doesn't get a recommendation from me. This book reads like it is more for scientists who like to read about other scientists. For someone outside the disciplines, this book gets disappointingly dull around the halfway point."
33,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18840302-adelyne,5,"What a ride. Strogatz takes chaos / complexity theory, in itself an incredibly complicated and wide-reaching topic, and condenses it into this volume which isn’t actually that long considering the scope. The description of synchrony in nature is beautifully crafted, the book itself is divided into three main parts (living, discovering and exploring synch respectively), and each has examples to illustrate the point. I found the middle section a bit technical, and got lost in some of the physics, but the first and the last I thought was well-written and easy to follow even for a non-specialist. From reading other reviews on the page, it seems like I’m not alone in struggling to visualise the shapes of the curves and such that Strogatz describes in words (I have no doubt he can, and perhaps physics/maths students who are more familiar with the different shapes of curves might), and agree that a couple of schematics might have been helpful. There is a lot of unknown in the field, and Strogatz makes absolutely no effort to hide that, in fact you can almost hear how proud he is of the questions that the field has yet to find answers for. The narrative is very natural, I really loved the description of how he first fell in love with the subject and his early interactions with Art Winfree. This was mirrored in his relationships with his students and other colleagues, and especially for a book so dense with material it was quite refreshing to have a break from the pure science and read about the human interactions going on as well. 4.5 stars (down half for the chapters that lost me), but 5 on Goodreads as I would really recommend this to anyone and am considering a re-read after I’ve had a chance to read some of the other books he refers to in the last chapter."
34,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71595-robert,3,"This book felt a bit disjointed and difficult to read for me.Perhaps because It covers such a wide range of topics, with only a very general connection between them.I also felt like the writing didn't flow. It felt like something written by an academic, without the strong narrative arcs and more well developed characters that you might see in the science books written by journalists.But on the positive side, quite a lot of interesting ideas are mentioned.I found the idea of ""sync"" itself to be interesting, it's not something I had ever seen mentioned before as a major research problem, but once he pointed it out it was obvious.The most interest parts for me were the beginning when he describes how they came up with a mathematical model for how fireflies synchronize (chapters 1 and 2) and the discussion of Bose-Einstein condensates (chapters 5 and 6) as I didn't really know too much about them. (I certainly didn't completely understand it, but I was intrigued nonetheless!)On a more general level, the question of ""So how do complicated systems synchronize"" still seems wide open. So that's why I'm glad I read this, as I had never realized how important and mysterious this phenomena is."
35,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9862564-erika-rs,4,"This book provides an introduction to synchronization in as detailed a way as can be expected without actually delving into the mathematics. Sync is order that arises without centralized intelligence. Yet in a universe driven by entropy how can order arise from chaos? The answer is that in non-linear systems, systems where the change in the output is not proportional to the change in the input, self organizing behavior can emerge. This book delves into what that means. The first two chapters were my highlights. They delve into how synchronization can be predicted and modeled using systems of coupled oscillators. Chapters five, seven, and nine are also fascinating insights into the mathematics of sync. The rest of the chapters, as well as those chapters, cover sync over a broad array of domains from sleep to lasers to the electric grid to human thought and physiology. The grab bag was interesting but it was the underlying mathematics which really fascinated me. Thus my follow-up purchase of Strogatz's textbook Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos: With Applications to Physics, Biology, Chemistry, and Engineering. :-) "
36,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40472466-dan,4,"Synchronization is a concept that can be applied to many phenomena, for example, circadian rhythm and brain waves, blinking fireflies, heartbeat, clapping, and possibly our consciousness. What is more interesting to me is that the mathematical construct and the scientific framework (whether this is called complex theory or not) generalizes and explains many things that do not seem similar to each other. At some point, something looks very monotonous, dull and less interesting. The other extreme is chaos. Maybe you could have both, like a gooey mess. Sync is something suddenly you observe, like random water molecules sync and line up to form a solid, crystal feature. A sum of individuals exceeds the total. It is nonlinear and suddenly something very different emerges. Power law better reflects the distribution than the normal.I am now trying to make an inference from this book that a random interest in multiple topics could lead to a grandiose theory. It could be the other way around, deducing multiple phenomena from a theory. Well, whatever it is, I find a big joy in trying to connect the dots. This book is my joy."
37,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56212685-lakmus,5,"This book will make being stuck in traffic jams exciting. Because suddenly, you are not bored to death in a smelly car, you are participating in an act of sync. It's basically like being one with nature and hugging trees.On a more serious note, this is one of the most exciting popsci books I've read. In fact so exciting, I am actually kind of keen to go study up on math a bit more, because for the first time ever it looks (a) relevant to important and cool things (like fireflies and brains, of course, my favourite brains!), (b) not hellishly daunting.The book is not about math per se, but the author shares many anecdotes from the lives of physicists and mathematicians who worked on problems related to chaos and sync and for the first time ever it seems to me the same kind of process as all other science (afaik) is done: it's messy and creative and you don't really know what you are doing, but you just gotta (for some reason) repeatedly plunge yourself into the same problem day after day trying to figure it out. ""Sync"" perhaps could be recommended to high-schoolers starting to think math was invented specifically to torture children to death by tedium."
38,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71712279-taylor,5,"This book compliments well with James Gleick's Chaos. Instead of discussing chaotic systems however (although this book has a chapter dedicated to it), Sync discusses the nature of synchronicity in physics, chemistry, biology, and it offers speculation into its effects on human behavior and even on the mind and consciousness.Some parts can be a bit tedious, but that's to be expected with descriptions of experiments and their exact setups (though sometimes tedious, I appreciate it when an author includes such descriptions rather than sugarcoating and 'dumbing down' the details). That said, the effort the author put into explaining the more complicated ideas with analogies is also appreciated, and I found them insightful and new and a curiosity turn on.I love to learn about things I'm ignorant of, and even though theoretical physics is of utmost interest to me, I found many new, interesting bits and pieces scattered throughout this book that tantalized this itch for knowledge."
39,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12098169-thomas,5,"I have a fondness for complex scientific subjects written about in a way that could attract a popular audience. Sync is such a book. I put it with Godel, Escher, and Bach; Chaos Theory; The Immense Journey. What Sync does so well is reverse the reductionist nature of modern science that has been its essence for 400+ years. Sync is a well-written description of a field of mathematics that is pushing its way into things that as yet have no formal definition or formalized set of underlying hypotheses - such as consciousness, crowd behaviour, biological phenomena, and un-solvable and non-linear systems. Sync is not an easy read. It took me quite a while becuase I had to stop so often to think about a paragraph. But that is essential to its underlying value - the subject matter itself is looking at things for which we have no solution and only a rudimentary start towards being able to describe. If you like real science presented understandably this is a book for you."
40,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2980685-daisy-cheng-milano,5,"This is a great book to continue after reading Gleick's Chaos - definitely read it in that order as Strogatz respectfully referenced Gleick in this. It's amazing how Strogatz can organize such a complex and ""non-linear"" topic with such a coherent flow covering almost every field of study under the sun. While Gleick's Chaos illustrated the historical struggle trying to get interdisciplinary fields to communicate with one another without snobbery, Strogatz presented just how much we can know when all the fields work together. Biology syncing with Psychology with Math with Physics, etc. and of course with computer science continually being the convergent node connecting all the other fields together by doing their computational work. This book will make you really appreciate DeGrasse Tyson's quote ""We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically” on another level - with a hint of synchronicity amidst seeming chaos."
41,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10726611-chunyang-ding,5,"A wonderful insight into the science of networks, order, and applied mathematics. Steven Strogatz is truly one of the preeminent mathematical writers of our time, clearly pouring time and effort into making difficult concepts as understandable as possible. There were moments in the book that seemed to suffer from too much analogy - the use of watermelons falling off of pedestals as a reasonable way to explain lasers didn't work for me - but when Strogatz is writing in his own specialty of mathematical modeling, biochemistry, and of networks, there is an incredible elegance in the way that things seem to come together. The road to the scientific results was not simple and straight, but in navigating all the curves and pitfalls, Strogatz reveals a hidden beauty to all that he investigates. "
42,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34586427-franck-chauvel,3,"S. Strogatz comes back to the many opportunities where synchronization popped up in research, from independent oscillators to biology, chemistry to computer science. As for scientific content, I enjoyed the effort to explain complicated issues using metaphors instead of equations—my Greek is kind of rusty. I also liked the story telling about research: Who were the people engaged in the research, how they met, and the fundamental spark of luck necessary for scientific breakthroughs. An interesting biography from both the scientific and human perspective."
43,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15642970-alex-delogu,4,"An excellent addition to popular science literature. I would put it up there with Gleick's book on Chaos. Strogatz's enthusiasm for the subject of sync really shines through on this and the friendships and work relationships forged enrich the book further. The book is littered with easy to understand examples of the, no doubt, complex maths it tries to describe. Sync explores phenomena as varied as traffic, lasers, fireflies, sleep cycles, and six degrees of Kevin Bacon. It is an exploration into matter, both living and inert, and its capacity to synchronise."
44,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62282083-denis-romanovsky,5,"A great journey into the world of complexity science through system thinking, chaos, non-linearity and network theory. Some great speculation on the origins of order in the universe. A really astonishing story of sync effect discovery and further development in the modern science. How far we are still from understanding of the universe... How much great things around to learn. A really great book even today in the year of 2019."
45,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12206258-adam-l,4,"Interesting readIt took me a while to read this all the way through, mostly because I don't have a very advanced education in mathematics. However, much of this is very interesting with regards to subjects like studying cardiac arrhythmia and the growth of the Internet. Sync is bound to captivate any math lover is some small way."
46,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79966005-rajesh-hegde,5,"The book was fascinating for me as i got some basic understanding on the chaos theory and how living systems synchronize. Very good explanation of scientific concepts in layman terms and simple analogies. Makes you more curious as you read the book, which speaks for itself. If you have a science/engineering background, it becomes easier to grasp the concepts. "
47,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39225478-jiliac,4,"Great book. Learned a lot. Deeply recommended for people with no technical background: I think this is the best book I have read that succeed in explaining technical stuff without any math. Which is very impressive considering the subject.No 5th star b/c I didn't any ""wow moment"" with a big insight. The book is more like a collection of interesting findings."
48,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4037814-mohammed-alkindy,4,"one of books i enjoy it allot, a nice twist to what being perceived as dry math or physics. the sad 😔 part is when the author at the end of the book decided not have the right punch line as i could see it coming since the beginning of the book and instead preferred to have an open question kind of ending. Quran chapter 41 verse 53 says it all."
49,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2582309-harry,4,"Like his Infinite Powers book, Strogatz makes complex mathematical and scientific pursuits understandable to those of us without the background. Tons of examples which hit home and clearly illustrate the point.Turns out Sync is really pervasive and critical throughout our physical and mental world. This book will aid in understanding its pervasiveness and its basis. "
50,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52898636-luciano-elementi,5,"The book is enjoyable and with examples that makes the subject compelling. It is just the right depth for a general audience with subject interest. The occasional diagram and formula must be imagined or searched through more specific literature. Notes with reference are present at the end of the book. Very interesting, thank you"
51,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88259758-vaidehi-rajguru,4,An introduction to mathematical biology and the concept of synchronisation in inanimate systems as well. I'll admit that this wasn't a light read. But finally managed to finish it! Love the way in which very complicated concepts in both biology and physics have been somewhat simplified and joined with a single connection - their ability to synchronise!
52,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60287501-daniil-lanovyi,4,"Big thank you to Steven H. Strogatz for trying to explain something as difficult to amateurs like me. I won't pretend I understood the entire book, but I guess the main points the author made did resonate with me. Most importantly, this book motivated me to seek more information on the subject. "
53,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32341209-ra-l-coterillo,5,"Although not in-depth by any means, this book really gives a nice overview over several fields of science through various entertaining examples of syncing phenomena, which the author clearly explains always aiming for a non-scientific reader. Would recommend."
54,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47827056-treyton,4,"Very informative about how sync permeates many aspects of our lives. Eye-opening. Not too math heavy, appropriate for a general audience, but those who have a strong foundation in mathematics will see some added benefit."
55,0786868449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42473039-eric,4,"Although a bit dated, still a very engaging and enjoyable account of the math and its applications to physical and biological systems. I would have preferred a few equations along the way, but I still liked it a lot."
