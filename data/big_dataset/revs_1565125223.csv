0,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/710201-skylar-burris,3,"This is typical sentence from Last Child in the Woods: ""he offered no academic studies to support his theory; nonetheless his statement rang true."" That about sums up this book: it's not empirical, but, nonetheless, it rings true'""more or less. Louv draws his conclusions far too widely and gives too much credit to what nature will do for kids, but the general idea rings true. Kids should play in nature '"" not because (as Louv questionably implies) it will cure ADHD, make them better athletes, increase their math and language test scores, prevent depression, or guarantee great creativity '"" but because it's fun, it's freeing, it's healthy, and they're kids, and that's what kids have done for centuries.The author takes an unfocused and largely anecdotal approach to supporting his argument that playing in nature makes kids better off in a myriad ways. He dubs the results of modern lack of contact with nature ""nature deficit disorder."" He cites some studies but often ignores the maxim that ""correlation does not necessarily imply causation."" A typical support goes something like this: look at all these creative people. They used to play in nature as kids. Playing in nature must make people creative. It's rather like picking the most creative people of the current youngest generation and saying '"" look at all these creative people. They used to surf the internet as kids! Surfing the internet must have made them creative!It makes sense, however, that nature would have a calming effect on kids; that balancing on fallen trees as you cross the creek would build coordination, that spending time imbibing the wonders of the great Creator would inspire human creativity. And I join in a feeling of sadness for a world that is largely gone; I want my children to have the childhood I had, spending hours after school exploring the creek with friends, building forts from scratch in the woods, catching waterbus and tadpoles and butterflies, digging pits in the earth, and engaging in neighborhood-wide, week-long war strategy games from patch of woods to patch of woods. I don't necessarily agree with all of his solutions, and I don't think he realizes how large a share of the problem is owing to private familial choice and not external circumstances, but I dearly want my kids to play in nature.Louv has ideas for improving the problem, but, as is true of most people making public policy proposals, he doesn't really consider the cost or practicality of implementing them. And ultimately it isn't schools or poor city planners that keep kids from nature, it's family culture. And he does mention this: the overscheduling, the fear of allowing children to wander off on their own to explore, and the permissive use of electronic entertainment. But roaming freely in packs from school until dinner time is the way children have always explored nature, so until you change that private family culture of fear, structure, scheduling, and plugging-in, no amount of city planning or tinkering with the public school curriculum is going to address the problem of ""nature deficit disorder."" This is why I think this is much more a private family issue than a public policy issue, and while I think this book is a good kick in the pants to parents (including me), it's not necessarily a good springboard for policy making, being based almost entirely on emotion rather than reason and lacking sufficient empirical verification of the claimed benefits of free play in nature or evidence that the particular policies he supports really would sufficiently increase free play in nature.The truth is '"" nature is still there. Development has made the areas smaller, but they're there. The very same creek I explored as a child is right where I left it. The question is '"" are we individual parents going to allow our kids to explore it on their own and encourage them to? Or are we going to say, I want you home after school, in your room, studying until basketball/football/piano/band practice? Even the author of this book doesn't let his kids explore the canyon behind his own backyard without taking their cell phones, and he has taught them to be appalled by hunting.Some questions I wished he'd addressed better (or at all):(1) How much of our perception of the problem might be connected to mere romantic nostalgic longing for our own pasts? I was not born into a world of personal computers (though I got my first in 4th grade) or of the Internet (which I didn't use until college); the world has changed irrevocably, and there is more difference between the childhood lifestyle of my children's generation and my own generation than there was between the childhood of me and my parents, or even me and my grandparents. The talents the future world will demand will be different; we have to acknowledge this and prepare our kids for it.(2) How much of it is that nature has a calming effect on children, and how much is it that in open spaces, adults are more tolerant of children acting like children? (3) I want my kids to explore nature on their own, but I did this with friends as a kid because this is what kids did. Now, how will my children make and maintain friends spending most of their time doing things most other kids simply aren't doing?"
1,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/619120-nicole-johns,3,"I would give this a 3.5 rating if I was allowed. After that caveat, I have to say that overall this book left me feeling sad, a little hopeless, nostalgic, grateful, and angry. I had a childhood spent outside; in the fields and woods behind our house and on camping and fishing trips with my Dad. I know how formative these experiences were to my personality, spirituality, politics, and attitude about so many things. I have always pictured my child/ren having a similarly intimate relationship with the natural world. But after reading this book I realize that for the most part that ideal world where children run free in fields, vacant lots and woods all over America is no more. We have killed it with fear, legislation, litigation, and sprawl. We have removed the natural world from our classrooms to make room for science and environmental education that alienates our young people from their own habitat, both local and global. We have taken the children out of the world and have only caused them harm because of it. You have to read the book to really get the myriad ways we have disadvantaged our children spiritually, psychologically, intellectually, and physically by bringing them inside, in front of screens. Louv goes into great detail about all the ways this has happened, in schools, neighborhoods, parks, backyards, etc. I skimmed some parts because I couldn't really make myself care. But he also gives concrete and reasonable examples of people and programs helping children know and love nature. Personal stories about childhoods spent in nature also weave the different topics and sections together. The mix of personal stories and journalism give the book a heart, where it might just have been dull and overwhelming.A book to be read by everyone who cares about children and the future of our world. So, that should be everyone."
2,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/541330-keith,2,"With its heart in the right place, this book needs an editor--it reads like a rambling, book-length review article. I don't dispute the message and there were nuggets of interest (how do we allow for rambunctious play that doesn't hurt habitat?). However, if I were against this or didn't believe the premise, I don't think Louv would have changed my mind. He doesn't makes a strong argument (the evidence is circumstantial and sentimental)--just a long one. You don't need to read this book to know we all need to be outside more and engaged--observing, resting or playing."
3,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/926114-nell,4,"The idea that struck me the most is that it is not just good for children to be outside in the grass, in the trees, in the creeks, wandering and unstructured--it is vital, as necessary every day as is food, water, and sleep. The accounts of how disconnected today's society has become from nature were dispiriting, although there were also many examples of communities and schools striving to reconnect children to the natural world. I also enjoyed the arguments against several things that drive me nuts: over-scheduled children, housing association rules/city codes that discourage free use of public green areas, schools that are cutting back on recess, and kids that are kept inside because of parents' fear (of predators or the idea that nature is dangerous or whatever). And, of course, there's the whole subject of ADD, which I won't even get started on. Several of the studies the author referred to showed a marked improvement in concentration, centered-ness, etc. amongst people that had been outdoors or even just exposed to views of trees and growing things. Fascinating stuff..."
4,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/214468-audrey,4,"This book has been criticized because it doesn't really offer empirical evidence, but I think for those of us who spent time wandering the woods (we had 40 acres that I knew like the back of my hand) as kids, we know what a gift that outdoor time can be for kids. That's why this book is a must-read for parents and educators, I think -- to remind us of what's out there and possible and what we've forgotten. It may be that ""nature"" therapy can work as a form of behavior therapy for ADHD kids -- and that's fine. But the point that's most important here is that there's a huge world out there that our kids should be experiencing first-hand whenever possible, rather than through a computer screen."
5,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1738783-betsy,1,"Rarely do I quit a book - but I did so with this one. I get what Louv is saying - it would be fair to say he is preaching to the choir. I appreciate the real and rugged outdoors as well as unstructured outdoor play for children. I guess I'd rather read something that challenges my perspective. Unfortunately, that was not what forced me to put this book down. If the babyboomers (that is the author's generation)spent so much wonderful time running around in the undeveloped landscape, how did they grow up to be the business people that took these lands away from their own children for the sake of profit? How is it that they have lead our country to be the world's most wasteful and polluting nation in the world? What did running around like Huck Finn do for them? Yes, kids need to be outside, using their imagination and engaging with nature. But they also need to be raised to be mindful and conscientious citizens. Letting them run around outside will not work wonders on it's own, as Louv and his generation have so tragically proven."
6,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3449814-tim,5,"What a significant piece of literature. At first glance, and even through the first chapter, one could confuse Louv for an overaggressive hippie whose soul purpose is to let mankind wander barefoot while living solely off fruits and berries. Instead, however, Louv has masterfully woven together monster topics such as parenthood, education, diet, relationships, and even religion--all in one book. This book should be read by all human beings, and I do not mean that in a hyperbolic way. At the very least, it's a must-read for parents and teachers. Louv's research is exhaustive in every single area, and no aspect of our society goes untouched. With so much information packed into one book, though, it makes me wonder if the book would be better served as 3-4 different shorter works.I rarely make time for books that are not fiction, but Last Child in the Woods is making me reconsider this approach. This has made me think differently about how I raise my children, teach my students, feed myself and my family, and my relationship with God. "
7,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54440237-patrick-henry,4,"""Yes, how true!"" I found myself agreeing with the author' illustrations time and again. For my part, I would never challenge his premise is that kids belong outside. But if someone was skeptical, they would not find Mr. Louv providing the evidence to be convincing. But who cares? He is right! How our culture of coddling has drained childhood of the thrills and risk of exploring and discovery. I realize even now all the adventure I found in the ravine behind our rental house, and am richer for it. Wish that for every generation."
8,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/270875-becca,2,"This was another book that is based on a great idea that I believe in, but didn't hold my interest. I felt like the author kept leading me along, implying that there was something interesting or substantial coming ahead but it never arrived (at least, not in the first half of the book). The book talks about how children don't have unstructured outdoor playtime anymore and what impact that may have on them. The author explores many different aspects of this, but everything in the book was anecdotal and I often felt that the quotes and stories were a bit of a stretch to make them apply to his cause. He states over and over again that there just isn't any scientific data out there on what impact playing in nature has on us. Then he proceeds to try and imply what impact it has through literary quotes and anecdotes. I really found myself yearning for him to tell us what scientific data there is...there must be at least some...instead of quoting yet another literary work that mentions nature. I was disappointed.I didn't finish the book. I made it about 7 chapters in and then started skimming ahead to the more interesting sounding headings. Then I had to return it to the library."
9,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/750375-debbie,5,"Charlotte Mason got it right. Children need the outdoors.It turns out the outdoors also need children. Richard Louv points out the incongruity behind the environmental extremists who want to set aside nature without allowing mankind to interfere, and the fact that our children aren't experiencing nature first-hand, since they aren't getting the chance to play, live and explore the outdoors unencumbered by interfering adults. This, he says, results in children who have no love for nature and thus no need to protect it. One of the many examples he gives is of a young John Muir who spent his childhood shooting his toy gun at seagulls on the beach. How many naturalists would allow such a thing today? Yet, it is precisely this sort of ""destructive"" play (like digging holes, building tree houses and killing bugs) that give children a love of the outdoors and a love for nature.I confess to being guilty of the ""fear of the outdoors"" he sees as one of the problems facing children today. I'm afraid to let my kids wander off, unaccompanied by adults, to explore the woods. But I want them to experience it and have deep and lasting memories of a childhood spent with nature."
10,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"I think every parent and educator should read this book or at least hear the thesis and give it some thought. The point is that children need nature--especially free play where they can roam and discover and create in the wild and that we, as a society have instilled too much fear of nature in our children and also outlawed a lot of free play and the changing landscape and culture have moved children into cities and away from farms. The author also claims that this ""nature-deficit disorder"" is responsible for some behavioral problems in children and certain over-medicated conditions such as ADHD. The thoughts are not earth-shattering. Of course. Children need to be outside. I did not like the way the book was laid out. There was a lot of repetition and some of the conclusions he draws form (often un-related and shoddy) research are unsupported. Also, I think he is a bit condescending in some of his conclusions--preferring certain outdoor activities to other others (bad: hunting, any outdoor activity aided by a machine; good: fishing, building tree houses).On the whole, however, I agree with his thesis and the book and the research he cites are very informative. I think a lot of problems with inner-city youth stem from this separation from nature and of course the childhood obesity epidemic and the boredom of children everywhere can be blamed on this. I am often a little skeptical of books that want to just go back to the good-old days because I think a lot of that time is gone and if we try to raise our kids on farms, it's manufactured (no pun intended) and false. So we have to embrace technology and all the good that comes with it, but I think he allows for a compromise and he lets us live in our cities and gives some great tips on how to get out. Since I read this book, I have been very aware of allowing my children free nature play and I have seen how they really embrace it. "
11,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/910160-s-r,4,"Now, any book that insists kids should be spending more time playing outside than in front of a screen is, in my case, preaching to the choir. I don't need to be convinced. I need data and ideas and backup.Louv makes many interesting observations and provides some references to research that supports his claims, but not much in the way of in depth examinations of those studies. (I am a skeptic even when presented with data that backs up my beliefs.) I would have liked to see more of that, but appreciate that the conversational tone was probably better suited for intended audience- ie, those who are trying to figure out how to get their kids outdoors and connected to the real world around them. He does provide a number of interesting ideas and examples, including ways to involve schools and communities.I found the chapters on HOA restrictions and legal complications of outside play especially informative. Louv addresses the pervasive but illogical ""stranger-danger"" paranoia that keeps many kids from exploring their own backyards, let alone the neighborhood, and suggests that more community involvement is the best way to combat these particular issues."
12,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3668593-marita,3,"Lots of great information, which I appreciatedAfter reading, I am hovering somewhere between joyous inspiration and the sadness of despair. I agree fervently with the premise that we as humans need more immersion in nature, but sometimes the prospect seems daunting and overwhelming.Still, I come away resolved to be more intentional, more purposeful to interact with my environment and to enjoy nature even this week.Also to up my game and get serious about incorporating nature study in our homeschooling. This was an important book and I'm glad I read it."
13,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/414804-carrie-lundell,5,"I feel like this is a book every parent should read. Personally, I ate it up because he explained in words what I have always felt and wanted for my children. He does back up some of his ideas with research, but also with a lot of anecdotal evidence. I did a lot of underlining and I like to keep the book handy to remind me to make sure my kids get dirty during plenty of unstructured outdoor time."
14,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17812040-anna-mussmann,4,"Reading this book made me more grateful than ever to look up and see my children playing in the bushes. We love our yard, but I’ve tended to take outdoor time for granted--after all, I grew up digging holes in the dirt, exploring tidepools, and going camping with my family. It’s both startling and horrifying to be reminded that thousands of American children have no idea what such a life is like, not just because they are cooped up in cities but because they have been indirectly taught to avoid nature as either boring, dangerous, or both. Louv argues that modern society suffers from a “nature-deficit disorder.” He points out the combination of forces that separate today’s children from meaningful interaction with nature, and argues that this is harmful both to children as individuals and to society as a whole. He also offers a range of ways in which the problem could be remedied. Louv’s solutions include the lifestyle of individual families, but the majority of his focus is on ways schools, towns, and society as a whole could help citizens center our lives around the enjoyment of nature.I appreciate many of Louv’s points, especially his discussion of the indirect ways that time in nature shapes human beings and helps us in other endeavors. I had to laugh, though, at his cry that scientists need to spend more time rigorously studying the impact of outdoor play on children, because human beings shouldn’t need scientists to tell us obvious truths before we can consider them true. Seriously, people! On the other hand, he is right that the allocation of money and governmental resources are heavily influenced by data. In some ways, Louv echoes concerns that have been discussed by writers like Anothony Esolen, but this book is much more progressive-friendly and will be palatable and accessible to readers who reject anything that smacks of mere conservative nostalgia for the past. Even though I winced at the suggestion that readers should increase our homeowners’ liability insurance so that they can let children engage in nature play and tree house building, perhaps that’s helpful advice, especially for folks who wouldn’t otherwise dare let kids in trees.Overall, an inspiring thesis and very important message for modern American parents to consider. "
15,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10770371-dan,3,"I did not enjoy this book although the idea of kids spending more time with nature is laudable and incontrovertible. I found the book a little preachy and poorly written. Reading the prose felt like I was reading a series of presentation slides some of which were grammatically incorrect. The author's message that kids have too many electronics and marginal time communing with nature is certainly true for most. However it shouldn't require 300 pages to make this point. The book is formulaic in name dropping an education or environmental expert with only a paragraph of detail or a quote. So the book is basically a serial of quotes and vignettes mixed with platitudes. I disagree with the book jacket's statement that this book rivals Rachel Carson's A Silent Spring. The Last Child in the Woods is not a science book. I did not learn any scientific facts about nature or the environment.The author pines for those good ole days when everyone was more active in the woods. When I was a child the smoking rate of adults was 3x that of today, masking obesity rates. In aggregate adults were not so fit 40 to 50 years ago. Not many adults regularly exercised then (or could hike 5 miles into the woods). So the health situation today is not as dire as portrayed in this book. I will acknowledge that we need more scientists and nature experts.I upgraded my rating of this book from two stars to three because of the following:1. The author has a laudable mission so two stars seems harsh.2. There was a very poignant story about the author's son meeting Mr. Rogers 3. The author provides a useful list of 100 nature activities for children and families that is thought provoking."
16,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1157793-jeffrey,1,"Do not let the title of this book deceive you. Your children do not suffer from ""Nature-Deficit Disorder."" In fact, Richard Louv, author of Last Child in the Woods, admits his unease with the appropriation of medical science jargon, but says that â€œparents and educatorsâ€ understand the term very clearly. Unfortunately, that alone does not justify such disingenuous, hyperbolized nomenclature. It does, however, set the tone nicely for his argument that the senses of young Americans are being unnaturally dulled by a lack of exposure to the wilds.Frankly, the arguments put forth to make such a case were very weak and disorganized. Louv is a columnist for the San Diego Union-Tribune and this book had all the factual basis that one would expect in a standard sized op-ed piece. The book is full of pull out quotes from seven year olds and grandmother naturalists alike and light on cultural analysis. And where he does pull together more credible academic research, he consistently fails to provide any sort of critical analysis beyond the same headline producing conclusions that we could expect to read about in a daily newspaper. While he frequently caveats his citations with notes that the research is not definitive or ongoing, he rarely talks about the shortcomings of the works he is relying upon.He utterly neglects the possibility that his views as a cultural commentator are just that, the product of a very specific American, middle-class culture. He frequently discusses the restorative power that nature experiences have on inner-city youth, never realizing the patronizing tone of such value projection. Meanwhile he bemoans the loss of the privileged places that natural historians and scout masters once occupied in the hierarchy of the American psyche. His ongoing nostalgia with the tree-houses of his own childhood came across as very generationally specific and I briefly wondered how many grandparents purchased this book impulsively for their own grown children.And finally, at its heart, this book was profoundly anti-urban. Louv's recipe for an ideal childhood is wholly exurban; the bigger the lot, the better. He claims the environmental high ground without acknowledging the positive effects of density.The real problem for kids today is not a nature-deficit, but a generation of adults that buys into the simplistic argument that doing things differently than they were done 'back when' is inherently inferior. (C)Jeffrey L. Otto, October 23, 2007"
17,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1506662-cynthia,5,"This one is a must read for anyone with children of their own, children in their life, teachers... Actually this is for all humans who grew up with or without nature... It shows the shift in how children were relating to the outdoors 40 years ago and how they are today. It explores the effects that technology and too much time inside is having on young lives and on the life of the planet.... It is hart warming and funny, it will bring you to tears and make you get outside yourself and take some children along for the adventure... I highly recommend this book.It is Saturday evening September 27th and I am just back from Richard Luv's lecture at CCRI..I was just wonderful. This is one of the most profound books and topics that should be on all of our minds. We all see the effects of nature neglect in global warming (among other things).... As Richard Louv said tonight with much hope ""everything must change, Architecture, urban planning, education...."" We can all make small steps by getting outside ourselves and sharing that with the children in out lives.Our children are the future stewards of the land.... we have to give them the experiences in nature that will allow them to grow, and care for it and themselves in the kindest of ways."
18,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56415485-sarah-howard,3,"While the information was very insightful and made me want to be engaged more in nature and not be just a spectator, the chapters at times felt disjointed and some information almost out of place with the rest of the information. Overall I learned a lot about getting back into nature and it’s overall healthy effects on our bodies both physically, mentally and emotionally. "
19,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73582-tony-cohen,3,"A book I strongly recommend, although I wish the information/research/extrapolation was farther long the developmental cycle. In a nutshell, the author coins the term 'nature deficit disorder' was some sort of easy-to-use term to somewhat anchor his still developing notions that children need unfettered time in un-organised nature. They need to be able to play in the margins, where the truly interesting stuff is happening (one study among scant few mentioned [for reasons that I will discuss later] was that children in the rubble of WW!! Europe preferred the wild spots to the undamaged concrete) The book is riddled with anecdotes about the changes in youthful patterns of interaction with nature, and the scary declines in that area: how children who once grew up with time alone in nature now spend it near the ubiquitous and ESSENTIAL electrical socket. Of course, there is a cavalcade of potentially damaging implications to our behavioural changes, few if any of which have yet been subjected to strict scientific rigor. There is some further effective commentary on the potential problems with development when we minimize our sensory input solely to the visual medium, which is the ever-increasing and general trend of our societies. There is also further tidbit relating to learning effectiveness and behaviours when there is a more ecological bent, and the scary decline in peoples' knowledge of the natural sciences (again a symbol of early play with nature) in lieu of a more recent molecular dominance. As vignettes go, one particularly memorable one was how, do to our society's fears and litigiousness, we have actually, legally, made it very hard to have unfetterd play with significant potential monetary penalties upon whose land fun can be had, which is a trend that we clearly need to reverse!It is a strong book, but there is not enough hard science to back up all the interesting (and there are many of them) theories, but this book is important because it is putting the ideas out there. Along a paradigm, the early adopters will have to be preaching into an unknown before what they consider common-sense is put to the hard science test. I do feel that many of these ideas, and damning trends the author warns about, will one day be reversed when the science manages to catch up a bit more with what can only be fairly described now as very intelligent conjecture. In general, Americans should be worried, and Singapore should be absolutely shitting themselves; it is hard to even conceive of a place which more marginalizes 'wild' nature in lieu of a nicely manicured lawn. "
20,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/315818-kim,4,"As a reader, a would-be environmentalist, and a mom, I felt like Richard Louv was writing this book for me. Like so many other former kids who remember lazy days of running free through the woods, wading in streams, and catching toads and butterflies, I am saddened by our current video-game culture in which kids have more electronics than they know what to do with and yet are utterly bored (I have a teenage nephew; I've seen it with my own eyes). I hate the fact that parents can no longer let their kids run free because of (a) concerns that pedophiles might lurk behind every tree or (b) concerns that other parents will think they don't care that pedophiles might lurk behind every tree. Because Louv thoughtfully describes our current ""nature deficit disorder"" crisis and provides real ways we might lure our kids back to the woods, I highly recommend this book. I couldn't give this book five stars, however, because of Louv's overly academic approach. The subject matter evokes wonder and delight, and yet the book buckles under the weight of Louv's substantial research and scholarly writing style. Yet, the moments when Louv describes his own nature rambles with his two sons are extremely moving and relatable. A one-page anecdote with TV's Mr. Rogers toward the end of the book is worth all the academic pages that come before it, and the last chapter had me in tears, counting the moments before I could take my son outside. "
21,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1778086-meredith,1,"I can only echo what other reviewers have said. He brings up an important issue, but does a miserable job of it. Louv bases most of his arguments on ""intuition"" and terrible logic. The worst of his arguments is that a)children with autism and ADHD can control their behavior and symptoms better when they're outside.b)there's a lot more autism and ADHD than there used to be.c)we don't play outside as much as we used to.d)not playing outside CAUSES autism and ADHD.?????That's a characteristic argument from the book. Similarly incoherant is his assertion that fishing is acceptable, but hunting isn't. He implies that even bicycles and playgrounds interfere with experiencing nature, and that the only way we can raise healthy, well-rounded children is to send them out into untouched fields. Anything less is a failure.And it's sad, because instead of convincing people that we need to get away from the computer and play outside, he convinced me that he's a fanatic and a really bad writer.I'd rather read Emerson."
22,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31921076-bambi-moore,2,"The best thing about this book is the  title and quote from a child who said he likes to play inside because ""that's where all the electrical outlets are."" As a Christian my motivation for the children in my life to know the wonder of God's creation, is in order to glorify Him more, give Him praise for all that borrows life from Him, and see His great power and might in all of creation. Not bond with an iceberg (yes it really said that somewhere). There were some interesting studies regarding children's creativity and intellectual capabilities being greatly affected by the amount of time they spent outdoors, and some cool comparisons of schools in Finland. I made it to the end but skimmed the last couple chapters, I just didn't really care that much about all the studies and theories."
23,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95737-joy,5,"I picked this book up at Mt. Rainier while I was waiting in line to pay for a National Park passport for Rebecca. One of my biggest struggles living in Indiana has been having the knowledge that outdoor opportunities for Rebecca are much more limited in scope than that which I grew up with. The environmental ethic is much different and ultimately I want more for Rebecca than what she is being exposed to.

It was on a book list that I got to choose from, and from my professor's short description it sounded enthralling. Boy, was I wrong... I can't help but think that I would have gotten much more out of this assignment had I picked a different book. That isn't to say it wasn't a worthwhile read, because I think it was. There is a lot of good information in this book, and Louv does back (some) of what he says up with sources. However, I have a long list of complaints. I know this was originally written in 2005, and that times have changed in 12 years, but I really couldn't let all his subtle racism, sexism, misogyny, and general Baby Boomer self-centeredness go. When your argument is built on ""back in the day..."" and ""well I survived!"" and ""kids these days just don't get it..."" and (my personal favorite) ""
common sense will tell ya...
"" it's a pretty friggin' weak argument. Overall, this book felt like a trip down memory lane for Louv, lamenting how awful humans are to the earth while simultaneously conveying how it's not actually that bad. It was a mindfuck in a lot of ways, perhaps most of all because I agree with the sentiment that we need to be kinder to our earth, our nature, our animals. I agree with Louv's general argument but if I hadn't been required to finish this I don't think I would have. That tells you right there that something is off with his writing. He wasn't very compelling, somehow, even though he had data to back himself up. He had access to great, heartfelt stories but the impact fell flat. Perhaps it was his tone of superiority, I really don't know. I just can't help but feel that this topic could have been handled much better by someone else. I wish more people cared about this subject, though, and that a more well thought out book could have been published. Unfortunately, as the 12 years since its original publication have shown us, the nature-child connection does not seem to have improved much at all. "

33,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,3,"Pre-reviewJust want to jot down my thoughts about this book BEFORE actually reading it. This book is constantly cited in discussions about connecting people to nature (which is kind of my thing) , but I've avoided reading it b/c I've also gotten the impression that it's not based on any kind of reasonable evidence, and by reasonable I mean quantitative, peer-reviewed research, and that's a problem for me. But, as Constance pointed out to me, the fact that it has traction in my circles is reason enough to read it, I guess, if only to knowledgeably refute it or repackage its message when it comes up in discussion....and the reviewI think if you read this as an editorial and not as an attempt to present evidence supporting the thesis, the book is actually quite good, and relevant. If you are a parent and you haven't thought about the value of unstructured play in the outdoors, or you simply live in a largely man-made landscape, I suspect there's a lot to be gained by reading Louv's occasionally eloquent, always impassioned plea that kids need the freedom to explore and experience the non-human world on their own terms, as almost all children have until our current urban era, even if that world is a weedy abandoned lot. His collected anecdotes from kids and parents are beautiful, and resonant for those of us who grew up, as Louv and I did, with easy access to forests and streams and abundant time to explore them.What I wanted, though (what I always want, really), was evidence, which was generally lacking or unconvincing. Sometimes this was Louv's fault, e.g. single-observer descriptions of events (doesn't that break a fundamental rule of journalism?) [1], un-cited facts and figures [2], over-reliance on the work of a handful of academics [3], or worse, reports that did not undergo any form of peer review [4]. That being said, I'm pretty sure the underlying problem is that the concepts here are complicated and hard to reduce into forms of evidence I find persuasive, even when Louv did cite research (which he often did). What is nature, anyway? What is a ""connection"" to nature, and how does one operationalize it in such a way that one can study it? These are the kinds of issues that make social science hard and its findings maddeningly impossible to generalize, so it's difficult to fault a journalist like Louv for not providing evidence that is not only not there, but practically impossible to collect in the first place (not that it stops people from trying, though). Calling this ""scholarly"" or ""well-researched"" as the back cover blurbs do seems a bit extreme, though.So while I can't exactly thump my forefinger against this book and cry out, ""The proof is here, people!"", I think I can recommend it in the way I can recommend Pollan's books, as a thought-provoker and a conversation-starter. For me, the ideas presented aren't novel, so I found the lack of supporting evidence frustrating, but for those who've never considered this stuff, like I hadn't considered the source of my food before reading Omnivore's Dilemma, I think this one's worth reading.[1] Louv has this great anecdote on p. 27 about a neighborhood association in San Diego chasing away kids who were fishing in a pond and making bike trails in the woods b/c it violated housing association rules, but it's all based on one friend's testimony. Isn't this too good to go unverified?[2] E.g. ""Copious studies show a reduced amount of leisure time experienced by American families, more time in front of the TV and computer, and growing obesity among adults and children because of diet and sedentary lifestyles"" (p. 32). Totally without citation. ""new studies suggest that exposure to nature may reduce the symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder"" (p. 34), also without citation.[3] He cites a lot of different researchers, but relies heavily on Chawla and Sobel, both of whom seem like cool nature-loving people in their own right, but neither of whom seem to publish much in the scientific literature.[4] E.g.

34,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/542037-annalisa,4,"I really enjoyed this book. I found myself analyzing the way I interact with nature and the encouragement I give to my daughter to do the same. She's not really a play in the dirt kind of a girl and when she told me she was bored on a sunny afternoon a few weeks ago just after I started this book I told her to go outside and play. I looked out the window a few minutes later to see her lying in the grass reading and had to laugh that she wasn't technically playing outside. At least she was feeling the rays of sunshine and the grass on her back. I think I will forever have these concepts in my head and look for ways to bond more with nature and encourage my daughter to do the same. The basic concept of the book is that as human beings we are creatures of nature and need nature as part of our emotional, intellectual, and spiritual development. The generations before us have spent their childhoods outdoors exploring and learning, but because of factors like less land and more people (and the way land is developed with less natural open space), our litigious society, fear of predators and injury, overscheduling, and modern technology, our children do not have the same quality unstructured outdoor play. While we do not know all the effects this lack of nature will have in our children, it most likely affects their creativity, attention (ADHD), ability to soothe and cope, emotional and behavioral (problems arise from a disconnect with nature), and my favorite: their spiritual connection to the space they live in. There is something about lying on your back in the grass at night and watching the stars above and feeling both insignificantly small and significantly important. It's just good for kids to get their hands in the dirt and play, but nobody really does anymore. I always knew nature was important, but never stopped to think just how important it is to our lives. The majority of the book tells us all the reasons we need nature and the ways our society has gone wrong turning its back on nature, but I wish he had more answers for just how to do that. Building utopian societies that revolve around farming and that are more expensive to build just isn't feasible in this country. People just aren't interested in spending more for a system they don't see as broken. My neighborhood has small parks, but there isn't a lot of open exploring area, nor do I know where around here I could move that would give me that without giving up the sense of community I enjoy. My daughter's school does not have grass area but man-made surface area in the playground. There isn't much, if anything, I can do to get that changed, other than move and I am happy with the education she is receiving. While he does give options like cultivating a garden and giving your children more unstructured play, I wanted more solutions that I could do personally instead of grand gestures society on whole must do. I was left with a little bit of a feeling that America is losing its love for nature and this generation will grow up without any loyalty to it and nobody to protect it, but there isn't much that can be done about it without improbable rewiring of the way Americans think. I found his solutions far too optimistic and unrealistic to surpass the mountains he spent the first half of the book showing us need to be climbed for change. And the problems seem just as much to blame on the natural exponential growth in population than anything else. There may be a lot of undeveloped land in this country, but wide open spaces around everyone's home is not only not feasible but it's not many people's style. I am a city girl and have no interest in returning to a frontier lifestyle that he seems to idolize. While I have a healthy appreciation for nature and often like to ponder it and enjoy the small pleasures of walks or rain, I'm not the type of person who likes to be outdoors getting my hands dirty. I could spend days on end indoors and be perfectly happy. And I don't think there's anything wrong that. While I was a little dissatisfied with the lack of solution, I still think the problems addressed in his book both real and extremely important ones to address. Being aware of this trend toward nature deficiency is the first step to evoking change. In our own small ways in our communities and families everyone can find creative solutions for getting more nature time. I especially could be better about encouraging my daughter to spend time bonding with the earth from whence she came. It's healthy and it's important. And I think it's an issue everyone should be aware of so they too can be conscious of the ways they incorporate and protect nature."

I agree with the author that too many electronics will deprive you. Nature can restore you, refresh you, and bring sanity back to your family and life. It is vitally important in childhood to give a firm foundation of life and peace and this book inspired me to make sure my daughter gets plenty of outdoor playtime."
36,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65233712-danielle,1,"This book could have been condensed to a small blurb or article. The basic point is beat over your head for 300 pages. The author had an unfortunate way of writing too scholarly for leisure readers and not scholarly enough for scholars. There were many things I did not like about how this book was written. As many people have voiced the concept was a good one but the execution had much to be desired. I am saddened that I used this book for a nature center book club because most readers gave up 50 to 100 pages in due to boredom. This is saying a lot since our first months book was over 500 pages. I would not recommend to anyone, especially if they already understand that spending time outside is good for one's health."
37,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/917050-lynne,2,"I'm finding this book pretty tedious so far - he is preaching to the choir with me on this subject but it still feels like preaching. I'm looking forward to the second half, which I hope will spend more time on getting kids outside rather than all the reasons why we should and we don't....update since I wrote that part: it was due back to the library so I gave up on it after getting about 85% through. It never got much better for me, which is a shame because it's an important topic. It did make me a little more conscious about the time my child (and me for that matter) spends outdoors, and armed me with the knowledge that it may help with possible ADD or ""spirited child"" symtoms, not to mention general well being... but I could have read a pamphlet version for that. I recommend this book for anyone who isn't already convinced, or maybe for school administrators looking for tips on ways to deal with test-readiness centered parents and school boards or how to implement more nature based programming. I was waiting for him to get around to talking about 4-H however, which has been doing this for over 100 years and is still very avtive in all 50 states with not only rural but suburban and urban kids too. In full disclosure I work for 4-H, but I was honestly surprised that he left that out, except for a very brief mention of one child and her sheep project- especially while devoting a section (though it was a pretty dismissive one, which wasn't fair either) on scouting. Maybe 4-H was in the last part of the book that I didn't get to. Anyway my very modern, screen-loving urban kid is in both scouts and 4-H and trust me, they get outside. It just seems like a good example of how flawed this book is. One little nugget I took from it though: one parent's change in vocabulary from ""be careful"" to ""pay attention"" when her child is outdoors climbing rocks or something and needs to watch her footing or be aware of surroundings to stay safe - a simple but very significant difference in attitude toward nature that can empower a child and teach them to be smart, not to be afraid. I guess that was worth a little tedium."
38,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4697631-karen,5,"At the end of my 6th grade year, I found out my wonderful and extremely intelligent cousin was accepted into Zoo School! You may feel free to insert a bit of intense jealousy here! As a child with high-average intelligence I always desired to achieve placement into gifted programs but never quite make the cut although I was always confident that my level of motivation and work ethic would allow me to keep up with the pace. My dream school was not Zoo School but Blandford- another school that focused on outdoor education and learning in nature. Seeing as I did not live in the correct district, neither of these schools was ever an option for me but the desire was always there.In the book ""Last Child in the Woods"", Richard Louv discusses the benefits of getting children outdoors. In fact he carries on for 310 pages on why kids, and adults, should spend more time outside. There are chapters on mental health, creativity, science, and many more! Despite going on for 310 pages, I was still intrigued through the whole book. This work inspired me to get outside and, as an adult, I have seen incredible benefits. Things are not going my way these days and in one weekend I lost my childhood cat from cancer and my job. Setting aside time to spend outside daily has made the stress of finding a teaching position for next school year much easier. I'm happier and much more positive regarding the hunt for jobs when I make sure to put my work aside to get outside for at least an hour each day. No matter what I have on my plate, I go outside to ""play"". I really enjoyed reading this book and I think the content applies to the health of both adults and children!"
39,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/593578-christina,3,"I mostly read the middle, since I don't need to be convinced that significant exposure to the natural world is essential for kids, or that there is less of it today than there was a generation or two ago. The back of the book promised to provide ""solutions"" and I wanted to see what those would be.Lots of recommendations for what changes the author would like to see made to the school/education system (pre-k through college), to how we build our cities/towns, and to how our culture views the natural world. These are all bigger projects than I can take on, although I'm generally in favor of most of them and would enthusiastically support folks who wanted to be the energy behind making those changes happen.No, it's the small reminders for me. Let your kids have UNSTRUCTURED time in the natural world, wherever it is (the garden, the back forty, the wilderness). Be more enthusiastic about the natural world and less suspicious. Say ""Pay attention"" more often than ""Be careful."" Let the child lead the expedition some of the time. Teach general observation skills, from sitting still to watch a deer cross a meadow or a bird in the garden, to assessing the surroundings - slippery rocks, thin branches, venomous snakes, dangerous people. All this tends to inspire more desire to be a steward of nature than all the ""Save the Species"" segments in school, and it teaches useful skills that will be important all through life, in and out of traditional wildernesses."
40,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/771552-martha,5,"This is a must-read for everyone. Here's what I wrote in my yoga newsletter about it: The subtitle of this book is ‘Saving Our Children from Nature-Deficit Disorder’. The author explains that he is not proposing such a disorder exists, but admits that calling it such will help the average person to understand the gravity of the situation he writes about. His contention is that like the forgotten and all-to-often-relegated-to-near-zero-status arts such as dance, music and painting, nature has been demoted in importance to the severe detriment of our children’s health. He means emotional, intellectual and spiritual health as well as physical health. As a culture, we have lost our connection to nature, and think of it as an ‘extra’, or just a place to occasionally recreate. He has brought together cutting-edge studies to prove his point.I suggest you read this book to get a different perspective on the issues of vanishing forests, polluted waterways, and increased childhood obesity, violence and excessive anti-depressant drug prescriptions. At the back of his book, the author lists some ways we can bring the experience and appreciation of nature back into our lives. If we do not rebuild our connection to the earth, and develop appropriate respect for the power of nature, we are gambling with our future and that of our children."
41,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88622-brittany,5,"I loved this. I'm so inspired to spend more time with my kids outdoors, in the garden, and in natural places regularly. I'm still not completely convinced I should let my young children wander alone for hours, though there are a few chapters dedicated to overcoming parents' fears. (In fact, while the author deeply laments that children of this generation don't play in the woods all day unsupervised, he likes to keep his kids within view as well.) The author believes that spending time outdoors can be stress-relieving for children, treat ADHD, and most importantly build confidence and character. The book left me with the same sorts of feelings I had reading The Secret Garden as a child, watching Mary and Collin transform as they worked in the garden and watched it bloom before their eyes. I want this for my kids. Last Child in the Woods did get a little preachy at the end about preserving natural spaces and saving the environment, but I didn't mind because it seemed appropriate and followed the flow of the book. Again, I am completely inspired. I would like to own my own copy of this book for reference and reminder."
42,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/164645-steve,3,"On a gut level, I agree with so much of what this book argues. But it just doesn't make its case convincingly. So much is taken for granted rather than supported with research or evidence, not least the author's assumption that his type of childhood (and mine) is ""normal"" and everything else—particularly an urban childhood—is a problematic deviation from that. So it was a struggle to read the whole book through that filter of elitism and, at times, what smacked of baby boomer self-aggrandizement. Which is a shame, because I really do agree with so much of this, and wanted to know there are better reasons for agreeing than merely wanting it to be true."
43,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/431775-abc,4,"I actually give this three and a half stars. Four for being a topic I am interesting and its great title. Three because it never really grabbed me and did not tell me anything I did not really already know.It did make me want to go out more and experience nature with my son, but did not really give many ideas on how to do so. A few ideas, but not many. It did cite many studies and so forth, for example, kids enjoy a natural setting more than the typical blacktop playground. Also, it reminded me of ""Free Range Kids"", even though I have not read that book yet. Don't be scared to just let your kids go out and explore."

It needed a good editor to cut out the bits where the author was lamenting his lost youth or shaking his stick at those terrible young people who simply weren't interested in all of the things that he was interested in back in the day. The last section appeared to be a random stream of consciousness, which was particularly hard to get through. The important message about disconnection with nature was somewhat lost within all this, which was a shame. Don't waste time reading the book, go out and visit a park instead."

47,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6176855-stephanie,4,"Louv writes a fantastic perspective on the necessity of introducing our children to nature and to keep nature as essential part of childhood. It was quite comforting to read this book and know that all the time I have spent with my children in nature was quite worth every second. I plan on continuing and increasing the time that I require them to discover the outdoors. I loved the suggestions and proof that children need more time with nature, even during school hours, which is really what spoke to me.This book does get a bit long winded and could really be stellar without the last 4 chapters. I felt he could have incorporated them within the other chapters. I also completely skipped the chapter that discussed relating God to nature. As a pantheist, nature is my all. The section with book suggestions and also activities to do with your children or to encourage them to do on their own, was very helpful. Even if you don't read the rest of the book, those are worth reviewing.There are some parts that I disagreed with and I felt were quite preachy. Although Louv is writing to all generations, he is being pretty judgmental against the current generation of parents (who weren't parents when he wrote the book, but it miffed me a bit). I grew up in a small city, I didn't have a ton of nature in my life, but enough that it awed me. I wasn't interested in birding or animals really - but it did inspire me to incorporate that into my own children's lives - something that Louv is afraid that won't happen with my generation (because we are the first generation to have so much access to electronics). But he's sort of wrong there - I'm proof that isn't always true. The love my kids have had for nature has opened so many doors for me as an adult. I include them on my finds. For example: We see a huge bird outside, we look it up. We find a nest with eggs, we look up the eggs to find out what bird it is. I never had this sort of discovery as a child, but here I am influencing my children despite not having as much nature exposure as generations before me. Nature matters to me as an adult although it wasn't as important to me as a child. I was also shocked that although Louv talked about several Cooperative Extensions, he never talks about how 4H programs can provide much of the exposure he talks about - especially for city kids. Our county has a wonderful Cooperative that kids from the more populated areas can come to and work with animals and be out in Nature."
48,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45921206-sue,5,"I had to read this book over a long period of time, as it could be somewhat academic at times, but also very overwhelming and frightening at the loss of our natural habitats and our next generations disconnect from the natural world. I see this in my work every day; children who are in daycare sometimes from 7 am to 6 pm, who don't go outdoors for days at a time, with families who are ""afraid of bugs"" and paralyzed by the very thought (understandably and no pun intended) of tick born illnesses or of animal encounters. We are losing out narratives of how to read upcoming weather by the clouds, telling time by the sun, or predicting seasonal changes by the appearance of flora and fauna. The last paragraph of the book literally left me in tears (SPOILER ALERT) ""jason is a man now. He graduated from college last spring. Matthew has two years left of high school. I feel a sense of pride and relief that they have grown well, and a deep grief that my years as a parent of young children is over, except in memory. And I am thankful, the times I spent with my children in nature are among my most meaningful memories, and I hope theirs. We have such a brief opportunity to pass on to our children our love for this Earth and to retell our stories. These are the moments when the world is made whole.""Highly recommend this read to anyone who values nature, or doesn't realize how to. Should be required reading for anyone entrusted to help raise a child up."
49,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7133770-florence,4,"Don't you just love plugging into your computers and phones daily? So do your children. But did you do so as a child? Depending on your age, likely not. It was normal and expected for children to spend time outdoors in natural settings. However, our lives have changed and are a lot more stressful! We are so involved in buying into new technology....such as mobile lawn mowers you can control from across the country and all the latest internet games and movies available for the kids. Yet, everyone feels better when they spend time outdoors; health benefits are obvious. If you ask kids what books they have read (never mind what books they have taken outside and read while lying on the grass or taken along to go camping in the backyard), they most often will tell you about the fantastic movies they have watched. But when did your son or daughter ever just lie on the grass, and do nothing, maybe watch birds, animals or insects? What about just playing in the dirt? The common phrase "" I am bored."" is a request to use an Ipad or watch TV. The funniest phrase I heard was, ""Can I do anything that involves electricity?"" (The boy was limited to one hour daily with his Ipad and dared not ask for more time.) O course, present-day communities have changed. We are concerned with safety and rules which keep the children inside. Louv talks about the number of people moving into larger centers as one of the reasons fewer people get outdoors to enjoy nature. He would like to see a reversal of this scenario, where for example people can be encouraged to stay and maintain their farms. He talks about some projects in B.C, Canada where interesting developments have been attempted.You will find a wonderful chapter entitled ""100 Actions We Can Take"". Suggestions like ""adopting a tree"" are great ideas to inspire kids and families!Richard Louv has written several informative books urging parents and communities to try and change the nature deficit scenario. He reminds us that obesity, depression and attention deficit disorders are linked to nature deficit conditions. It is given! Spending time in the great outdoors can be a solution for us. It is important to try to make this a better world for the children."

One of those kids is taken by an inter-dimensional monster, which seems to also explain why children are not allowed to ride bikes in the woods anymore.You know those sky rocketing rates of anxiety, depression, and ADHD? Everyone has a theory what's messing with children, and Louv's is that it's a lack of time in the woods, which he calls ""nature deficit disorder."" Given that he is quite content to use Gardner's multiple intelligences theory, I decided to mostly ignore all psychological claims and took this as a book that argues being alone in the woods has become underrated. In other words, I rarely found the psychology convincing, even though I was sympathetic to the argument.There are some fine moments here, and I was most impressed by Louv's enthusiasm for just getting kids into the woods. Let them shoot a bb gun at seagulls, let them hunt, let them fish, let them catch crawdads down by the shore, let them touch turtles, let them pick up frogs, let them write unwitnessed sagas amongst trees. It seems like almost everyone who has a powerful, perhaps transcendental, experience in the woods does so in an unscripted way.This is a book about loss. But what have we lost? The woods are mostly removed from human habitats, as is unscripted time. I wonder if the two don't mostly go together.3.5."

Our children didn't enjoy the same freedom, imagination, healthy risk and strength that come along with unscheduled time in nature—whether it happens in woods or vacant lots. This book digs into all the cultural reasons for the one-generation shift, and the critical physical, mental and spiritual reasons to get our kids and grandkids out of virtual life and into the real. The book rambles, but the anecdotes, as much as the science, reaffirm what many of us already feel to be true."

That being said, there were some neat things in here. Particularly a story about a mom who told her daughter to ""pay attention"" instead of ""be careful.""

63,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,3,"Pre-reviewJust want to jot down my thoughts about this book BEFORE actually reading it. This book is constantly cited in discussions about connecting people to nature (which is kind of my thing) , but I've avoided reading it b/c I've also gotten the impression that it's not based on any kind of reasonable evidence, and by reasonable I mean quantitative, peer-reviewed research, and that's a problem for me. But, as Constance pointed out to me, the fact that it has traction in my circles is reason enough to read it, I guess, if only to knowledgeably refute it or repackage its message when it comes up in discussion....and the reviewI think if you read this as an editorial and not as an attempt to present evidence supporting the thesis, the book is actually quite good, and relevant. If you are a parent and you haven't thought about the value of unstructured play in the outdoors, or you simply live in a largely man-made landscape, I suspect there's a lot to be gained by reading Louv's occasionally eloquent, always impassioned plea that kids need the freedom to explore and experience the non-human world on their own terms, as almost all children have until our current urban era, even if that world is a weedy abandoned lot. His collected anecdotes from kids and parents are beautiful, and resonant for those of us who grew up, as Louv and I did, with easy access to forests and streams and abundant time to explore them.What I wanted, though (what I always want, really), was evidence, which was generally lacking or unconvincing. Sometimes this was Louv's fault, e.g. single-observer descriptions of events (doesn't that break a fundamental rule of journalism?) [1], un-cited facts and figures [2], over-reliance on the work of a handful of academics [3], or worse, reports that did not undergo any form of peer review [4]. That being said, I'm pretty sure the underlying problem is that the concepts here are complicated and hard to reduce into forms of evidence I find persuasive, even when Louv did cite research (which he often did). What is nature, anyway? What is a ""connection"" to nature, and how does one operationalize it in such a way that one can study it? These are the kinds of issues that make social science hard and its findings maddeningly impossible to generalize, so it's difficult to fault a journalist like Louv for not providing evidence that is not only not there, but practically impossible to collect in the first place (not that it stops people from trying, though). Calling this ""scholarly"" or ""well-researched"" as the back cover blurbs do seems a bit extreme, though.So while I can't exactly thump my forefinger against this book and cry out, ""The proof is here, people!"", I think I can recommend it in the way I can recommend Pollan's books, as a thought-provoker and a conversation-starter. For me, the ideas presented aren't novel, so I found the lack of supporting evidence frustrating, but for those who've never considered this stuff, like I hadn't considered the source of my food before reading Omnivore's Dilemma, I think this one's worth reading.[1] Louv has this great anecdote on p. 27 about a neighborhood association in San Diego chasing away kids who were fishing in a pond and making bike trails in the woods b/c it violated housing association rules, but it's all based on one friend's testimony. Isn't this too good to go unverified?[2] E.g. ""Copious studies show a reduced amount of leisure time experienced by American families, more time in front of the TV and computer, and growing obesity among adults and children because of diet and sedentary lifestyles"" (p. 32). Totally without citation. ""new studies suggest that exposure to nature may reduce the symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder"" (p. 34), also without citation.[3] He cites a lot of different researchers, but relies heavily on Chawla and Sobel, both of whom seem like cool nature-loving people in their own right, but neither of whom seem to publish much in the scientific literature.[4] E.g.

64,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/542037-annalisa,4,"I really enjoyed this book. I found myself analyzing the way I interact with nature and the encouragement I give to my daughter to do the same. She's not really a play in the dirt kind of a girl and when she told me she was bored on a sunny afternoon a few weeks ago just after I started this book I told her to go outside and play. I looked out the window a few minutes later to see her lying in the grass reading and had to laugh that she wasn't technically playing outside. At least she was feeling the rays of sunshine and the grass on her back. I think I will forever have these concepts in my head and look for ways to bond more with nature and encourage my daughter to do the same. The basic concept of the book is that as human beings we are creatures of nature and need nature as part of our emotional, intellectual, and spiritual development. The generations before us have spent their childhoods outdoors exploring and learning, but because of factors like less land and more people (and the way land is developed with less natural open space), our litigious society, fear of predators and injury, overscheduling, and modern technology, our children do not have the same quality unstructured outdoor play. While we do not know all the effects this lack of nature will have in our children, it most likely affects their creativity, attention (ADHD), ability to soothe and cope, emotional and behavioral (problems arise from a disconnect with nature), and my favorite: their spiritual connection to the space they live in. There is something about lying on your back in the grass at night and watching the stars above and feeling both insignificantly small and significantly important. It's just good for kids to get their hands in the dirt and play, but nobody really does anymore. I always knew nature was important, but never stopped to think just how important it is to our lives. The majority of the book tells us all the reasons we need nature and the ways our society has gone wrong turning its back on nature, but I wish he had more answers for just how to do that. Building utopian societies that revolve around farming and that are more expensive to build just isn't feasible in this country. People just aren't interested in spending more for a system they don't see as broken. My neighborhood has small parks, but there isn't a lot of open exploring area, nor do I know where around here I could move that would give me that without giving up the sense of community I enjoy. My daughter's school does not have grass area but man-made surface area in the playground. There isn't much, if anything, I can do to get that changed, other than move and I am happy with the education she is receiving. While he does give options like cultivating a garden and giving your children more unstructured play, I wanted more solutions that I could do personally instead of grand gestures society on whole must do. I was left with a little bit of a feeling that America is losing its love for nature and this generation will grow up without any loyalty to it and nobody to protect it, but there isn't much that can be done about it without improbable rewiring of the way Americans think. I found his solutions far too optimistic and unrealistic to surpass the mountains he spent the first half of the book showing us need to be climbed for change. And the problems seem just as much to blame on the natural exponential growth in population than anything else. There may be a lot of undeveloped land in this country, but wide open spaces around everyone's home is not only not feasible but it's not many people's style. I am a city girl and have no interest in returning to a frontier lifestyle that he seems to idolize. While I have a healthy appreciation for nature and often like to ponder it and enjoy the small pleasures of walks or rain, I'm not the type of person who likes to be outdoors getting my hands dirty. I could spend days on end indoors and be perfectly happy. And I don't think there's anything wrong that. While I was a little dissatisfied with the lack of solution, I still think the problems addressed in his book both real and extremely important ones to address. Being aware of this trend toward nature deficiency is the first step to evoking change. In our own small ways in our communities and families everyone can find creative solutions for getting more nature time. I especially could be better about encouraging my daughter to spend time bonding with the earth from whence she came. It's healthy and it's important. And I think it's an issue everyone should be aware of so they too can be conscious of the ways they incorporate and protect nature."

I agree with the author that too many electronics will deprive you. Nature can restore you, refresh you, and bring sanity back to your family and life. It is vitally important in childhood to give a firm foundation of life and peace and this book inspired me to make sure my daughter gets plenty of outdoor playtime."
66,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65233712-danielle,1,"This book could have been condensed to a small blurb or article. The basic point is beat over your head for 300 pages. The author had an unfortunate way of writing too scholarly for leisure readers and not scholarly enough for scholars. There were many things I did not like about how this book was written. As many people have voiced the concept was a good one but the execution had much to be desired. I am saddened that I used this book for a nature center book club because most readers gave up 50 to 100 pages in due to boredom. This is saying a lot since our first months book was over 500 pages. I would not recommend to anyone, especially if they already understand that spending time outside is good for one's health."
67,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/917050-lynne,2,"I'm finding this book pretty tedious so far - he is preaching to the choir with me on this subject but it still feels like preaching. I'm looking forward to the second half, which I hope will spend more time on getting kids outside rather than all the reasons why we should and we don't....update since I wrote that part: it was due back to the library so I gave up on it after getting about 85% through. It never got much better for me, which is a shame because it's an important topic. It did make me a little more conscious about the time my child (and me for that matter) spends outdoors, and armed me with the knowledge that it may help with possible ADD or ""spirited child"" symtoms, not to mention general well being... but I could have read a pamphlet version for that. I recommend this book for anyone who isn't already convinced, or maybe for school administrators looking for tips on ways to deal with test-readiness centered parents and school boards or how to implement more nature based programming. I was waiting for him to get around to talking about 4-H however, which has been doing this for over 100 years and is still very avtive in all 50 states with not only rural but suburban and urban kids too. In full disclosure I work for 4-H, but I was honestly surprised that he left that out, except for a very brief mention of one child and her sheep project- especially while devoting a section (though it was a pretty dismissive one, which wasn't fair either) on scouting. Maybe 4-H was in the last part of the book that I didn't get to. Anyway my very modern, screen-loving urban kid is in both scouts and 4-H and trust me, they get outside. It just seems like a good example of how flawed this book is. One little nugget I took from it though: one parent's change in vocabulary from ""be careful"" to ""pay attention"" when her child is outdoors climbing rocks or something and needs to watch her footing or be aware of surroundings to stay safe - a simple but very significant difference in attitude toward nature that can empower a child and teach them to be smart, not to be afraid. I guess that was worth a little tedium."
68,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4697631-karen,5,"At the end of my 6th grade year, I found out my wonderful and extremely intelligent cousin was accepted into Zoo School! You may feel free to insert a bit of intense jealousy here! As a child with high-average intelligence I always desired to achieve placement into gifted programs but never quite make the cut although I was always confident that my level of motivation and work ethic would allow me to keep up with the pace. My dream school was not Zoo School but Blandford- another school that focused on outdoor education and learning in nature. Seeing as I did not live in the correct district, neither of these schools was ever an option for me but the desire was always there.In the book ""Last Child in the Woods"", Richard Louv discusses the benefits of getting children outdoors. In fact he carries on for 310 pages on why kids, and adults, should spend more time outside. There are chapters on mental health, creativity, science, and many more! Despite going on for 310 pages, I was still intrigued through the whole book. This work inspired me to get outside and, as an adult, I have seen incredible benefits. Things are not going my way these days and in one weekend I lost my childhood cat from cancer and my job. Setting aside time to spend outside daily has made the stress of finding a teaching position for next school year much easier. I'm happier and much more positive regarding the hunt for jobs when I make sure to put my work aside to get outside for at least an hour each day. No matter what I have on my plate, I go outside to ""play"". I really enjoyed reading this book and I think the content applies to the health of both adults and children!"
69,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/593578-christina,3,"I mostly read the middle, since I don't need to be convinced that significant exposure to the natural world is essential for kids, or that there is less of it today than there was a generation or two ago. The back of the book promised to provide ""solutions"" and I wanted to see what those would be.Lots of recommendations for what changes the author would like to see made to the school/education system (pre-k through college), to how we build our cities/towns, and to how our culture views the natural world. These are all bigger projects than I can take on, although I'm generally in favor of most of them and would enthusiastically support folks who wanted to be the energy behind making those changes happen.No, it's the small reminders for me. Let your kids have UNSTRUCTURED time in the natural world, wherever it is (the garden, the back forty, the wilderness). Be more enthusiastic about the natural world and less suspicious. Say ""Pay attention"" more often than ""Be careful."" Let the child lead the expedition some of the time. Teach general observation skills, from sitting still to watch a deer cross a meadow or a bird in the garden, to assessing the surroundings - slippery rocks, thin branches, venomous snakes, dangerous people. All this tends to inspire more desire to be a steward of nature than all the ""Save the Species"" segments in school, and it teaches useful skills that will be important all through life, in and out of traditional wildernesses."
70,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/771552-martha,5,"This is a must-read for everyone. Here's what I wrote in my yoga newsletter about it: The subtitle of this book is ‘Saving Our Children from Nature-Deficit Disorder’. The author explains that he is not proposing such a disorder exists, but admits that calling it such will help the average person to understand the gravity of the situation he writes about. His contention is that like the forgotten and all-to-often-relegated-to-near-zero-status arts such as dance, music and painting, nature has been demoted in importance to the severe detriment of our children’s health. He means emotional, intellectual and spiritual health as well as physical health. As a culture, we have lost our connection to nature, and think of it as an ‘extra’, or just a place to occasionally recreate. He has brought together cutting-edge studies to prove his point.I suggest you read this book to get a different perspective on the issues of vanishing forests, polluted waterways, and increased childhood obesity, violence and excessive anti-depressant drug prescriptions. At the back of his book, the author lists some ways we can bring the experience and appreciation of nature back into our lives. If we do not rebuild our connection to the earth, and develop appropriate respect for the power of nature, we are gambling with our future and that of our children."
71,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88622-brittany,5,"I loved this. I'm so inspired to spend more time with my kids outdoors, in the garden, and in natural places regularly. I'm still not completely convinced I should let my young children wander alone for hours, though there are a few chapters dedicated to overcoming parents' fears. (In fact, while the author deeply laments that children of this generation don't play in the woods all day unsupervised, he likes to keep his kids within view as well.) The author believes that spending time outdoors can be stress-relieving for children, treat ADHD, and most importantly build confidence and character. The book left me with the same sorts of feelings I had reading The Secret Garden as a child, watching Mary and Collin transform as they worked in the garden and watched it bloom before their eyes. I want this for my kids. Last Child in the Woods did get a little preachy at the end about preserving natural spaces and saving the environment, but I didn't mind because it seemed appropriate and followed the flow of the book. Again, I am completely inspired. I would like to own my own copy of this book for reference and reminder."
72,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/164645-steve,3,"On a gut level, I agree with so much of what this book argues. But it just doesn't make its case convincingly. So much is taken for granted rather than supported with research or evidence, not least the author's assumption that his type of childhood (and mine) is ""normal"" and everything else—particularly an urban childhood—is a problematic deviation from that. So it was a struggle to read the whole book through that filter of elitism and, at times, what smacked of baby boomer self-aggrandizement. Which is a shame, because I really do agree with so much of this, and wanted to know there are better reasons for agreeing than merely wanting it to be true."
73,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/431775-abc,4,"I actually give this three and a half stars. Four for being a topic I am interesting and its great title. Three because it never really grabbed me and did not tell me anything I did not really already know.It did make me want to go out more and experience nature with my son, but did not really give many ideas on how to do so. A few ideas, but not many. It did cite many studies and so forth, for example, kids enjoy a natural setting more than the typical blacktop playground. Also, it reminded me of ""Free Range Kids"", even though I have not read that book yet. Don't be scared to just let your kids go out and explore."

It needed a good editor to cut out the bits where the author was lamenting his lost youth or shaking his stick at those terrible young people who simply weren't interested in all of the things that he was interested in back in the day. The last section appeared to be a random stream of consciousness, which was particularly hard to get through. The important message about disconnection with nature was somewhat lost within all this, which was a shame. Don't waste time reading the book, go out and visit a park instead."

77,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6176855-stephanie,4,"Louv writes a fantastic perspective on the necessity of introducing our children to nature and to keep nature as essential part of childhood. It was quite comforting to read this book and know that all the time I have spent with my children in nature was quite worth every second. I plan on continuing and increasing the time that I require them to discover the outdoors. I loved the suggestions and proof that children need more time with nature, even during school hours, which is really what spoke to me.This book does get a bit long winded and could really be stellar without the last 4 chapters. I felt he could have incorporated them within the other chapters. I also completely skipped the chapter that discussed relating God to nature. As a pantheist, nature is my all. The section with book suggestions and also activities to do with your children or to encourage them to do on their own, was very helpful. Even if you don't read the rest of the book, those are worth reviewing.There are some parts that I disagreed with and I felt were quite preachy. Although Louv is writing to all generations, he is being pretty judgmental against the current generation of parents (who weren't parents when he wrote the book, but it miffed me a bit). I grew up in a small city, I didn't have a ton of nature in my life, but enough that it awed me. I wasn't interested in birding or animals really - but it did inspire me to incorporate that into my own children's lives - something that Louv is afraid that won't happen with my generation (because we are the first generation to have so much access to electronics). But he's sort of wrong there - I'm proof that isn't always true. The love my kids have had for nature has opened so many doors for me as an adult. I include them on my finds. For example: We see a huge bird outside, we look it up. We find a nest with eggs, we look up the eggs to find out what bird it is. I never had this sort of discovery as a child, but here I am influencing my children despite not having as much nature exposure as generations before me. Nature matters to me as an adult although it wasn't as important to me as a child. I was also shocked that although Louv talked about several Cooperative Extensions, he never talks about how 4H programs can provide much of the exposure he talks about - especially for city kids. Our county has a wonderful Cooperative that kids from the more populated areas can come to and work with animals and be out in Nature."
78,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45921206-sue,5,"I had to read this book over a long period of time, as it could be somewhat academic at times, but also very overwhelming and frightening at the loss of our natural habitats and our next generations disconnect from the natural world. I see this in my work every day; children who are in daycare sometimes from 7 am to 6 pm, who don't go outdoors for days at a time, with families who are ""afraid of bugs"" and paralyzed by the very thought (understandably and no pun intended) of tick born illnesses or of animal encounters. We are losing out narratives of how to read upcoming weather by the clouds, telling time by the sun, or predicting seasonal changes by the appearance of flora and fauna. The last paragraph of the book literally left me in tears (SPOILER ALERT) ""jason is a man now. He graduated from college last spring. Matthew has two years left of high school. I feel a sense of pride and relief that they have grown well, and a deep grief that my years as a parent of young children is over, except in memory. And I am thankful, the times I spent with my children in nature are among my most meaningful memories, and I hope theirs. We have such a brief opportunity to pass on to our children our love for this Earth and to retell our stories. These are the moments when the world is made whole.""Highly recommend this read to anyone who values nature, or doesn't realize how to. Should be required reading for anyone entrusted to help raise a child up."
79,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7133770-florence,4,"Don't you just love plugging into your computers and phones daily? So do your children. But did you do so as a child? Depending on your age, likely not. It was normal and expected for children to spend time outdoors in natural settings. However, our lives have changed and are a lot more stressful! We are so involved in buying into new technology....such as mobile lawn mowers you can control from across the country and all the latest internet games and movies available for the kids. Yet, everyone feels better when they spend time outdoors; health benefits are obvious. If you ask kids what books they have read (never mind what books they have taken outside and read while lying on the grass or taken along to go camping in the backyard), they most often will tell you about the fantastic movies they have watched. But when did your son or daughter ever just lie on the grass, and do nothing, maybe watch birds, animals or insects? What about just playing in the dirt? The common phrase "" I am bored."" is a request to use an Ipad or watch TV. The funniest phrase I heard was, ""Can I do anything that involves electricity?"" (The boy was limited to one hour daily with his Ipad and dared not ask for more time.) O course, present-day communities have changed. We are concerned with safety and rules which keep the children inside. Louv talks about the number of people moving into larger centers as one of the reasons fewer people get outdoors to enjoy nature. He would like to see a reversal of this scenario, where for example people can be encouraged to stay and maintain their farms. He talks about some projects in B.C, Canada where interesting developments have been attempted.You will find a wonderful chapter entitled ""100 Actions We Can Take"". Suggestions like ""adopting a tree"" are great ideas to inspire kids and families!Richard Louv has written several informative books urging parents and communities to try and change the nature deficit scenario. He reminds us that obesity, depression and attention deficit disorders are linked to nature deficit conditions. It is given! Spending time in the great outdoors can be a solution for us. It is important to try to make this a better world for the children."

One of those kids is taken by an inter-dimensional monster, which seems to also explain why children are not allowed to ride bikes in the woods anymore.You know those sky rocketing rates of anxiety, depression, and ADHD? Everyone has a theory what's messing with children, and Louv's is that it's a lack of time in the woods, which he calls ""nature deficit disorder."" Given that he is quite content to use Gardner's multiple intelligences theory, I decided to mostly ignore all psychological claims and took this as a book that argues being alone in the woods has become underrated. In other words, I rarely found the psychology convincing, even though I was sympathetic to the argument.There are some fine moments here, and I was most impressed by Louv's enthusiasm for just getting kids into the woods. Let them shoot a bb gun at seagulls, let them hunt, let them fish, let them catch crawdads down by the shore, let them touch turtles, let them pick up frogs, let them write unwitnessed sagas amongst trees. It seems like almost everyone who has a powerful, perhaps transcendental, experience in the woods does so in an unscripted way.This is a book about loss. But what have we lost? The woods are mostly removed from human habitats, as is unscripted time. I wonder if the two don't mostly go together.3.5."

Our children didn't enjoy the same freedom, imagination, healthy risk and strength that come along with unscheduled time in nature—whether it happens in woods or vacant lots. This book digs into all the cultural reasons for the one-generation shift, and the critical physical, mental and spiritual reasons to get our kids and grandkids out of virtual life and into the real. The book rambles, but the anecdotes, as much as the science, reaffirm what many of us already feel to be true."

By the end of the book, I felt like the author was repeating himself a lot. Also, there were too many instances of ""Here is my theory that has not been researched or proven in any way."" That being said, there were some neat things in here. Particularly a story about a mom who told her daughter to ""pay attention"" instead of ""be careful.""

93,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,3,"Pre-reviewJust want to jot down my thoughts about this book BEFORE actually reading it. This book is constantly cited in discussions about connecting people to nature (which is kind of my thing) , but I've avoided reading it b/c I've also gotten the impression that it's not based on any kind of reasonable evidence, and by reasonable I mean quantitative, peer-reviewed research, and that's a problem for me. But, as Constance pointed out to me, the fact that it has traction in my circles is reason enough to read it, I guess, if only to knowledgeably refute it or repackage its message when it comes up in discussion....and the reviewI think if you read this as an editorial and not as an attempt to present evidence supporting the thesis, the book is actually quite good, and relevant. If you are a parent and you haven't thought about the value of unstructured play in the outdoors, or you simply live in a largely man-made landscape, I suspect there's a lot to be gained by reading Louv's occasionally eloquent, always impassioned plea that kids need the freedom to explore and experience the non-human world on their own terms, as almost all children have until our current urban era, even if that world is a weedy abandoned lot. His collected anecdotes from kids and parents are beautiful, and resonant for those of us who grew up, as Louv and I did, with easy access to forests and streams and abundant time to explore them.What I wanted, though (what I always want, really), was evidence, which was generally lacking or unconvincing. Sometimes this was Louv's fault, e.g. single-observer descriptions of events (doesn't that break a fundamental rule of journalism?) [1], un-cited facts and figures [2], over-reliance on the work of a handful of academics [3], or worse, reports that did not undergo any form of peer review [4]. That being said, I'm pretty sure the underlying problem is that the concepts here are complicated and hard to reduce into forms of evidence I find persuasive, even when Louv did cite research (which he often did). What is nature, anyway? What is a ""connection"" to nature, and how does one operationalize it in such a way that one can study it? These are the kinds of issues that make social science hard and its findings maddeningly impossible to generalize, so it's difficult to fault a journalist like Louv for not providing evidence that is not only not there, but practically impossible to collect in the first place (not that it stops people from trying, though). Calling this ""scholarly"" or ""well-researched"" as the back cover blurbs do seems a bit extreme, though.So while I can't exactly thump my forefinger against this book and cry out, ""The proof is here, people!"", I think I can recommend it in the way I can recommend Pollan's books, as a thought-provoker and a conversation-starter. For me, the ideas presented aren't novel, so I found the lack of supporting evidence frustrating, but for those who've never considered this stuff, like I hadn't considered the source of my food before reading Omnivore's Dilemma, I think this one's worth reading.[1] Louv has this great anecdote on p. 27 about a neighborhood association in San Diego chasing away kids who were fishing in a pond and making bike trails in the woods b/c it violated housing association rules, but it's all based on one friend's testimony. Isn't this too good to go unverified?[2] E.g. ""Copious studies show a reduced amount of leisure time experienced by American families, more time in front of the TV and computer, and growing obesity among adults and children because of diet and sedentary lifestyles"" (p. 32). Totally without citation. ""new studies suggest that exposure to nature may reduce the symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder"" (p. 34), also without citation.[3] He cites a lot of different researchers, but relies heavily on Chawla and Sobel, both of whom seem like cool nature-loving people in their own right, but neither of whom seem to publish much in the scientific literature.[4] E.g.

94,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/542037-annalisa,4,"I really enjoyed this book. I found myself analyzing the way I interact with nature and the encouragement I give to my daughter to do the same. She's not really a play in the dirt kind of a girl and when she told me she was bored on a sunny afternoon a few weeks ago just after I started this book I told her to go outside and play. I looked out the window a few minutes later to see her lying in the grass reading and had to laugh that she wasn't technically playing outside. At least she was feeling the rays of sunshine and the grass on her back. I think I will forever have these concepts in my head and look for ways to bond more with nature and encourage my daughter to do the same. The basic concept of the book is that as human beings we are creatures of nature and need nature as part of our emotional, intellectual, and spiritual development. The generations before us have spent their childhoods outdoors exploring and learning, but because of factors like less land and more people (and the way land is developed with less natural open space), our litigious society, fear of predators and injury, overscheduling, and modern technology, our children do not have the same quality unstructured outdoor play. While we do not know all the effects this lack of nature will have in our children, it most likely affects their creativity, attention (ADHD), ability to soothe and cope, emotional and behavioral (problems arise from a disconnect with nature), and my favorite: their spiritual connection to the space they live in. There is something about lying on your back in the grass at night and watching the stars above and feeling both insignificantly small and significantly important. It's just good for kids to get their hands in the dirt and play, but nobody really does anymore. I always knew nature was important, but never stopped to think just how important it is to our lives. The majority of the book tells us all the reasons we need nature and the ways our society has gone wrong turning its back on nature, but I wish he had more answers for just how to do that. Building utopian societies that revolve around farming and that are more expensive to build just isn't feasible in this country. People just aren't interested in spending more for a system they don't see as broken. My neighborhood has small parks, but there isn't a lot of open exploring area, nor do I know where around here I could move that would give me that without giving up the sense of community I enjoy. My daughter's school does not have grass area but man-made surface area in the playground. There isn't much, if anything, I can do to get that changed, other than move and I am happy with the education she is receiving. While he does give options like cultivating a garden and giving your children more unstructured play, I wanted more solutions that I could do personally instead of grand gestures society on whole must do. I was left with a little bit of a feeling that America is losing its love for nature and this generation will grow up without any loyalty to it and nobody to protect it, but there isn't much that can be done about it without improbable rewiring of the way Americans think. I found his solutions far too optimistic and unrealistic to surpass the mountains he spent the first half of the book showing us need to be climbed for change. And the problems seem just as much to blame on the natural exponential growth in population than anything else. There may be a lot of undeveloped land in this country, but wide open spaces around everyone's home is not only not feasible but it's not many people's style. I am a city girl and have no interest in returning to a frontier lifestyle that he seems to idolize. While I have a healthy appreciation for nature and often like to ponder it and enjoy the small pleasures of walks or rain, I'm not the type of person who likes to be outdoors getting my hands dirty. I could spend days on end indoors and be perfectly happy. And I don't think there's anything wrong that. While I was a little dissatisfied with the lack of solution, I still think the problems addressed in his book both real and extremely important ones to address. Being aware of this trend toward nature deficiency is the first step to evoking change. In our own small ways in our communities and families everyone can find creative solutions for getting more nature time. I especially could be better about encouraging my daughter to spend time bonding with the earth from whence she came. It's healthy and it's important. And I think it's an issue everyone should be aware of so they too can be conscious of the ways they incorporate and protect nature."

I agree with the author that too many electronics will deprive you. Nature can restore you, refresh you, and bring sanity back to your family and life. It is vitally important in childhood to give a firm foundation of life and peace and this book inspired me to make sure my daughter gets plenty of outdoor playtime."
96,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65233712-danielle,1,"This book could have been condensed to a small blurb or article. The basic point is beat over your head for 300 pages. The author had an unfortunate way of writing too scholarly for leisure readers and not scholarly enough for scholars. There were many things I did not like about how this book was written. As many people have voiced the concept was a good one but the execution had much to be desired. I am saddened that I used this book for a nature center book club because most readers gave up 50 to 100 pages in due to boredom. This is saying a lot since our first months book was over 500 pages. I would not recommend to anyone, especially if they already understand that spending time outside is good for one's health."
97,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/917050-lynne,2,"I'm finding this book pretty tedious so far - he is preaching to the choir with me on this subject but it still feels like preaching. I'm looking forward to the second half, which I hope will spend more time on getting kids outside rather than all the reasons why we should and we don't....update since I wrote that part: it was due back to the library so I gave up on it after getting about 85% through. It never got much better for me, which is a shame because it's an important topic. It did make me a little more conscious about the time my child (and me for that matter) spends outdoors, and armed me with the knowledge that it may help with possible ADD or ""spirited child"" symtoms, not to mention general well being... but I could have read a pamphlet version for that. I recommend this book for anyone who isn't already convinced, or maybe for school administrators looking for tips on ways to deal with test-readiness centered parents and school boards or how to implement more nature based programming. I was waiting for him to get around to talking about 4-H however, which has been doing this for over 100 years and is still very avtive in all 50 states with not only rural but suburban and urban kids too. In full disclosure I work for 4-H, but I was honestly surprised that he left that out, except for a very brief mention of one child and her sheep project- especially while devoting a section (though it was a pretty dismissive one, which wasn't fair either) on scouting. Maybe 4-H was in the last part of the book that I didn't get to. Anyway my very modern, screen-loving urban kid is in both scouts and 4-H and trust me, they get outside. It just seems like a good example of how flawed this book is. One little nugget I took from it though: one parent's change in vocabulary from ""be careful"" to ""pay attention"" when her child is outdoors climbing rocks or something and needs to watch her footing or be aware of surroundings to stay safe - a simple but very significant difference in attitude toward nature that can empower a child and teach them to be smart, not to be afraid. I guess that was worth a little tedium."
98,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4697631-karen,5,"At the end of my 6th grade year, I found out my wonderful and extremely intelligent cousin was accepted into Zoo School! You may feel free to insert a bit of intense jealousy here! As a child with high-average intelligence I always desired to achieve placement into gifted programs but never quite make the cut although I was always confident that my level of motivation and work ethic would allow me to keep up with the pace. My dream school was not Zoo School but Blandford- another school that focused on outdoor education and learning in nature. Seeing as I did not live in the correct district, neither of these schools was ever an option for me but the desire was always there.In the book ""Last Child in the Woods"", Richard Louv discusses the benefits of getting children outdoors. In fact he carries on for 310 pages on why kids, and adults, should spend more time outside. There are chapters on mental health, creativity, science, and many more! Despite going on for 310 pages, I was still intrigued through the whole book. This work inspired me to get outside and, as an adult, I have seen incredible benefits. Things are not going my way these days and in one weekend I lost my childhood cat from cancer and my job. Setting aside time to spend outside daily has made the stress of finding a teaching position for next school year much easier. I'm happier and much more positive regarding the hunt for jobs when I make sure to put my work aside to get outside for at least an hour each day. No matter what I have on my plate, I go outside to ""play"". I really enjoyed reading this book and I think the content applies to the health of both adults and children!"
99,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/593578-christina,3,"I mostly read the middle, since I don't need to be convinced that significant exposure to the natural world is essential for kids, or that there is less of it today than there was a generation or two ago. The back of the book promised to provide ""solutions"" and I wanted to see what those would be.Lots of recommendations for what changes the author would like to see made to the school/education system (pre-k through college), to how we build our cities/towns, and to how our culture views the natural world. These are all bigger projects than I can take on, although I'm generally in favor of most of them and would enthusiastically support folks who wanted to be the energy behind making those changes happen.No, it's the small reminders for me. Let your kids have UNSTRUCTURED time in the natural world, wherever it is (the garden, the back forty, the wilderness). Be more enthusiastic about the natural world and less suspicious. Say ""Pay attention"" more often than ""Be careful."" Let the child lead the expedition some of the time. Teach general observation skills, from sitting still to watch a deer cross a meadow or a bird in the garden, to assessing the surroundings - slippery rocks, thin branches, venomous snakes, dangerous people. All this tends to inspire more desire to be a steward of nature than all the ""Save the Species"" segments in school, and it teaches useful skills that will be important all through life, in and out of traditional wildernesses."
100,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/771552-martha,5,"This is a must-read for everyone. Here's what I wrote in my yoga newsletter about it: The subtitle of this book is ‘Saving Our Children from Nature-Deficit Disorder’. The author explains that he is not proposing such a disorder exists, but admits that calling it such will help the average person to understand the gravity of the situation he writes about. His contention is that like the forgotten and all-to-often-relegated-to-near-zero-status arts such as dance, music and painting, nature has been demoted in importance to the severe detriment of our children’s health. He means emotional, intellectual and spiritual health as well as physical health. As a culture, we have lost our connection to nature, and think of it as an ‘extra’, or just a place to occasionally recreate. He has brought together cutting-edge studies to prove his point.I suggest you read this book to get a different perspective on the issues of vanishing forests, polluted waterways, and increased childhood obesity, violence and excessive anti-depressant drug prescriptions. At the back of his book, the author lists some ways we can bring the experience and appreciation of nature back into our lives. If we do not rebuild our connection to the earth, and develop appropriate respect for the power of nature, we are gambling with our future and that of our children."
101,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88622-brittany,5,"I loved this. I'm so inspired to spend more time with my kids outdoors, in the garden, and in natural places regularly. I'm still not completely convinced I should let my young children wander alone for hours, though there are a few chapters dedicated to overcoming parents' fears. (In fact, while the author deeply laments that children of this generation don't play in the woods all day unsupervised, he likes to keep his kids within view as well.) The author believes that spending time outdoors can be stress-relieving for children, treat ADHD, and most importantly build confidence and character. The book left me with the same sorts of feelings I had reading The Secret Garden as a child, watching Mary and Collin transform as they worked in the garden and watched it bloom before their eyes. I want this for my kids. Last Child in the Woods did get a little preachy at the end about preserving natural spaces and saving the environment, but I didn't mind because it seemed appropriate and followed the flow of the book. Again, I am completely inspired. I would like to own my own copy of this book for reference and reminder."

So much is taken for granted rather than supported with research or evidence, not least the author's assumption that his type of childhood (and mine) is ""normal"" and everything else—particularly an urban childhood—is a problematic deviation from that. So it was a struggle to read the whole book through that filter of elitism and, at times, what smacked of baby boomer self-aggrandizement. Which is a shame, because I really do agree with so much of this, and wanted to know there are better reasons for agreeing than merely wanting it to be true."
103,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/431775-abc,4,"I actually give this three and a half stars. Four for being a topic I am interesting and its great title. Three because it never really grabbed me and did not tell me anything I did not really already know.It did make me want to go out more and experience nature with my son, but did not really give many ideas on how to do so. A few ideas, but not many. It did cite many studies and so forth, for example, kids enjoy a natural setting more than the typical blacktop playground. Also, it reminded me of ""Free Range Kids"", even though I have not read that book yet. Don't be scared to just let your kids go out and explore."

It needed a good editor to cut out the bits where the author was lamenting his lost youth or shaking his stick at those terrible young people who simply weren't interested in all of the things that he was interested in back in the day. The last section appeared to be a random stream of consciousness, which was particularly hard to get through. The important message about disconnection with nature was somewhat lost within all this, which was a shame. Don't waste time reading the book, go out and visit a park instead."

107,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6176855-stephanie,4,"Louv writes a fantastic perspective on the necessity of introducing our children to nature and to keep nature as essential part of childhood. It was quite comforting to read this book and know that all the time I have spent with my children in nature was quite worth every second. I plan on continuing and increasing the time that I require them to discover the outdoors. I loved the suggestions and proof that children need more time with nature, even during school hours, which is really what spoke to me.This book does get a bit long winded and could really be stellar without the last 4 chapters. I felt he could have incorporated them within the other chapters. I also completely skipped the chapter that discussed relating God to nature. As a pantheist, nature is my all. The section with book suggestions and also activities to do with your children or to encourage them to do on their own, was very helpful. Even if you don't read the rest of the book, those are worth reviewing.There are some parts that I disagreed with and I felt were quite preachy. Although Louv is writing to all generations, he is being pretty judgmental against the current generation of parents (who weren't parents when he wrote the book, but it miffed me a bit). I grew up in a small city, I didn't have a ton of nature in my life, but enough that it awed me. I wasn't interested in birding or animals really - but it did inspire me to incorporate that into my own children's lives - something that Louv is afraid that won't happen with my generation (because we are the first generation to have so much access to electronics). But he's sort of wrong there - I'm proof that isn't always true. The love my kids have had for nature has opened so many doors for me as an adult. I include them on my finds. For example: We see a huge bird outside, we look it up. We find a nest with eggs, we look up the eggs to find out what bird it is. I never had this sort of discovery as a child, but here I am influencing my children despite not having as much nature exposure as generations before me. Nature matters to me as an adult although it wasn't as important to me as a child. I was also shocked that although Louv talked about several Cooperative Extensions, he never talks about how 4H programs can provide much of the exposure he talks about - especially for city kids. Our county has a wonderful Cooperative that kids from the more populated areas can come to and work with animals and be out in Nature."
108,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45921206-sue,5,"I had to read this book over a long period of time, as it could be somewhat academic at times, but also very overwhelming and frightening at the loss of our natural habitats and our next generations disconnect from the natural world. I see this in my work every day; children who are in daycare sometimes from 7 am to 6 pm, who don't go outdoors for days at a time, with families who are ""afraid of bugs"" and paralyzed by the very thought (understandably and no pun intended) of tick born illnesses or of animal encounters. We are losing out narratives of how to read upcoming weather by the clouds, telling time by the sun, or predicting seasonal changes by the appearance of flora and fauna. The last paragraph of the book literally left me in tears (SPOILER ALERT) ""jason is a man now. He graduated from college last spring. Matthew has two years left of high school. I feel a sense of pride and relief that they have grown well, and a deep grief that my years as a parent of young children is over, except in memory. And I am thankful, the times I spent with my children in nature are among my most meaningful memories, and I hope theirs. We have such a brief opportunity to pass on to our children our love for this Earth and to retell our stories. These are the moments when the world is made whole.""Highly recommend this read to anyone who values nature, or doesn't realize how to.

Depending on your age, likely not. It was normal and expected for children to spend time outdoors in natural settings. However, our lives have changed and are a lot more stressful! We are so involved in buying into new technology....such as mobile lawn mowers you can control from across the country and all the latest internet games and movies available for the kids. Yet, everyone feels better when they spend time outdoors; health benefits are obvious. If you ask kids what books they have read (never mind what books they have taken outside and read while lying on the grass or taken along to go camping in the backyard), they most often will tell you about the fantastic movies they have watched. But when did your son or daughter ever just lie on the grass, and do nothing, maybe watch birds, animals or insects? What about just playing in the dirt? The common phrase "" I am bored."" is a request to use an Ipad or watch TV. The funniest phrase I heard was, ""Can I do anything that involves electricity?"" (The boy was limited to one hour daily with his Ipad and dared not ask for more time.) O course, present-day communities have changed. We are concerned with safety and rules which keep the children inside. Louv talks about the number of people moving into larger centers as one of the reasons fewer people get outdoors to enjoy nature. He would like to see a reversal of this scenario, where for example people can be encouraged to stay and maintain their farms. He talks about some projects in B.C, Canada where interesting developments have been attempted.You will find a wonderful chapter entitled ""100 Actions We Can Take"". Suggestions like ""adopting a tree"" are great ideas to inspire kids and families!Richard Louv has written several informative books urging parents and communities to try and change the nature deficit scenario. He reminds us that obesity, depression and attention deficit disorders are linked to nature deficit conditions. It is given! Spending time in the great outdoors can be a solution for us. It is important to try to make this a better world for the children."

One of those kids is taken by an inter-dimensional monster, which seems to also explain why children are not allowed to ride bikes in the woods anymore.You know those sky rocketing rates of anxiety, depression, and ADHD? Everyone has a theory what's messing with children, and Louv's is that it's a lack of time in the woods, which he calls ""nature deficit disorder."" Given that he is quite content to use Gardner's multiple intelligences theory, I decided to mostly ignore all psychological claims and took this as a book that argues being alone in the woods has become underrated. In other words, I rarely found the psychology convincing, even though I was sympathetic to the argument.There are some fine moments here, and I was most impressed by Louv's enthusiasm for just getting kids into the woods. Let them shoot a bb gun at seagulls, let them hunt, let them fish, let them catch crawdads down by the shore, let them touch turtles, let them pick up frogs, let them write unwitnessed sagas amongst trees. It seems like almost everyone who has a powerful, perhaps transcendental, experience in the woods does so in an unscripted way.This is a book about loss. But what have we lost? The woods are mostly removed from human habitats, as is unscripted time. I wonder if the two don't mostly go together.3.5."

Our children didn't enjoy the same freedom, imagination, healthy risk and strength that come along with unscheduled time in nature—whether it happens in woods or vacant lots. This book digs into all the cultural reasons for the one-generation shift, and the critical physical, mental and spiritual reasons to get our kids and grandkids out of virtual life and into the real. The book rambles, but the anecdotes, as much as the science, reaffirm what many of us already feel to be true."

123,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,3,"Pre-reviewJust want to jot down my thoughts about this book BEFORE actually reading it. This book is constantly cited in discussions about connecting people to nature (which is kind of my thing) , but I've avoided reading it b/c I've also gotten the impression that it's not based on any kind of reasonable evidence, and by reasonable I mean quantitative, peer-reviewed research, and that's a problem for me. But, as Constance pointed out to me, the fact that it has traction in my circles is reason enough to read it, I guess, if only to knowledgeably refute it or repackage its message when it comes up in discussion....and the reviewI think if you read this as an editorial and not as an attempt to present evidence supporting the thesis, the book is actually quite good, and relevant. If you are a parent and you haven't thought about the value of unstructured play in the outdoors, or you simply live in a largely man-made landscape, I suspect there's a lot to be gained by reading Louv's occasionally eloquent, always impassioned plea that kids need the freedom to explore and experience the non-human world on their own terms, as almost all children have until our current urban era, even if that world is a weedy abandoned lot. His collected anecdotes from kids and parents are beautiful, and resonant for those of us who grew up, as Louv and I did, with easy access to forests and streams and abundant time to explore them.What I wanted, though (what I always want, really), was evidence, which was generally lacking or unconvincing. Sometimes this was Louv's fault, e.g. single-observer descriptions of events (doesn't that break a fundamental rule of journalism?) [1], un-cited facts and figures [2], over-reliance on the work of a handful of academics [3], or worse, reports that did not undergo any form of peer review [4]. That being said, I'm pretty sure the underlying problem is that the concepts here are complicated and hard to reduce into forms of evidence I find persuasive, even when Louv did cite research (which he often did). What is nature, anyway? What is a ""connection"" to nature, and how does one operationalize it in such a way that one can study it? These are the kinds of issues that make social science hard and its findings maddeningly impossible to generalize, so it's difficult to fault a journalist like Louv for not providing evidence that is not only not there, but practically impossible to collect in the first place (not that it stops people from trying, though). Calling this ""scholarly"" or ""well-researched"" as the back cover blurbs do seems a bit extreme, though.So while I can't exactly thump my forefinger against this book and cry out, ""The proof is here, people!"", I think I can recommend it in the way I can recommend Pollan's books, as a thought-provoker and a conversation-starter. For me, the ideas presented aren't novel, so I found the lack of supporting evidence frustrating, but for those who've never considered this stuff, like I hadn't considered the source of my food before reading Omnivore's Dilemma, I think this one's worth reading.[1] Louv has this great anecdote on p. 27 about a neighborhood association in San Diego chasing away kids who were fishing in a pond and making bike trails in the woods b/c it violated housing association rules, but it's all based on one friend's testimony. Isn't this too good to go unverified?[2] E.g. ""Copious studies show a reduced amount of leisure time experienced by American families, more time in front of the TV and computer, and growing obesity among adults and children because of diet and sedentary lifestyles"" (p. 32). Totally without citation. ""new studies suggest that exposure to nature may reduce the symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder"" (p. 34), also without citation.[3] He cites a lot of different researchers, but relies heavily on Chawla and Sobel, both of whom seem like cool nature-loving people in their own right, but neither of whom seem to publish much in the scientific literature.[4] E.g.

124,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/542037-annalisa,4,"I really enjoyed this book. I found myself analyzing the way I interact with nature and the encouragement I give to my daughter to do the same. She's not really a play in the dirt kind of a girl and when she told me she was bored on a sunny afternoon a few weeks ago just after I started this book I told her to go outside and play. I looked out the window a few minutes later to see her lying in the grass reading and had to laugh that she wasn't technically playing outside. At least she was feeling the rays of sunshine and the grass on her back. I think I will forever have these concepts in my head and look for ways to bond more with nature and encourage my daughter to do the same. The basic concept of the book is that as human beings we are creatures of nature and need nature as part of our emotional, intellectual, and spiritual development. The generations before us have spent their childhoods outdoors exploring and learning, but because of factors like less land and more people (and the way land is developed with less natural open space), our litigious society, fear of predators and injury, overscheduling, and modern technology, our children do not have the same quality unstructured outdoor play. While we do not know all the effects this lack of nature will have in our children, it most likely affects their creativity, attention (ADHD), ability to soothe and cope, emotional and behavioral (problems arise from a disconnect with nature), and my favorite: their spiritual connection to the space they live in. There is something about lying on your back in the grass at night and watching the stars above and feeling both insignificantly small and significantly important. It's just good for kids to get their hands in the dirt and play, but nobody really does anymore. I always knew nature was important, but never stopped to think just how important it is to our lives. The majority of the book tells us all the reasons we need nature and the ways our society has gone wrong turning its back on nature, but I wish he had more answers for just how to do that. Building utopian societies that revolve around farming and that are more expensive to build just isn't feasible in this country. People just aren't interested in spending more for a system they don't see as broken. My neighborhood has small parks, but there isn't a lot of open exploring area, nor do I know where around here I could move that would give me that without giving up the sense of community I enjoy. My daughter's school does not have grass area but man-made surface area in the playground. There isn't much, if anything, I can do to get that changed, other than move and I am happy with the education she is receiving. While he does give options like cultivating a garden and giving your children more unstructured play, I wanted more solutions that I could do personally instead of grand gestures society on whole must do. I was left with a little bit of a feeling that America is losing its love for nature and this generation will grow up without any loyalty to it and nobody to protect it, but there isn't much that can be done about it without improbable rewiring of the way Americans think. I found his solutions far too optimistic and unrealistic to surpass the mountains he spent the first half of the book showing us need to be climbed for change. And the problems seem just as much to blame on the natural exponential growth in population than anything else. There may be a lot of undeveloped land in this country, but wide open spaces around everyone's home is not only not feasible but it's not many people's style. I am a city girl and have no interest in returning to a frontier lifestyle that he seems to idolize. While I have a healthy appreciation for nature and often like to ponder it and enjoy the small pleasures of walks or rain, I'm not the type of person who likes to be outdoors getting my hands dirty. I could spend days on end indoors and be perfectly happy. And I don't think there's anything wrong that. While I was a little dissatisfied with the lack of solution, I still think the problems addressed in his book both real and extremely important ones to address. Being aware of this trend toward nature deficiency is the first step to evoking change. In our own small ways in our communities and families everyone can find creative solutions for getting more nature time. I especially could be better about encouraging my daughter to spend time bonding with the earth from whence she came. It's healthy and it's important. And I think it's an issue everyone should be aware of so they too can be conscious of the ways they incorporate and protect nature."

I agree with the author that too many electronics will deprive you. Nature can restore you, refresh you, and bring sanity back to your family and life. It is vitally important in childhood to give a firm foundation of life and peace and this book inspired me to make sure my daughter gets plenty of outdoor playtime."
126,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65233712-danielle,1,"This book could have been condensed to a small blurb or article. The basic point is beat over your head for 300 pages. The author had an unfortunate way of writing too scholarly for leisure readers and not scholarly enough for scholars. There were many things I did not like about how this book was written. As many people have voiced the concept was a good one but the execution had much to be desired. I am saddened that I used this book for a nature center book club because most readers gave up 50 to 100 pages in due to boredom. This is saying a lot since our first months book was over 500 pages. I would not recommend to anyone, especially if they already understand that spending time outside is good for one's health."
127,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/917050-lynne,2,"I'm finding this book pretty tedious so far - he is preaching to the choir with me on this subject but it still feels like preaching. I'm looking forward to the second half, which I hope will spend more time on getting kids outside rather than all the reasons why we should and we don't....update since I wrote that part: it was due back to the library so I gave up on it after getting about 85% through. It never got much better for me, which is a shame because it's an important topic. It did make me a little more conscious about the time my child (and me for that matter) spends outdoors, and armed me with the knowledge that it may help with possible ADD or ""spirited child"" symtoms, not to mention general well being... but I could have read a pamphlet version for that. I recommend this book for anyone who isn't already convinced, or maybe for school administrators looking for tips on ways to deal with test-readiness centered parents and school boards or how to implement more nature based programming. I was waiting for him to get around to talking about 4-H however, which has been doing this for over 100 years and is still very avtive in all 50 states with not only rural but suburban and urban kids too. In full disclosure I work for 4-H, but I was honestly surprised that he left that out, except for a very brief mention of one child and her sheep project- especially while devoting a section (though it was a pretty dismissive one, which wasn't fair either) on scouting. Maybe 4-H was in the last part of the book that I didn't get to. Anyway my very modern, screen-loving urban kid is in both scouts and 4-H and trust me, they get outside. It just seems like a good example of how flawed this book is. One little nugget I took from it though: one parent's change in vocabulary from ""be careful"" to ""pay attention"" when her child is outdoors climbing rocks or something and needs to watch her footing or be aware of surroundings to stay safe - a simple but very significant difference in attitude toward nature that can empower a child and teach them to be smart, not to be afraid. I guess that was worth a little tedium."
128,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4697631-karen,5,"At the end of my 6th grade year, I found out my wonderful and extremely intelligent cousin was accepted into Zoo School! You may feel free to insert a bit of intense jealousy here! As a child with high-average intelligence I always desired to achieve placement into gifted programs but never quite make the cut although I was always confident that my level of motivation and work ethic would allow me to keep up with the pace. My dream school was not Zoo School but Blandford- another school that focused on outdoor education and learning in nature. Seeing as I did not live in the correct district, neither of these schools was ever an option for me but the desire was always there.In the book ""Last Child in the Woods"", Richard Louv discusses the benefits of getting children outdoors. In fact he carries on for 310 pages on why kids, and adults, should spend more time outside. There are chapters on mental health, creativity, science, and many more! Despite going on for 310 pages, I was still intrigued through the whole book. This work inspired me to get outside and, as an adult, I have seen incredible benefits. Things are not going my way these days and in one weekend I lost my childhood cat from cancer and my job. Setting aside time to spend outside daily has made the stress of finding a teaching position for next school year much easier. I'm happier and much more positive regarding the hunt for jobs when I make sure to put my work aside to get outside for at least an hour each day. No matter what I have on my plate, I go outside to ""play"". I really enjoyed reading this book and I think the content applies to the health of both adults and children!"
129,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/593578-christina,3,"I mostly read the middle, since I don't need to be convinced that significant exposure to the natural world is essential for kids, or that there is less of it today than there was a generation or two ago. The back of the book promised to provide ""solutions"" and I wanted to see what those would be.Lots of recommendations for what changes the author would like to see made to the school/education system (pre-k through college), to how we build our cities/towns, and to how our culture views the natural world. These are all bigger projects than I can take on, although I'm generally in favor of most of them and would enthusiastically support folks who wanted to be the energy behind making those changes happen.No, it's the small reminders for me. Let your kids have UNSTRUCTURED time in the natural world, wherever it is (the garden, the back forty, the wilderness). Be more enthusiastic about the natural world and less suspicious. Say ""Pay attention"" more often than ""Be careful."" Let the child lead the expedition some of the time. Teach general observation skills, from sitting still to watch a deer cross a meadow or a bird in the garden, to assessing the surroundings - slippery rocks, thin branches, venomous snakes, dangerous people. All this tends to inspire more desire to be a steward of nature than all the ""Save the Species"" segments in school, and it teaches useful skills that will be important all through life, in and out of traditional wildernesses."
130,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/771552-martha,5,"This is a must-read for everyone. Here's what I wrote in my yoga newsletter about it: The subtitle of this book is ‘Saving Our Children from Nature-Deficit Disorder’. The author explains that he is not proposing such a disorder exists, but admits that calling it such will help the average person to understand the gravity of the situation he writes about. His contention is that like the forgotten and all-to-often-relegated-to-near-zero-status arts such as dance, music and painting, nature has been demoted in importance to the severe detriment of our children’s health. He means emotional, intellectual and spiritual health as well as physical health. As a culture, we have lost our connection to nature, and think of it as an ‘extra’, or just a place to occasionally recreate. He has brought together cutting-edge studies to prove his point.I suggest you read this book to get a different perspective on the issues of vanishing forests, polluted waterways, and increased childhood obesity, violence and excessive anti-depressant drug prescriptions. At the back of his book, the author lists some ways we can bring the experience and appreciation of nature back into our lives. If we do not rebuild our connection to the earth, and develop appropriate respect for the power of nature, we are gambling with our future and that of our children."
131,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88622-brittany,5,"I loved this. I'm so inspired to spend more time with my kids outdoors, in the garden, and in natural places regularly. I'm still not completely convinced I should let my young children wander alone for hours, though there are a few chapters dedicated to overcoming parents' fears. (In fact, while the author deeply laments that children of this generation don't play in the woods all day unsupervised, he likes to keep his kids within view as well.) The author believes that spending time outdoors can be stress-relieving for children, treat ADHD, and most importantly build confidence and character. The book left me with the same sorts of feelings I had reading The Secret Garden as a child, watching Mary and Collin transform as they worked in the garden and watched it bloom before their eyes. I want this for my kids. Last Child in the Woods did get a little preachy at the end about preserving natural spaces and saving the environment, but I didn't mind because it seemed appropriate and followed the flow of the book. Again, I am completely inspired. I would like to own my own copy of this book for reference and reminder."

So much is taken for granted rather than supported with research or evidence, not least the author's assumption that his type of childhood (and mine) is ""normal"" and everything else—particularly an urban childhood—is a problematic deviation from that. So it was a struggle to read the whole book through that filter of elitism and, at times, what smacked of baby boomer self-aggrandizement. Which is a shame, because I really do agree with so much of this, and wanted to know there are better reasons for agreeing than merely wanting it to be true."

A few ideas, but not many. It did cite many studies and so forth, for example, kids enjoy a natural setting more than the typical blacktop playground.

It needed a good editor to cut out the bits where the author was lamenting his lost youth or shaking his stick at those terrible young people who simply weren't interested in all of the things that he was interested in back in the day. The last section appeared to be a random stream of consciousness, which was particularly hard to get through. The important message about disconnection with nature was somewhat lost within all this, which was a shame. Don't waste time reading the book, go out and visit a park instead."

137,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6176855-stephanie,4,"Louv writes a fantastic perspective on the necessity of introducing our children to nature and to keep nature as essential part of childhood. It was quite comforting to read this book and know that all the time I have spent with my children in nature was quite worth every second. I plan on continuing and increasing the time that I require them to discover the outdoors. I loved the suggestions and proof that children need more time with nature, even during school hours, which is really what spoke to me.This book does get a bit long winded and could really be stellar without the last 4 chapters. I felt he could have incorporated them within the other chapters. I also completely skipped the chapter that discussed relating God to nature. As a pantheist, nature is my all. The section with book suggestions and also activities to do with your children or to encourage them to do on their own, was very helpful. Even if you don't read the rest of the book, those are worth reviewing.There are some parts that I disagreed with and I felt were quite preachy. Although Louv is writing to all generations, he is being pretty judgmental against the current generation of parents (who weren't parents when he wrote the book, but it miffed me a bit). I grew up in a small city, I didn't have a ton of nature in my life, but enough that it awed me. I wasn't interested in birding or animals really - but it did inspire me to incorporate that into my own children's lives - something that Louv is afraid that won't happen with my generation (because we are the first generation to have so much access to electronics). But he's sort of wrong there - I'm proof that isn't always true. The love my kids have had for nature has opened so many doors for me as an adult. I include them on my finds. For example: We see a huge bird outside, we look it up. We find a nest with eggs, we look up the eggs to find out what bird it is. I never had this sort of discovery as a child, but here I am influencing my children despite not having as much nature exposure as generations before me. Nature matters to me as an adult although it wasn't as important to me as a child. I was also shocked that although Louv talked about several Cooperative Extensions, he never talks about how 4H programs can provide much of the exposure he talks about - especially for city kids. Our county has a wonderful Cooperative that kids from the more populated areas can come to and work with animals and be out in Nature."
138,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45921206-sue,5,"I had to read this book over a long period of time, as it could be somewhat academic at times, but also very overwhelming and frightening at the loss of our natural habitats and our next generations disconnect from the natural world. I see this in my work every day; children who are in daycare sometimes from 7 am to 6 pm, who don't go outdoors for days at a time, with families who are ""afraid of bugs"" and paralyzed by the very thought (understandably and no pun intended) of tick born illnesses or of animal encounters. We are losing out narratives of how to read upcoming weather by the clouds, telling time by the sun, or predicting seasonal changes by the appearance of flora and fauna. The last paragraph of the book literally left me in tears (SPOILER ALERT) ""jason is a man now. He graduated from college last spring. Matthew has two years left of high school. I feel a sense of pride and relief that they have grown well, and a deep grief that my years as a parent of young children is over, except in memory. And I am thankful, the times I spent with my children in nature are among my most meaningful memories, and I hope theirs. We have such a brief opportunity to pass on to our children our love for this Earth and to retell our stories.

Depending on your age, likely not. It was normal and expected for children to spend time outdoors in natural settings. However, our lives have changed and are a lot more stressful! We are so involved in buying into new technology....such as mobile lawn mowers you can control from across the country and all the latest internet games and movies available for the kids. Yet, everyone feels better when they spend time outdoors; health benefits are obvious. If you ask kids what books they have read (never mind what books they have taken outside and read while lying on the grass or taken along to go camping in the backyard), they most often will tell you about the fantastic movies they have watched. But when did your son or daughter ever just lie on the grass, and do nothing, maybe watch birds, animals or insects? What about just playing in the dirt? The common phrase "" I am bored."" is a request to use an Ipad or watch TV. The funniest phrase I heard was, ""Can I do anything that involves electricity?"" (The boy was limited to one hour daily with his Ipad and dared not ask for more time.) O course, present-day communities have changed. We are concerned with safety and rules which keep the children inside. Louv talks about the number of people moving into larger centers as one of the reasons fewer people get outdoors to enjoy nature. He would like to see a reversal of this scenario, where for example people can be encouraged to stay and maintain their farms. He talks about some projects in B.C, Canada where interesting developments have been attempted.You will find a wonderful chapter entitled ""100 Actions We Can Take"". Suggestions like ""adopting a tree"" are great ideas to inspire kids and families!Richard Louv has written several informative books urging parents and communities to try and change the nature deficit scenario. He reminds us that obesity, depression and attention deficit disorders are linked to nature deficit conditions. It is given! Spending time in the great outdoors can be a solution for us. It is important to try to make this a better world for the children."

One of those kids is taken by an inter-dimensional monster, which seems to also explain why children are not allowed to ride bikes in the woods anymore.You know those sky rocketing rates of anxiety, depression, and ADHD? Everyone has a theory what's messing with children, and Louv's is that it's a lack of time in the woods, which he calls ""nature deficit disorder."" Given that he is quite content to use Gardner's multiple intelligences theory, I decided to mostly ignore all psychological claims and took this as a book that argues being alone in the woods has become underrated. In other words, I rarely found the psychology convincing, even though I was sympathetic to the argument.There are some fine moments here, and I was most impressed by Louv's enthusiasm for just getting kids into the woods. Let them shoot a bb gun at seagulls, let them hunt, let them fish, let them catch crawdads down by the shore, let them touch turtles, let them pick up frogs, let them write unwitnessed sagas amongst trees. It seems like almost everyone who has a powerful, perhaps transcendental, experience in the woods does so in an unscripted way.This is a book about loss. But what have we lost? The woods are mostly removed from human habitats, as is unscripted time. I wonder if the two don't mostly go together.3.5."

Our children didn't enjoy the same freedom, imagination, healthy risk and strength that come along with unscheduled time in nature—whether it happens in woods or vacant lots. This book digs into all the cultural reasons for the one-generation shift, and the critical physical, mental and spiritual reasons to get our kids and grandkids out of virtual life and into the real. The book rambles, but the anecdotes, as much as the science, reaffirm what many of us already feel to be true."

153,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,3,"Pre-reviewJust want to jot down my thoughts about this book BEFORE actually reading it. This book is constantly cited in discussions about connecting people to nature (which is kind of my thing) , but I've avoided reading it b/c I've also gotten the impression that it's not based on any kind of reasonable evidence, and by reasonable I mean quantitative, peer-reviewed research, and that's a problem for me. But, as Constance pointed out to me, the fact that it has traction in my circles is reason enough to read it, I guess, if only to knowledgeably refute it or repackage its message when it comes up in discussion....and the reviewI think if you read this as an editorial and not as an attempt to present evidence supporting the thesis, the book is actually quite good, and relevant. If you are a parent and you haven't thought about the value of unstructured play in the outdoors, or you simply live in a largely man-made landscape, I suspect there's a lot to be gained by reading Louv's occasionally eloquent, always impassioned plea that kids need the freedom to explore and experience the non-human world on their own terms, as almost all children have until our current urban era, even if that world is a weedy abandoned lot. His collected anecdotes from kids and parents are beautiful, and resonant for those of us who grew up, as Louv and I did, with easy access to forests and streams and abundant time to explore them.What I wanted, though (what I always want, really), was evidence, which was generally lacking or unconvincing. Sometimes this was Louv's fault, e.g. single-observer descriptions of events (doesn't that break a fundamental rule of journalism?) [1], un-cited facts and figures [2], over-reliance on the work of a handful of academics [3], or worse, reports that did not undergo any form of peer review [4]. That being said, I'm pretty sure the underlying problem is that the concepts here are complicated and hard to reduce into forms of evidence I find persuasive, even when Louv did cite research (which he often did). What is nature, anyway? What is a ""connection"" to nature, and how does one operationalize it in such a way that one can study it? These are the kinds of issues that make social science hard and its findings maddeningly impossible to generalize, so it's difficult to fault a journalist like Louv for not providing evidence that is not only not there, but practically impossible to collect in the first place (not that it stops people from trying, though). Calling this ""scholarly"" or ""well-researched"" as the back cover blurbs do seems a bit extreme, though.So while I can't exactly thump my forefinger against this book and cry out, ""The proof is here, people!"", I think I can recommend it in the way I can recommend Pollan's books, as a thought-provoker and a conversation-starter. For me, the ideas presented aren't novel, so I found the lack of supporting evidence frustrating, but for those who've never considered this stuff, like I hadn't considered the source of my food before reading Omnivore's Dilemma, I think this one's worth reading.[1] Louv has this great anecdote on p. 27 about a neighborhood association in San Diego chasing away kids who were fishing in a pond and making bike trails in the woods b/c it violated housing association rules, but it's all based on one friend's testimony. Isn't this too good to go unverified?[2] E.g. ""Copious studies show a reduced amount of leisure time experienced by American families, more time in front of the TV and computer, and growing obesity among adults and children because of diet and sedentary lifestyles"" (p. 32). Totally without citation. ""new studies suggest that exposure to nature may reduce the symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder"" (p. 34), also without citation.[3] He cites a lot of different researchers, but relies heavily on Chawla and Sobel, both of whom seem like cool nature-loving people in their own right, but neither of whom seem to publish much in the scientific literature.[4] E.g.

154,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/542037-annalisa,4,"I really enjoyed this book. I found myself analyzing the way I interact with nature and the encouragement I give to my daughter to do the same. She's not really a play in the dirt kind of a girl and when she told me she was bored on a sunny afternoon a few weeks ago just after I started this book I told her to go outside and play. I looked out the window a few minutes later to see her lying in the grass reading and had to laugh that she wasn't technically playing outside. At least she was feeling the rays of sunshine and the grass on her back. I think I will forever have these concepts in my head and look for ways to bond more with nature and encourage my daughter to do the same. The basic concept of the book is that as human beings we are creatures of nature and need nature as part of our emotional, intellectual, and spiritual development. The generations before us have spent their childhoods outdoors exploring and learning, but because of factors like less land and more people (and the way land is developed with less natural open space), our litigious society, fear of predators and injury, overscheduling, and modern technology, our children do not have the same quality unstructured outdoor play. While we do not know all the effects this lack of nature will have in our children, it most likely affects their creativity, attention (ADHD), ability to soothe and cope, emotional and behavioral (problems arise from a disconnect with nature), and my favorite: their spiritual connection to the space they live in. There is something about lying on your back in the grass at night and watching the stars above and feeling both insignificantly small and significantly important. It's just good for kids to get their hands in the dirt and play, but nobody really does anymore. I always knew nature was important, but never stopped to think just how important it is to our lives. The majority of the book tells us all the reasons we need nature and the ways our society has gone wrong turning its back on nature, but I wish he had more answers for just how to do that. Building utopian societies that revolve around farming and that are more expensive to build just isn't feasible in this country. People just aren't interested in spending more for a system they don't see as broken. My neighborhood has small parks, but there isn't a lot of open exploring area, nor do I know where around here I could move that would give me that without giving up the sense of community I enjoy. My daughter's school does not have grass area but man-made surface area in the playground. There isn't much, if anything, I can do to get that changed, other than move and I am happy with the education she is receiving. While he does give options like cultivating a garden and giving your children more unstructured play, I wanted more solutions that I could do personally instead of grand gestures society on whole must do. I was left with a little bit of a feeling that America is losing its love for nature and this generation will grow up without any loyalty to it and nobody to protect it, but there isn't much that can be done about it without improbable rewiring of the way Americans think. I found his solutions far too optimistic and unrealistic to surpass the mountains he spent the first half of the book showing us need to be climbed for change. And the problems seem just as much to blame on the natural exponential growth in population than anything else. There may be a lot of undeveloped land in this country, but wide open spaces around everyone's home is not only not feasible but it's not many people's style. I am a city girl and have no interest in returning to a frontier lifestyle that he seems to idolize. While I have a healthy appreciation for nature and often like to ponder it and enjoy the small pleasures of walks or rain, I'm not the type of person who likes to be outdoors getting my hands dirty. I could spend days on end indoors and be perfectly happy. And I don't think there's anything wrong that. While I was a little dissatisfied with the lack of solution, I still think the problems addressed in his book both real and extremely important ones to address. Being aware of this trend toward nature deficiency is the first step to evoking change. In our own small ways in our communities and families everyone can find creative solutions for getting more nature time. I especially could be better about encouraging my daughter to spend time bonding with the earth from whence she came. It's healthy and it's important. And I think it's an issue everyone should be aware of so they too can be conscious of the ways they incorporate and protect nature."

I agree with the author that too many electronics will deprive you. Nature can restore you, refresh you, and bring sanity back to your family and life. It is vitally important in childhood to give a firm foundation of life and peace and this book inspired me to make sure my daughter gets plenty of outdoor playtime."
156,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65233712-danielle,1,"This book could have been condensed to a small blurb or article. The basic point is beat over your head for 300 pages. The author had an unfortunate way of writing too scholarly for leisure readers and not scholarly enough for scholars. There were many things I did not like about how this book was written. As many people have voiced the concept was a good one but the execution had much to be desired. I am saddened that I used this book for a nature center book club because most readers gave up 50 to 100 pages in due to boredom. This is saying a lot since our first months book was over 500 pages. I would not recommend to anyone, especially if they already understand that spending time outside is good for one's health."
157,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/917050-lynne,2,"I'm finding this book pretty tedious so far - he is preaching to the choir with me on this subject but it still feels like preaching. I'm looking forward to the second half, which I hope will spend more time on getting kids outside rather than all the reasons why we should and we don't....update since I wrote that part: it was due back to the library so I gave up on it after getting about 85% through. It never got much better for me, which is a shame because it's an important topic. It did make me a little more conscious about the time my child (and me for that matter) spends outdoors, and armed me with the knowledge that it may help with possible ADD or ""spirited child"" symtoms, not to mention general well being... but I could have read a pamphlet version for that. I recommend this book for anyone who isn't already convinced, or maybe for school administrators looking for tips on ways to deal with test-readiness centered parents and school boards or how to implement more nature based programming. I was waiting for him to get around to talking about 4-H however, which has been doing this for over 100 years and is still very avtive in all 50 states with not only rural but suburban and urban kids too. In full disclosure I work for 4-H, but I was honestly surprised that he left that out, except for a very brief mention of one child and her sheep project- especially while devoting a section (though it was a pretty dismissive one, which wasn't fair either) on scouting. Maybe 4-H was in the last part of the book that I didn't get to. Anyway my very modern, screen-loving urban kid is in both scouts and 4-H and trust me, they get outside. It just seems like a good example of how flawed this book is. One little nugget I took from it though: one parent's change in vocabulary from ""be careful"" to ""pay attention"" when her child is outdoors climbing rocks or something and needs to watch her footing or be aware of surroundings to stay safe - a simple but very significant difference in attitude toward nature that can empower a child and teach them to be smart, not to be afraid. I guess that was worth a little tedium."
158,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4697631-karen,5,"At the end of my 6th grade year, I found out my wonderful and extremely intelligent cousin was accepted into Zoo School! You may feel free to insert a bit of intense jealousy here! As a child with high-average intelligence I always desired to achieve placement into gifted programs but never quite make the cut although I was always confident that my level of motivation and work ethic would allow me to keep up with the pace. My dream school was not Zoo School but Blandford- another school that focused on outdoor education and learning in nature. Seeing as I did not live in the correct district, neither of these schools was ever an option for me but the desire was always there.In the book ""Last Child in the Woods"", Richard Louv discusses the benefits of getting children outdoors. In fact he carries on for 310 pages on why kids, and adults, should spend more time outside. There are chapters on mental health, creativity, science, and many more! Despite going on for 310 pages, I was still intrigued through the whole book. This work inspired me to get outside and, as an adult, I have seen incredible benefits. Things are not going my way these days and in one weekend I lost my childhood cat from cancer and my job. Setting aside time to spend outside daily has made the stress of finding a teaching position for next school year much easier. I'm happier and much more positive regarding the hunt for jobs when I make sure to put my work aside to get outside for at least an hour each day. No matter what I have on my plate, I go outside to ""play"". I really enjoyed reading this book and I think the content applies to the health of both adults and children!"
159,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/593578-christina,3,"I mostly read the middle, since I don't need to be convinced that significant exposure to the natural world is essential for kids, or that there is less of it today than there was a generation or two ago. The back of the book promised to provide ""solutions"" and I wanted to see what those would be.Lots of recommendations for what changes the author would like to see made to the school/education system (pre-k through college), to how we build our cities/towns, and to how our culture views the natural world. These are all bigger projects than I can take on, although I'm generally in favor of most of them and would enthusiastically support folks who wanted to be the energy behind making those changes happen.No, it's the small reminders for me. Let your kids have UNSTRUCTURED time in the natural world, wherever it is (the garden, the back forty, the wilderness). Be more enthusiastic about the natural world and less suspicious. Say ""Pay attention"" more often than ""Be careful."" Let the child lead the expedition some of the time. Teach general observation skills, from sitting still to watch a deer cross a meadow or a bird in the garden, to assessing the surroundings - slippery rocks, thin branches, venomous snakes, dangerous people. All this tends to inspire more desire to be a steward of nature than all the ""Save the Species"" segments in school, and it teaches useful skills that will be important all through life, in and out of traditional wildernesses."
160,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/771552-martha,5,"This is a must-read for everyone. Here's what I wrote in my yoga newsletter about it: The subtitle of this book is ‘Saving Our Children from Nature-Deficit Disorder’. The author explains that he is not proposing such a disorder exists, but admits that calling it such will help the average person to understand the gravity of the situation he writes about. His contention is that like the forgotten and all-to-often-relegated-to-near-zero-status arts such as dance, music and painting, nature has been demoted in importance to the severe detriment of our children’s health. He means emotional, intellectual and spiritual health as well as physical health. As a culture, we have lost our connection to nature, and think of it as an ‘extra’, or just a place to occasionally recreate. He has brought together cutting-edge studies to prove his point.I suggest you read this book to get a different perspective on the issues of vanishing forests, polluted waterways, and increased childhood obesity, violence and excessive anti-depressant drug prescriptions. At the back of his book, the author lists some ways we can bring the experience and appreciation of nature back into our lives. If we do not rebuild our connection to the earth, and develop appropriate respect for the power of nature, we are gambling with our future and that of our children."
161,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88622-brittany,5,"I loved this. I'm so inspired to spend more time with my kids outdoors, in the garden, and in natural places regularly. I'm still not completely convinced I should let my young children wander alone for hours, though there are a few chapters dedicated to overcoming parents' fears. (In fact, while the author deeply laments that children of this generation don't play in the woods all day unsupervised, he likes to keep his kids within view as well.) The author believes that spending time outdoors can be stress-relieving for children, treat ADHD, and most importantly build confidence and character. The book left me with the same sorts of feelings I had reading The Secret Garden as a child, watching Mary and Collin transform as they worked in the garden and watched it bloom before their eyes. I want this for my kids. Last Child in the Woods did get a little preachy at the end about preserving natural spaces and saving the environment, but I didn't mind because it seemed appropriate and followed the flow of the book. Again, I am completely inspired. I would like to own my own copy of this book for reference and reminder."

So much is taken for granted rather than supported with research or evidence, not least the author's assumption that his type of childhood (and mine) is ""normal"" and everything else—particularly an urban childhood—is a problematic deviation from that. So it was a struggle to read the whole book through that filter of elitism and, at times, what smacked of baby boomer self-aggrandizement. Which is a shame, because I really do agree with so much of this, and wanted to know there are better reasons for agreeing than merely wanting it to be true."
163,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/431775-abc,4,"I actually give this three and a half stars. Four for being a topic I am interesting and its great title. Three because it never really grabbed me and did not tell me anything I did not really already know.It did make me want to go out more and experience nature with my son, but did not really give many ideas on how to do so. A few ideas, but not many. It did cite many studies and so forth, for example, kids enjoy a natural setting more than the typical blacktop playground. Also, it reminded me of ""Free Range Kids"", even though I have not read that book yet. Don't be scared to just let your kids go out and explore."

It needed a good editor to cut out the bits where the author was lamenting his lost youth or shaking his stick at those terrible young people who simply weren't interested in all of the things that he was interested in back in the day. The last section appeared to be a random stream of consciousness, which was particularly hard to get through. The important message about disconnection with nature was somewhat lost within all this, which was a shame. Don't waste time reading the book, go out and visit a park instead."

167,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6176855-stephanie,4,"Louv writes a fantastic perspective on the necessity of introducing our children to nature and to keep nature as essential part of childhood. It was quite comforting to read this book and know that all the time I have spent with my children in nature was quite worth every second. I plan on continuing and increasing the time that I require them to discover the outdoors. I loved the suggestions and proof that children need more time with nature, even during school hours, which is really what spoke to me.This book does get a bit long winded and could really be stellar without the last 4 chapters. I felt he could have incorporated them within the other chapters. I also completely skipped the chapter that discussed relating God to nature. As a pantheist, nature is my all. The section with book suggestions and also activities to do with your children or to encourage them to do on their own, was very helpful. Even if you don't read the rest of the book, those are worth reviewing.There are some parts that I disagreed with and I felt were quite preachy. Although Louv is writing to all generations, he is being pretty judgmental against the current generation of parents (who weren't parents when he wrote the book, but it miffed me a bit). I grew up in a small city, I didn't have a ton of nature in my life, but enough that it awed me. I wasn't interested in birding or animals really - but it did inspire me to incorporate that into my own children's lives - something that Louv is afraid that won't happen with my generation (because we are the first generation to have so much access to electronics). But he's sort of wrong there - I'm proof that isn't always true. The love my kids have had for nature has opened so many doors for me as an adult. I include them on my finds. For example: We see a huge bird outside, we look it up. We find a nest with eggs, we look up the eggs to find out what bird it is. I never had this sort of discovery as a child, but here I am influencing my children despite not having as much nature exposure as generations before me. Nature matters to me as an adult although it wasn't as important to me as a child. I was also shocked that although Louv talked about several Cooperative Extensions, he never talks about how 4H programs can provide much of the exposure he talks about - especially for city kids. Our county has a wonderful Cooperative that kids from the more populated areas can come to and work with animals and be out in Nature."
168,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45921206-sue,5,"I had to read this book over a long period of time, as it could be somewhat academic at times, but also very overwhelming and frightening at the loss of our natural habitats and our next generations disconnect from the natural world. I see this in my work every day; children who are in daycare sometimes from 7 am to 6 pm, who don't go outdoors for days at a time, with families who are ""afraid of bugs"" and paralyzed by the very thought (understandably and no pun intended) of tick born illnesses or of animal encounters. We are losing out narratives of how to read upcoming weather by the clouds, telling time by the sun, or predicting seasonal changes by the appearance of flora and fauna.

I feel a sense of pride and relief that they have grown well, and a deep grief that my years as a parent of young children is over, except in memory. And I am thankful, the times I spent with my children in nature are among my most meaningful memories, and I hope theirs. We have such a brief opportunity to pass on to our children our love for this Earth and to retell our stories. These are the moments when the world is made whole.""Highly recommend this read to anyone who values nature, or doesn't realize how to. Should be required reading for anyone entrusted to help raise a child up."

Depending on your age, likely not. It was normal and expected for children to spend time outdoors in natural settings. However, our lives have changed and are a lot more stressful! We are so involved in buying into new technology....such as mobile lawn mowers you can control from across the country and all the latest internet games and movies available for the kids. Yet, everyone feels better when they spend time outdoors; health benefits are obvious. If you ask kids what books they have read (never mind what books they have taken outside and read while lying on the grass or taken along to go camping in the backyard), they most often will tell you about the fantastic movies they have watched. But when did your son or daughter ever just lie on the grass, and do nothing, maybe watch birds, animals or insects? What about just playing in the dirt? The common phrase "" I am bored."" is a request to use an Ipad or watch TV. The funniest phrase I heard was, ""Can I do anything that involves electricity?"" (The boy was limited to one hour daily with his Ipad and dared not ask for more time.) O course, present-day communities have changed. We are concerned with safety and rules which keep the children inside. Louv talks about the number of people moving into larger centers as one of the reasons fewer people get outdoors to enjoy nature. He would like to see a reversal of this scenario, where for example people can be encouraged to stay and maintain their farms. He talks about some projects in B.C, Canada where interesting developments have been attempted.You will find a wonderful chapter entitled ""100 Actions We Can Take"". Suggestions like ""adopting a tree"" are great ideas to inspire kids and families!Richard Louv has written several informative books urging parents and communities to try and change the nature deficit scenario. He reminds us that obesity, depression and attention deficit disorders are linked to nature deficit conditions. It is given! Spending time in the great outdoors can be a solution for us. It is important to try to make this a better world for the children."

One of those kids is taken by an inter-dimensional monster, which seems to also explain why children are not allowed to ride bikes in the woods anymore.You know those sky rocketing rates of anxiety, depression, and ADHD? Everyone has a theory what's messing with children, and Louv's is that it's a lack of time in the woods, which he calls ""nature deficit disorder."" Given that he is quite content to use Gardner's multiple intelligences theory, I decided to mostly ignore all psychological claims and took this as a book that argues being alone in the woods has become underrated. In other words, I rarely found the psychology convincing, even though I was sympathetic to the argument.There are some fine moments here, and I was most impressed by Louv's enthusiasm for just getting kids into the woods. Let them shoot a bb gun at seagulls, let them hunt, let them fish, let them catch crawdads down by the shore, let them touch turtles, let them pick up frogs, let them write unwitnessed sagas amongst trees. It seems like almost everyone who has a powerful, perhaps transcendental, experience in the woods does so in an unscripted way.This is a book about loss. But what have we lost? The woods are mostly removed from human habitats, as is unscripted time. I wonder if the two don't mostly go together.3.5."

Our children didn't enjoy the same freedom, imagination, healthy risk and strength that come along with unscheduled time in nature—whether it happens in woods or vacant lots. This book digs into all the cultural reasons for the one-generation shift, and the critical physical, mental and spiritual reasons to get our kids and grandkids out of virtual life and into the real. The book rambles, but the anecdotes, as much as the science, reaffirm what many of us already feel to be true."

That being said, there were some neat things in here. Particularly a story about a mom who told her daughter to ""pay attention"" instead of ""be careful.""

183,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,3,"Pre-reviewJust want to jot down my thoughts about this book BEFORE actually reading it. This book is constantly cited in discussions about connecting people to nature (which is kind of my thing) , but I've avoided reading it b/c I've also gotten the impression that it's not based on any kind of reasonable evidence, and by reasonable I mean quantitative, peer-reviewed research, and that's a problem for me. But, as Constance pointed out to me, the fact that it has traction in my circles is reason enough to read it, I guess, if only to knowledgeably refute it or repackage its message when it comes up in discussion....and the reviewI think if you read this as an editorial and not as an attempt to present evidence supporting the thesis, the book is actually quite good, and relevant. If you are a parent and you haven't thought about the value of unstructured play in the outdoors, or you simply live in a largely man-made landscape, I suspect there's a lot to be gained by reading Louv's occasionally eloquent, always impassioned plea that kids need the freedom to explore and experience the non-human world on their own terms, as almost all children have until our current urban era, even if that world is a weedy abandoned lot. His collected anecdotes from kids and parents are beautiful, and resonant for those of us who grew up, as Louv and I did, with easy access to forests and streams and abundant time to explore them.What I wanted, though (what I always want, really), was evidence, which was generally lacking or unconvincing. Sometimes this was Louv's fault, e.g. single-observer descriptions of events (doesn't that break a fundamental rule of journalism?) [1], un-cited facts and figures [2], over-reliance on the work of a handful of academics [3], or worse, reports that did not undergo any form of peer review [4]. That being said, I'm pretty sure the underlying problem is that the concepts here are complicated and hard to reduce into forms of evidence I find persuasive, even when Louv did cite research (which he often did). What is nature, anyway? What is a ""connection"" to nature, and how does one operationalize it in such a way that one can study it? These are the kinds of issues that make social science hard and its findings maddeningly impossible to generalize, so it's difficult to fault a journalist like Louv for not providing evidence that is not only not there, but practically impossible to collect in the first place (not that it stops people from trying, though). Calling this ""scholarly"" or ""well-researched"" as the back cover blurbs do seems a bit extreme, though.So while I can't exactly thump my forefinger against this book and cry out, ""The proof is here, people!"", I think I can recommend it in the way I can recommend Pollan's books, as a thought-provoker and a conversation-starter. For me, the ideas presented aren't novel, so I found the lack of supporting evidence frustrating, but for those who've never considered this stuff, like I hadn't considered the source of my food before reading Omnivore's Dilemma, I think this one's worth reading.[1] Louv has this great anecdote on p. 27 about a neighborhood association in San Diego chasing away kids who were fishing in a pond and making bike trails in the woods b/c it violated housing association rules, but it's all based on one friend's testimony. Isn't this too good to go unverified?[2] E.g. ""Copious studies show a reduced amount of leisure time experienced by American families, more time in front of the TV and computer, and growing obesity among adults and children because of diet and sedentary lifestyles"" (p. 32). Totally without citation. ""new studies suggest that exposure to nature may reduce the symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder"" (p. 34), also without citation.[3] He cites a lot of different researchers, but relies heavily on Chawla and Sobel, both of whom seem like cool nature-loving people in their own right, but neither of whom seem to publish much in the scientific literature.[4] E.g.

184,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/542037-annalisa,4,"I really enjoyed this book. I found myself analyzing the way I interact with nature and the encouragement I give to my daughter to do the same. She's not really a play in the dirt kind of a girl and when she told me she was bored on a sunny afternoon a few weeks ago just after I started this book I told her to go outside and play. I looked out the window a few minutes later to see her lying in the grass reading and had to laugh that she wasn't technically playing outside. At least she was feeling the rays of sunshine and the grass on her back. I think I will forever have these concepts in my head and look for ways to bond more with nature and encourage my daughter to do the same. The basic concept of the book is that as human beings we are creatures of nature and need nature as part of our emotional, intellectual, and spiritual development. The generations before us have spent their childhoods outdoors exploring and learning, but because of factors like less land and more people (and the way land is developed with less natural open space), our litigious society, fear of predators and injury, overscheduling, and modern technology, our children do not have the same quality unstructured outdoor play. While we do not know all the effects this lack of nature will have in our children, it most likely affects their creativity, attention (ADHD), ability to soothe and cope, emotional and behavioral (problems arise from a disconnect with nature), and my favorite: their spiritual connection to the space they live in. There is something about lying on your back in the grass at night and watching the stars above and feeling both insignificantly small and significantly important. It's just good for kids to get their hands in the dirt and play, but nobody really does anymore. I always knew nature was important, but never stopped to think just how important it is to our lives. The majority of the book tells us all the reasons we need nature and the ways our society has gone wrong turning its back on nature, but I wish he had more answers for just how to do that. Building utopian societies that revolve around farming and that are more expensive to build just isn't feasible in this country. People just aren't interested in spending more for a system they don't see as broken. My neighborhood has small parks, but there isn't a lot of open exploring area, nor do I know where around here I could move that would give me that without giving up the sense of community I enjoy. My daughter's school does not have grass area but man-made surface area in the playground. There isn't much, if anything, I can do to get that changed, other than move and I am happy with the education she is receiving. While he does give options like cultivating a garden and giving your children more unstructured play, I wanted more solutions that I could do personally instead of grand gestures society on whole must do. I was left with a little bit of a feeling that America is losing its love for nature and this generation will grow up without any loyalty to it and nobody to protect it, but there isn't much that can be done about it without improbable rewiring of the way Americans think. I found his solutions far too optimistic and unrealistic to surpass the mountains he spent the first half of the book showing us need to be climbed for change. And the problems seem just as much to blame on the natural exponential growth in population than anything else. There may be a lot of undeveloped land in this country, but wide open spaces around everyone's home is not only not feasible but it's not many people's style. I am a city girl and have no interest in returning to a frontier lifestyle that he seems to idolize. While I have a healthy appreciation for nature and often like to ponder it and enjoy the small pleasures of walks or rain, I'm not the type of person who likes to be outdoors getting my hands dirty. I could spend days on end indoors and be perfectly happy. And I don't think there's anything wrong that. While I was a little dissatisfied with the lack of solution, I still think the problems addressed in his book both real and extremely important ones to address. Being aware of this trend toward nature deficiency is the first step to evoking change. In our own small ways in our communities and families everyone can find creative solutions for getting more nature time. I especially could be better about encouraging my daughter to spend time bonding with the earth from whence she came. It's healthy and it's important. And I think it's an issue everyone should be aware of so they too can be conscious of the ways they incorporate and protect nature."

I agree with the author that too many electronics will deprive you. Nature can restore you, refresh you, and bring sanity back to your family and life. It is vitally important in childhood to give a firm foundation of life and peace and this book inspired me to make sure my daughter gets plenty of outdoor playtime."
186,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65233712-danielle,1,"This book could have been condensed to a small blurb or article. The basic point is beat over your head for 300 pages. The author had an unfortunate way of writing too scholarly for leisure readers and not scholarly enough for scholars. There were many things I did not like about how this book was written. As many people have voiced the concept was a good one but the execution had much to be desired. I am saddened that I used this book for a nature center book club because most readers gave up 50 to 100 pages in due to boredom. This is saying a lot since our first months book was over 500 pages. I would not recommend to anyone, especially if they already understand that spending time outside is good for one's health."
187,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/917050-lynne,2,"I'm finding this book pretty tedious so far - he is preaching to the choir with me on this subject but it still feels like preaching. I'm looking forward to the second half, which I hope will spend more time on getting kids outside rather than all the reasons why we should and we don't....update since I wrote that part: it was due back to the library so I gave up on it after getting about 85% through. It never got much better for me, which is a shame because it's an important topic. It did make me a little more conscious about the time my child (and me for that matter) spends outdoors, and armed me with the knowledge that it may help with possible ADD or ""spirited child"" symtoms, not to mention general well being... but I could have read a pamphlet version for that. I recommend this book for anyone who isn't already convinced, or maybe for school administrators looking for tips on ways to deal with test-readiness centered parents and school boards or how to implement more nature based programming. I was waiting for him to get around to talking about 4-H however, which has been doing this for over 100 years and is still very avtive in all 50 states with not only rural but suburban and urban kids too. In full disclosure I work for 4-H, but I was honestly surprised that he left that out, except for a very brief mention of one child and her sheep project- especially while devoting a section (though it was a pretty dismissive one, which wasn't fair either) on scouting. Maybe 4-H was in the last part of the book that I didn't get to. Anyway my very modern, screen-loving urban kid is in both scouts and 4-H and trust me, they get outside. It just seems like a good example of how flawed this book is. One little nugget I took from it though: one parent's change in vocabulary from ""be careful"" to ""pay attention"" when her child is outdoors climbing rocks or something and needs to watch her footing or be aware of surroundings to stay safe - a simple but very significant difference in attitude toward nature that can empower a child and teach them to be smart, not to be afraid. I guess that was worth a little tedium."
188,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4697631-karen,5,"At the end of my 6th grade year, I found out my wonderful and extremely intelligent cousin was accepted into Zoo School! You may feel free to insert a bit of intense jealousy here! As a child with high-average intelligence I always desired to achieve placement into gifted programs but never quite make the cut although I was always confident that my level of motivation and work ethic would allow me to keep up with the pace. My dream school was not Zoo School but Blandford- another school that focused on outdoor education and learning in nature. Seeing as I did not live in the correct district, neither of these schools was ever an option for me but the desire was always there.In the book ""Last Child in the Woods"", Richard Louv discusses the benefits of getting children outdoors. In fact he carries on for 310 pages on why kids, and adults, should spend more time outside. There are chapters on mental health, creativity, science, and many more! Despite going on for 310 pages, I was still intrigued through the whole book. This work inspired me to get outside and, as an adult, I have seen incredible benefits. Things are not going my way these days and in one weekend I lost my childhood cat from cancer and my job. Setting aside time to spend outside daily has made the stress of finding a teaching position for next school year much easier. I'm happier and much more positive regarding the hunt for jobs when I make sure to put my work aside to get outside for at least an hour each day. No matter what I have on my plate, I go outside to ""play"". I really enjoyed reading this book and I think the content applies to the health of both adults and children!"
189,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/593578-christina,3,"I mostly read the middle, since I don't need to be convinced that significant exposure to the natural world is essential for kids, or that there is less of it today than there was a generation or two ago. The back of the book promised to provide ""solutions"" and I wanted to see what those would be.Lots of recommendations for what changes the author would like to see made to the school/education system (pre-k through college), to how we build our cities/towns, and to how our culture views the natural world. These are all bigger projects than I can take on, although I'm generally in favor of most of them and would enthusiastically support folks who wanted to be the energy behind making those changes happen.No, it's the small reminders for me. Let your kids have UNSTRUCTURED time in the natural world, wherever it is (the garden, the back forty, the wilderness). Be more enthusiastic about the natural world and less suspicious. Say ""Pay attention"" more often than ""Be careful."" Let the child lead the expedition some of the time. Teach general observation skills, from sitting still to watch a deer cross a meadow or a bird in the garden, to assessing the surroundings - slippery rocks, thin branches, venomous snakes, dangerous people. All this tends to inspire more desire to be a steward of nature than all the ""Save the Species"" segments in school, and it teaches useful skills that will be important all through life, in and out of traditional wildernesses."
190,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/771552-martha,5,"This is a must-read for everyone. Here's what I wrote in my yoga newsletter about it: The subtitle of this book is ‘Saving Our Children from Nature-Deficit Disorder’. The author explains that he is not proposing such a disorder exists, but admits that calling it such will help the average person to understand the gravity of the situation he writes about. His contention is that like the forgotten and all-to-often-relegated-to-near-zero-status arts such as dance, music and painting, nature has been demoted in importance to the severe detriment of our children’s health. He means emotional, intellectual and spiritual health as well as physical health. As a culture, we have lost our connection to nature, and think of it as an ‘extra’, or just a place to occasionally recreate. He has brought together cutting-edge studies to prove his point.I suggest you read this book to get a different perspective on the issues of vanishing forests, polluted waterways, and increased childhood obesity, violence and excessive anti-depressant drug prescriptions. At the back of his book, the author lists some ways we can bring the experience and appreciation of nature back into our lives. If we do not rebuild our connection to the earth, and develop appropriate respect for the power of nature, we are gambling with our future and that of our children."
191,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88622-brittany,5,"I loved this. I'm so inspired to spend more time with my kids outdoors, in the garden, and in natural places regularly. I'm still not completely convinced I should let my young children wander alone for hours, though there are a few chapters dedicated to overcoming parents' fears. (In fact, while the author deeply laments that children of this generation don't play in the woods all day unsupervised, he likes to keep his kids within view as well.) The author believes that spending time outdoors can be stress-relieving for children, treat ADHD, and most importantly build confidence and character. The book left me with the same sorts of feelings I had reading The Secret Garden as a child, watching Mary and Collin transform as they worked in the garden and watched it bloom before their eyes. I want this for my kids. Last Child in the Woods did get a little preachy at the end about preserving natural spaces and saving the environment, but I didn't mind because it seemed appropriate and followed the flow of the book. Again, I am completely inspired. I would like to own my own copy of this book for reference and reminder."

So much is taken for granted rather than supported with research or evidence, not least the author's assumption that his type of childhood (and mine) is ""normal"" and everything else—particularly an urban childhood—is a problematic deviation from that. So it was a struggle to read the whole book through that filter of elitism and, at times, what smacked of baby boomer self-aggrandizement. Which is a shame, because I really do agree with so much of this, and wanted to know there are better reasons for agreeing than merely wanting it to be true."
193,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/431775-abc,4,"I actually give this three and a half stars. Four for being a topic I am interesting and its great title. Three because it never really grabbed me and did not tell me anything I did not really already know.It did make me want to go out more and experience nature with my son, but did not really give many ideas on how to do so. A few ideas, but not many. It did cite many studies and so forth, for example, kids enjoy a natural setting more than the typical blacktop playground. Also, it reminded me of ""Free Range Kids"", even though I have not read that book yet. Don't be scared to just let your kids go out and explore."

It needed a good editor to cut out the bits where the author was lamenting his lost youth or shaking his stick at those terrible young people who simply weren't interested in all of the things that he was interested in back in the day. The last section appeared to be a random stream of consciousness, which was particularly hard to get through. The important message about disconnection with nature was somewhat lost within all this, which was a shame. Don't waste time reading the book, go out and visit a park instead."

197,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6176855-stephanie,4,"Louv writes a fantastic perspective on the necessity of introducing our children to nature and to keep nature as essential part of childhood. It was quite comforting to read this book and know that all the time I have spent with my children in nature was quite worth every second. I plan on continuing and increasing the time that I require them to discover the outdoors. I loved the suggestions and proof that children need more time with nature, even during school hours, which is really what spoke to me.This book does get a bit long winded and could really be stellar without the last 4 chapters. I felt he could have incorporated them within the other chapters. I also completely skipped the chapter that discussed relating God to nature. As a pantheist, nature is my all. The section with book suggestions and also activities to do with your children or to encourage them to do on their own, was very helpful. Even if you don't read the rest of the book, those are worth reviewing.There are some parts that I disagreed with and I felt were quite preachy. Although Louv is writing to all generations, he is being pretty judgmental against the current generation of parents (who weren't parents when he wrote the book, but it miffed me a bit). I grew up in a small city, I didn't have a ton of nature in my life, but enough that it awed me. I wasn't interested in birding or animals really - but it did inspire me to incorporate that into my own children's lives - something that Louv is afraid that won't happen with my generation (because we are the first generation to have so much access to electronics). But he's sort of wrong there - I'm proof that isn't always true. The love my kids have had for nature has opened so many doors for me as an adult. I include them on my finds. For example: We see a huge bird outside, we look it up. We find a nest with eggs, we look up the eggs to find out what bird it is. I never had this sort of discovery as a child, but here I am influencing my children despite not having as much nature exposure as generations before me. Nature matters to me as an adult although it wasn't as important to me as a child. I was also shocked that although Louv talked about several Cooperative Extensions, he never talks about how 4H programs can provide much of the exposure he talks about - especially for city kids. Our county has a wonderful Cooperative that kids from the more populated areas can come to and work with animals and be out in Nature."

I see this in my work every day; children who are in daycare sometimes from 7 am to 6 pm, who don't go outdoors for days at a time, with families who are ""afraid of bugs"" and paralyzed by the very thought (understandably and no pun intended) of tick born illnesses or of animal encounters. We are losing out narratives of how to read upcoming weather by the clouds, telling time by the sun, or predicting seasonal changes by the appearance of flora and fauna. The last paragraph of the book literally left me in tears (SPOILER ALERT) ""jason is a man now. He graduated from college last spring. Matthew has two years left of high school. I feel a sense of pride and relief that they have grown well, and a deep grief that my years as a parent of young children is over, except in memory. And I am thankful, the times I spent with my children in nature are among my most meaningful memories, and I hope theirs. We have such a brief opportunity to pass on to our children our love for this Earth and to retell our stories. These are the moments when the world is made whole.""Highly recommend this read to anyone who values nature, or doesn't realize how to.

Depending on your age, likely not. It was normal and expected for children to spend time outdoors in natural settings. However, our lives have changed and are a lot more stressful! We are so involved in buying into new technology....such as mobile lawn mowers you can control from across the country and all the latest internet games and movies available for the kids. Yet, everyone feels better when they spend time outdoors; health benefits are obvious. If you ask kids what books they have read (never mind what books they have taken outside and read while lying on the grass or taken along to go camping in the backyard), they most often will tell you about the fantastic movies they have watched. But when did your son or daughter ever just lie on the grass, and do nothing, maybe watch birds, animals or insects? What about just playing in the dirt? The common phrase "" I am bored."" is a request to use an Ipad or watch TV. The funniest phrase I heard was, ""Can I do anything that involves electricity?"" (The boy was limited to one hour daily with his Ipad and dared not ask for more time.) O course, present-day communities have changed. We are concerned with safety and rules which keep the children inside. Louv talks about the number of people moving into larger centers as one of the reasons fewer people get outdoors to enjoy nature. He would like to see a reversal of this scenario, where for example people can be encouraged to stay and maintain their farms. He talks about some projects in B.C, Canada where interesting developments have been attempted.You will find a wonderful chapter entitled ""100 Actions We Can Take"". Suggestions like ""adopting a tree"" are great ideas to inspire kids and families!Richard Louv has written several informative books urging parents and communities to try and change the nature deficit scenario. He reminds us that obesity, depression and attention deficit disorders are linked to nature deficit conditions. It is given! Spending time in the great outdoors can be a solution for us. It is important to try to make this a better world for the children."

One of those kids is taken by an inter-dimensional monster, which seems to also explain why children are not allowed to ride bikes in the woods anymore.You know those sky rocketing rates of anxiety, depression, and ADHD? Everyone has a theory what's messing with children, and Louv's is that it's a lack of time in the woods, which he calls ""nature deficit disorder."" Given that he is quite content to use Gardner's multiple intelligences theory, I decided to mostly ignore all psychological claims and took this as a book that argues being alone in the woods has become underrated. In other words, I rarely found the psychology convincing, even though I was sympathetic to the argument.There are some fine moments here, and I was most impressed by Louv's enthusiasm for just getting kids into the woods. Let them shoot a bb gun at seagulls, let them hunt, let them fish, let them catch crawdads down by the shore, let them touch turtles, let them pick up frogs, let them write unwitnessed sagas amongst trees. It seems like almost everyone who has a powerful, perhaps transcendental, experience in the woods does so in an unscripted way.This is a book about loss. But what have we lost? The woods are mostly removed from human habitats, as is unscripted time. I wonder if the two don't mostly go together.3.5."

Our children didn't enjoy the same freedom, imagination, healthy risk and strength that come along with unscheduled time in nature—whether it happens in woods or vacant lots. This book digs into all the cultural reasons for the one-generation shift, and the critical physical, mental and spiritual reasons to get our kids and grandkids out of virtual life and into the real. The book rambles, but the anecdotes, as much as the science, reaffirm what many of us already feel to be true."

213,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,3,"Pre-reviewJust want to jot down my thoughts about this book BEFORE actually reading it. This book is constantly cited in discussions about connecting people to nature (which is kind of my thing) , but I've avoided reading it b/c I've also gotten the impression that it's not based on any kind of reasonable evidence, and by reasonable I mean quantitative, peer-reviewed research, and that's a problem for me. But, as Constance pointed out to me, the fact that it has traction in my circles is reason enough to read it, I guess, if only to knowledgeably refute it or repackage its message when it comes up in discussion....and the reviewI think if you read this as an editorial and not as an attempt to present evidence supporting the thesis, the book is actually quite good, and relevant. If you are a parent and you haven't thought about the value of unstructured play in the outdoors, or you simply live in a largely man-made landscape, I suspect there's a lot to be gained by reading Louv's occasionally eloquent, always impassioned plea that kids need the freedom to explore and experience the non-human world on their own terms, as almost all children have until our current urban era, even if that world is a weedy abandoned lot. His collected anecdotes from kids and parents are beautiful, and resonant for those of us who grew up, as Louv and I did, with easy access to forests and streams and abundant time to explore them.What I wanted, though (what I always want, really), was evidence, which was generally lacking or unconvincing. Sometimes this was Louv's fault, e.g. single-observer descriptions of events (doesn't that break a fundamental rule of journalism?) [1], un-cited facts and figures [2], over-reliance on the work of a handful of academics [3], or worse, reports that did not undergo any form of peer review [4]. That being said, I'm pretty sure the underlying problem is that the concepts here are complicated and hard to reduce into forms of evidence I find persuasive, even when Louv did cite research (which he often did). What is nature, anyway? What is a ""connection"" to nature, and how does one operationalize it in such a way that one can study it? These are the kinds of issues that make social science hard and its findings maddeningly impossible to generalize, so it's difficult to fault a journalist like Louv for not providing evidence that is not only not there, but practically impossible to collect in the first place (not that it stops people from trying, though). Calling this ""scholarly"" or ""well-researched"" as the back cover blurbs do seems a bit extreme, though.So while I can't exactly thump my forefinger against this book and cry out, ""The proof is here, people!"", I think I can recommend it in the way I can recommend Pollan's books, as a thought-provoker and a conversation-starter. For me, the ideas presented aren't novel, so I found the lack of supporting evidence frustrating, but for those who've never considered this stuff, like I hadn't considered the source of my food before reading Omnivore's Dilemma, I think this one's worth reading.[1] Louv has this great anecdote on p. 27 about a neighborhood association in San Diego chasing away kids who were fishing in a pond and making bike trails in the woods b/c it violated housing association rules, but it's all based on one friend's testimony. Isn't this too good to go unverified?[2] E.g. ""Copious studies show a reduced amount of leisure time experienced by American families, more time in front of the TV and computer, and growing obesity among adults and children because of diet and sedentary lifestyles"" (p. 32). Totally without citation. ""new studies suggest that exposure to nature may reduce the symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder"" (p. 34), also without citation.[3] He cites a lot of different researchers, but relies heavily on Chawla and Sobel, both of whom seem like cool nature-loving people in their own right, but neither of whom seem to publish much in the scientific literature.[4] E.g.

214,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/542037-annalisa,4,"I really enjoyed this book. I found myself analyzing the way I interact with nature and the encouragement I give to my daughter to do the same. She's not really a play in the dirt kind of a girl and when she told me she was bored on a sunny afternoon a few weeks ago just after I started this book I told her to go outside and play. I looked out the window a few minutes later to see her lying in the grass reading and had to laugh that she wasn't technically playing outside. At least she was feeling the rays of sunshine and the grass on her back. I think I will forever have these concepts in my head and look for ways to bond more with nature and encourage my daughter to do the same. The basic concept of the book is that as human beings we are creatures of nature and need nature as part of our emotional, intellectual, and spiritual development. The generations before us have spent their childhoods outdoors exploring and learning, but because of factors like less land and more people (and the way land is developed with less natural open space), our litigious society, fear of predators and injury, overscheduling, and modern technology, our children do not have the same quality unstructured outdoor play. While we do not know all the effects this lack of nature will have in our children, it most likely affects their creativity, attention (ADHD), ability to soothe and cope, emotional and behavioral (problems arise from a disconnect with nature), and my favorite: their spiritual connection to the space they live in. There is something about lying on your back in the grass at night and watching the stars above and feeling both insignificantly small and significantly important. It's just good for kids to get their hands in the dirt and play, but nobody really does anymore. I always knew nature was important, but never stopped to think just how important it is to our lives. The majority of the book tells us all the reasons we need nature and the ways our society has gone wrong turning its back on nature, but I wish he had more answers for just how to do that. Building utopian societies that revolve around farming and that are more expensive to build just isn't feasible in this country. People just aren't interested in spending more for a system they don't see as broken. My neighborhood has small parks, but there isn't a lot of open exploring area, nor do I know where around here I could move that would give me that without giving up the sense of community I enjoy. My daughter's school does not have grass area but man-made surface area in the playground. There isn't much, if anything, I can do to get that changed, other than move and I am happy with the education she is receiving. While he does give options like cultivating a garden and giving your children more unstructured play, I wanted more solutions that I could do personally instead of grand gestures society on whole must do. I was left with a little bit of a feeling that America is losing its love for nature and this generation will grow up without any loyalty to it and nobody to protect it, but there isn't much that can be done about it without improbable rewiring of the way Americans think. I found his solutions far too optimistic and unrealistic to surpass the mountains he spent the first half of the book showing us need to be climbed for change. And the problems seem just as much to blame on the natural exponential growth in population than anything else. There may be a lot of undeveloped land in this country, but wide open spaces around everyone's home is not only not feasible but it's not many people's style. I am a city girl and have no interest in returning to a frontier lifestyle that he seems to idolize. While I have a healthy appreciation for nature and often like to ponder it and enjoy the small pleasures of walks or rain, I'm not the type of person who likes to be outdoors getting my hands dirty. I could spend days on end indoors and be perfectly happy. And I don't think there's anything wrong that. While I was a little dissatisfied with the lack of solution, I still think the problems addressed in his book both real and extremely important ones to address. Being aware of this trend toward nature deficiency is the first step to evoking change. In our own small ways in our communities and families everyone can find creative solutions for getting more nature time. I especially could be better about encouraging my daughter to spend time bonding with the earth from whence she came. It's healthy and it's important. And I think it's an issue everyone should be aware of so they too can be conscious of the ways they incorporate and protect nature."

I agree with the author that too many electronics will deprive you. Nature can restore you, refresh you, and bring sanity back to your family and life. It is vitally important in childhood to give a firm foundation of life and peace and this book inspired me to make sure my daughter gets plenty of outdoor playtime."
216,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65233712-danielle,1,"This book could have been condensed to a small blurb or article. The basic point is beat over your head for 300 pages. The author had an unfortunate way of writing too scholarly for leisure readers and not scholarly enough for scholars. There were many things I did not like about how this book was written. As many people have voiced the concept was a good one but the execution had much to be desired. I am saddened that I used this book for a nature center book club because most readers gave up 50 to 100 pages in due to boredom. This is saying a lot since our first months book was over 500 pages. I would not recommend to anyone, especially if they already understand that spending time outside is good for one's health."
217,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/917050-lynne,2,"I'm finding this book pretty tedious so far - he is preaching to the choir with me on this subject but it still feels like preaching. I'm looking forward to the second half, which I hope will spend more time on getting kids outside rather than all the reasons why we should and we don't....update since I wrote that part: it was due back to the library so I gave up on it after getting about 85% through. It never got much better for me, which is a shame because it's an important topic. It did make me a little more conscious about the time my child (and me for that matter) spends outdoors, and armed me with the knowledge that it may help with possible ADD or ""spirited child"" symtoms, not to mention general well being... but I could have read a pamphlet version for that. I recommend this book for anyone who isn't already convinced, or maybe for school administrators looking for tips on ways to deal with test-readiness centered parents and school boards or how to implement more nature based programming. I was waiting for him to get around to talking about 4-H however, which has been doing this for over 100 years and is still very avtive in all 50 states with not only rural but suburban and urban kids too. In full disclosure I work for 4-H, but I was honestly surprised that he left that out, except for a very brief mention of one child and her sheep project- especially while devoting a section (though it was a pretty dismissive one, which wasn't fair either) on scouting. Maybe 4-H was in the last part of the book that I didn't get to. Anyway my very modern, screen-loving urban kid is in both scouts and 4-H and trust me, they get outside. It just seems like a good example of how flawed this book is. One little nugget I took from it though: one parent's change in vocabulary from ""be careful"" to ""pay attention"" when her child is outdoors climbing rocks or something and needs to watch her footing or be aware of surroundings to stay safe - a simple but very significant difference in attitude toward nature that can empower a child and teach them to be smart, not to be afraid. I guess that was worth a little tedium."
218,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4697631-karen,5,"At the end of my 6th grade year, I found out my wonderful and extremely intelligent cousin was accepted into Zoo School! You may feel free to insert a bit of intense jealousy here! As a child with high-average intelligence I always desired to achieve placement into gifted programs but never quite make the cut although I was always confident that my level of motivation and work ethic would allow me to keep up with the pace. My dream school was not Zoo School but Blandford- another school that focused on outdoor education and learning in nature. Seeing as I did not live in the correct district, neither of these schools was ever an option for me but the desire was always there.In the book ""Last Child in the Woods"", Richard Louv discusses the benefits of getting children outdoors. In fact he carries on for 310 pages on why kids, and adults, should spend more time outside. There are chapters on mental health, creativity, science, and many more! Despite going on for 310 pages, I was still intrigued through the whole book. This work inspired me to get outside and, as an adult, I have seen incredible benefits. Things are not going my way these days and in one weekend I lost my childhood cat from cancer and my job. Setting aside time to spend outside daily has made the stress of finding a teaching position for next school year much easier. I'm happier and much more positive regarding the hunt for jobs when I make sure to put my work aside to get outside for at least an hour each day. No matter what I have on my plate, I go outside to ""play"". I really enjoyed reading this book and I think the content applies to the health of both adults and children!"
219,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/593578-christina,3,"I mostly read the middle, since I don't need to be convinced that significant exposure to the natural world is essential for kids, or that there is less of it today than there was a generation or two ago. The back of the book promised to provide ""solutions"" and I wanted to see what those would be.Lots of recommendations for what changes the author would like to see made to the school/education system (pre-k through college), to how we build our cities/towns, and to how our culture views the natural world. These are all bigger projects than I can take on, although I'm generally in favor of most of them and would enthusiastically support folks who wanted to be the energy behind making those changes happen.No, it's the small reminders for me. Let your kids have UNSTRUCTURED time in the natural world, wherever it is (the garden, the back forty, the wilderness). Be more enthusiastic about the natural world and less suspicious. Say ""Pay attention"" more often than ""Be careful."" Let the child lead the expedition some of the time. Teach general observation skills, from sitting still to watch a deer cross a meadow or a bird in the garden, to assessing the surroundings - slippery rocks, thin branches, venomous snakes, dangerous people. All this tends to inspire more desire to be a steward of nature than all the ""Save the Species"" segments in school, and it teaches useful skills that will be important all through life, in and out of traditional wildernesses."
220,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/771552-martha,5,"This is a must-read for everyone. Here's what I wrote in my yoga newsletter about it: The subtitle of this book is ‘Saving Our Children from Nature-Deficit Disorder’. The author explains that he is not proposing such a disorder exists, but admits that calling it such will help the average person to understand the gravity of the situation he writes about. His contention is that like the forgotten and all-to-often-relegated-to-near-zero-status arts such as dance, music and painting, nature has been demoted in importance to the severe detriment of our children’s health. He means emotional, intellectual and spiritual health as well as physical health. As a culture, we have lost our connection to nature, and think of it as an ‘extra’, or just a place to occasionally recreate. He has brought together cutting-edge studies to prove his point.I suggest you read this book to get a different perspective on the issues of vanishing forests, polluted waterways, and increased childhood obesity, violence and excessive anti-depressant drug prescriptions. At the back of his book, the author lists some ways we can bring the experience and appreciation of nature back into our lives. If we do not rebuild our connection to the earth, and develop appropriate respect for the power of nature, we are gambling with our future and that of our children."
221,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88622-brittany,5,"I loved this. I'm so inspired to spend more time with my kids outdoors, in the garden, and in natural places regularly. I'm still not completely convinced I should let my young children wander alone for hours, though there are a few chapters dedicated to overcoming parents' fears. (In fact, while the author deeply laments that children of this generation don't play in the woods all day unsupervised, he likes to keep his kids within view as well.) The author believes that spending time outdoors can be stress-relieving for children, treat ADHD, and most importantly build confidence and character. The book left me with the same sorts of feelings I had reading The Secret Garden as a child, watching Mary and Collin transform as they worked in the garden and watched it bloom before their eyes. I want this for my kids. Last Child in the Woods did get a little preachy at the end about preserving natural spaces and saving the environment, but I didn't mind because it seemed appropriate and followed the flow of the book. Again, I am completely inspired. I would like to own my own copy of this book for reference and reminder."

So much is taken for granted rather than supported with research or evidence, not least the author's assumption that his type of childhood (and mine) is ""normal"" and everything else—particularly an urban childhood—is a problematic deviation from that. So it was a struggle to read the whole book through that filter of elitism and, at times, what smacked of baby boomer self-aggrandizement. Which is a shame, because I really do agree with so much of this, and wanted to know there are better reasons for agreeing than merely wanting it to be true."
223,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/431775-abc,4,"I actually give this three and a half stars. Four for being a topic I am interesting and its great title. Three because it never really grabbed me and did not tell me anything I did not really already know.It did make me want to go out more and experience nature with my son, but did not really give many ideas on how to do so. A few ideas, but not many. It did cite many studies and so forth, for example, kids enjoy a natural setting more than the typical blacktop playground. Also, it reminded me of ""Free Range Kids"", even though I have not read that book yet. Don't be scared to just let your kids go out and explore."

It needed a good editor to cut out the bits where the author was lamenting his lost youth or shaking his stick at those terrible young people who simply weren't interested in all of the things that he was interested in back in the day. The last section appeared to be a random stream of consciousness, which was particularly hard to get through. The important message about disconnection with nature was somewhat lost within all this, which was a shame. Don't waste time reading the book, go out and visit a park instead."

227,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6176855-stephanie,4,"Louv writes a fantastic perspective on the necessity of introducing our children to nature and to keep nature as essential part of childhood. It was quite comforting to read this book and know that all the time I have spent with my children in nature was quite worth every second. I plan on continuing and increasing the time that I require them to discover the outdoors. I loved the suggestions and proof that children need more time with nature, even during school hours, which is really what spoke to me.This book does get a bit long winded and could really be stellar without the last 4 chapters. I felt he could have incorporated them within the other chapters. I also completely skipped the chapter that discussed relating God to nature. As a pantheist, nature is my all. The section with book suggestions and also activities to do with your children or to encourage them to do on their own, was very helpful. Even if you don't read the rest of the book, those are worth reviewing.There are some parts that I disagreed with and I felt were quite preachy. Although Louv is writing to all generations, he is being pretty judgmental against the current generation of parents (who weren't parents when he wrote the book, but it miffed me a bit). I grew up in a small city, I didn't have a ton of nature in my life, but enough that it awed me. I wasn't interested in birding or animals really - but it did inspire me to incorporate that into my own children's lives - something that Louv is afraid that won't happen with my generation (because we are the first generation to have so much access to electronics). But he's sort of wrong there - I'm proof that isn't always true. The love my kids have had for nature has opened so many doors for me as an adult. I include them on my finds. For example: We see a huge bird outside, we look it up. We find a nest with eggs, we look up the eggs to find out what bird it is. I never had this sort of discovery as a child, but here I am influencing my children despite not having as much nature exposure as generations before me. Nature matters to me as an adult although it wasn't as important to me as a child. I was also shocked that although Louv talked about several Cooperative Extensions, he never talks about how 4H programs can provide much of the exposure he talks about - especially for city kids. Our county has a wonderful Cooperative that kids from the more populated areas can come to and work with animals and be out in Nature."
228,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45921206-sue,5,"I had to read this book over a long period of time, as it could be somewhat academic at times, but also very overwhelming and frightening at the loss of our natural habitats and our next generations disconnect from the natural world. I see this in my work every day; children who are in daycare sometimes from 7 am to 6 pm, who don't go outdoors for days at a time, with families who are ""afraid of bugs"" and paralyzed by the very thought (understandably and no pun intended) of tick born illnesses or of animal encounters. We are losing out narratives of how to read upcoming weather by the clouds, telling time by the sun, or predicting seasonal changes by the appearance of flora and fauna. The last paragraph of the book literally left me in tears (SPOILER ALERT) ""jason is a man now. He graduated from college last spring. Matthew has two years left of high school. I feel a sense of pride and relief that they have grown well, and a deep grief that my years as a parent of young children is over, except in memory. And I am thankful, the times I spent with my children in nature are among my most meaningful memories, and I hope theirs. We have such a brief opportunity to pass on to our children our love for this Earth and to retell our stories. These are the moments when the world is made whole.""Highly recommend this read to anyone who values nature, or doesn't realize how to.

Depending on your age, likely not. It was normal and expected for children to spend time outdoors in natural settings. However, our lives have changed and are a lot more stressful! We are so involved in buying into new technology....such as mobile lawn mowers you can control from across the country and all the latest internet games and movies available for the kids. Yet, everyone feels better when they spend time outdoors; health benefits are obvious. If you ask kids what books they have read (never mind what books they have taken outside and read while lying on the grass or taken along to go camping in the backyard), they most often will tell you about the fantastic movies they have watched. But when did your son or daughter ever just lie on the grass, and do nothing, maybe watch birds, animals or insects? What about just playing in the dirt? The common phrase "" I am bored."" is a request to use an Ipad or watch TV. The funniest phrase I heard was, ""Can I do anything that involves electricity?"" (The boy was limited to one hour daily with his Ipad and dared not ask for more time.) O course, present-day communities have changed. We are concerned with safety and rules which keep the children inside. Louv talks about the number of people moving into larger centers as one of the reasons fewer people get outdoors to enjoy nature. He would like to see a reversal of this scenario, where for example people can be encouraged to stay and maintain their farms. He talks about some projects in B.C, Canada where interesting developments have been attempted.You will find a wonderful chapter entitled ""100 Actions We Can Take"". Suggestions like ""adopting a tree"" are great ideas to inspire kids and families!Richard Louv has written several informative books urging parents and communities to try and change the nature deficit scenario. He reminds us that obesity, depression and attention deficit disorders are linked to nature deficit conditions. It is given! Spending time in the great outdoors can be a solution for us. It is important to try to make this a better world for the children."

One of those kids is taken by an inter-dimensional monster, which seems to also explain why children are not allowed to ride bikes in the woods anymore.You know those sky rocketing rates of anxiety, depression, and ADHD? Everyone has a theory what's messing with children, and Louv's is that it's a lack of time in the woods, which he calls ""nature deficit disorder."" Given that he is quite content to use Gardner's multiple intelligences theory, I decided to mostly ignore all psychological claims and took this as a book that argues being alone in the woods has become underrated. In other words, I rarely found the psychology convincing, even though I was sympathetic to the argument.There are some fine moments here, and I was most impressed by Louv's enthusiasm for just getting kids into the woods. Let them shoot a bb gun at seagulls, let them hunt, let them fish, let them catch crawdads down by the shore, let them touch turtles, let them pick up frogs, let them write unwitnessed sagas amongst trees. It seems like almost everyone who has a powerful, perhaps transcendental, experience in the woods does so in an unscripted way.This is a book about loss. But what have we lost? The woods are mostly removed from human habitats, as is unscripted time. I wonder if the two don't mostly go together.3.5."

Our children didn't enjoy the same freedom, imagination, healthy risk and strength that come along with unscheduled time in nature—whether it happens in woods or vacant lots. This book digs into all the cultural reasons for the one-generation shift, and the critical physical, mental and spiritual reasons to get our kids and grandkids out of virtual life and into the real. The book rambles, but the anecdotes, as much as the science, reaffirm what many of us already feel to be true."

243,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,3,"Pre-reviewJust want to jot down my thoughts about this book BEFORE actually reading it. This book is constantly cited in discussions about connecting people to nature (which is kind of my thing) , but I've avoided reading it b/c I've also gotten the impression that it's not based on any kind of reasonable evidence, and by reasonable I mean quantitative, peer-reviewed research, and that's a problem for me. But, as Constance pointed out to me, the fact that it has traction in my circles is reason enough to read it, I guess, if only to knowledgeably refute it or repackage its message when it comes up in discussion....and the reviewI think if you read this as an editorial and not as an attempt to present evidence supporting the thesis, the book is actually quite good, and relevant. If you are a parent and you haven't thought about the value of unstructured play in the outdoors, or you simply live in a largely man-made landscape, I suspect there's a lot to be gained by reading Louv's occasionally eloquent, always impassioned plea that kids need the freedom to explore and experience the non-human world on their own terms, as almost all children have until our current urban era, even if that world is a weedy abandoned lot. His collected anecdotes from kids and parents are beautiful, and resonant for those of us who grew up, as Louv and I did, with easy access to forests and streams and abundant time to explore them.What I wanted, though (what I always want, really), was evidence, which was generally lacking or unconvincing. Sometimes this was Louv's fault, e.g. single-observer descriptions of events (doesn't that break a fundamental rule of journalism?) [1], un-cited facts and figures [2], over-reliance on the work of a handful of academics [3], or worse, reports that did not undergo any form of peer review [4]. That being said, I'm pretty sure the underlying problem is that the concepts here are complicated and hard to reduce into forms of evidence I find persuasive, even when Louv did cite research (which he often did). What is nature, anyway? What is a ""connection"" to nature, and how does one operationalize it in such a way that one can study it? These are the kinds of issues that make social science hard and its findings maddeningly impossible to generalize, so it's difficult to fault a journalist like Louv for not providing evidence that is not only not there, but practically impossible to collect in the first place (not that it stops people from trying, though). Calling this ""scholarly"" or ""well-researched"" as the back cover blurbs do seems a bit extreme, though.So while I can't exactly thump my forefinger against this book and cry out, ""The proof is here, people!"", I think I can recommend it in the way I can recommend Pollan's books, as a thought-provoker and a conversation-starter. For me, the ideas presented aren't novel, so I found the lack of supporting evidence frustrating, but for those who've never considered this stuff, like I hadn't considered the source of my food before reading Omnivore's Dilemma, I think this one's worth reading.[1] Louv has this great anecdote on p. 27 about a neighborhood association in San Diego chasing away kids who were fishing in a pond and making bike trails in the woods b/c it violated housing association rules, but it's all based on one friend's testimony. Isn't this too good to go unverified?[2] E.g. ""Copious studies show a reduced amount of leisure time experienced by American families, more time in front of the TV and computer, and growing obesity among adults and children because of diet and sedentary lifestyles"" (p. 32). Totally without citation. ""new studies suggest that exposure to nature may reduce the symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder"" (p. 34), also without citation.[3] He cites a lot of different researchers, but relies heavily on Chawla and Sobel, both of whom seem like cool nature-loving people in their own right, but neither of whom seem to publish much in the scientific literature.[4] E.g.

244,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/542037-annalisa,4,"I really enjoyed this book. I found myself analyzing the way I interact with nature and the encouragement I give to my daughter to do the same. She's not really a play in the dirt kind of a girl and when she told me she was bored on a sunny afternoon a few weeks ago just after I started this book I told her to go outside and play. I looked out the window a few minutes later to see her lying in the grass reading and had to laugh that she wasn't technically playing outside. At least she was feeling the rays of sunshine and the grass on her back. I think I will forever have these concepts in my head and look for ways to bond more with nature and encourage my daughter to do the same. The basic concept of the book is that as human beings we are creatures of nature and need nature as part of our emotional, intellectual, and spiritual development. The generations before us have spent their childhoods outdoors exploring and learning, but because of factors like less land and more people (and the way land is developed with less natural open space), our litigious society, fear of predators and injury, overscheduling, and modern technology, our children do not have the same quality unstructured outdoor play. While we do not know all the effects this lack of nature will have in our children, it most likely affects their creativity, attention (ADHD), ability to soothe and cope, emotional and behavioral (problems arise from a disconnect with nature), and my favorite: their spiritual connection to the space they live in. There is something about lying on your back in the grass at night and watching the stars above and feeling both insignificantly small and significantly important. It's just good for kids to get their hands in the dirt and play, but nobody really does anymore. I always knew nature was important, but never stopped to think just how important it is to our lives. The majority of the book tells us all the reasons we need nature and the ways our society has gone wrong turning its back on nature, but I wish he had more answers for just how to do that. Building utopian societies that revolve around farming and that are more expensive to build just isn't feasible in this country. People just aren't interested in spending more for a system they don't see as broken. My neighborhood has small parks, but there isn't a lot of open exploring area, nor do I know where around here I could move that would give me that without giving up the sense of community I enjoy. My daughter's school does not have grass area but man-made surface area in the playground. There isn't much, if anything, I can do to get that changed, other than move and I am happy with the education she is receiving. While he does give options like cultivating a garden and giving your children more unstructured play, I wanted more solutions that I could do personally instead of grand gestures society on whole must do. I was left with a little bit of a feeling that America is losing its love for nature and this generation will grow up without any loyalty to it and nobody to protect it, but there isn't much that can be done about it without improbable rewiring of the way Americans think. I found his solutions far too optimistic and unrealistic to surpass the mountains he spent the first half of the book showing us need to be climbed for change. And the problems seem just as much to blame on the natural exponential growth in population than anything else. There may be a lot of undeveloped land in this country, but wide open spaces around everyone's home is not only not feasible but it's not many people's style. I am a city girl and have no interest in returning to a frontier lifestyle that he seems to idolize. While I have a healthy appreciation for nature and often like to ponder it and enjoy the small pleasures of walks or rain, I'm not the type of person who likes to be outdoors getting my hands dirty. I could spend days on end indoors and be perfectly happy. And I don't think there's anything wrong that. While I was a little dissatisfied with the lack of solution, I still think the problems addressed in his book both real and extremely important ones to address. Being aware of this trend toward nature deficiency is the first step to evoking change. In our own small ways in our communities and families everyone can find creative solutions for getting more nature time. I especially could be better about encouraging my daughter to spend time bonding with the earth from whence she came. It's healthy and it's important. And I think it's an issue everyone should be aware of so they too can be conscious of the ways they incorporate and protect nature."

I agree with the author that too many electronics will deprive you. Nature can restore you, refresh you, and bring sanity back to your family and life. It is vitally important in childhood to give a firm foundation of life and peace and this book inspired me to make sure my daughter gets plenty of outdoor playtime."
246,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65233712-danielle,1,"This book could have been condensed to a small blurb or article. The basic point is beat over your head for 300 pages. The author had an unfortunate way of writing too scholarly for leisure readers and not scholarly enough for scholars. There were many things I did not like about how this book was written. As many people have voiced the concept was a good one but the execution had much to be desired. I am saddened that I used this book for a nature center book club because most readers gave up 50 to 100 pages in due to boredom. This is saying a lot since our first months book was over 500 pages. I would not recommend to anyone, especially if they already understand that spending time outside is good for one's health."
247,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/917050-lynne,2,"I'm finding this book pretty tedious so far - he is preaching to the choir with me on this subject but it still feels like preaching. I'm looking forward to the second half, which I hope will spend more time on getting kids outside rather than all the reasons why we should and we don't....update since I wrote that part: it was due back to the library so I gave up on it after getting about 85% through. It never got much better for me, which is a shame because it's an important topic. It did make me a little more conscious about the time my child (and me for that matter) spends outdoors, and armed me with the knowledge that it may help with possible ADD or ""spirited child"" symtoms, not to mention general well being... but I could have read a pamphlet version for that. I recommend this book for anyone who isn't already convinced, or maybe for school administrators looking for tips on ways to deal with test-readiness centered parents and school boards or how to implement more nature based programming. I was waiting for him to get around to talking about 4-H however, which has been doing this for over 100 years and is still very avtive in all 50 states with not only rural but suburban and urban kids too. In full disclosure I work for 4-H, but I was honestly surprised that he left that out, except for a very brief mention of one child and her sheep project- especially while devoting a section (though it was a pretty dismissive one, which wasn't fair either) on scouting. Maybe 4-H was in the last part of the book that I didn't get to. Anyway my very modern, screen-loving urban kid is in both scouts and 4-H and trust me, they get outside. It just seems like a good example of how flawed this book is. One little nugget I took from it though: one parent's change in vocabulary from ""be careful"" to ""pay attention"" when her child is outdoors climbing rocks or something and needs to watch her footing or be aware of surroundings to stay safe - a simple but very significant difference in attitude toward nature that can empower a child and teach them to be smart, not to be afraid. I guess that was worth a little tedium."
248,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4697631-karen,5,"At the end of my 6th grade year, I found out my wonderful and extremely intelligent cousin was accepted into Zoo School! You may feel free to insert a bit of intense jealousy here! As a child with high-average intelligence I always desired to achieve placement into gifted programs but never quite make the cut although I was always confident that my level of motivation and work ethic would allow me to keep up with the pace. My dream school was not Zoo School but Blandford- another school that focused on outdoor education and learning in nature. Seeing as I did not live in the correct district, neither of these schools was ever an option for me but the desire was always there.In the book ""Last Child in the Woods"", Richard Louv discusses the benefits of getting children outdoors. In fact he carries on for 310 pages on why kids, and adults, should spend more time outside. There are chapters on mental health, creativity, science, and many more! Despite going on for 310 pages, I was still intrigued through the whole book. This work inspired me to get outside and, as an adult, I have seen incredible benefits. Things are not going my way these days and in one weekend I lost my childhood cat from cancer and my job. Setting aside time to spend outside daily has made the stress of finding a teaching position for next school year much easier. I'm happier and much more positive regarding the hunt for jobs when I make sure to put my work aside to get outside for at least an hour each day. No matter what I have on my plate, I go outside to ""play"". I really enjoyed reading this book and I think the content applies to the health of both adults and children!"
249,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/593578-christina,3,"I mostly read the middle, since I don't need to be convinced that significant exposure to the natural world is essential for kids, or that there is less of it today than there was a generation or two ago. The back of the book promised to provide ""solutions"" and I wanted to see what those would be.Lots of recommendations for what changes the author would like to see made to the school/education system (pre-k through college), to how we build our cities/towns, and to how our culture views the natural world. These are all bigger projects than I can take on, although I'm generally in favor of most of them and would enthusiastically support folks who wanted to be the energy behind making those changes happen.No, it's the small reminders for me. Let your kids have UNSTRUCTURED time in the natural world, wherever it is (the garden, the back forty, the wilderness). Be more enthusiastic about the natural world and less suspicious. Say ""Pay attention"" more often than ""Be careful."" Let the child lead the expedition some of the time. Teach general observation skills, from sitting still to watch a deer cross a meadow or a bird in the garden, to assessing the surroundings - slippery rocks, thin branches, venomous snakes, dangerous people. All this tends to inspire more desire to be a steward of nature than all the ""Save the Species"" segments in school, and it teaches useful skills that will be important all through life, in and out of traditional wildernesses."
250,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/771552-martha,5,"This is a must-read for everyone. Here's what I wrote in my yoga newsletter about it: The subtitle of this book is ‘Saving Our Children from Nature-Deficit Disorder’. The author explains that he is not proposing such a disorder exists, but admits that calling it such will help the average person to understand the gravity of the situation he writes about. His contention is that like the forgotten and all-to-often-relegated-to-near-zero-status arts such as dance, music and painting, nature has been demoted in importance to the severe detriment of our children’s health. He means emotional, intellectual and spiritual health as well as physical health. As a culture, we have lost our connection to nature, and think of it as an ‘extra’, or just a place to occasionally recreate. He has brought together cutting-edge studies to prove his point.I suggest you read this book to get a different perspective on the issues of vanishing forests, polluted waterways, and increased childhood obesity, violence and excessive anti-depressant drug prescriptions. At the back of his book, the author lists some ways we can bring the experience and appreciation of nature back into our lives. If we do not rebuild our connection to the earth, and develop appropriate respect for the power of nature, we are gambling with our future and that of our children."
251,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88622-brittany,5,"I loved this. I'm so inspired to spend more time with my kids outdoors, in the garden, and in natural places regularly. I'm still not completely convinced I should let my young children wander alone for hours, though there are a few chapters dedicated to overcoming parents' fears. (In fact, while the author deeply laments that children of this generation don't play in the woods all day unsupervised, he likes to keep his kids within view as well.) The author believes that spending time outdoors can be stress-relieving for children, treat ADHD, and most importantly build confidence and character. The book left me with the same sorts of feelings I had reading The Secret Garden as a child, watching Mary and Collin transform as they worked in the garden and watched it bloom before their eyes. I want this for my kids. Last Child in the Woods did get a little preachy at the end about preserving natural spaces and saving the environment, but I didn't mind because it seemed appropriate and followed the flow of the book. Again, I am completely inspired. I would like to own my own copy of this book for reference and reminder."

So much is taken for granted rather than supported with research or evidence, not least the author's assumption that his type of childhood (and mine) is ""normal"" and everything else—particularly an urban childhood—is a problematic deviation from that. So it was a struggle to read the whole book through that filter of elitism and, at times, what smacked of baby boomer self-aggrandizement. Which is a shame, because I really do agree with so much of this, and wanted to know there are better reasons for agreeing than merely wanting it to be true."

A few ideas, but not many. It did cite many studies and so forth, for example, kids enjoy a natural setting more than the typical blacktop playground.

It needed a good editor to cut out the bits where the author was lamenting his lost youth or shaking his stick at those terrible young people who simply weren't interested in all of the things that he was interested in back in the day. The last section appeared to be a random stream of consciousness, which was particularly hard to get through. The important message about disconnection with nature was somewhat lost within all this, which was a shame. Don't waste time reading the book, go out and visit a park instead."

It was quite comforting to read this book and know that all the time I have spent with my children in nature was quite worth every second. I plan on continuing and increasing the time that I require them to discover the outdoors. I loved the suggestions and proof that children need more time with nature, even during school hours, which is really what spoke to me.This book does get a bit long winded and could really be stellar without the last 4 chapters. I felt he could have incorporated them within the other chapters. I also completely skipped the chapter that discussed relating God to nature. As a pantheist, nature is my all. The section with book suggestions and also activities to do with your children or to encourage them to do on their own, was very helpful. Even if you don't read the rest of the book, those are worth reviewing.There are some parts that I disagreed with and I felt were quite preachy. Although Louv is writing to all generations, he is being pretty judgmental against the current generation of parents (who weren't parents when he wrote the book, but it miffed me a bit). I grew up in a small city, I didn't have a ton of nature in my life, but enough that it awed me. I wasn't interested in birding or animals really - but it did inspire me to incorporate that into my own children's lives - something that Louv is afraid that won't happen with my generation (because we are the first generation to have so much access to electronics). But he's sort of wrong there - I'm proof that isn't always true. The love my kids have had for nature has opened so many doors for me as an adult. I include them on my finds. For example: We see a huge bird outside, we look it up. We find a nest with eggs, we look up the eggs to find out what bird it is. I never had this sort of discovery as a child, but here I am influencing my children despite not having as much nature exposure as generations before me. Nature matters to me as an adult although it wasn't as important to me as a child. I was also shocked that although Louv talked about several Cooperative Extensions, he never talks about how 4H programs can provide much of the exposure he talks about - especially for city kids. Our county has a wonderful Cooperative that kids from the more populated areas can come to and work with animals and be out in Nature."

I see this in my work every day; children who are in daycare sometimes from 7 am to 6 pm, who don't go outdoors for days at a time, with families who are ""afraid of bugs"" and paralyzed by the very thought (understandably and no pun intended) of tick born illnesses or of animal encounters. We are losing out narratives of how to read upcoming weather by the clouds, telling time by the sun, or predicting seasonal changes by the appearance of flora and fauna. The last paragraph of the book literally left me in tears (SPOILER ALERT) ""jason is a man now. He graduated from college last spring. Matthew has two years left of high school. I feel a sense of pride and relief that they have grown well, and a deep grief that my years as a parent of young children is over, except in memory. And I am thankful, the times I spent with my children in nature are among my most meaningful memories, and I hope theirs. We have such a brief opportunity to pass on to our children our love for this Earth and to retell our stories.

Depending on your age, likely not. It was normal and expected for children to spend time outdoors in natural settings. However, our lives have changed and are a lot more stressful! We are so involved in buying into new technology....such as mobile lawn mowers you can control from across the country and all the latest internet games and movies available for the kids. Yet, everyone feels better when they spend time outdoors; health benefits are obvious. If you ask kids what books they have read (never mind what books they have taken outside and read while lying on the grass or taken along to go camping in the backyard), they most often will tell you about the fantastic movies they have watched. But when did your son or daughter ever just lie on the grass, and do nothing, maybe watch birds, animals or insects? What about just playing in the dirt? The common phrase "" I am bored."" is a request to use an Ipad or watch TV. The funniest phrase I heard was, ""Can I do anything that involves electricity?"" (The boy was limited to one hour daily with his Ipad and dared not ask for more time.) O course, present-day communities have changed. We are concerned with safety and rules which keep the children inside. Louv talks about the number of people moving into larger centers as one of the reasons fewer people get outdoors to enjoy nature. He would like to see a reversal of this scenario, where for example people can be encouraged to stay and maintain their farms. He talks about some projects in B.C, Canada where interesting developments have been attempted.You will find a wonderful chapter entitled ""100 Actions We Can Take"". Suggestions like ""adopting a tree"" are great ideas to inspire kids and families!Richard Louv has written several informative books urging parents and communities to try and change the nature deficit scenario. He reminds us that obesity, depression and attention deficit disorders are linked to nature deficit conditions. It is given! Spending time in the great outdoors can be a solution for us. It is important to try to make this a better world for the children."

One of those kids is taken by an inter-dimensional monster, which seems to also explain why children are not allowed to ride bikes in the woods anymore.You know those sky rocketing rates of anxiety, depression, and ADHD? Everyone has a theory what's messing with children, and Louv's is that it's a lack of time in the woods, which he calls ""nature deficit disorder."" Given that he is quite content to use Gardner's multiple intelligences theory, I decided to mostly ignore all psychological claims and took this as a book that argues being alone in the woods has become underrated. In other words, I rarely found the psychology convincing, even though I was sympathetic to the argument.There are some fine moments here, and I was most impressed by Louv's enthusiasm for just getting kids into the woods. Let them shoot a bb gun at seagulls, let them hunt, let them fish, let them catch crawdads down by the shore, let them touch turtles, let them pick up frogs, let them write unwitnessed sagas amongst trees. It seems like almost everyone who has a powerful, perhaps transcendental, experience in the woods does so in an unscripted way.This is a book about loss. But what have we lost? The woods are mostly removed from human habitats, as is unscripted time. I wonder if the two don't mostly go together.3.5."

Our children didn't enjoy the same freedom, imagination, healthy risk and strength that come along with unscheduled time in nature—whether it happens in woods or vacant lots. This book digs into all the cultural reasons for the one-generation shift, and the critical physical, mental and spiritual reasons to get our kids and grandkids out of virtual life and into the real. The book rambles, but the anecdotes, as much as the science, reaffirm what many of us already feel to be true."

273,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,3,"Pre-reviewJust want to jot down my thoughts about this book BEFORE actually reading it. This book is constantly cited in discussions about connecting people to nature (which is kind of my thing) , but I've avoided reading it b/c I've also gotten the impression that it's not based on any kind of reasonable evidence, and by reasonable I mean quantitative, peer-reviewed research, and that's a problem for me. But, as Constance pointed out to me, the fact that it has traction in my circles is reason enough to read it, I guess, if only to knowledgeably refute it or repackage its message when it comes up in discussion....and the reviewI think if you read this as an editorial and not as an attempt to present evidence supporting the thesis, the book is actually quite good, and relevant. If you are a parent and you haven't thought about the value of unstructured play in the outdoors, or you simply live in a largely man-made landscape, I suspect there's a lot to be gained by reading Louv's occasionally eloquent, always impassioned plea that kids need the freedom to explore and experience the non-human world on their own terms, as almost all children have until our current urban era, even if that world is a weedy abandoned lot. His collected anecdotes from kids and parents are beautiful, and resonant for those of us who grew up, as Louv and I did, with easy access to forests and streams and abundant time to explore them.What I wanted, though (what I always want, really), was evidence, which was generally lacking or unconvincing. Sometimes this was Louv's fault, e.g. single-observer descriptions of events (doesn't that break a fundamental rule of journalism?) [1], un-cited facts and figures [2], over-reliance on the work of a handful of academics [3], or worse, reports that did not undergo any form of peer review [4]. That being said, I'm pretty sure the underlying problem is that the concepts here are complicated and hard to reduce into forms of evidence I find persuasive, even when Louv did cite research (which he often did). What is nature, anyway? What is a ""connection"" to nature, and how does one operationalize it in such a way that one can study it? These are the kinds of issues that make social science hard and its findings maddeningly impossible to generalize, so it's difficult to fault a journalist like Louv for not providing evidence that is not only not there, but practically impossible to collect in the first place (not that it stops people from trying, though). Calling this ""scholarly"" or ""well-researched"" as the back cover blurbs do seems a bit extreme, though.So while I can't exactly thump my forefinger against this book and cry out, ""The proof is here, people!"", I think I can recommend it in the way I can recommend Pollan's books, as a thought-provoker and a conversation-starter. For me, the ideas presented aren't novel, so I found the lack of supporting evidence frustrating, but for those who've never considered this stuff, like I hadn't considered the source of my food before reading Omnivore's Dilemma, I think this one's worth reading.[1] Louv has this great anecdote on p. 27 about a neighborhood association in San Diego chasing away kids who were fishing in a pond and making bike trails in the woods b/c it violated housing association rules, but it's all based on one friend's testimony. Isn't this too good to go unverified?[2] E.g. ""Copious studies show a reduced amount of leisure time experienced by American families, more time in front of the TV and computer, and growing obesity among adults and children because of diet and sedentary lifestyles"" (p. 32). Totally without citation. ""new studies suggest that exposure to nature may reduce the symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder"" (p. 34), also without citation.[3] He cites a lot of different researchers, but relies heavily on Chawla and Sobel, both of whom seem like cool nature-loving people in their own right, but neither of whom seem to publish much in the scientific literature.[4] E.g.

274,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/542037-annalisa,4,"I really enjoyed this book. I found myself analyzing the way I interact with nature and the encouragement I give to my daughter to do the same. She's not really a play in the dirt kind of a girl and when she told me she was bored on a sunny afternoon a few weeks ago just after I started this book I told her to go outside and play. I looked out the window a few minutes later to see her lying in the grass reading and had to laugh that she wasn't technically playing outside. At least she was feeling the rays of sunshine and the grass on her back. I think I will forever have these concepts in my head and look for ways to bond more with nature and encourage my daughter to do the same. The basic concept of the book is that as human beings we are creatures of nature and need nature as part of our emotional, intellectual, and spiritual development. The generations before us have spent their childhoods outdoors exploring and learning, but because of factors like less land and more people (and the way land is developed with less natural open space), our litigious society, fear of predators and injury, overscheduling, and modern technology, our children do not have the same quality unstructured outdoor play. While we do not know all the effects this lack of nature will have in our children, it most likely affects their creativity, attention (ADHD), ability to soothe and cope, emotional and behavioral (problems arise from a disconnect with nature), and my favorite: their spiritual connection to the space they live in. There is something about lying on your back in the grass at night and watching the stars above and feeling both insignificantly small and significantly important. It's just good for kids to get their hands in the dirt and play, but nobody really does anymore. I always knew nature was important, but never stopped to think just how important it is to our lives. The majority of the book tells us all the reasons we need nature and the ways our society has gone wrong turning its back on nature, but I wish he had more answers for just how to do that. Building utopian societies that revolve around farming and that are more expensive to build just isn't feasible in this country. People just aren't interested in spending more for a system they don't see as broken. My neighborhood has small parks, but there isn't a lot of open exploring area, nor do I know where around here I could move that would give me that without giving up the sense of community I enjoy. My daughter's school does not have grass area but man-made surface area in the playground. There isn't much, if anything, I can do to get that changed, other than move and I am happy with the education she is receiving. While he does give options like cultivating a garden and giving your children more unstructured play, I wanted more solutions that I could do personally instead of grand gestures society on whole must do. I was left with a little bit of a feeling that America is losing its love for nature and this generation will grow up without any loyalty to it and nobody to protect it, but there isn't much that can be done about it without improbable rewiring of the way Americans think. I found his solutions far too optimistic and unrealistic to surpass the mountains he spent the first half of the book showing us need to be climbed for change. And the problems seem just as much to blame on the natural exponential growth in population than anything else. There may be a lot of undeveloped land in this country, but wide open spaces around everyone's home is not only not feasible but it's not many people's style. I am a city girl and have no interest in returning to a frontier lifestyle that he seems to idolize. While I have a healthy appreciation for nature and often like to ponder it and enjoy the small pleasures of walks or rain, I'm not the type of person who likes to be outdoors getting my hands dirty. I could spend days on end indoors and be perfectly happy. And I don't think there's anything wrong that. While I was a little dissatisfied with the lack of solution, I still think the problems addressed in his book both real and extremely important ones to address. Being aware of this trend toward nature deficiency is the first step to evoking change. In our own small ways in our communities and families everyone can find creative solutions for getting more nature time. I especially could be better about encouraging my daughter to spend time bonding with the earth from whence she came. It's healthy and it's important. And I think it's an issue everyone should be aware of so they too can be conscious of the ways they incorporate and protect nature."

I agree with the author that too many electronics will deprive you. Nature can restore you, refresh you, and bring sanity back to your family and life.

276,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65233712-danielle,1,"This book could have been condensed to a small blurb or article. The basic point is beat over your head for 300 pages. The author had an unfortunate way of writing too scholarly for leisure readers and not scholarly enough for scholars. There were many things I did not like about how this book was written. As many people have voiced the concept was a good one but the execution had much to be desired. I am saddened that I used this book for a nature center book club because most readers gave up 50 to 100 pages in due to boredom. This is saying a lot since our first months book was over 500 pages. I would not recommend to anyone, especially if they already understand that spending time outside is good for one's health."
277,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/917050-lynne,2,"I'm finding this book pretty tedious so far - he is preaching to the choir with me on this subject but it still feels like preaching. I'm looking forward to the second half, which I hope will spend more time on getting kids outside rather than all the reasons why we should and we don't....update since I wrote that part: it was due back to the library so I gave up on it after getting about 85% through. It never got much better for me, which is a shame because it's an important topic. It did make me a little more conscious about the time my child (and me for that matter) spends outdoors, and armed me with the knowledge that it may help with possible ADD or ""spirited child"" symtoms, not to mention general well being... but I could have read a pamphlet version for that. I recommend this book for anyone who isn't already convinced, or maybe for school administrators looking for tips on ways to deal with test-readiness centered parents and school boards or how to implement more nature based programming. I was waiting for him to get around to talking about 4-H however, which has been doing this for over 100 years and is still very avtive in all 50 states with not only rural but suburban and urban kids too. In full disclosure I work for 4-H, but I was honestly surprised that he left that out, except for a very brief mention of one child and her sheep project- especially while devoting a section (though it was a pretty dismissive one, which wasn't fair either) on scouting. Maybe 4-H was in the last part of the book that I didn't get to. Anyway my very modern, screen-loving urban kid is in both scouts and 4-H and trust me, they get outside. It just seems like a good example of how flawed this book is. One little nugget I took from it though: one parent's change in vocabulary from ""be careful"" to ""pay attention"" when her child is outdoors climbing rocks or something and needs to watch her footing or be aware of surroundings to stay safe - a simple but very significant difference in attitude toward nature that can empower a child and teach them to be smart, not to be afraid. I guess that was worth a little tedium."
278,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4697631-karen,5,"At the end of my 6th grade year, I found out my wonderful and extremely intelligent cousin was accepted into Zoo School! You may feel free to insert a bit of intense jealousy here! As a child with high-average intelligence I always desired to achieve placement into gifted programs but never quite make the cut although I was always confident that my level of motivation and work ethic would allow me to keep up with the pace. My dream school was not Zoo School but Blandford- another school that focused on outdoor education and learning in nature. Seeing as I did not live in the correct district, neither of these schools was ever an option for me but the desire was always there.In the book ""Last Child in the Woods"", Richard Louv discusses the benefits of getting children outdoors. In fact he carries on for 310 pages on why kids, and adults, should spend more time outside. There are chapters on mental health, creativity, science, and many more! Despite going on for 310 pages, I was still intrigued through the whole book. This work inspired me to get outside and, as an adult, I have seen incredible benefits. Things are not going my way these days and in one weekend I lost my childhood cat from cancer and my job. Setting aside time to spend outside daily has made the stress of finding a teaching position for next school year much easier. I'm happier and much more positive regarding the hunt for jobs when I make sure to put my work aside to get outside for at least an hour each day. No matter what I have on my plate, I go outside to ""play"". I really enjoyed reading this book and I think the content applies to the health of both adults and children!"
279,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/593578-christina,3,"I mostly read the middle, since I don't need to be convinced that significant exposure to the natural world is essential for kids, or that there is less of it today than there was a generation or two ago. The back of the book promised to provide ""solutions"" and I wanted to see what those would be.Lots of recommendations for what changes the author would like to see made to the school/education system (pre-k through college), to how we build our cities/towns, and to how our culture views the natural world. These are all bigger projects than I can take on, although I'm generally in favor of most of them and would enthusiastically support folks who wanted to be the energy behind making those changes happen.No, it's the small reminders for me. Let your kids have UNSTRUCTURED time in the natural world, wherever it is (the garden, the back forty, the wilderness). Be more enthusiastic about the natural world and less suspicious. Say ""Pay attention"" more often than ""Be careful."" Let the child lead the expedition some of the time. Teach general observation skills, from sitting still to watch a deer cross a meadow or a bird in the garden, to assessing the surroundings - slippery rocks, thin branches, venomous snakes, dangerous people. All this tends to inspire more desire to be a steward of nature than all the ""Save the Species"" segments in school, and it teaches useful skills that will be important all through life, in and out of traditional wildernesses."
280,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/771552-martha,5,"This is a must-read for everyone. Here's what I wrote in my yoga newsletter about it: The subtitle of this book is ‘Saving Our Children from Nature-Deficit Disorder’. The author explains that he is not proposing such a disorder exists, but admits that calling it such will help the average person to understand the gravity of the situation he writes about. His contention is that like the forgotten and all-to-often-relegated-to-near-zero-status arts such as dance, music and painting, nature has been demoted in importance to the severe detriment of our children’s health. He means emotional, intellectual and spiritual health as well as physical health. As a culture, we have lost our connection to nature, and think of it as an ‘extra’, or just a place to occasionally recreate. He has brought together cutting-edge studies to prove his point.I suggest you read this book to get a different perspective on the issues of vanishing forests, polluted waterways, and increased childhood obesity, violence and excessive anti-depressant drug prescriptions. At the back of his book, the author lists some ways we can bring the experience and appreciation of nature back into our lives. If we do not rebuild our connection to the earth, and develop appropriate respect for the power of nature, we are gambling with our future and that of our children."
281,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88622-brittany,5,"I loved this. I'm so inspired to spend more time with my kids outdoors, in the garden, and in natural places regularly. I'm still not completely convinced I should let my young children wander alone for hours, though there are a few chapters dedicated to overcoming parents' fears. (In fact, while the author deeply laments that children of this generation don't play in the woods all day unsupervised, he likes to keep his kids within view as well.) The author believes that spending time outdoors can be stress-relieving for children, treat ADHD, and most importantly build confidence and character. The book left me with the same sorts of feelings I had reading The Secret Garden as a child, watching Mary and Collin transform as they worked in the garden and watched it bloom before their eyes. I want this for my kids. Last Child in the Woods did get a little preachy at the end about preserving natural spaces and saving the environment, but I didn't mind because it seemed appropriate and followed the flow of the book.

So much is taken for granted rather than supported with research or evidence, not least the author's assumption that his type of childhood (and mine) is ""normal"" and everything else—particularly an urban childhood—is a problematic deviation from that. So it was a struggle to read the whole book through that filter of elitism and, at times, what smacked of baby boomer self-aggrandizement. Which is a shame, because I really do agree with so much of this, and wanted to know there are better reasons for agreeing than merely wanting it to be true."

A few ideas, but not many. It did cite many studies and so forth, for example, kids enjoy a natural setting more than the typical blacktop playground.

It needed a good editor to cut out the bits where the author was lamenting his lost youth or shaking his stick at those terrible young people who simply weren't interested in all of the things that he was interested in back in the day. The last section appeared to be a random stream of consciousness, which was particularly hard to get through.

It was quite comforting to read this book and know that all the time I have spent with my children in nature was quite worth every second. I plan on continuing and increasing the time that I require them to discover the outdoors. I loved the suggestions and proof that children need more time with nature, even during school hours, which is really what spoke to me.This book does get a bit long winded and could really be stellar without the last 4 chapters. I felt he could have incorporated them within the other chapters. I also completely skipped the chapter that discussed relating God to nature. As a pantheist, nature is my all. The section with book suggestions and also activities to do with your children or to encourage them to do on their own, was very helpful. Even if you don't read the rest of the book, those are worth reviewing.There are some parts that I disagreed with and I felt were quite preachy. Although Louv is writing to all generations, he is being pretty judgmental against the current generation of parents (who weren't parents when he wrote the book, but it miffed me a bit). I grew up in a small city, I didn't have a ton of nature in my life, but enough that it awed me. I wasn't interested in birding or animals really - but it did inspire me to incorporate that into my own children's lives - something that Louv is afraid that won't happen with my generation (because we are the first generation to have so much access to electronics). But he's sort of wrong there - I'm proof that isn't always true. The love my kids have had for nature has opened so many doors for me as an adult. I include them on my finds. For example: We see a huge bird outside, we look it up. We find a nest with eggs, we look up the eggs to find out what bird it is. I never had this sort of discovery as a child, but here I am influencing my children despite not having as much nature exposure as generations before me. Nature matters to me as an adult although it wasn't as important to me as a child. I was also shocked that although Louv talked about several Cooperative Extensions, he never talks about how 4H programs can provide much of the exposure he talks about - especially for city kids. Our county has a wonderful Cooperative that kids from the more populated areas can come to and work with animals and be out in Nature."

I see this in my work every day; children who are in daycare sometimes from 7 am to 6 pm, who don't go outdoors for days at a time, with families who are ""afraid of bugs"" and paralyzed by the very thought (understandably and no pun intended) of tick born illnesses or of animal encounters. We are losing out narratives of how to read upcoming weather by the clouds, telling time by the sun, or predicting seasonal changes by the appearance of flora and fauna. The last paragraph of the book literally left me in tears (SPOILER ALERT) ""jason is a man now. He graduated from college last spring. Matthew has two years left of high school. I feel a sense of pride and relief that they have grown well, and a deep grief that my years as a parent of young children is over, except in memory. And I am thankful, the times I spent with my children in nature are among my most meaningful memories, and I hope theirs. We have such a brief opportunity to pass on to our children our love for this Earth and to retell our stories. These are the moments when the world is made whole.""Highly recommend this read to anyone who values nature, or doesn't realize how to. Should be required reading for anyone entrusted to help raise a child up."

Depending on your age, likely not. It was normal and expected for children to spend time outdoors in natural settings. However, our lives have changed and are a lot more stressful! We are so involved in buying into new technology....such as mobile lawn mowers you can control from across the country and all the latest internet games and movies available for the kids. Yet, everyone feels better when they spend time outdoors; health benefits are obvious. If you ask kids what books they have read (never mind what books they have taken outside and read while lying on the grass or taken along to go camping in the backyard), they most often will tell you about the fantastic movies they have watched. But when did your son or daughter ever just lie on the grass, and do nothing, maybe watch birds, animals or insects? What about just playing in the dirt? The common phrase "" I am bored."" is a request to use an Ipad or watch TV. The funniest phrase I heard was, ""Can I do anything that involves electricity?"" (The boy was limited to one hour daily with his Ipad and dared not ask for more time.) O course, present-day communities have changed. We are concerned with safety and rules which keep the children inside. Louv talks about the number of people moving into larger centers as one of the reasons fewer people get outdoors to enjoy nature. He would like to see a reversal of this scenario, where for example people can be encouraged to stay and maintain their farms. He talks about some projects in B.C, Canada where interesting developments have been attempted.You will find a wonderful chapter entitled ""100 Actions We Can Take"". Suggestions like ""adopting a tree"" are great ideas to inspire kids and families!Richard Louv has written several informative books urging parents and communities to try and change the nature deficit scenario. He reminds us that obesity, depression and attention deficit disorders are linked to nature deficit conditions. It is given! Spending time in the great outdoors can be a solution for us. It is important to try to make this a better world for the children."

One of those kids is taken by an inter-dimensional monster, which seems to also explain why children are not allowed to ride bikes in the woods anymore.You know those sky rocketing rates of anxiety, depression, and ADHD? Everyone has a theory what's messing with children, and Louv's is that it's a lack of time in the woods, which he calls ""nature deficit disorder."" Given that he is quite content to use Gardner's multiple intelligences theory, I decided to mostly ignore all psychological claims and took this as a book that argues being alone in the woods has become underrated. In other words, I rarely found the psychology convincing, even though I was sympathetic to the argument.There are some fine moments here, and I was most impressed by Louv's enthusiasm for just getting kids into the woods. Let them shoot a bb gun at seagulls, let them hunt, let them fish, let them catch crawdads down by the shore, let them touch turtles, let them pick up frogs, let them write unwitnessed sagas amongst trees. It seems like almost everyone who has a powerful, perhaps transcendental, experience in the woods does so in an unscripted way.This is a book about loss. But what have we lost? The woods are mostly removed from human habitats, as is unscripted time. I wonder if the two don't mostly go together.3.5."
291,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4930559-julie,4,"I think most of my generation looks back fondly at our childhoods spent outdoors. Our children didn't enjoy the same freedom, imagination, healthy risk and strength that come along with unscheduled time in nature—whether it happens in woods or vacant lots. This book digs into all the cultural reasons for the one-generation shift, and the critical physical, mental and spiritual reasons to get our kids and grandkids out of virtual life and into the real. The book rambles, but the anecdotes, as much as the science, reaffirm what many of us already feel to be true."
292,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75233510-curtis-schmidt,5,An outstanding book that every parent should read. This book mirrors my philosophies of spending time in the great outdoors. It's going to be painful to see today's youth grow up staring at screens and texting their lives away. I only hope the increase in mental disorders isn't as bad as I fear it might be.
293,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5943303-rebecca,5,"Loved this book! I'd say it's a must read if you have children, are involved in the lives of children, or even just want future generations to care and be good stewards of the earth. Kids *need* immersive experiences in nature. It's so important for so many things including health: physical, emotional, mental, *and* spiritual."

Not sure if it felt dated or preachy or political but I struggled. Still, the next time I was outside I tried to see it with wonder, imagining myself as a child again."
295,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27849569-jacy,4,An excellent book about the importance of nature in childhood development and how we owe it to our kids to protect nature and their right to experience it. This book is one of the more optimistic works on environmentalism and the future; it will leave you feeling motivated and encouraged to make a better world for future generations. 
296,1565125223,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3935218-jill,4,"I liked it. I kept thinking about how to bring the natural world into my English clas, or my English class to the natural world. I felt that once Louv made his point, he just kept making it. I'll admit to skimming the last quarter. Even so, an inspiring and provocative read. "

Select one piece of this problem that you can impact positively, and act upon it. We will all thank you."
