There is no hard and absolute proof, and can't be with all the distance in time and space with our ansestors. Yes, many scientists, including paleoanthropologists and the like would go butt heads with me on this one. See, it's their job making their research 'proof-based and scientific and on...'. Still, one has to be realistic about things, including the veracity and interpretation and perceprion and the role of imagination in the research of things that are long since gone and erased by time.So... That taken into account, this piece of lit reads very thought-inducing. Loved it. As far back as the work of psychologist Kurt Goldstein in the early twentieth century, researchers have denied that there are language-exclusive cognitive disorders. The absence of such disorders would seem to suggest that language emerges from the individual and not merely from language-specific regions of the brain. And this in turn supports the claim that language is not a relatively recent development, say 50–100,000 years old, possessed exclusively by Homo sapiens. My research suggests that language began with Homo erectus more than one million years ago, and has existed for 60,000 generations.Homo sapiens means ‘wise man’, and suggests, erroneously as we see, that modern humans (we are all Homo sapiens) are the only wise or intelligent humans. We are almost certainly the smartest. But we are not the only smart humans who ever lived.Erectus also invented the other pillar of human cognition: culture. Who we are today was partially forged by the intelligence, travels, trials and strength of Homo erectus. This is worth stating because too many sapiens fail to reflect on the importance of earlier humans to who we are today.Languages’ similarities are not rooted in a special genetics for language. They follow from culture and common information-processing solutions and have their own individual evolutionary stories.But each language satisfies the human need to communicate. While many people in today’s world are tempted to spend more time on social media than perhaps they should, it is the pull of linguistic intercourse that is mainly driving them there. No matter how busy some are, it is hard for them to avoid entering into some ‘conversation’ on the screen in front of them to opine on issues about which they often know little and care less.Language is the handmaiden of culture.But what is an invention? It is a creation of culture. Edison alone did not invent the light bulb; he needed Franklin’s work in electricity nearly 200 years before him. No one person invents anything. Everyone is part of a culture and part of each other’s creativity, ideas, earlier attempts and the general world of knowledge in which they live. Every invention is built up over time, bit by bit. Language is no exception.Conversations are the apex of linguistic studies and sources of insight particularly because they are potentially open-ended in meaning and form. They are also crucial to understanding the nature of language because of their ‘underdeterminacy’ – saying less than what is intended to be communicated and leaving the unspoken assumptions to be figured out by the hearer in some way. Underdeterminacy has always been part of language.Based on the evidence of Homo erectus culture, such as their tools, houses, village spatial organisation and ocean travel to imagined lands beyond the horizon, the genus Homo has been talking for some 60,000 generations – quite possibly more than one and a half million yearsUnderdeterminacy means that every utterance in every conversation and every line in every novel and each sentence of any speech contains ‘blank spots’ – unspoken, assumed knowledge, values, roles and emotions – underdetermined content that I label ‘dark matter’.Language can never be understood entirely without a shared, internalised set of values, social structures and knowledge relationships. In these shared cultural and psychological components, language filters what is communicated, guiding a hearer’s interpretations of what another is saying.One proposal I discard is arguably the most influential explanation of the origin of human language of all time. This is the idea that language resulted from a single genetic mutation some 50–100,000 years ago. This mutation supposedly enabled Homo sapiens to build complex sentences. This is the set of ideas known as universal grammar. But a very different hypothesis emerges from a careful examination of the evidence for the biological and cultural evolution of our species, namely the sign progression theory of language origin. The evidence shows that there was no ‘sudden leap’ to the uniquely human features of language, but that our predecessor species in the genus Homo and earlier, perhaps among the australopithecines, slowly but surely progressed until humans achieved language. This slow march taken by early hominins resulted eventually in a yawning evolutionary chasm between human language and other animal communication. Language is a gestalt – the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. That is to say, the whole is not understood merely by examining its individual components."
1,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"As someone with an interest in both science and language, How Language Began seemed an ideal combination - which managed to intrigue and disappoint me in equal measures.Let's get that disappointment out the way first, as it's hardly the fault of Daniel Everett. This isn't really science (and so the title of the book is rather misleading, but I suppose 'One possibility for how language began' wouldn't be as punchy). It's hard to see how this could be science. Our ideas on the exact detail of hominin/hominid development aren't 100 percent clear - how much more vague are we inevitably about something that leaves no direct traces whatsoever: the beginnings of language? Because there is so little evidence to base arguments on, what we end up with is far more like a philosophical debate than modern science. Ancient Greek philosophers would have been totally comfortable with this battle of ideas with very limited recourse to data (and would also have been very familiar with the feel of Everett's barbed attacks on Noam Chomsky). I shouldn't have expected anything different - but it was still a disappointment.Given that proviso, there is a lot to like. Everett does make very impressive arguments for the early nature of language, gives those of us not familiar with the field a strong introduction to the likes of indexes (not the familiar meaning), icons (ditto to some extent) and symbols and makes it feel very likely that language was not a sudden genetic switch-on, but a gradual accretion. He also seems very convincing when telling us that the primary role of language is communication. This probably seems a common sense observation, but contrasts sharply with the strongly held hypothesis that it emerged as a tool for thinking, leaving communication as a secondary use.Best of all is when Everett gives us examples from his experience of working in the Amazonian jungles of Brazil, using the different approaches to spoken language there to try to tease out truths about the development of language in general. Both Everett's writing style and the reader interest spring to life during these segments. He is also good at showing how language is more than words - gesture, for example, playing an important part.Elsewhere in How Language Began there is a degree of repetition - the book doesn't seem ideally structured, and covers some secondary topics at too great a length. And given the philosophical cut and thrust that is clearly present in the field, I would rather have seen a neutral bringing together and comparison of the different viewpoints, rather than a very one-sided view that gives us the opposition's position only in order to pull it apart, without giving the opposing arguments any substance.Overall, then, an interesting venture into a fascinating topic, but one that left me feeling a little frustrated."

Dan EverettThat is why it was called Babel – because there the Lord confused the language of the whole world. From there the Lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth.Genesis 11:9Our human ancestors Homo Erectus invented language and culture. We, Homo Sapiens have just made them better.We are the crown of creationHumans have become, for better or worse, lords of the planet. If the dinosaurs were still alive today, humans would kill them for trophies, or eat them, or put them in parks and zoos. They would be no match for sapiens. Humans, not they, are the apex predators of all time on this planet. This success has much to do with the fact that, though sapiens are small with soft skin, no claws or serious strength, they talk to each other. Because humans can talk they can plan, they can share knowledge, they can even leave knowledge for future generations. And therein lies the human advantage over all other terrestrial species.If Africa had all we needed, then why did we leave?Initially erectus and other Homo species were hunters and gatherers. As such, they needed to move frequently as they exhausted the edible flora and fauna of a given region in a relatively short period of time. Hunter-gatherers usually move a bit further each day from their original village. They may sometimes return to an established camp, but as food becomes ever scarcer in the area surrounding the original village, hunter-gatherers move to establish new settlements closer to their fresher sources of proteins and plant foods.The average forager travels just over nine miles (fifteen kilometres) per day. Assume that they move communities around four times per year and that each new village is a day’s foraging from the last village. That is thirty-seven miles (sixty kilometres) per year. How long, at that rate, would it take an erectus community to travel from Africa to Beijing or Indonesia, both locations where erectus fossils were found? Well, if one divides 10,000 kilometres (roughly the distance from East Africa to where erectus fossils have been found in China) by sixty (the number of kilometres erectus would, under my extremely conservative calculation, move in a year), then it would take only 167 years for erectus to traverse Eurasia, moving at a normal pace. But if erectus populations had other reasons to travel, such as to escape hostile neighbours or climatic events such as flood or drought, they might have moved even more quickly, potentially reducing the time needed in the extreme case to as little as a year. Likewise, if they moved more slowly due to, say, the discovery of rich food supplies in a place along their route, then a larger period of time would elapse. It was, in any case, easily within the grasp of erectus to settle large regions of the world within only a thousand years, a trivial amount of time from an evolutionary perspective.Language can be so very simple and yet convey a great deal of meaningNewspaper headlines, store regulations, movie titles and other unusual forms of modern language are occasionally reminders of how simple language can be. There are some famous examples of languages reminiscent of possible early languages in the movies:You Jane. Me Tarzan.Eat. Drink. Man. Woman.And in store signs:No shirt. No shoes. No service.No ticket. No wash.These examples can even be found on billboards: You drink. You drive. You go to jail.In spite of their grammatical simplicity, we understand these examples just fine.We owe our modern life to our ancestorsErectus societies had culture. From the very first, humans, with their larger brains and new experiences, built up values, knowledge and social roles that allowed them to wander the earth, sail the seas and build the first communities in the history of the earth. And from these cultures built more than 60,000 generations ago we emerged. Our debt to Homo erectus is inestimable. They were not cavemen. They were men, women and children, the first humans to speak and to live in culturally linked communities.Each human alive enjoys their grammar and society because of the work, the discoveries and the intelligence of Homo erectus. Natural selection took those things that were most effective for human survival and improved the species until today humans live in the Age of Innovation, the Era of Culture, in the Kingdom of Speech.Enjoy!"

Could not finish it (and that is rare for me).The Author has a habit of making broad generalized claims without backing them up. For example he dismisses Wernicke's area and Broca's area as not functioning on language by simply saying ""they don't"" and then going on to a vague statement attributed to ""several researchers ..."". He says ""the brain does not appear to be organized into separate modules"" without explaining why there is a cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and many other named parts of the brain. And he simply brushes away centuries of evidence of how various parts of the brain work. He is either completely wrong, or he is writing in such a style as to be completely incoherent. When reading, you need to trudge through statements like ""It is always best to consider learning as the reason for any information found in any part of the brain."" Well, duh! The verb ""learning"" is literally defined as the way that information is collected in the brain.Many statements like this appear: ""Language, as we have been seeing, is not that difficult, in spite of a long tradition going back to the 1950's telling us that it is extremely complicated, a veritable mystery."" No, he had not demonstrated that language was easy. The fact that nobody, not even the author, agrees on a clear simply theory of language is all we need to know that this statement random gibberish. One star or two stars? One star means the book is wrong or harmful. That might be the case for this, but it is more likely that there is a hint of truth, but it is too poorly organized and too badly written to get the idea across. So two stars it is. Don't bother reading this unfortunate collection of random, unguided statements. "
4,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1414282-peter-bradley,5,"Please give my Amazon review a helpful vote - https://www.amazon.com/gp/review/R2B0...How Language Began by Daniel L. EverettControversial and revisionist are two words that came to my mind while reading this book.I can't claim any deep specialty in this area but I've read a few books on the subject of linguistics and thought I was keeping abreast of the subject. I thought that Noam Chomsky was widely accepted as setting the benchmark for linguistic study and that the idea that language developed as a result of a genetic mutation in the last 50,000 years was equally accepted. Likewise, I read Steven Pinker's ""The Language Instinct"" and I was sold on the notion that the human brain has a component for handling language.Daniel L. Everett's book ""How Language Began"" challenges those complacent beliefs. Everett comes across as a one-man wrecking crew to set things straight. Everett sets forth his thesis in the preface:""The story of how humans came to have language is a mostly untold one, full of invention and discovery, and the conclusions that I come to through that story have a long pedigree in the sciences related to language evolution – anthropology, linguistics, cognitive science, palaeoneurology, archaeology, biology, neuroscience and primatology. Like any scientist, however, my interpretations are informed by my background, which in this case are my forty years of field research on languages and cultures of North, Central and South America, especially with hunter-gatherers of the Brazilian Amazon. As in my latest monograph on the intersection of psychology and culture, Dark Matter of the Mind: The Culturally Articulated Unconscious, I deny here that language is an instinct of any kind, as I also deny that it is innate, or inborn.As far back as the work of psychologist Kurt Goldstein in the early twentieth century, researchers have denied that there are language-exclusive cognitive disorders. The absence of such disorders would seem to suggest that language emerges from the individual and not merely from language-specific regions of the brain. And this in turn supports the claim that language is not a relatively recent development, say 50–100,000 years old, possessed exclusively by Homo sapiens. My research suggests that language began with Homo erectus more than one million years ago, and has existed for 60,000 generations.As such, the hero of this story is Homo erectus, upright man, the most intelligent creature that had ever existed until that time. Erectus was the pioneer of language, culture, human migration and adventure. Around three-quarters of a million years before Homo erectus transmogrified into Homo sapiens, their communities sailed almost two hundred miles (320 kilometres) across open ocean and walked nearly the entire world. Erectus communities invented symbols and language, the sort that wouldn’t seem out of place today. Although their languages differed from modern languages in the quantity of their grammatical tools, they were human languages.Of course, as generations came and went, Homo sapiens unsurprisingly improved on what erectus had done, but there are languages still spoken today that are reminiscent of the first ever spoken, and they are not inferior to other modern languages.""Everett argues his thesis in great detail, which results in this book being a soup to nuts survey of linguistics, running from anthropology to historical linguistics to the mechanics of how words are formed by the human vocal apparatus.Everett's position on Homo Erectus is both interesting and idiosyncratic. Everett argues cogently that H. Erectus must have had speech capabilities in order to accomplish the things that they accomplished, particularly building sea going vessels capable of taking their species to offshore islands beyond the site of land. Everett also discounts the trustworthiness of scholarship that identifies other homo species:""According to some classifications, there were, soon after and before erectus, other species of Homo co-existing or existing in close succession – Homo habilis, Homo ergaster, Homo heidelbergensis, Homo rudolfensis among others. But, again, most of these various species of Homo are ignored here, with the focus kept on Homo erectus, Homo neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens. Most other Homo species are murky, maybe nothing more than variants of Homo erectus. However, the story of human language evolution changes in no significant way, whether erectus and ergaster were the same or different species.""Homo Sapien is simply an improved model of Homo Erectus.Everett offers this on the sophistication of Erectus:""This view of human cooperation in erectus is strongly supported by the archaeological record. As erectus wandered through the Levant, near the Jordan between the Dead Sea to the south and the Hula Valley to the north, they came to stop at the site known today as Gesher Benot Ya’aqov. At this site, going back at least 790,000 years, there is evidence for Acheulean tools, Levallois tools, evidence of controlled fire, organised village life, huts that housed socially specialised tasks of different kinds and other evidence of culture among Homo erectus. Erectus may have stopped here on the way out of Africa. Erectus technology was impressive. They built villages that manifested what almost appears to be central planning, or at least gradual construction under social guidance, as in Gesher Benot Ya’aqov. This is clear evidence of cultural values, organised knowledge and social roles. But such villages are just one example of erectus’s technological and organisational innovation.""I didn't know that.Communication exists in sub-homo species. Non-humans use indexes and icons, non-arbitrary referents that mean one thing only. Humans use symbols. For Everett, the human achievement was a brain capable of using symbols and engaging in recursive thinking. Language is not a product of the wiring of the brain any more than a hammer is; both language and a hammer are inventions or tools of the human mind. Everett notes:""A startling conclusion emerges from deficits affecting language: There are no language-only hereditary disorders. And the reason for that is predicted by the theory of language evolution here – namely that there could not be such a deficit because there is no language-specific part of the brain. Language is an invention. The brain is no more specialised for language than for toolmaking, though over time both have affected the development of the brain in general ways that make it more supportive of these tasks.""This insight comes after a long discussion of the kinds of ways that things can go wrong in the human ability to talk. Everett's point is well-made. We don't say that a hammer must be ""wired"" into the brain because someone without thumbs can't use one. There is no genetic condition that effects language - no one is born without an ability to comprehend verbs except insofar as they can also not comprehend nouns and prepositions. Likewise, as a practicing Linguist, Everett has seen far too many grammars to accept the notion that there is a universal language.For readers of anthropology and linguistics this is a very useful work because it shows how much is still open to debate. I think that for someone looking for a survey of linguistics this is a helpful and interesting book. If you are like me and are intrigued by the ""gosh-wow!"" ideas of ""deep history"" and ""human evolution,"" this book is well-worth the investment.On the other hand, it is not particularly written for the lay reader. Everett spins off idea after idea and the reader has to stay on his toes to keep up. Also, there is a lot of dense and dry material. For example, the chapters on the mechanics of language are important (and I found them interesting insofar as Everett shared his personal experiences in the field), but I found my enthusiasm for the subject lagging at times. I suspect that for others with less background, these are chapters that can and will be skipped.Obviously, on the whole, I found Everett's thesis captivating and his arguments cogent.PSB"
5,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,3,"This is such a frustrating book.Everett has a lot to say, that's of interest, about the history of human language, and makes an interesting, and to me persuasive, case that language goes back to Homo erectus, if not further. One thing he points to, hardly the only one, is the H. erectus population on the the island of Flores. They must at some point have arrived in numbers sufficient to establish a viable population, which would mean a minimum of fifty men, women, and children arriving together or in close succession. This isn't likely with accidental rafting. It suggests more sophisticated skills, to build craft capable of crossing that distance in sufficient numbers intentionally--which would probably require language.He's also quite, quite certain that language is an invention, not an instinct. If you think otherwise, you are wrong. Completely wrong. Oh, and he really thinks Noam Chomsky is completely wrong, and doesn't seem to concede him any significant contributions on the subject of language at all.Chomsky in 1957 published Syntactic Structures, arguing that human language flows from an innate instinct, a universal grammar at the base of how humans think. An important part of his argument is that since only humans have language, it must have emerged fairly recently, due to a single mutation, perhaps 50,000 years ago. There's more to his theory, including the idea that universal grammar didn't develop for the purpose of communication, but instead was originally used to facilitate complex human thought, with language a later effect.That's not remotely a complete explanation of Chomsky's theory, but it's a good-enough starting point for a review of Everett's book. Everett says, not quite in so many words, that Chomsky is an ignorant fool. Language is obviously an invention, not an instinct, not a mutation, and he has demonstrated this by...as far as I can tell, by asserting it repeatedly.That's very sad, because there are some obvious weaknesses to Chomsky's theory, starting with the fact that complex features are essentially never the result of a single mutation. This involves a far greater knowledge of genetics than we had in 1957, of course, but it's not surprising that sixty years of research result in some significant damage to a theory grounded in areas we had not yet made major progress in.It seems far more likely, in light of what we now know, that language emerged more gradually, as mutations, and natural and sexual selection among the natural variations in genus homo, led to the development of language.Unfortunately, Everett rejects that, too.Language, he says, is just a straight-up brilliant invention, coming straight from the clever brains of Homo erectus, or Homo habilis, or Homo ergaster, or possibly even Australopithecus afarensis, whoever came up with it first. Also, there was never any proto-language. The very first language was fully functional, able to do everything its users might need language to do.Because every brilliant invention is perfect when first invented, right? That's normal, isn't it?Everett also says there are no inherited language defects, which there ought to be if language is an instinct, written in the genes, rather than an invention. This would be persuasive, if true. Alas, other scientists seem to disagree, finding genetics-based language impairment not common, but nevertheless real. Here's a link to one example of a scientific paper discussing it. Full text is pricey, but if interested, your public library may be able to help you. Genetics of Speech and Language Disorders Changsoo Kang and Dennis Drayna Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics 2011 12:1, 145-164https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs...There's also the awkward fact that every human population, no matter how isolated, has language. Why is this awkward? Because things invented in one place, don't automatically spread to other populations the inventors' population isn't in contact with. Every culture has language. Not every culture invented written language, even though it's incredibly useful, once you have spoken language and a moderately complex culture. Invention of an alphabetic-style written language is even rarer.And the wheel appears to have been invented once, in Sumeria, and spread from there. There's one exception; ancient Mexicans, but no other New World cultures, did invent wheels--and use them only in what appear to have been either toys or cult objects. Yet these were advanced, complex, sophisticated cultures, arguably more complex and advanced than the Spanish who arrived to conquer them. It wasn't lack of brains or sophistication that kept wheels as a useful concept from being invented in the New World.So, why does everyone have language?Why do two children, kept in isolation from anyone who speaks to them during the entire period they should be acquiring language, invariably emerge from that abuse speaking their own language? Why do twins not kept in that kind of extreme isolation not uncommonly develop their own ""secret"" language, separate from the one they use with adults around them?Humans in contact with other humans develop language. It doesn't matter how sophisticated or complex their culture is otherwise. Humans speak to each other. If they're deaf, if there's more than one deaf child even if there's no one around who teaches them sign language, they create their own sign language. It's universal. It's how humans in contact with other humans behave.It's innate.It's also quite obviously for communication, another way Chomsky appears to be wrong, so one would think Everett wouldn't need to pound so incoherently on Chomsky rather than more calmly discussing the specifics.This is an interesting book. I find I've not touched nearly enough on the aspects that I like, or that I found persuasive. Yet the weaknesses are important, and also interesting.If interested in the topic, I recommend giving it a try.I bought this audiobook."

7,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1394552-keith-akers,4,"This is an interesting and convincing book on the invention of language. There are several surprises in this book. First of all, language existed prior to homo sapiens, specifically in homo erectus. Secondly, what language requires, more than anything else, is culture; and homo erectus clearly had culture. Grammar is helpful but comes along later. This book is a bit technical and is not exactly ""light summer reading."" However, it is clearly written and interesting and does not require special technical training to get the basic points. If I read it again I'd probably understand more, but it was clear enough to see that he has some very relevant points.Many of the things we think of as required for language, such as a voice box and a bigger brain, are not actually required. They evolved after language developed. The reason is that language was such a powerful tool, that those creatures who were best able to communicate had a powerful means of surviving and reproducing. Language is much more effective with a larger brain and a voice box, ergo, these evolved when some creatures had slightly bigger brains or the ability to express (and understand) what their fellow creatures were trying to say in a more nuanced way. Grammar is very useful for language but comes along after we have indexes, icons, signs and symbols. The author explains the distinction between these, and the various controversies over where exactly grammar evolved in the process of language development. Though Everett doesn't discuss this in any depth, it's clearly possible that animals (meaning non-humans) would have language, just because Homo erectus had language. Communication can exist without language, animals do that all the time. If Koko the gorilla (whom Everett briefly discusses), who understands human sign language, were to teach other gorillas sign language (and if we don't totally wipe out their habitat), it's possible that gorillas could have a culture and that this would carry some evolutionary advantages to those gorillas who could master it. Gorilla evolution might then take a completely different path, in which cultural understanding could in some cases replace the instincts on which many animals rely for survival, and gorillas might evolve in somewhat the same way that to be able to better understand language. It's conceivable that they might evolve, for example, to be more nimble and flexible with their hands (the better to be able to sign with, for example), rather than evolve a voice box, but a bigger brain would seem to be indispensable for communicating better with other gorillas. Those interested in what makes humans ""different"" from animals, or what it means to be human, will be intrigued by this somewhat technical but quite comprehensible book. "

The author assumes the reader to know exactly nothing at all about evolution and so tells us all about evolutionary theory that we already know even though we came here to learn about language. 2. While it is overly simplistic, it is also too academic and seems to be citing everybody's work without actually saying anything. 3. I read the entire book and am still not sure what is new in here or even what the author thinks is new. 4. It needed some seriously heaving editing and revising. "

By showing that culture, symbols and language go together and that we have archaeological evidence of culture in several locations inhabited by H. erectus, the author makes a persuasive argument for at least a G1 level language (simple word strings). He also discusses the recent evidence for dispersal of H. erectus from Africa across much of Europe and Asia and to islands that could only be reached by some sort of vessel. There is also much information on the brain and physical side of language development. When I picked this book up from a library display, I expected an update on the debate about whether proto-Indo-European languages were brought to western Europe by Beaker Folk or Celts. This was much more fun to read and the author's bibliography enables me to follow up on several relevant sites."
11,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4696922-ushan,1,"I have lived in an English-speaking country for 29 years, from age 16 on. As soon as I open my mouth, people ask me where I am from. I was exposed to Ukrainian in early childhood, and have studied it as a school subject, but almost never used it in conversation. Yet even if I have an accent in the language, it is slight. My daughter knew no English until age 3, when she went to an American preschool, and came back singing ""Do you know the muffin man?""; she never had an accent in English since. She also does not have an accent in Russian, although expressing complicated thoughts in it is difficult for her. These facts alone tell me that language is not like any other skill; not like programming, not like operating machinery. Learning one's native languages (someone like Justin Trudeau or my daughter has more than one) from around age two until around age ten is like learning to walk around age one, or developing a sexuality during puberty: it is something necessary for the normal development of a human being, which happens to all healthy humans at a certain age. It is an instinct.Everett is an anti-Chomskyan linguist who denies that language is an instinct. There doesn't seem to be any area of the brain used only for language. Given how little we know about how the brain operates, I don't think that this proves anything. Everett thinks that Homo erectus had language: skeletons of archaic humans were found on islands that could only be reached by rafts, and building such a raft required cooperation and therefore language. Many species of animals colonize islands by hitching a ride on a floating raft of uprooted vegetation; why not archaic humans? Everett also thinks that early language must have been exceptionally simple, like Piraha, an Amazonian Indian language he studied.

Written in the style of a newspaper feature article, this book is just as disposable as your daily tabloid, but with less useful alternative uses.Anybody picking this book up would be forgiven for thinking that D.Everett was a 21st century prophet, with selected praise including ""A book whose importance is almost impossible to overstate"" and ""Revelatory"".The author begins by giving a fat middle finger to John 1:1 and next cites the Watchmaker analogy as a frequent used argument for a creator deity. At many points raspberries are blown by D.Everett at the dunce of the class, who in his opinion is religion. Unfortunately, this arrogance coupled with a poor style of writing, means you'll soon find this for a pound in your local charity shop. Ironically, he makes the point that ""Underdeterminacy has always been a part of language"", which has the effect of tying his shoelaces together before trying to cross the road. There is a bizarre lack of understanding amongst many modern scientists about the historical and scholarly interpretation of God the creator which is summarised in John 1:1. An analysis of religious scripture using the best language hominins have created; mathematical logic, would be revelatory for the author, but would negate a large chunk of this which is just page filler. Any study in the evolution of the abstract languages of Mathematics have been excluded, possibly because they arise out of the natural objectification of our natural world, but develop into a method of transcending it. This is something the author seems opposed to accepting, poetic religious scripture that goes beyond being and non-being, is rebuked glibly."

14,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17653261-bart-jr,5,"How Language Began by Daniel Everett How Language Began is an excellent exposition of the possible manner in which language originated. Many linguists believe that the explosion of symbolic art and other artifacts, traced to times between 40,000 and 100,000 years ago, signaled the rise of language. The author of How Language Began, Daniel Everett, contrary to this hypothesis, situates the origin of language some 2 million years earlier, in the time of Homo erectus.He argues that Homo erectus had tools, sailed to far lands, had symbolic thought, and what he calls G1 language. He divides language into the usual categories of linguistics: semantics, the study of meaning; syntax, pragmatics, phonology, discourse conversational principles, and information and gestures; though he stresses that the study of the whole is always more than that of the parts. Language is a gestalt, says Everett, and not innate but an invention. He stipulates that language must always be studied in the context of the culture in which it is used and spends time outlining the mountain of unspoken knowledge that is implicit in any conversation.He follows Charles Peirce in his study of signs, dividing them into iconic use, indexical use, and finally, symbolic use. Interestingly, however, he departs from Peirce in believing that indexical use is more basic than iconic. Indexical signs are those that generally occur together, like tracks and the creatures that made them, or smoke and fire.Following Deacon’s study, I believe he is incorrect here. Iconicity, as outlined by Peirce and expanded by Deacon, is the basic way that we humans, and other animals, categorize. Iconicity is based upon resemblance, the discussion of which Everett limits mainly to man-made artifacts or coincidence. He hardly mentions categorization at all, though it is the way that all organisms classify food, objects, and threats to survive in their environments. Categorizing a bear as a bear because you have seen one before, and are familiar with how they act, the threat they present, allows you to respond in the best manner, be it fleeing or moving your car. So, in my opinion, categorization comes before learning by association, as with indexical signs. Actually, the indexical elements are usually recognized because they resemble (are iconic) to those seen prior.And although the divisions of language are classic divisions of linguistic study, my personal opinion is that meaning is the most important aspect of that study, and that it underlies all of the other aspects. We study them because they shed light in one way or another upon the meaning of our utterances.Everett mounts a convincing argument that language did not develop from gesture, as full-blown sign language would likely have hindered the development of speech. Why develop competing speech if sign language already works for you? But my belief is that gesture probably was very important to Homo erectus, and preceded speech, with speech possibly coming much later.Everett thinks that tool use and marine navigation indicate the presence of symbolic thought. They certainly could, but objects in the environment can and do have meaning for most creatures without involving symbolic thought. Tools certainly do have meaning for those who make and use them. They likely do bring hunting and other associations to mind.But is that truly symbolic thought in the systemic sense necessary for language?Perhaps it is, as outlined by Everett, but not necessarily in the sense used by Deacon in his exposition of Peirce’s icon, index, and symbol. For Deacon believes, (and so do I), the symbolic process in language involves symbolic takeoff, in which relationships are developed between the symbols in use, over and beyond the indexical relationships which first bind them. This is not an isolated change but a systemic change in thought and language. These relationships between the symbols themselves lead from mere indexical relationships to abstract thought. (Bananas, berries, meat, are food. Water and coconut juice are drinks.) Although isolated incidents of symbolic meaning would certainly be a start to this process.Everett gives the example of mistaking a root for a snake and then having the root become symbolic of the concept of snake. This type of symbolic thought, I think, is quite possible without achieving a complete symbol system such as language, though we lack much artifact evidence that it existed in early Homo erectus either.So, I would think that the grammar of G1, which Everett postulates as the first real language, could have been, and probably was, not truly symbolic at all, in that sense, but more indexical at first, from associations of words, objects, and events. This would be similar to opinions about the lack of full-blown symbol use by the great apes and others that have been studied. Although they have been trained to recognize symbols and make simple statements, they do not seem to fully grasp symbolic relationships or grammar. The real question is: How long ago did symbolic takeoff happen for humans?If you accept that it is possible to have language of sorts without full-blown symbolic takeoff, then both Everett and those who postulate that symbolic takeoff was responsible for more abstract thought and artistic representation, almost 2 million years later, could be correct.I thought the sections on the anatomy necessary for speech, pragmatics, and especially the idea that linguistic utterances are always made in the context of a particular culture, with all the implicit, unspoken knowledge that entails, were insightful and valid. Everett offers compelling, if not completely convincing, arguments that language began with Homo erectus 2 million years ago, and a wealth of information about other aspects of language and culture. His field studies of the Pirahã and others give him perspective and insight others may lack.Edward O. Wilson, perhaps the most respected sociobiologist of our time, has stated this book will become a classic. And I should say, with all of my caveats and quibbles offered for consideration above, from my perspective as an amateur student of language and mind that I humbly agree. This brief outline of topics covered does not do the book justice. How Language Began is an erudite, well-written, groundbreaking addition to my personal research and library."
15,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1016626-tim-pendry,3,"Daniel Everett's book is a curious one - at one level, he has a thesis (that 'Homo Erectus' possessed language), at another level it is a succession of basic primers on all the academic disciplines surrounding language and its place in human culture, at a third, it is about culture in general. The thesis, his McGuffin, you can take or leave. I was unpersuaded. It struck me that he had redefined language as something so simple (perhaps not without cause) that the proposition was close to meaningless. In essence, all that is being said is that language evolves with the species. The primer aspect is useful though can be over-technical with inadequate explanation of terms in places. At the least he brings the reader up to date with the main findings and debates in each field and one can pick and choose the degree of care in the reading according to interest. It is the third, cultural, aspect that is most interesting, not because Everett is arguing for something but because he is representing something - a change in the way the social and hard sciences see reality, one that brings them closer to the humanities without losing their rigour.The fact that his main hypothesis is not entirely persuasive is irrelevant. It is the tone that matters and a methodology that is keen to synthesise many different specialist forms of analysis into some sort of hypothesis about which he gives us sufficient tools to take a reasonable view.His arguments about culture - which should perhaps have been more overtly the subject of the book - are persuasive, that it is a natural evolved human form of great complexity relating to time and to environment and ever-shifting but with its own observable coherence at any one time.This is a challenge to the deadweight of radical humanist universalism but also to the sort of cultural relativism that would pickle any culture in aspic. It is a middle way that sees us all as one species but building our realities from the ground up through socialised individual perception.This is a view that also sees language as weapon or tool and culture as a system of co-operative and competitive survival in which language has a central role. He adopts a holistic approach to the matter of language in which many parts contribute to the analysis of the whole.In unravelling the basis for the propositions of recent thinkers like Chomsky, he does a great service, restoring some degree of humility within an intellectual class that tends to like grand projects that, on closer inspection, may be neat but do not necessarily accord with reality.He is also good on restoring us to our animal origins without diminishing in the slightest our achievements as a peculiar and new type of animal. The evolutionary arguments are thus not prescriptive, tending to predestination, but stories about how we became 'free' and conscious.Our freedom and consciousness is, of course, constrained by biology, environment and (though increasing less so) culture but constraint is not imprisonment by any means. In a way perhaps not directly intended, Everett restores our difference over the machines and our cause for dominance.Of course, the positioning here is a little inchoate as if it is reflecting the mood of a time that is still in formation but it is one that we will see transforming culture if not in the current generation which seems to be stuck in various forms of utopian idealism or counter-productive self interest.This is not some fluffy spiritual form of interconnectedness but a scientically justified observation of a process that derives from individual relations to the world and to others within cultural and historical frameworks imposed by the necessity of communication.This ensures that we can be more confident of having the will to change those frameworks that do not suit us while being aware that you cannot change those frameworks usefully without persuasion of others, that frameworks exist for a reason and such reasons need to be understood.All in all, not a masterpiece perhaps (the author has a tendency to be repetitive when he moves towards culture and gnomic and under-explanatory when he moves towards science) but a useful book that moves us a few steps forward in understanding what it is to be human."

Not because it is complex (I read lots of complex books on scientific and related topics), but because it is a collection of assertions with little to back them up. Also it is poorly organized: for example he'll make an allusion to some concept or finding (an allusion that I, and probably many readers, haven't heard before), but then, before elaborating, he goes on to make another point (or two or dozen) ... and maybe 25 page later (or never) he doubles back to the earlier allusion. Ironically, I intuitively feel that his key thesis is correct (namely language grew incrementally from Homo Erectus, and not via some sudden genetic mutation in Homo Sapiens [as he alleges is claimed by linguist Noam Chomsky]) - but he never really proves it to my satisfaction. The book is also unbearably repetitious."

23,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24373332-jacques-coulardeau,5,"CHOMSKY'S UG BLACK BOX IS JUST A SECULAR CREATIONIST OPINIONThis book is essential in today’s linguistics where we are shifting away from Chomsky’s modern – in fact pre-postmodern – Universal Grammar’s innate theory of language though Chomsky does not choose between innate by creation (by God of course) or by genetic evolution (Darwin’s natural selection). The result is the same: by the decision of a supernatural being or by the natural selection of some genetic mutation, Homo Sapiens became language-endowed at a certain date of his history (and that is the basis of the rather awkward and pointless concept of Homo Sapiens Sapiens). This approach is in phase with the famous “cognitive revolution” that states Homo Sapiens between 70,000 and 55,000 BCE became culturally competent, including language, painting, any symbolical representation, etc. This is pre-postmodern because it states a solution that is in no way proved and yet that accepts no alternative or questioning.Chomsky is nevertheless the linguist who inspired this scientific domain from 1955 to 2005 or so. He has now been severely questioned and challenged for something like twelve years. Against his innate approach, he had many other linguistic schools, most of them refusing to debate on the origin of language in conformity with the decision of the Paris Linguistic School at the end of the 19th century, a decision that reflected the anti-religious secular approach of life in the full process of establishing itself in France then. A few, alas, very few, accepted to speak of the evolution of language over a very long period of time, and subsequently of the geographical origin of our languages declared to be one in what is today Black Africa with the emergence of Homo Sapiens there from Homo Erectus or Homo Ergaster. Joseph Greenberg is the great master of this approach, though in his time it was only “out of Africa”. In today’s post-modern if not post-postmodern world we have to speak of “Out of Black Africa” and push the dates of the migrations from this vast base to something like 200,000 years BCE, if not even 250,000 years BCE, for the first migration to Northern Africa. Note here that the standard European method invented in the 19th century to study old states of our modern European languages, the retrospective reconstruction of the more than famous Proto Indo-European could not go beyond a historical distance of about 15,000 years which means not even the peak of the last glaciation which is 21,000 years ago. Any retrospective method comes to a point when everything is either nil or infinite in mathematical calculations. The main shortcoming of this PIE retrospective chase is the fact that the simple triad of questions about who were these people, where did they come from, and what language did they speak before is not even considered. The present book rejects this method and this retrospective approach. And that is postmodern indeed whereas the PIE supporters are definitely pre-postmodern. What is surprising is that so many in Europe and the Western world are still sticking to this obvious blocking retrospective or backward reconstructive method. Daniel L. Everett does not fall in this trap. Everett’s rejection of Chomsky’s theory is radical and systematic. He rejects the idea that language is a disembodied object (spoken by an ideal speaker in Chomsky’s own perspective and terms) along the line of a mathematical formula “[that] language is little more than a particular kind of grammar…, a hierarchical recursive grammar [that] is not found in a communication system, then [that] that form of communication is not language…, [that] that grammar ‘popped’ into being some 50-65,000 years ago via a mutation.” (p. 68) “Chomsky’s view that language is a recursive grammar, nothing more nothing less” (p. 68) is just rejected as unrealistic. And unrealistic is definitely a semantic and semiological understatement.This sudden apparition of Universal Grammar or language, Everett calls it catastrophism and for him, Chomsky’s theory is based on such an approach: a sudden fully developed apparition of Universal Grammar’s recursive hierarchical system. I don’t think it is useful to go beyond this simple rejection of Chomsky’s innate genetic approach of the creation of language by man or in man, though this last trait is not solved, disambiguated by Chomsky himself and it may be considered as a mutation that created it or it may have been guided by the wisdom of some God, Biblical or not. “And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof. And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field, but for Adam, there was not found a helper suitable for him.” (Genesis 2:19-20)But what is Everett’s approach?“Language is not merely a synonym for grammar. It is a combination of meaning, form, gestures, and pitch. Grammar aids language. It is not itself language. Language, whatever its biological basis, is shaped by psychology, history, and culture.” (p. 69) Then on the same page, he gives a chart of what he calls “language is a nexus.”His main point is that “language evolution can be explained without mutations, [and] based instead on gradual uniformitarianist assumptions, rendering superfluous proposals of language-specific genes or language-specific mutations.” P. 71) Along that line, he heavily insists on the fact that Homo Erectus changed by acquiring, through natural selection, the bipedal position. He is right to speak of the necessary mutations that were selected and that made this evolution possible. Why did Hominins become bipedal is another question that Everett does not answer. Mutations being haphazard and natural selection being guided by the increased efficiency in the struggle for survival, it is difficult to know why these ‘bipedal’ mutations happened though it is clear that the upright position gave an advantage to Homo Erectus who could see over the savanna and in plains without forests. But here it is what Everett misses: The radical change in lifestyle brought to Hominins when they became bipedal by the natural selection of a genetic accident. He also forgets to analyze the consequences of this change. Gathering new products. Hunting new animals. Homo Erectus’s food became more animal with the consequences it has on the physical development of the species and its brain. But it also narrowed the hips of women and it lengthened the dependence of the young on their mothers for breastfeeding, and then food and protection. Homo Erectus gave rise to three species.Neanderthals, massive individuals and well adapted to the climate of the Middle East and Europe. Denisovans of whom we know little but they covered the whole of Asia. And Homo Sapiens (via a first evolution from Homo Erectus to Homo Ergaster) in Africa, in fact, Black Africa. We know that Homo Sapiens was an agile bipedal long distance fast runner and this characteristic narrowed the hips of women some more and it lengthened the period during which the young had to be taken care of (breastfed, then fed and overlook, be it only for protection).When we consider these species, including Homo Erectus, migrated over vast territories, we must state they produced more young ones than supported by local resources to be able to “fuel” that migration. This implies a great number of births at a time of a high level of infantile mortality increased by the narrowing of women’s hips and the lengthening of infantile dependency. To reach three or four children brought to adult age per woman the fertile ones who lived at least 29 years (life expectancy at the time) had to have, over fifteen to sixteen years of their life a good eight or ten children, a child every one year and a half. Everett never considers this fact, and note he is not the only one. In fact, I have hardly found nothing but a few side-remarks on the subject of women, pregnancies and children among Homo Sapiens from their emergence to the Ice Age, and even after it, in most of the research I have read on the subject. To the point that I think there is a male-bias in archaeology and anthropology. If we consider the breastfeeding of the young for twelve months, then the dependence in which they are going to live for three more years or even more, some social organization is necessary to do it on a regular basis. A woman hence always has a child in her womb, or at her breast or on her hip or back. Women then had a full schedule with this activity and that means they specialized in taking care of children. This implies a division of labor that sets women in a very clear position: they were the progenitors and propagators of the species. Note this has to be extended to Homo Erectus. If the organization was good, some women, on a rotating basis, could be freed every day for gathering and collecting various food items, or other activities (like painting the caves), while those taking care of the children shared their milk and care over several children, including some who were not their own. Unluckily Everett does not consider these elements and I think he misses an essential point.The shift of Homo Erectus from the African forests to the vast open plains of Northern Africa, Asia Minor, Europe, and Asia obliged them to devise hunting methods based on collective and coordinated work over vast areas with communication among the hunters. And that is the main point, for males at least. For women, they had to share their experience, their schedules and they had to speak to the children. There too communication is essential. But that’s where phylogeny is essential for language, and that’s where Everett is right about Chomsky and the Universal Grammar approach: language cannot be reduced to grammar but has to be considered as the tool of communication, produced and developed by this communication. At the same time, we have to be very clear that language is not an ‘invention’ done by a few in some kind of laboratory, but it is the development of articulated human language within and from the communicational situation that requires this language to communicate and in the same dynamic as the mind itself. Both language and mind are constructs developed to enable communication, later conceptualization, within a communicational situation. The development of language that concerns us here has to follow some stages dictated by the raw materials used by Homo Sapiens, and before him by Homo Erectus, to generate our articulated language and the master word here is articulation. Chomsky states two articulations, an idea he got from André Martinet and standard post-1945 European linguistics and he is wrong. Our language has three articulations that are both in one particular order and hierarchically organized. But Homo Sapiens, and before him, Homo Erectus inherited from previous Hominins and of course Hominids, monkeys and apes, some vocal articulated calls used to communicate along with gestures, intonations, repetitions and so on. Homo Erectus, let alone Homo Sapiens, started from this heritage. There are facts that cannot be avoided. Monkeys and apes have some ‘linguistic’ tools in the shape of calls that are clusters of vowels and consonants articulated into stable units. The cases I have studied show that these monkeys have about five consonants and three vowels and with these means they produce about six or seven calls that can be repeated for emphasis and some calls are ordered in a certain way to call for attention first and then to specify the danger menacing the community (lion, eagle, falling trees, etc.) Then they produce chains of calls but each call keeps its own meaning and two different calls together do not produce a specific and new meaning. They can articulate vowels and consonants but they can’t produce anything beyond except repetitive chains. Their only syntax is concatenation or repetition but with no specific semiologic development. Each call, each unit is holistic and they are only assembled in concatenated chains for emphasis and urgency, along with gestures, vocal level, intonation, etc. […]what in this communicational situation provides a syntactic frame in which the lexical units get to a higher level of meaning?But we have to consider why Homo Sapiens evolved and how. By becoming bipedal runners, later on long distance fast runners, they selected mutations that lowered the larynx (the pump of that type of breathing), that developed physiological and physical coordination between diaphragm, lungs, heart, laryngeal and glottal areas, breathing tracks (nose, mouth, tongue, sinuses, etc.) plus the whole body, particularly the limbs, and all that was under brain-control from, among others, the Broca area. The innervation of the subglottal area, mouth, and tongue had to be improved and increased. All that was done by natural selection of haphazard mutations improving these elements for the objective of running longer and faster. I calculated that Neanderthals had an 11% deficit as compared to Homo Sapiens in brain size and probably subglottal innervation in EQ (Encephalization Quotient) proportion. Everett does not seem to capture the importance of this ratio. He says Neanderthals had a bigger brain than Homo Sapiens but this bigger brain is in fact in proportion with their bigger body mass and when compared with Homo Sapiens the ratio shows an 11% deficit. And I assume here the brains of the three species (Homo Erectus, Neanderthals, and Homo Sapiens) are of the same architecture, which is absolutely not sure. The highly parallel and hierarchical brain of Homo Sapiens has no reason to be identical to Neanderthals’ brain. Actually, from Homo Erectus to Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens there might have been mutations at the level of the brain and Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens are not directly connected in descending order and Homo Sapiens could not inherit the eventual mutations of Neanderthals. All this is considered by Everett but more or less on a back burner, though it is essential to evaluate where Homo Erectus stood. Before dealing with communication, let me say that women have been proved to stand apart in Homo Sapiens society, to have a special role in these societies, all over the world, confirmed today both in Europe and Indonesia: 75% of the handprints found in caves there (and it has just been proved that these handprints are older in Indonesia than in Europe) are women’s. That, from my point of view, confirms the central role of women before the peak of the Ice Age as the progenitors and propagators of the species but also as the spiritual beings of their societies, hence as those who control spiritual language or communication. If we follow those who say that these caves were the locale of some initiation of the seers of these societies by crawling as deep as possible in the dark and with limited resources, apparently all coming back to the surface with visions that they may have painted onto the deepest and narrowest caves. These visions would have become some spiritual discourse, some bridge with the other side of this world, with the world of spirits. And once again 75% of these were women. Is that proportion the same for those who went through the initiation as for those who painted the main entrance caves? A lot of work is still to be done. Was Homo Erectus on the same line? No one can say, I guess, since they did not paint the caves they lived in. Is that true of Homo Sapiens only at a maximum of 70,000 years BCE? No one can say. But there is no reason not to think it is possible it went a long way farther back in time because of the element Everett did not consider, the procreational situation of women from 13 to 29, and because of what he does not study. He speaks of communication but never considers the communicational situation without which there is no communication.If we speak of communication, and I would agree with Everett, we have to go back to Homo Erectus at least, we have to state a communicational situation that sets rules and functions, what I call the communicational syntax or discursive syntax. Note the communicational syntax of hunters is not the same as that of mothers taking care of children, but there is a basic situation which is true of all communication, at least Hominin communication based on calls.Call-ER		CALL		CALL		CALL-EEAgent		Relation	Theme		GoalSourceThen call-EE might answer the call vocally but the call-EE, when she is a mother, will answer materially and that action will be on the following pattern here specified as connected to hunger:Ex-call-EE					Ex-call-ERFeed-ER	FEED		FOOD		Feed-EEAgent		Relation	Theme		GoalSourceThis is the basic pattern of the syntax of human languages. According to the various circumstances or cultural circumstances it can be the basis of an active vision, a passive vision or an ergative vision. I call it communicational syntax. This syntax is also the basic discursive syntax. Everett is right on that point. We do not need to have a grammar gene or a syntax gene. Hominin society provides the mold and the melting pot that will bring and develop the basic syntactic architecture of human language. This communicational syntax is essential to lead to the second articulation of language, the distinction between spatial lexical units (what we call nouns in western linguistics) and temporal lexical units (what we call verbs in western linguistics). The first capture of time is not so much the inscription of the utterance in universe-time, which is by the way captured as duration by animals and hence by emerging Hominins, but the fact that some of these lexical items describe or name processes, relations that develop in duration. To be you have to become and once you are you have to go on becoming. To feed you have to start, do and then end the process, whereas food, feed-er, and feed-ee are static entities. They are and they only become due to their being attached to the process of feeding. These two dimensions will become in most languages nouns and verbs, though these names are derived from western linguistics and might not be the best and most proper descriptions. […]The last element we have to consider is to associate the phylogeny of language and its three articulations in connection with the three vast migrations of Homo Sapiens out of Black Africa to understand that the three vast families of root languages, isolating languages and agglutinative-synthetic/analytical languages evolved from the same linguistic nest but then three migrations left the nest at three different moments along this phylogenic evolution in the nest. But that is another story and I would advise you to check what I have published on the subject, for example, my Kindle book: “Cro-Magnon's Language: Emergence of Homo Sapiens, Invention of Articulated Language, Migrations out of Africa” (English Edition) Format Kindle, B074DXJM5C.This book by Daniel L. Everett is essential to finally step beyond the Chomskyan approach that is too narrow to be really effective. Language can only be understood within the human or Hominin communicational situation that produced it from genetic mutations naturally selected for reasons that had nothing to do with language. Language is a side effect of the evolution of Hominins to the bipedal long distance fast runner that Homo Sapiens became after Homo Erectus became bipedal and started migrating. Language is a side-effect of that bipedalism but it is the tool of this migration-oriented Hominin species that starts with Homo Erectus. And that has nothing to do with Chomsky’s black box of Universal Grammar. Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"

And I especially liked that he was not afraid to openly say that Chomsky was wrong.When I heard that he was writing a book on the origin of language I was looking forward to it. I had my doubts though when I heard that he was actually writing two books at the same time.And reading this book it does seem that he had just one main ambition, somehow filling 300 pages and making the deadline. What a pity.Like other commenters have said, it is really unnecessary to explain the concept of evolution. His former Christian friends who are ignorant of it will not read this book anyway.But the book is not only overhastily written there is a lot of evidence of muddled thinking. He tells us that Culture is abstract because it cannot be touched or smelled. (p. 68) Fair enough, but immediately afterward he goes on saying that the products of culture are visible and tangible. Like art, religion, science, style, tolerance or intolerance. Really? Last time I checked I could not smell religion. But only the products of religion. This seems an obvious example of a category mistake.There are other small things that make me mistrust the guy. Like being told that the past tense of German ""spielen"" is ""gespielt"".But my main objection is, that there is nothing on the connection between language and thought and consciousness. It does seem that he thinks that Homo erectus could think alright and then gradually learned to speak. I find this questionable. (I am prejudiced but I think it is indecent to write a book on language without even mentioning Wittgenstein.)So okay, what does he say? That homo erectus ""invented"" language roughly 2 million years ago. It developed gradually not as Chomsky believe by mutation. But at the same time he claims that there was immediately a fully developed language (with a simpler grammar though, no recursions, for example. But who needs this?) There was no proto-language. And the argument for this is cute. Erectus language was a Ford T model, not a Tesla. But it was a car.Again and again, he states as a fact what he wants to prove, that erectus invented language.The arguments he gives us are few. Erectus reached islands that could only be reached by rafts. And to build rafts you need language. Maybe, although I am not convinced. And he carried with him art. Stones that looked like faces. These are arguments. But not overwhelmingly strong ones. And one thing he does not bother to explain, why could a species with language dwell on earth for more than a million years without developing a lasting culture?The last quarter of the book suddenly turns interesting and earns the third star. For example when he explains our desire to put in meaning into everything. (Even colorless green ideas). That language in communication is far more complicated than Shannon thought. When he talks about Grice.""Thus it is clear that as language evolved, speech acts, indirect speech acts, conversations and stories depended heavily on cooperation, implicit (unspoken) information, culture and context. It is the only way that language has ever worked."" (p. 265)"

26,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81448030-clint-joseph,2,"Okay, so, I always get hooked by these types of book titles, and then am always immediately reminded out how of the shallow end I can find myself. But, here's the thing: I feel like if you have really mastered something, that is shown by your ability to explain it to someone like me, who maybe isn't the smartest guy on the block. And here's the thing, I spent the vast majority of this book trying to figure out exactly what this guy was arguing. At some points, I was pretty sure he just really bad wanted to explain that he disagrees with Noam Chomsky. Then other times I thought, ""oh, maybe this is just the second book of a two-book contract,"" because he seemed to reference himself numerous times. Maybe one can infer then that his other books are better, or cover the topic pretty much to the extent that it needs covered. I really can't say so I'm not telling anybody to write him off. To the extent that I can say, he seemed like he really knew his stuff, as far as the history of language evolution and linguistic studies goes. But then again, other times I found myself thinking the biggest problem Everett seemed to have was with how people define terms like ""language"" and ""communication"" and ""culture."" And there's a place for that, sure, but I don't know that it was expressed well. Or maybe, like this review, he had a lot of ideas that didn't quite come together in the way he intended. Ironic, I suppose, in a book about language. But, anyway, like pretty much everything ever, I'm not going to write this off entirely. I did find myself considering culture and language in new ways, and they ties between them, how they play and interact and what that implies about a people group. And that's always good. Other than that feeling you get when you start suspecting that you can't really ever know much about anything without knowing something about everything. Nevertheless, if I were you, I'd read the two pages conclusion first. It absolutely sums up what he was trying to say in the most straight-forward and clear-cut way. If this strikes your fancy, then absolutely go back and read the book. Just bear in mind that it is exactly represented in this conclusion/summary. The book is exceedingly heavy on human evolution, and pretty much only the last chapter covers the interactions of language. But beware, after 250 pages of him being angry about the idea of a porto-language, he doesn't totally sell you on the idea that it couldn't exist. Or rather, he seems to be upset that people think there could be one, instead of many. And yeah, that carries some weight, but having finished it I'm still not sure entirely how this ties with the other parts of the book. Or maybe I'm overthinking it. (One or two of you have mentioned this before, haha.)But all that being said, if you are big into archaeology/anthropology, then yes, get after it. He basically moves back the emergence of language a million and a half years or so. I think though, that I didn't have a strong enough opinion on this in the first place to really appreciate the arguments. So, there ya go."
27,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22752-nat,0,"I really liked Don't Sleep, There are Snakes, and this book starts with the attention-grabbing story of how Everett's dad was killed by a rattlesnake. But an explanation of how the capacity to use language evolved requires a much more systematic telling than Everett gives it--I'd recommend Henrich's The Secret of Our Success, which covers some of the same cultural evolutionary ground.The book begins with a discussion of the chemical origins of life in the Proterozoic, which struck me as overshooting the background needed to explain ""how language began""--kind of like Carl Sagan's remark that ""if you wish to bake an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe"". On p.224 Everett makes the claim that Pirahã lacks recursion, and that ""some linguists, such as Noam Chomsky, claim that all human languages...have...recursion"". I would refer the interested reader to E.J. Spode's (pseudonym of a famous philosopher of language) review of Tom Wolfe's attempted critique of Chomsky for a clear statement of what's wrong with that claim: But is it true? Did Everett and [the Pirahã] really lay waste to seventy years of hard work by Chomsky and thousands of linguists around the world?The short answer is no, first, because Chomsky never said every language has recursion. Indeed what he had been claiming for decades is that he was interested in the properties of the biological system – the Language Acquisition Device — that makes it possible for us to learn languages that have properties like recursion...I imagine Chomsky’s first encounter with the devastating blow went like this:Chomsky is working at his computer when a student rushes in.Student: “Professor Chomsky! They’ve discovered an Amazonian tribe that has a language without recursion!”Chomsky (slowly turning from his computer): “Can they learn Portuguese?”Student: “Well… yes.”Chomsky slowly turns back to his computer.(http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/tom-wo...)There are a couple of basic mistakes in the way Everett describes Austin's theory of speech acts (p. 257), like his gloss on what an illocutionary act is as ""the effect one intends their utterance to have"" (that's what a perlocutionary act/effect is). And he says that ""the illocutionary acts a person's words can accomplish include statements, commands, questions, or performative acts"". That's close to a category mistake, since performatives are Austin's earlier (unsatisfactory) way of classifying what roughly became illocutionary acts. Everett seems to be using ""performative act"" to mean a highly conventionalized illocutionary act, like using the words ""I now pronounce you man and wife"" to perform a marriage. These are mainly just terminological mistakes that don't affect his argument, but they stick out. I did thoroughly enjoy Everett imagining what the first utterances of homo erectus might have been like. Channeling the linguistic spirit of Jimmy Castor's ""Troglodyte"", he writes: ...say that the first utterance by an erectus was 'Shamalangadingdong!' as he saw a sabre-toothed cat run by him... (p.239)"
28,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35655787-ahmad,4,"The book is a hidden gem, which is strange why nobody paid attention to it. Anyway, I digress. The book discusses exactly what it says 'how language began'. It borrows scientific evidence and arguments from different fields such as anthropology, neuroscience, biology, sociology, psychology and so on. Starting at the biological level, the author narrates the common accounts of the biological conceptions of language (gene, the brain's areas for processing speech production ...etc.) What was interesting about this department is that the author didn't acknowledge Broca's and Wernicke's area for receiving and producing speech and claimed that they were abstract, more than physical areas in the brain. Moving on, the author later gradually discusses cognition, increasing complexity of culture, grammar and language until he concludes that they're intricately evolving together. Although the author did a tremendous job covering the biological aspects of language, this includes arguing against the face-valued acceptance of Broca and Wernicke, the author at times seems too much focus on the abstraction of language more than its contextualized use in real language. At least, there could've been one chapter on the use of language in cultures. Instead, he briefly gives Speech Act and Cooperative Principles. Having said that, that's just minor complaints, which do not undermine how engaging this book is. I strongly recommend this book to those linguistic enthusiasts like me. However, for those who are interested in language, linguistics and related fields, it's better to familiarize with the common key terminology in the field of linguistics because I think it's mostly written for those knowledgeable on language.

Although not a subject I've read much about, the book was fascinating to me. To make his points, the author touches upon many disciplines that span millions of years. He considers the areas of evolution and genetics beyond natural selection and survival of the fittest while considering the importance of the Baldwin effect, genetic drift, population bottlenecks, etc. He does all of this while challenging the idea of a ""language gene"" or the innateness of language found somewhere in the human brain. His main thrust is how culture plays the greatest role in language development. Language is an invention. Culture plays the role that genetics once did while leading up to Sapiens. It appears that eugenics had it backward. Culture is liberating us from strictly biological changes and genetics. A great book to make a thinker think and rethink. For those who question the science or the evolutionary thoughts in the book, I suggest they do the same for the opposing ides they consider to be scientific or evolutionary. All in all, lots of interesting information. "

40,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1532739-cary,3,"This was... okay. I think the science behind it is quite reasonable. Certainly giving what we now know about human genetics and neurology it makes far more sense than the opposing view championed by Noam Chomsky and his disciples. That view -- than human ability to use language arose relatively recently and suddenly via a single mutation -- does not jive with the facts that there are no areas of the brain exclusively dedicated to language and language does not engage only one area of the brain, implying that such a mutation event would need to affect several areas of the brain (but not create new structures) as well as parts of human anatomy. Possible? Sure. Likely? No.Instead, Everett proposes that language evolved gradually and as its utility (anthropomorphizing heavily here, but w/e) became obvious to evolution and selection for the parts of our neural and gross anatomy used in linguistic processing and production happened. Brains got bigger and areas within them got tweaked and enlarged to help humans 'do' language. The anatomy of our mouths and throats also underwent modification to enhance our production of speech sounds.The upstart of this is that Neandert[h]als could speak (a view held by most anthropologists and linguists today) and probably our earlier ancestors (e.g., homo erectus) could too (a less common view, but in no way beyond the pale; the author holds this view as well).The problems I had with this book were its unevenness and repetitiveness. At times things were overexplained while at others things were not. Much information is repeated ad nauseam -- for example a quotation about evolution satisficing, though at no point does he bother to point out that it's a portmanteau of satisfy and suffice. Sure, most people either know or will figure it out, but given the repetitive explanations of other things... wtf?Finally, an error that irked me greatly. The author has done a lot of work in the Amazon and purports to speak Portuguese (which, not Spanish, is the official language of Brazil). However, he makes an observation about Portuguese verb conjugation that is flat out wrong. Wrong and something that one would learn in the 2nd week of a course. In the grand scheme of the book it's not a problem, but it is plainly wrong and no one who speaks the language even a little would ever claim. This sort of thing makes me wonder what other plainly wrong things are stated as facts."
41,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109137015-brian-dahmen,3,"About 300 pages, didn't look so bad, but it got difficult, and I don't mean conceptually, I mean the rhetorical style became trying. Everett takes us from his home field of linguistics through anthropology, archaeology, politics, genetics, and a dozen other side adventures to try and convince us that our predecessors, Homo Erectus, had language. And I so want to know if this is true, so it promised to be a fascinating read. After all, Harari's Sapiens taught me that Erectus was not just our predecessor, but our “older brother” human race, who co-existed with Sapiens, Neanderthals, and at least three other “homo” species alive on earth at the same time, about 200,000 years ago. And Erectus flourished for over a million years on this Earth (before we sapiens likely killed them off); way longer than homo sapiens are likely to survive. Homo Erectus were, perhaps, the original people. But after learning way more about linguistics than I ever cared to, I feel the one piece of circumstantial evidence Everett returns to repeatedly is, while really cool, just not all that convincing: that a band of at least 50 Homo Erectus sailed 200 miles from the mainland to colonize the island of Flores, and they couldn't have possibly done that without language. Its a fascinating concept, but not exactly science, and there's just no hard evidence that they had language. In short, Everett poses a fascinating question: “Did other species in the Homo genus have language?,” and without really giving us much of anything in 300 pages, comes to the resounding “conclusion” that Homo Erectus did, “in fact,” have language. I feel like Everett does little more than bullying us into agreeing with him. After all, how could we prove that Homo Erectus didn't have language?Throughout the book, we are asked to take his word for it on sweeping generalizations and obtuse arguments. Everett sites a lot of other theorists, and takes a good whack at Chomsky, who in spite of his liberal political views could evoke little more than a yawn from me on what he got famous for: grammar. Syntax. A kook. While it's easy to pass on How Language Began, Everett's earlier book Dark Matter of the Mind: The Culturally Articulated Unconscious, sounds ever more appealing. But I suspect its just another cloak for a similar set of arguments, so I'll head back to the library and see what else is there."
42,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/811989-douglas-summers-stay,4,"This makes many of the same points as his other book I read (Language, A Cultural Tool) about how there is no ""language instinct"" but instead language is an invention that makes use of many mental capabilities developed for other purposes. He's primarily pushing back against Chomsky, saying that recursive grammar is an unnecessary and unimportant part of language, and in fact some languages (Piraha) do without it entirely.Instead, Everett argues that language began with the ability to read the signs of the environment-- the understanding that deer prints in the mud and deer droppings indicates that deer were in the area, for example. (I think you could also include the ability to read another person's face and gestures that they make unintentionally.) These he calls (after C.S. Pierce) ""indexes."" They are ""non-intentional, non-arbitrary links between form and meaning."" From there, the earliest language developed icons. Icons are intentional but still non-arbitrary: think how emojis are designed to be used. Beyond icons you have symbols, which are arbitrary linkages, like the connection English makes between the sound ""dog"" and the animal. On top of symbols, language adds compositionality-- the ability to combine two signs such as ""black dog"".Overall, this made a more structured, academic argument than the other book, and I felt like he made his case clearly and thoroughly. At each step, he showed how archaeological evidence supported the idea that language developed with Homo Sapiens' direct ancestor, Homo Erectus, and not before or after that. There are fewer personal stories and details about his time with the Piraha."
43,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1217440-maria,3,"While this author provides an alternate explanation to that of Chomsky’s Universal Grammar (UG) assertions, the evidence he provides to disputes UG is to merely state that he is correct and other scientists are wrong. While he provides cultural scenarios that he deems likely to have happened with Homo Erectus, in particular, he doesn’t quite make the link from cultural necessity to language invention clear beyond: if they needed to work together to complete more complex tasks, such as building boats to travel vast distances , they’d have needed language, so therefore they invented language that later evolved to what is currently what we use. That isn’t convincing enough to me. He does have some very good explanations for how evolution is likely to have happened, but all of this is predicated on a theory that he is right and others are wrong, without making a case for why he’s right. The fact that he simply dismisses ALL of the linguistic work of earlier scientists for his own theories comes across as shortsighted to me in that his explanation for dismissing it all isn’t clear. He simply starts with a premise that his theories are correct and others’ theories are not. That’s bad science and bad academic reasoning. I do appreciate that he positing a new theory, but wish he’d done more to connect the dots to come across as more credible. "

Too often, however, he cites disparate studies to advance his own theory with is at odds with the scientific consensus.I'm not a scientist, but I expected a more objective summation of the scientific literature based on the title and summary of the book. The author argues throughout the book that language began with homo-erectus. The studies he cites to advance his argument are not necessarily related to language and he frequently uses conjecture to make his point--this really detracted from my experience with the book.It's a shame because I did find the history and a bulk of the research interesting, was introduced to many new linguistic concepts I had never heard of, and particularly enjoyed the last few chapters which went more in to the science. Unfortunately the author circles the wagons at the end to revisit his hypothesis.To be a bit crass--vast sections of the book read more like diatribes than research. I got the impression this was a writer clearly in love with their own voice.I don't mean to diminish the vast scope and knowledge presented in the work--I simply didn't care for how that information was presented through the lens of the author's own opinion."

This book however very much disappointed me. It's a way too lengthy debate of the author with his scientific opponents.In a nutshell, Everett's theses are: Language is older than we thought. Homo Erectus probably already had language. Language is not genetically innate. Language and culture co-evolve. Human brain and speech apparatus co-evolved with language. Language grammar continuously evolves more complex (e.g. modal sentences and recursion) or simpler as required by surrounding culture as opposite to a linear evolution point of view.Nothing this book postulates I would argue against, I just wish this highly interesting material was presented in a much shorter, more engaging and constructive form."

Next he takes on a broad, pop science explanation of the science of evolution with some questionable theories : humans lost body hair because they were walking upright and didn't need it to shield from the sun? If he sees any animal shaved he will see their skin underlying the hair is pale. Meaning evolution had to exchange skin pigmentation for hair. Then, before presenting his own theory of the evolution of language, he attacks Norm Chomsky. While it is relevant for him to contrast his theory to Chomsky's, he could at least wait until after he presents his own theory before defending it by attacking another researcher.This is where I stopped reading."

In this book he makes a more general, point of how homo gained a language.The books argues that at least since homo erectus must have had language since they had 'culture', and were able to make sea voyages that must have involved planning. This contrasts with the Chomskian view that language evolved much later -- between ca. 200-60K BP (the book misrepresents this a bit).The book was interesting, thiough I'm not fully convinced about its main claim -- that language already started with homo erectus; possible pre-sapiens seafaring is some indication though."

As someone with only a very basic background knowledge of biology and anthropology, I didn't mind the detours and the writing matched my level of comprehension. Unfortunately, the way Everett makes his arguments for his theories is less interesting. Everett has a tendency to disregard other theories or he simply states things to be false, without giving a decent explanation or counterarguments. In that same way, he puts forward ideas or generalizations as logical statements and expects the reader to take his word for it.

It would be absolutely impossible to absorb everything in this book unless you were already largely familiar of the concepts it deals with.A large portion of it is also dedicated to what has to be a personal grudge the author has against people who have differing views of the theories involved.

69,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/782114-nathan-albright,3,"Do you like fairy tales?  I do too, but it is perhaps better if people are aware that they are writing fairy tales and not possessed of the belief that they actually know what they are talking about.  This author manages to accomplish something that I view as very difficult to manage, and that is making me agree at least somewhat with Noam Chomsky, whose belief in innate language structures this author mercilessly and unsuccessfully attempts to skewer throughout the book.  Indeed, the author seems to believe that his speculations about prehistory and his dogmatic opinions about human evolution amount to indisputable scientific truth, which makes him somewhat entertaining to read if you view this properly as a fictional and speculative account and somewhat less enjoyable if you only value books for their factual value.  On the one hand, the author's idea that human language and speech began with grammarless languages in the early mists of prehistory going back to homo erectus is somewhat interesting of an idea, and the author's interest in obscure Amazonian languages does give him at least some comparative linguistics interests to use in imagining a fairytale of early human language acquisition in the absence of linguistic artifacts that could verify such a story.This book is about 300 pages long and is divided into 4 parts and 12 chapters.  The author begins with a list of figures, acknowledgments, and a preface and introduction.  After that the author spends four chapters discussing the first hominins (I), with chapters on the rise of early humans (1), fossil hunters (2) and their fossil hunting and occasional controversies, then the departure of the early humans from Africa (3), and the way that everyone speaks languages of signs (4).  After that the author discusses biological adaptations for language (II), including how humans got a bigger brain (5), what it is about the brain that makes language possible without the author believing in language-specific parts of the brain (6), what happens when the brain goes wrong (7), and a discussion of talking with tongues (8).  After that the author discusses the speculative evolution of language form (III), with chapters on the development of grammar (9), how one talks with one's hands in addition to or in place of spoken language (10), as well as the way that languages are ""just good enough"" to convey what the speaker is thinking or feeling (11).  After that the fourth section of the book discusses the supposed cultural evolution of language (IV) with a chapter on communities and communication and the cultural context of language (12), after which the book ends with a conclusion, suggestions for further reading, notes, and an index.Whether or not you enjoy this book will depend a great deal on your fondness for naturalistic imaginative works.  This book is clearly not on as sound an empirical bias as the author believes it to be, and while I have no trouble seeing the author's creative writing as a novella about the past that one can take or leave depending on how it matches with one's own religious and scientific worldview, it is clear that the author has very passionate ideas that he wishes to promote but which he cannot always defend very ably.  In some cases the author's strident tone detracted from the enjoyment of the fairy tale I was reading, because it was clear that the author took his own writing far more seriously and far more literally than it was possible for me to take it.  Again, if your beliefs are similar to the author's you may find this book to be quite interesting and even persuasive, but if your worldview differs drastically, then it is best to view this book as a diverting fictional speculation about paleolinguistics from the point of view of someone who does not know as much about what he is writing about than he thinks he does, a common affliction among those who write about subjects relating to the origin of man."
70,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1532739-cary,3,"This was... okay. I think the science behind it is quite reasonable. Certainly giving what we now know about human genetics and neurology it makes far more sense than the opposing view championed by Noam Chomsky and his disciples. That view -- than human ability to use language arose relatively recently and suddenly via a single mutation -- does not jive with the facts that there are no areas of the brain exclusively dedicated to language and language does not engage only one area of the brain, implying that such a mutation event would need to affect several areas of the brain (but not create new structures) as well as parts of human anatomy. Possible? Sure. Likely? No.Instead, Everett proposes that language evolved gradually and as its utility (anthropomorphizing heavily here, but w/e) became obvious to evolution and selection for the parts of our neural and gross anatomy used in linguistic processing and production happened. Brains got bigger and areas within them got tweaked and enlarged to help humans 'do' language. The anatomy of our mouths and throats also underwent modification to enhance our production of speech sounds.The upstart of this is that Neandert[h]als could speak (a view held by most anthropologists and linguists today) and probably our earlier ancestors (e.g., homo erectus) could too (a less common view, but in no way beyond the pale; the author holds this view as well).The problems I had with this book were its unevenness and repetitiveness. At times things were overexplained while at others things were not. Much information is repeated ad nauseam -- for example a quotation about evolution satisficing, though at no point does he bother to point out that it's a portmanteau of satisfy and suffice. Sure, most people either know or will figure it out, but given the repetitive explanations of other things... wtf?Finally, an error that irked me greatly. The author has done a lot of work in the Amazon and purports to speak Portuguese (which, not Spanish, is the official language of Brazil). However, he makes an observation about Portuguese verb conjugation that is flat out wrong. Wrong and something that one would learn in the 2nd week of a course. In the grand scheme of the book it's not a problem, but it is plainly wrong and no one who speaks the language even a little would ever claim. This sort of thing makes me wonder what other plainly wrong things are stated as facts."
71,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109137015-brian-dahmen,3,"About 300 pages, didn't look so bad, but it got difficult, and I don't mean conceptually, I mean the rhetorical style became trying. Everett takes us from his home field of linguistics through anthropology, archaeology, politics, genetics, and a dozen other side adventures to try and convince us that our predecessors, Homo Erectus, had language. And I so want to know if this is true, so it promised to be a fascinating read. After all, Harari's Sapiens taught me that Erectus was not just our predecessor, but our “older brother” human race, who co-existed with Sapiens, Neanderthals, and at least three other “homo” species alive on earth at the same time, about 200,000 years ago. And Erectus flourished for over a million years on this Earth (before we sapiens likely killed them off); way longer than homo sapiens are likely to survive. Homo Erectus were, perhaps, the original people. But after learning way more about linguistics than I ever cared to, I feel the one piece of circumstantial evidence Everett returns to repeatedly is, while really cool, just not all that convincing: that a band of at least 50 Homo Erectus sailed 200 miles from the mainland to colonize the island of Flores, and they couldn't have possibly done that without language. Its a fascinating concept, but not exactly science, and there's just no hard evidence that they had language. In short, Everett poses a fascinating question: “Did other species in the Homo genus have language?,” and without really giving us much of anything in 300 pages, comes to the resounding “conclusion” that Homo Erectus did, “in fact,” have language. I feel like Everett does little more than bullying us into agreeing with him. After all, how could we prove that Homo Erectus didn't have language?Throughout the book, we are asked to take his word for it on sweeping generalizations and obtuse arguments. Everett sites a lot of other theorists, and takes a good whack at Chomsky, who in spite of his liberal political views could evoke little more than a yawn from me on what he got famous for: grammar. Syntax. A kook. While it's easy to pass on How Language Began, Everett's earlier book Dark Matter of the Mind: The Culturally Articulated Unconscious, sounds ever more appealing. But I suspect its just another cloak for a similar set of arguments, so I'll head back to the library and see what else is there."
72,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/811989-douglas-summers-stay,4,"This makes many of the same points as his other book I read (Language, A Cultural Tool) about how there is no ""language instinct"" but instead language is an invention that makes use of many mental capabilities developed for other purposes. He's primarily pushing back against Chomsky, saying that recursive grammar is an unnecessary and unimportant part of language, and in fact some languages (Piraha) do without it entirely.Instead, Everett argues that language began with the ability to read the signs of the environment-- the understanding that deer prints in the mud and deer droppings indicates that deer were in the area, for example. (I think you could also include the ability to read another person's face and gestures that they make unintentionally.) These he calls (after C.S. Pierce) ""indexes."" They are ""non-intentional, non-arbitrary links between form and meaning."" From there, the earliest language developed icons. Icons are intentional but still non-arbitrary: think how emojis are designed to be used. Beyond icons you have symbols, which are arbitrary linkages, like the connection English makes between the sound ""dog"" and the animal. On top of symbols, language adds compositionality-- the ability to combine two signs such as ""black dog"".Overall, this made a more structured, academic argument than the other book, and I felt like he made his case clearly and thoroughly. At each step, he showed how archaeological evidence supported the idea that language developed with Homo Sapiens' direct ancestor, Homo Erectus, and not before or after that. There are fewer personal stories and details about his time with the Piraha."
73,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1217440-maria,3,"While this author provides an alternate explanation to that of Chomsky’s Universal Grammar (UG) assertions, the evidence he provides to disputes UG is to merely state that he is correct and other scientists are wrong. While he provides cultural scenarios that he deems likely to have happened with Homo Erectus, in particular, he doesn’t quite make the link from cultural necessity to language invention clear beyond: if they needed to work together to complete more complex tasks, such as building boats to travel vast distances , they’d have needed language, so therefore they invented language that later evolved to what is currently what we use. That isn’t convincing enough to me. He does have some very good explanations for how evolution is likely to have happened, but all of this is predicated on a theory that he is right and others are wrong, without making a case for why he’s right. The fact that he simply dismisses ALL of the linguistic work of earlier scientists for his own theories comes across as shortsighted to me in that his explanation for dismissing it all isn’t clear. He simply starts with a premise that his theories are correct and others’ theories are not. That’s bad science and bad academic reasoning. I do appreciate that he positing a new theory, but wish he’d done more to connect the dots to come across as more credible. "
74,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4601217-john,2,"When the author sticks to the history of the science the book is interesting. Too often, however, he cites disparate studies to advance his own theory with is at odds with the scientific consensus.I'm not a scientist, but I expected a more objective summation of the scientific literature based on the title and summary of the book. The author argues throughout the book that language began with homo-erectus. The studies he cites to advance his argument are not necessarily related to language and he frequently uses conjecture to make his point--this really detracted from my experience with the book.It's a shame because I did find the history and a bulk of the research interesting, was introduced to many new linguistic concepts I had never heard of, and particularly enjoyed the last few chapters which went more in to the science. Unfortunately the author circles the wagons at the end to revisit his hypothesis.To be a bit crass--vast sections of the book read more like diatribes than research. I got the impression this was a writer clearly in love with their own voice.I don't mean to diminish the vast scope and knowledge presented in the work--I simply didn't care for how that information was presented through the lens of the author's own opinion."
75,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6076891-sergey-shishkin,2,"After reading Mastery I became interested in Everett's linguistic research and his contrarian view of language evolution. This book however very much disappointed me. It's a way too lengthy debate of the author with his scientific opponents.In a nutshell, Everett's theses are: Language is older than we thought. Homo Erectus probably already had language. Language is not genetically innate. Language and culture co-evolve. Human brain and speech apparatus co-evolved with language. Language grammar continuously evolves more complex (e.g. modal sentences and recursion) or simpler as required by surrounding culture as opposite to a linear evolution point of view.Nothing this book postulates I would argue against, I just wish this highly interesting material was presented in a much shorter, more engaging and constructive form."
76,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3899111-jean,2,"In general the book is meandering snd poorly organized. Starting with the author's experience in the jungle is interesting. Next he takes on a broad, pop science explanation of the science of evolution with some questionable theories : humans lost body hair because they were walking upright and didn't need it to shield from the sun? If he sees any animal shaved he will see their skin underlying the hair is pale. Meaning evolution had to exchange skin pigmentation for hair. Then, before presenting his own theory of the evolution of language, he attacks Norm Chomsky. While it is relevant for him to contrast his theory to Chomsky's, he could at least wait until after he presents his own theory before defending it by attacking another researcher.This is where I stopped reading."
77,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936064-djcb,3,"Linguist Everett famously lived among the Pirahã people of the Amazon rain forest in Brazil, and described their non-Chomskian (ie., non-recursive) language. In this book he makes a more general, point of how homo gained a language.The books argues that at least since homo erectus must have had language since they had 'culture', and were able to make sea voyages that must have involved planning. This contrasts with the Chomskian view that language evolved much later -- between ca. 200-60K BP (the book misrepresents this a bit).The book was interesting, thiough I'm not fully convinced about its main claim -- that language already started with homo erectus; possible pre-sapiens seafaring is some indication though."
78,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77744562-brian-bakker,3,"This was an interesting read. As someone with only a very basic background knowledge of biology and anthropology, I didn't mind the detours and the writing matched my level of comprehension. Unfortunately, the way Everett makes his arguments for his theories is less interesting. Everett has a tendency to disregard other theories or he simply states things to be false, without giving a decent explanation or counterarguments. In that same way, he puts forward ideas or generalizations as logical statements and expects the reader to take his word for it. I listened to the audiobook version while I was on the go (as I think a lot of people do when listening to audiobooks), so the frequent references to the bonus PDF were a bit annoying. "
79,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3130865-daniel-currie,2,"I listened to the unabridged audiobook version of this (without the bonus PDF).I have no idea if this is meant as a textbook or not, but it certainly comes across as one. It takes what ought to be a very interesting subject and grinds it down to the point where it is barley listenable. It would be absolutely impossible to absorb everything in this book unless you were already largely familiar of the concepts it deals with.A large portion of it is also dedicated to what has to be a personal grudge the author has against people who have differing views of the theories involved. There are a fair number of what amount to personal attacks against other experts in the field. There is a very interesting and listenable book here somewhere, but this isn't it. "

101,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109137015-brian-dahmen,3,"About 300 pages, didn't look so bad, but it got difficult, and I don't mean conceptually, I mean the rhetorical style became trying. Everett takes us from his home field of linguistics through anthropology, archaeology, politics, genetics, and a dozen other side adventures to try and convince us that our predecessors, Homo Erectus, had language. And I so want to know if this is true, so it promised to be a fascinating read. After all, Harari's Sapiens taught me that Erectus was not just our predecessor, but our “older brother” human race, who co-existed with Sapiens, Neanderthals, and at least three other “homo” species alive on earth at the same time, about 200,000 years ago. And Erectus flourished for over a million years on this Earth (before we sapiens likely killed them off); way longer than homo sapiens are likely to survive. Homo Erectus were, perhaps, the original people. But after learning way more about linguistics than I ever cared to, I feel the one piece of circumstantial evidence Everett returns to repeatedly is, while really cool, just not all that convincing: that a band of at least 50 Homo Erectus sailed 200 miles from the mainland to colonize the island of Flores, and they couldn't have possibly done that without language. Its a fascinating concept, but not exactly science, and there's just no hard evidence that they had language. In short, Everett poses a fascinating question: “Did other species in the Homo genus have language?,” and without really giving us much of anything in 300 pages, comes to the resounding “conclusion” that Homo Erectus did, “in fact,” have language. I feel like Everett does little more than bullying us into agreeing with him. After all, how could we prove that Homo Erectus didn't have language?Throughout the book, we are asked to take his word for it on sweeping generalizations and obtuse arguments. Everett sites a lot of other theorists, and takes a good whack at Chomsky, who in spite of his liberal political views could evoke little more than a yawn from me on what he got famous for: grammar. Syntax. A kook. While it's easy to pass on How Language Began, Everett's earlier book Dark Matter of the Mind: The Culturally Articulated Unconscious, sounds ever more appealing. But I suspect its just another cloak for a similar set of arguments, so I'll head back to the library and see what else is there."
102,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/811989-douglas-summers-stay,4,"This makes many of the same points as his other book I read (Language, A Cultural Tool) about how there is no ""language instinct"" but instead language is an invention that makes use of many mental capabilities developed for other purposes. He's primarily pushing back against Chomsky, saying that recursive grammar is an unnecessary and unimportant part of language, and in fact some languages (Piraha) do without it entirely.Instead, Everett argues that language began with the ability to read the signs of the environment-- the understanding that deer prints in the mud and deer droppings indicates that deer were in the area, for example. (I think you could also include the ability to read another person's face and gestures that they make unintentionally.) These he calls (after C.S. Pierce) ""indexes."" They are ""non-intentional, non-arbitrary links between form and meaning."" From there, the earliest language developed icons. Icons are intentional but still non-arbitrary: think how emojis are designed to be used. Beyond icons you have symbols, which are arbitrary linkages, like the connection English makes between the sound ""dog"" and the animal. On top of symbols, language adds compositionality-- the ability to combine two signs such as ""black dog"".Overall, this made a more structured, academic argument than the other book, and I felt like he made his case clearly and thoroughly. At each step, he showed how archaeological evidence supported the idea that language developed with Homo Sapiens' direct ancestor, Homo Erectus, and not before or after that. There are fewer personal stories and details about his time with the Piraha."
103,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1217440-maria,3,"While this author provides an alternate explanation to that of Chomsky’s Universal Grammar (UG) assertions, the evidence he provides to disputes UG is to merely state that he is correct and other scientists are wrong. While he provides cultural scenarios that he deems likely to have happened with Homo Erectus, in particular, he doesn’t quite make the link from cultural necessity to language invention clear beyond: if they needed to work together to complete more complex tasks, such as building boats to travel vast distances , they’d have needed language, so therefore they invented language that later evolved to what is currently what we use. That isn’t convincing enough to me. He does have some very good explanations for how evolution is likely to have happened, but all of this is predicated on a theory that he is right and others are wrong, without making a case for why he’s right. The fact that he simply dismisses ALL of the linguistic work of earlier scientists for his own theories comes across as shortsighted to me in that his explanation for dismissing it all isn’t clear. He simply starts with a premise that his theories are correct and others’ theories are not. That’s bad science and bad academic reasoning. I do appreciate that he positing a new theory, but wish he’d done more to connect the dots to come across as more credible. "
104,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4601217-john,2,"When the author sticks to the history of the science the book is interesting. Too often, however, he cites disparate studies to advance his own theory with is at odds with the scientific consensus.I'm not a scientist, but I expected a more objective summation of the scientific literature based on the title and summary of the book. The author argues throughout the book that language began with homo-erectus. The studies he cites to advance his argument are not necessarily related to language and he frequently uses conjecture to make his point--this really detracted from my experience with the book.It's a shame because I did find the history and a bulk of the research interesting, was introduced to many new linguistic concepts I had never heard of, and particularly enjoyed the last few chapters which went more in to the science. Unfortunately the author circles the wagons at the end to revisit his hypothesis.To be a bit crass--vast sections of the book read more like diatribes than research. I got the impression this was a writer clearly in love with their own voice.I don't mean to diminish the vast scope and knowledge presented in the work--I simply didn't care for how that information was presented through the lens of the author's own opinion."
105,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6076891-sergey-shishkin,2,"After reading Mastery I became interested in Everett's linguistic research and his contrarian view of language evolution. This book however very much disappointed me. It's a way too lengthy debate of the author with his scientific opponents.In a nutshell, Everett's theses are: Language is older than we thought. Homo Erectus probably already had language. Language is not genetically innate. Language and culture co-evolve. Human brain and speech apparatus co-evolved with language. Language grammar continuously evolves more complex (e.g. modal sentences and recursion) or simpler as required by surrounding culture as opposite to a linear evolution point of view.Nothing this book postulates I would argue against, I just wish this highly interesting material was presented in a much shorter, more engaging and constructive form."
106,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3899111-jean,2,"In general the book is meandering snd poorly organized. Starting with the author's experience in the jungle is interesting. Next he takes on a broad, pop science explanation of the science of evolution with some questionable theories : humans lost body hair because they were walking upright and didn't need it to shield from the sun? If he sees any animal shaved he will see their skin underlying the hair is pale. Meaning evolution had to exchange skin pigmentation for hair. Then, before presenting his own theory of the evolution of language, he attacks Norm Chomsky. While it is relevant for him to contrast his theory to Chomsky's, he could at least wait until after he presents his own theory before defending it by attacking another researcher.This is where I stopped reading."
107,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936064-djcb,3,"Linguist Everett famously lived among the Pirahã people of the Amazon rain forest in Brazil, and described their non-Chomskian (ie., non-recursive) language. In this book he makes a more general, point of how homo gained a language.The books argues that at least since homo erectus must have had language since they had 'culture', and were able to make sea voyages that must have involved planning. This contrasts with the Chomskian view that language evolved much later -- between ca. 200-60K BP (the book misrepresents this a bit).The book was interesting, thiough I'm not fully convinced about its main claim -- that language already started with homo erectus; possible pre-sapiens seafaring is some indication though."
108,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77744562-brian-bakker,3,"This was an interesting read. As someone with only a very basic background knowledge of biology and anthropology, I didn't mind the detours and the writing matched my level of comprehension. Unfortunately, the way Everett makes his arguments for his theories is less interesting. Everett has a tendency to disregard other theories or he simply states things to be false, without giving a decent explanation or counterarguments. In that same way, he puts forward ideas or generalizations as logical statements and expects the reader to take his word for it. I listened to the audiobook version while I was on the go (as I think a lot of people do when listening to audiobooks), so the frequent references to the bonus PDF were a bit annoying. "

It takes what ought to be a very interesting subject and grinds it down to the point where it is barley listenable. It would be absolutely impossible to absorb everything in this book unless you were already largely familiar of the concepts it deals with.A large portion of it is also dedicated to what has to be a personal grudge the author has against people who have differing views of the theories involved. There are a fair number of what amount to personal attacks against other experts in the field. There is a very interesting and listenable book here somewhere, but this isn't it. "

If you find language as a human centric skill and how it developed then this book is a good fit for you. I was hoping for a more in depth discussion of how language developed at the beginning. How Erectus communicated. But it seems that the fault is not in the author but in our knowledge. I was able to finish the book and at the end there was some wonderful tidbits addressing the subject I was hoping for.

There were some interesting passages and information included, and I do feel like I learned some things through reading (listening) to it.

159,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/782114-nathan-albright,3,"Do you like fairy tales?  I do too, but it is perhaps better if people are aware that they are writing fairy tales and not possessed of the belief that they actually know what they are talking about.  This author manages to accomplish something that I view as very difficult to manage, and that is making me agree at least somewhat with Noam Chomsky, whose belief in innate language structures this author mercilessly and unsuccessfully attempts to skewer throughout the book.  Indeed, the author seems to believe that his speculations about prehistory and his dogmatic opinions about human evolution amount to indisputable scientific truth, which makes him somewhat entertaining to read if you view this properly as a fictional and speculative account and somewhat less enjoyable if you only value books for their factual value.  On the one hand, the author's idea that human language and speech began with grammarless languages in the early mists of prehistory going back to homo erectus is somewhat interesting of an idea, and the author's interest in obscure Amazonian languages does give him at least some comparative linguistics interests to use in imagining a fairytale of early human language acquisition in the absence of linguistic artifacts that could verify such a story.This book is about 300 pages long and is divided into 4 parts and 12 chapters.  The author begins with a list of figures, acknowledgments, and a preface and introduction.  After that the author spends four chapters discussing the first hominins (I), with chapters on the rise of early humans (1), fossil hunters (2) and their fossil hunting and occasional controversies, then the departure of the early humans from Africa (3), and the way that everyone speaks languages of signs (4).  After that the author discusses biological adaptations for language (II), including how humans got a bigger brain (5), what it is about the brain that makes language possible without the author believing in language-specific parts of the brain (6), what happens when the brain goes wrong (7), and a discussion of talking with tongues (8).  After that the author discusses the speculative evolution of language form (III), with chapters on the development of grammar (9), how one talks with one's hands in addition to or in place of spoken language (10), as well as the way that languages are ""just good enough"" to convey what the speaker is thinking or feeling (11).  After that the fourth section of the book discusses the supposed cultural evolution of language (IV) with a chapter on communities and communication and the cultural context of language (12), after which the book ends with a conclusion, suggestions for further reading, notes, and an index.Whether or not you enjoy this book will depend a great deal on your fondness for naturalistic imaginative works.  This book is clearly not on as sound an empirical bias as the author believes it to be, and while I have no trouble seeing the author's creative writing as a novella about the past that one can take or leave depending on how it matches with one's own religious and scientific worldview, it is clear that the author has very passionate ideas that he wishes to promote but which he cannot always defend very ably.  In some cases the author's strident tone detracted from the enjoyment of the fairy tale I was reading, because it was clear that the author took his own writing far more seriously and far more literally than it was possible for me to take it.  Again, if your beliefs are similar to the author's you may find this book to be quite interesting and even persuasive, but if your worldview differs drastically, then it is best to view this book as a diverting fictional speculation about paleolinguistics from the point of view of someone who does not know as much about what he is writing about than he thinks he does, a common affliction among those who write about subjects relating to the origin of man."
160,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1532739-cary,3,"This was... okay. I think the science behind it is quite reasonable. Certainly giving what we now know about human genetics and neurology it makes far more sense than the opposing view championed by Noam Chomsky and his disciples. That view -- than human ability to use language arose relatively recently and suddenly via a single mutation -- does not jive with the facts that there are no areas of the brain exclusively dedicated to language and language does not engage only one area of the brain, implying that such a mutation event would need to affect several areas of the brain (but not create new structures) as well as parts of human anatomy. Possible? Sure. Likely? No.Instead, Everett proposes that language evolved gradually and as its utility (anthropomorphizing heavily here, but w/e) became obvious to evolution and selection for the parts of our neural and gross anatomy used in linguistic processing and production happened. Brains got bigger and areas within them got tweaked and enlarged to help humans 'do' language. The anatomy of our mouths and throats also underwent modification to enhance our production of speech sounds.The upstart of this is that Neandert[h]als could speak (a view held by most anthropologists and linguists today) and probably our earlier ancestors (e.g., homo erectus) could too (a less common view, but in no way beyond the pale; the author holds this view as well).The problems I had with this book were its unevenness and repetitiveness. At times things were overexplained while at others things were not. Much information is repeated ad nauseam -- for example a quotation about evolution satisficing, though at no point does he bother to point out that it's a portmanteau of satisfy and suffice. Sure, most people either know or will figure it out, but given the repetitive explanations of other things... wtf?Finally, an error that irked me greatly. The author has done a lot of work in the Amazon and purports to speak Portuguese (which, not Spanish, is the official language of Brazil). However, he makes an observation about Portuguese verb conjugation that is flat out wrong. Wrong and something that one would learn in the 2nd week of a course. In the grand scheme of the book it's not a problem, but it is plainly wrong and no one who speaks the language even a little would ever claim. This sort of thing makes me wonder what other plainly wrong things are stated as facts."
161,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109137015-brian-dahmen,3,"About 300 pages, didn't look so bad, but it got difficult, and I don't mean conceptually, I mean the rhetorical style became trying. Everett takes us from his home field of linguistics through anthropology, archaeology, politics, genetics, and a dozen other side adventures to try and convince us that our predecessors, Homo Erectus, had language. And I so want to know if this is true, so it promised to be a fascinating read. After all, Harari's Sapiens taught me that Erectus was not just our predecessor, but our “older brother” human race, who co-existed with Sapiens, Neanderthals, and at least three other “homo” species alive on earth at the same time, about 200,000 years ago. And Erectus flourished for over a million years on this Earth (before we sapiens likely killed them off); way longer than homo sapiens are likely to survive. Homo Erectus were, perhaps, the original people. But after learning way more about linguistics than I ever cared to, I feel the one piece of circumstantial evidence Everett returns to repeatedly is, while really cool, just not all that convincing: that a band of at least 50 Homo Erectus sailed 200 miles from the mainland to colonize the island of Flores, and they couldn't have possibly done that without language. Its a fascinating concept, but not exactly science, and there's just no hard evidence that they had language. In short, Everett poses a fascinating question: “Did other species in the Homo genus have language?,” and without really giving us much of anything in 300 pages, comes to the resounding “conclusion” that Homo Erectus did, “in fact,” have language. I feel like Everett does little more than bullying us into agreeing with him. After all, how could we prove that Homo Erectus didn't have language?Throughout the book, we are asked to take his word for it on sweeping generalizations and obtuse arguments. Everett sites a lot of other theorists, and takes a good whack at Chomsky, who in spite of his liberal political views could evoke little more than a yawn from me on what he got famous for: grammar. Syntax. A kook. While it's easy to pass on How Language Began, Everett's earlier book Dark Matter of the Mind: The Culturally Articulated Unconscious, sounds ever more appealing.

189,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/782114-nathan-albright,3,"Do you like fairy tales?  I do too, but it is perhaps better if people are aware that they are writing fairy tales and not possessed of the belief that they actually know what they are talking about.  This author manages to accomplish something that I view as very difficult to manage, and that is making me agree at least somewhat with Noam Chomsky, whose belief in innate language structures this author mercilessly and unsuccessfully attempts to skewer throughout the book.  Indeed, the author seems to believe that his speculations about prehistory and his dogmatic opinions about human evolution amount to indisputable scientific truth, which makes him somewhat entertaining to read if you view this properly as a fictional and speculative account and somewhat less enjoyable if you only value books for their factual value.  On the one hand, the author's idea that human language and speech began with grammarless languages in the early mists of prehistory going back to homo erectus is somewhat interesting of an idea, and the author's interest in obscure Amazonian languages does give him at least some comparative linguistics interests to use in imagining a fairytale of early human language acquisition in the absence of linguistic artifacts that could verify such a story.This book is about 300 pages long and is divided into 4 parts and 12 chapters.  The author begins with a list of figures, acknowledgments, and a preface and introduction.  After that the author spends four chapters discussing the first hominins (I), with chapters on the rise of early humans (1), fossil hunters (2) and their fossil hunting and occasional controversies, then the departure of the early humans from Africa (3), and the way that everyone speaks languages of signs (4).  After that the author discusses biological adaptations for language (II), including how humans got a bigger brain (5), what it is about the brain that makes language possible without the author believing in language-specific parts of the brain (6), what happens when the brain goes wrong (7), and a discussion of talking with tongues (8).  After that the author discusses the speculative evolution of language form (III), with chapters on the development of grammar (9), how one talks with one's hands in addition to or in place of spoken language (10), as well as the way that languages are ""just good enough"" to convey what the speaker is thinking or feeling (11).  After that the fourth section of the book discusses the supposed cultural evolution of language (IV) with a chapter on communities and communication and the cultural context of language (12), after which the book ends with a conclusion, suggestions for further reading, notes, and an index.Whether or not you enjoy this book will depend a great deal on your fondness for naturalistic imaginative works.  This book is clearly not on as sound an empirical bias as the author believes it to be, and while I have no trouble seeing the author's creative writing as a novella about the past that one can take or leave depending on how it matches with one's own religious and scientific worldview, it is clear that the author has very passionate ideas that he wishes to promote but which he cannot always defend very ably.  In some cases the author's strident tone detracted from the enjoyment of the fairy tale I was reading, because it was clear that the author took his own writing far more seriously and far more literally than it was possible for me to take it.  Again, if your beliefs are similar to the author's you may find this book to be quite interesting and even persuasive, but if your worldview differs drastically, then it is best to view this book as a diverting fictional speculation about paleolinguistics from the point of view of someone who does not know as much about what he is writing about than he thinks he does, a common affliction among those who write about subjects relating to the origin of man."
190,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1532739-cary,3,"This was... okay. I think the science behind it is quite reasonable. Certainly giving what we now know about human genetics and neurology it makes far more sense than the opposing view championed by Noam Chomsky and his disciples. That view -- than human ability to use language arose relatively recently and suddenly via a single mutation -- does not jive with the facts that there are no areas of the brain exclusively dedicated to language and language does not engage only one area of the brain, implying that such a mutation event would need to affect several areas of the brain (but not create new structures) as well as parts of human anatomy. Possible? Sure. Likely? No.Instead, Everett proposes that language evolved gradually and as its utility (anthropomorphizing heavily here, but w/e) became obvious to evolution and selection for the parts of our neural and gross anatomy used in linguistic processing and production happened. Brains got bigger and areas within them got tweaked and enlarged to help humans 'do' language. The anatomy of our mouths and throats also underwent modification to enhance our production of speech sounds.The upstart of this is that Neandert[h]als could speak (a view held by most anthropologists and linguists today) and probably our earlier ancestors (e.g., homo erectus) could too (a less common view, but in no way beyond the pale; the author holds this view as well).The problems I had with this book were its unevenness and repetitiveness. At times things were overexplained while at others things were not. Much information is repeated ad nauseam -- for example a quotation about evolution satisficing, though at no point does he bother to point out that it's a portmanteau of satisfy and suffice. Sure, most people either know or will figure it out, but given the repetitive explanations of other things... wtf?Finally, an error that irked me greatly. The author has done a lot of work in the Amazon and purports to speak Portuguese (which, not Spanish, is the official language of Brazil). However, he makes an observation about Portuguese verb conjugation that is flat out wrong. Wrong and something that one would learn in the 2nd week of a course. In the grand scheme of the book it's not a problem, but it is plainly wrong and no one who speaks the language even a little would ever claim. This sort of thing makes me wonder what other plainly wrong things are stated as facts."
191,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109137015-brian-dahmen,3,"About 300 pages, didn't look so bad, but it got difficult, and I don't mean conceptually, I mean the rhetorical style became trying. Everett takes us from his home field of linguistics through anthropology, archaeology, politics, genetics, and a dozen other side adventures to try and convince us that our predecessors, Homo Erectus, had language. And I so want to know if this is true, so it promised to be a fascinating read. After all, Harari's Sapiens taught me that Erectus was not just our predecessor, but our “older brother” human race, who co-existed with Sapiens, Neanderthals, and at least three other “homo” species alive on earth at the same time, about 200,000 years ago. And Erectus flourished for over a million years on this Earth (before we sapiens likely killed them off); way longer than homo sapiens are likely to survive. Homo Erectus were, perhaps, the original people. But after learning way more about linguistics than I ever cared to, I feel the one piece of circumstantial evidence Everett returns to repeatedly is, while really cool, just not all that convincing: that a band of at least 50 Homo Erectus sailed 200 miles from the mainland to colonize the island of Flores, and they couldn't have possibly done that without language. Its a fascinating concept, but not exactly science, and there's just no hard evidence that they had language. In short, Everett poses a fascinating question: “Did other species in the Homo genus have language?,” and without really giving us much of anything in 300 pages, comes to the resounding “conclusion” that Homo Erectus did, “in fact,” have language. I feel like Everett does little more than bullying us into agreeing with him. After all, how could we prove that Homo Erectus didn't have language?Throughout the book, we are asked to take his word for it on sweeping generalizations and obtuse arguments. Everett sites a lot of other theorists, and takes a good whack at Chomsky, who in spite of his liberal political views could evoke little more than a yawn from me on what he got famous for: grammar. Syntax. A kook. While it's easy to pass on How Language Began, Everett's earlier book Dark Matter of the Mind: The Culturally Articulated Unconscious, sounds ever more appealing. But I suspect its just another cloak for a similar set of arguments, so I'll head back to the library and see what else is there."
192,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/811989-douglas-summers-stay,4,"This makes many of the same points as his other book I read (Language, A Cultural Tool) about how there is no ""language instinct"" but instead language is an invention that makes use of many mental capabilities developed for other purposes. He's primarily pushing back against Chomsky, saying that recursive grammar is an unnecessary and unimportant part of language, and in fact some languages (Piraha) do without it entirely.Instead, Everett argues that language began with the ability to read the signs of the environment-- the understanding that deer prints in the mud and deer droppings indicates that deer were in the area, for example. (I think you could also include the ability to read another person's face and gestures that they make unintentionally.) These he calls (after C.S. Pierce) ""indexes."" They are ""non-intentional, non-arbitrary links between form and meaning."" From there, the earliest language developed icons. Icons are intentional but still non-arbitrary: think how emojis are designed to be used. Beyond icons you have symbols, which are arbitrary linkages, like the connection English makes between the sound ""dog"" and the animal. On top of symbols, language adds compositionality-- the ability to combine two signs such as ""black dog"".Overall, this made a more structured, academic argument than the other book, and I felt like he made his case clearly and thoroughly. At each step, he showed how archaeological evidence supported the idea that language developed with Homo Sapiens' direct ancestor, Homo Erectus, and not before or after that. There are fewer personal stories and details about his time with the Piraha."
193,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1217440-maria,3,"While this author provides an alternate explanation to that of Chomsky’s Universal Grammar (UG) assertions, the evidence he provides to disputes UG is to merely state that he is correct and other scientists are wrong. While he provides cultural scenarios that he deems likely to have happened with Homo Erectus, in particular, he doesn’t quite make the link from cultural necessity to language invention clear beyond: if they needed to work together to complete more complex tasks, such as building boats to travel vast distances , they’d have needed language, so therefore they invented language that later evolved to what is currently what we use. That isn’t convincing enough to me. He does have some very good explanations for how evolution is likely to have happened, but all of this is predicated on a theory that he is right and others are wrong, without making a case for why he’s right. The fact that he simply dismisses ALL of the linguistic work of earlier scientists for his own theories comes across as shortsighted to me in that his explanation for dismissing it all isn’t clear. He simply starts with a premise that his theories are correct and others’ theories are not. That’s bad science and bad academic reasoning. I do appreciate that he positing a new theory, but wish he’d done more to connect the dots to come across as more credible. "
194,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4601217-john,2,"When the author sticks to the history of the science the book is interesting. Too often, however, he cites disparate studies to advance his own theory with is at odds with the scientific consensus.I'm not a scientist, but I expected a more objective summation of the scientific literature based on the title and summary of the book. The author argues throughout the book that language began with homo-erectus. The studies he cites to advance his argument are not necessarily related to language and he frequently uses conjecture to make his point--this really detracted from my experience with the book.It's a shame because I did find the history and a bulk of the research interesting, was introduced to many new linguistic concepts I had never heard of, and particularly enjoyed the last few chapters which went more in to the science. Unfortunately the author circles the wagons at the end to revisit his hypothesis.To be a bit crass--vast sections of the book read more like diatribes than research. I got the impression this was a writer clearly in love with their own voice.I don't mean to diminish the vast scope and knowledge presented in the work--I simply didn't care for how that information was presented through the lens of the author's own opinion."
195,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6076891-sergey-shishkin,2,"After reading Mastery I became interested in Everett's linguistic research and his contrarian view of language evolution. This book however very much disappointed me. It's a way too lengthy debate of the author with his scientific opponents.In a nutshell, Everett's theses are: Language is older than we thought. Homo Erectus probably already had language. Language is not genetically innate. Language and culture co-evolve. Human brain and speech apparatus co-evolved with language. Language grammar continuously evolves more complex (e.g. modal sentences and recursion) or simpler as required by surrounding culture as opposite to a linear evolution point of view.Nothing this book postulates I would argue against, I just wish this highly interesting material was presented in a much shorter, more engaging and constructive form."
196,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3899111-jean,2,"In general the book is meandering snd poorly organized. Starting with the author's experience in the jungle is interesting. Next he takes on a broad, pop science explanation of the science of evolution with some questionable theories : humans lost body hair because they were walking upright and didn't need it to shield from the sun? If he sees any animal shaved he will see their skin underlying the hair is pale. Meaning evolution had to exchange skin pigmentation for hair. Then, before presenting his own theory of the evolution of language, he attacks Norm Chomsky. While it is relevant for him to contrast his theory to Chomsky's, he could at least wait until after he presents his own theory before defending it by attacking another researcher.This is where I stopped reading."
197,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936064-djcb,3,"Linguist Everett famously lived among the Pirahã people of the Amazon rain forest in Brazil, and described their non-Chomskian (ie., non-recursive) language. In this book he makes a more general, point of how homo gained a language.The books argues that at least since homo erectus must have had language since they had 'culture', and were able to make sea voyages that must have involved planning. This contrasts with the Chomskian view that language evolved much later -- between ca. 200-60K BP (the book misrepresents this a bit).The book was interesting, thiough I'm not fully convinced about its main claim -- that language already started with homo erectus; possible pre-sapiens seafaring is some indication though."

221,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109137015-brian-dahmen,3,"About 300 pages, didn't look so bad, but it got difficult, and I don't mean conceptually, I mean the rhetorical style became trying. Everett takes us from his home field of linguistics through anthropology, archaeology, politics, genetics, and a dozen other side adventures to try and convince us that our predecessors, Homo Erectus, had language. And I so want to know if this is true, so it promised to be a fascinating read. After all, Harari's Sapiens taught me that Erectus was not just our predecessor, but our “older brother” human race, who co-existed with Sapiens, Neanderthals, and at least three other “homo” species alive on earth at the same time, about 200,000 years ago. And Erectus flourished for over a million years on this Earth (before we sapiens likely killed them off); way longer than homo sapiens are likely to survive. Homo Erectus were, perhaps, the original people. But after learning way more about linguistics than I ever cared to, I feel the one piece of circumstantial evidence Everett returns to repeatedly is, while really cool, just not all that convincing: that a band of at least 50 Homo Erectus sailed 200 miles from the mainland to colonize the island of Flores, and they couldn't have possibly done that without language. Its a fascinating concept, but not exactly science, and there's just no hard evidence that they had language. In short, Everett poses a fascinating question: “Did other species in the Homo genus have language?,” and without really giving us much of anything in 300 pages, comes to the resounding “conclusion” that Homo Erectus did, “in fact,” have language. I feel like Everett does little more than bullying us into agreeing with him. After all, how could we prove that Homo Erectus didn't have language?Throughout the book, we are asked to take his word for it on sweeping generalizations and obtuse arguments. Everett sites a lot of other theorists, and takes a good whack at Chomsky, who in spite of his liberal political views could evoke little more than a yawn from me on what he got famous for: grammar. Syntax. A kook. While it's easy to pass on How Language Began, Everett's earlier book Dark Matter of the Mind: The Culturally Articulated Unconscious, sounds ever more appealing. But I suspect its just another cloak for a similar set of arguments, so I'll head back to the library and see what else is there."
222,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/811989-douglas-summers-stay,4,"This makes many of the same points as his other book I read (Language, A Cultural Tool) about how there is no ""language instinct"" but instead language is an invention that makes use of many mental capabilities developed for other purposes. He's primarily pushing back against Chomsky, saying that recursive grammar is an unnecessary and unimportant part of language, and in fact some languages (Piraha) do without it entirely.Instead, Everett argues that language began with the ability to read the signs of the environment-- the understanding that deer prints in the mud and deer droppings indicates that deer were in the area, for example. (I think you could also include the ability to read another person's face and gestures that they make unintentionally.) These he calls (after C.S. Pierce) ""indexes."" They are ""non-intentional, non-arbitrary links between form and meaning."" From there, the earliest language developed icons. Icons are intentional but still non-arbitrary: think how emojis are designed to be used. Beyond icons you have symbols, which are arbitrary linkages, like the connection English makes between the sound ""dog"" and the animal. On top of symbols, language adds compositionality-- the ability to combine two signs such as ""black dog"".Overall, this made a more structured, academic argument than the other book, and I felt like he made his case clearly and thoroughly. At each step, he showed how archaeological evidence supported the idea that language developed with Homo Sapiens' direct ancestor, Homo Erectus, and not before or after that. There are fewer personal stories and details about his time with the Piraha."
223,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1217440-maria,3,"While this author provides an alternate explanation to that of Chomsky’s Universal Grammar (UG) assertions, the evidence he provides to disputes UG is to merely state that he is correct and other scientists are wrong. While he provides cultural scenarios that he deems likely to have happened with Homo Erectus, in particular, he doesn’t quite make the link from cultural necessity to language invention clear beyond: if they needed to work together to complete more complex tasks, such as building boats to travel vast distances , they’d have needed language, so therefore they invented language that later evolved to what is currently what we use. That isn’t convincing enough to me. He does have some very good explanations for how evolution is likely to have happened, but all of this is predicated on a theory that he is right and others are wrong, without making a case for why he’s right. The fact that he simply dismisses ALL of the linguistic work of earlier scientists for his own theories comes across as shortsighted to me in that his explanation for dismissing it all isn’t clear. He simply starts with a premise that his theories are correct and others’ theories are not. That’s bad science and bad academic reasoning. I do appreciate that he positing a new theory, but wish he’d done more to connect the dots to come across as more credible. "
224,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4601217-john,2,"When the author sticks to the history of the science the book is interesting. Too often, however, he cites disparate studies to advance his own theory with is at odds with the scientific consensus.I'm not a scientist, but I expected a more objective summation of the scientific literature based on the title and summary of the book. The author argues throughout the book that language began with homo-erectus. The studies he cites to advance his argument are not necessarily related to language and he frequently uses conjecture to make his point--this really detracted from my experience with the book.It's a shame because I did find the history and a bulk of the research interesting, was introduced to many new linguistic concepts I had never heard of, and particularly enjoyed the last few chapters which went more in to the science. Unfortunately the author circles the wagons at the end to revisit his hypothesis.To be a bit crass--vast sections of the book read more like diatribes than research. I got the impression this was a writer clearly in love with their own voice.I don't mean to diminish the vast scope and knowledge presented in the work--I simply didn't care for how that information was presented through the lens of the author's own opinion."
225,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6076891-sergey-shishkin,2,"After reading Mastery I became interested in Everett's linguistic research and his contrarian view of language evolution. This book however very much disappointed me. It's a way too lengthy debate of the author with his scientific opponents.In a nutshell, Everett's theses are: Language is older than we thought. Homo Erectus probably already had language. Language is not genetically innate. Language and culture co-evolve. Human brain and speech apparatus co-evolved with language. Language grammar continuously evolves more complex (e.g. modal sentences and recursion) or simpler as required by surrounding culture as opposite to a linear evolution point of view.Nothing this book postulates I would argue against, I just wish this highly interesting material was presented in a much shorter, more engaging and constructive form."
226,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3899111-jean,2,"In general the book is meandering snd poorly organized. Starting with the author's experience in the jungle is interesting. Next he takes on a broad, pop science explanation of the science of evolution with some questionable theories : humans lost body hair because they were walking upright and didn't need it to shield from the sun? If he sees any animal shaved he will see their skin underlying the hair is pale. Meaning evolution had to exchange skin pigmentation for hair. Then, before presenting his own theory of the evolution of language, he attacks Norm Chomsky. While it is relevant for him to contrast his theory to Chomsky's, he could at least wait until after he presents his own theory before defending it by attacking another researcher.This is where I stopped reading."
227,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11936064-djcb,3,"Linguist Everett famously lived among the Pirahã people of the Amazon rain forest in Brazil, and described their non-Chomskian (ie., non-recursive) language. In this book he makes a more general, point of how homo gained a language.The books argues that at least since homo erectus must have had language since they had 'culture', and were able to make sea voyages that must have involved planning. This contrasts with the Chomskian view that language evolved much later -- between ca. 200-60K BP (the book misrepresents this a bit).The book was interesting, thiough I'm not fully convinced about its main claim -- that language already started with homo erectus; possible pre-sapiens seafaring is some indication though."

As someone with only a very basic background knowledge of biology and anthropology, I didn't mind the detours and the writing matched my level of comprehension. Unfortunately, the way Everett makes his arguments for his theories is less interesting. Everett has a tendency to disregard other theories or he simply states things to be false, without giving a decent explanation or counterarguments. In that same way, he puts forward ideas or generalizations as logical statements and expects the reader to take his word for it. I listened to the audiobook version while I was on the go (as I think a lot of people do when listening to audiobooks), so the frequent references to the bonus PDF were a bit annoying. "

It takes what ought to be a very interesting subject and grinds it down to the point where it is barley listenable. It would be absolutely impossible to absorb everything in this book unless you were already largely familiar of the concepts it deals with.A large portion of it is also dedicated to what has to be a personal grudge the author has against people who have differing views of the theories involved. There are a fair number of what amount to personal attacks against other experts in the field. There is a very interesting and listenable book here somewhere, but this isn't it. "

If you find language as a human centric skill and how it developed then this book is a good fit for you. I was hoping for a more in depth discussion of how language developed at the beginning. How Erectus communicated. But it seems that the fault is not in the author but in our knowledge. I was able to finish the book and at the end there was some wonderful tidbits addressing the subject I was hoping for.

After all, Harari's Sapiens taught me that Erectus was not just our predecessor, but our “older brother” human race, who co-existed with Sapiens, Neanderthals, and at least three other “homo” species alive on earth at the same time, about 200,000 years ago. And Erectus flourished for over a million years on this Earth (before we sapiens likely killed them off); way longer than homo sapiens are likely to survive. Homo Erectus were, perhaps, the original people. But after learning way more about linguistics than I ever cared to, I feel the one piece of circumstantial evidence Everett returns to repeatedly is, while really cool, just not all that convincing: that a band of at least 50 Homo Erectus sailed 200 miles from the mainland to colonize the island of Flores, and they couldn't have possibly done that without language. Its a fascinating concept, but not exactly science, and there's just no hard evidence that they had language. In short, Everett poses a fascinating question: “Did other species in the Homo genus have language?,” and without really giving us much of anything in 300 pages, comes to the resounding “conclusion” that Homo Erectus did, “in fact,” have language. I feel like Everett does little more than bullying us into agreeing with him. After all, how could we prove that Homo Erectus didn't have language?Throughout the book, we are asked to take his word for it on sweeping generalizations and obtuse arguments. Everett sites a lot of other theorists, and takes a good whack at Chomsky, who in spite of his liberal political views could evoke little more than a yawn from me on what he got famous for: grammar. Syntax. A kook. While it's easy to pass on How Language Began, Everett's earlier book Dark Matter of the Mind: The Culturally Articulated Unconscious, sounds ever more appealing.

In this book he makes a more general, point of how homo gained a language.The books argues that at least since homo erectus must have had language since they had 'culture', and were able to make sea voyages that must have involved planning. This contrasts with the Chomskian view that language evolved much later -- between ca. 200-60K BP (the book misrepresents this a bit).The book was interesting, thiough I'm not fully convinced about its main claim -- that language already started with homo erectus; possible pre-sapiens seafaring is some indication though."

As someone with only a very basic background knowledge of biology and anthropology, I didn't mind the detours and the writing matched my level of comprehension. Unfortunately, the way Everett makes his arguments for his theories is less interesting. Everett has a tendency to disregard other theories or he simply states things to be false, without giving a decent explanation or counterarguments. In that same way, he puts forward ideas or generalizations as logical statements and expects the reader to take his word for it. I listened to the audiobook version while I was on the go (as I think a lot of people do when listening to audiobooks), so the frequent references to the bonus PDF were a bit annoying. "

It takes what ought to be a very interesting subject and grinds it down to the point where it is barley listenable. It would be absolutely impossible to absorb everything in this book unless you were already largely familiar of the concepts it deals with.A large portion of it is also dedicated to what has to be a personal grudge the author has against people who have differing views of the theories involved. There are a fair number of what amount to personal attacks against other experts in the field. There is a very interesting and listenable book here somewhere, but this isn't it. "

How Erectus communicated. But it seems that the fault is not in the author but in our knowledge.

280,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1532739-cary,3,"This was... okay. I think the science behind it is quite reasonable. Certainly giving what we now know about human genetics and neurology it makes far more sense than the opposing view championed by Noam Chomsky and his disciples. That view -- than human ability to use language arose relatively recently and suddenly via a single mutation -- does not jive with the facts that there are no areas of the brain exclusively dedicated to language and language does not engage only one area of the brain, implying that such a mutation event would need to affect several areas of the brain (but not create new structures) as well as parts of human anatomy. Possible? Sure. Likely? No.Instead, Everett proposes that language evolved gradually and as its utility (anthropomorphizing heavily here, but w/e) became obvious to evolution and selection for the parts of our neural and gross anatomy used in linguistic processing and production happened. Brains got bigger and areas within them got tweaked and enlarged to help humans 'do' language. The anatomy of our mouths and throats also underwent modification to enhance our production of speech sounds.The upstart of this is that Neandert[h]als could speak (a view held by most anthropologists and linguists today) and probably our earlier ancestors (e.g., homo erectus) could too (a less common view, but in no way beyond the pale; the author holds this view as well).The problems I had with this book were its unevenness and repetitiveness. At times things were overexplained while at others things were not. Much information is repeated ad nauseam -- for example a quotation about evolution satisficing, though at no point does he bother to point out that it's a portmanteau of satisfy and suffice. Sure, most people either know or will figure it out, but given the repetitive explanations of other things... wtf?Finally, an error that irked me greatly. The author has done a lot of work in the Amazon and purports to speak Portuguese (which, not Spanish, is the official language of Brazil). However, he makes an observation about Portuguese verb conjugation that is flat out wrong. Wrong and something that one would learn in the 2nd week of a course. In the grand scheme of the book it's not a problem, but it is plainly wrong and no one who speaks the language even a little would ever claim. This sort of thing makes me wonder what other plainly wrong things are stated as facts."

In this book he makes a more general, point of how homo gained a language.The books argues that at least since homo erectus must have had language since they had 'culture', and were able to make sea voyages that must have involved planning. This contrasts with the Chomskian view that language evolved much later -- between ca. 200-60K BP (the book misrepresents this a bit).The book was interesting, thiough I'm not fully convinced about its main claim -- that language already started with homo erectus; possible pre-sapiens seafaring is some indication though."
288,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77744562-brian-bakker,3,"This was an interesting read. As someone with only a very basic background knowledge of biology and anthropology, I didn't mind the detours and the writing matched my level of comprehension. Unfortunately, the way Everett makes his arguments for his theories is less interesting. Everett has a tendency to disregard other theories or he simply states things to be false, without giving a decent explanation or counterarguments. In that same way, he puts forward ideas or generalizations as logical statements and expects the reader to take his word for it. I listened to the audiobook version while I was on the go (as I think a lot of people do when listening to audiobooks), so the frequent references to the bonus PDF were a bit annoying. "
289,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3130865-daniel-currie,2,"I listened to the unabridged audiobook version of this (without the bonus PDF).I have no idea if this is meant as a textbook or not, but it certainly comes across as one. It takes what ought to be a very interesting subject and grinds it down to the point where it is barley listenable. It would be absolutely impossible to absorb everything in this book unless you were already largely familiar of the concepts it deals with.A large portion of it is also dedicated to what has to be a personal grudge the author has against people who have differing views of the theories involved. There are a fair number of what amount to personal attacks against other experts in the field. There is a very interesting and listenable book here somewhere, but this isn't it. "
290,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7095999-rob,3,"It was ok but not as good as his book Don’t Sleep, There Are Snakes.Key points:– language evolved slowly, not a big bang– Homo Erectus had sophisticated language– language is integrated with culture, cannot consider one without the other– Chomsky is an idiotMy criticism:1) strong opinions backed by weak data, for example “early hominids traveled long distances, therefore they must have had language”2) no discussion of the most interesting questions:a) what happened to cognitive capabilities and language at the emergence of behaviorally modern humans?b) why are humans the only species with complex language?c) why are humans the only species with a culture that has gods?"
291,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7555965-jan-havlis,3,"i have quite mixed feelings towards the book. on one side, it contains some interesting ideas and formulations, on the other, there are lots of trivialities, strange conclusions and also some misunderstandings (mostly in fields far from the author's). i thought the books will be more scientific, but it is rather popular. that is not bad per se, just a small disappointment (mostly cos of lacking citations to some interesting claims). the books is still inspiring, i would recommend it to lay person interested in the topic, and also to linguists for at least some new angles of viewing things in study of language evolution."
292,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6451950-wendy-williams,3,I really really wanted to love this book. And it’s not a bad book just not what I was hoping for. If you find language as a human centric skill and how it developed then this book is a good fit for you. I was hoping for a more in depth discussion of how language developed at the beginning. How Erectus communicated. But it seems that the fault is not in the author but in our knowledge. I was able to finish the book and at the end there was some wonderful tidbits addressing the subject I was hoping for. 
293,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10821439-kseniya,3,"I feel as if, although there was a clear surplus of random information (technically on topic), there was absolutely no new information for me to intake. And ""the story"" (from the title) isn't really narrated in a very story-like fashion. Nothing gripping or anything a reader can project themselves onto. No actual ""story"" to follow. This book is written like a giant peer reviewed journal article. Like sitting through a lecture in a college class you just went to to get an easy a. Reads the same way monotone sounds."
294,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6334999-jennifer,2,"This book was in a strange place where it was too advanced for beginners, but too basic for people who are already familiar with linguistic concepts. I'm not a linguist per se (I did not study it formally, but I work in a related field) and I still felt like this missed the mark for me. There were some interesting passages and information included, and I do feel like I learned some things through reading (listening) to it. But overall, I'm not sure I would recommend this as a good introduction to linguistics or the evolution of language over our species' histories."
295,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6476980-rebecka,3,"Very interesting! I’m so intrigued by the Pirahã, and I’m guessing Everett must have written an entire book about them. That being said, I wish I had read this book instead of listened to it. There is extra material for the audiobook, but when I listen to books I’m always doing something else, so I won’t actually look at it... Also, there is just so MUCH in this book that I think you need a marker and some sticky notes to do the reading experience justice. "
296,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13605644-joseph,1,"The author is very intelligent. He offers some interesting ideas. More often, however, he runs off on self-aggrandizing tangents or rants against scholars who disagree with him.""How Language Began"" would be a good book if its author someday learned ""how arrogant language really pisses off the reader."""
297,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44200098-anthony-zacharzewski,2,Interesting ideas but a strange balance of style (mostly zippy but occasionally stodgy) and level of expertise (mostly generalist but occasionally highly technical). Plus a sense that this is just a set of ideas and no one knows the actual truth. 
298,0871407957,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27745736-kayson-fakhar,4,"This book delivered its promise. Easy to follow, scientifically accurate (as far as I can tell!), engaging, and on point. There's a lot about evolution and neuroscience here and interestingly the book does a good job myth-busting the common but controversial issues in both. So yeah, go for it. "
