0,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1733683-petra,4,"A really interesting books with many aspects and ways of looking at reproduction methods in many species, gender selection, the ""war"" between male and female DNA and an interesting fact-based speculation on what may lay ahead for human survival in terms of DNA. Sykes lays out the science of DNA investigation in an interesting and understandable way. He states what has been learned, what it means, what is still left unanswered. He then goes to investigate such things as families who have boy over girls for generations on end (and vice versa; those who have girls over boys for generations) and why, from a DNA aspect, this may happen because, naturally, having only one sex threatens future generations. In the final third of the book, Sykes speculates on the future of human reproduction, taking into account some interesting aspects of mankind that affect reproduction into the future. Although speculations at this point, Sykes brings into the discussions as much of the proven and being-researched DNA & scientific evidence that is currently available to him and other scientists. Completely interesting, whether one sides with the speculations or not.I've enjoyed both of the books by Bryan Sykes that I've read: this one and The Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry. He writes as if he's talking with the reader in an everyday discussion. He's entertaining, educational and not afraid to look beyond the known into the possibilities while realizing that the possibilities may change as more information becomes known and proven. "

The first half of the book is absolutely fascinating and I enjoyed reading about the likely origins and the evolutionary advantages of sexual reproduction, how certain species gave up on sex, as well as the reproduction methods of the blue-headed wrasse, the bdelloid rotifers, the aphids and the sea turtles. Who knew that there is a sea worm species called Bonellia viridis where the tiny males live inside a female's womb? In the second half, however, the science becomes hazier and the writing more speculative. Somewhere between the adventurous genes of the Vikings and the musings of the earth goddess Gaia, Sykes lost a bit of his persuasive power. Still, this is an entertaining read, recommended to anyone who is interested in reproduction methods, evolutionary biology and the role of our genes."
2,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2439329-keith-davis,3,"Most of the book is a very interesting discussion of genetic research focusing on the male Y chromosome. In the later part of the book the author explores his controversial thesis that males are ultimately doomed because of the inability of the Y chromosome to repair itself through recombination. This may or may not be correct, but one gets the distinct impression that the author is hoping that it is true and that the far future will be a women only utopia, with female babies produced through egg to egg ICSI genetic implantation."
3,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5897334-thieluar,0,"I actually wrote a book report for this. Here's a summary of it with some of my ideas about it.Throughout the history of the world, every event has lead to the collective knowledge of humanity. Since the early tribes, knowledge has been regarded as something useful yet equally something to fear. For it is the fear of every person to discover things that will lead to leave that enclosed cave of thought. Everyone is feeling warm and cozy inside it and whatever the cost may be, they don’t want to come out to discover what is truly real. Some take advantage of this to enrich themselves. While a very small community is trying to get people out of their fantasy and make them face the facts. Dr. Brian Sykes is one of them. Although we differ in opinions, the purpose is the same. To discover what is real and prepare for it. Now, I shall lead you through one of his books. It is a book entitled: Adam’s Curse. The story begins with a simple quest. Dr. Brian Sykes was to investigate whether the owner of Glaxo Wellcome. Mr. Richard Sykes was related to him or not. He takes his blood sample and finds out that both their Y-Chromosomes (Y-C’s) match perfectly. But why? Enthralled to learn more about this matter, he begins searching for the past history of the Sykes family tree and finds detailed information about how names came to be in England. With the help of a friend, he then finds the place where the original Mr. Sykes lived. His name was Henri del Sike. His house had been constructed between two sykes. Nowadays everyone knows the basics of Y for men and X for woman. But back in the day. Scientists took a long journey to discover what made a man a man and a woman a woman. First, there was an experiment with fruit flies. I will not go into details but the whole experiment ended with the wrong assumption that what determined sex on the flies, also determined sex on humans. After many other errors, a Chinese student discovering how to put chromosomes in order, Murray Barr discovering the Barr body and many notices of more chromosomes than there should be in humans. Pat Jacobs and John Strong made the final contribution and it was finally stated that if you have a Y-C you are male. If you don’t, you’re a female. To tip that, within the Y-C there is a “master switch”. Which is the one that detours the body of a female, to take the road of a man. That switch is a gene called SRY. On the natural world there are many species that have quite a different approach to sex than humans do. But the idea is all the same. Men are there for their sperm and in some cases protection of the females. Also on many reptiles the way of determining sex is decided while they are still inside the egg. Basically if the temperature is cold a male will be born. If it is hot, a female will be born. But the animal I see as most fascinating is the honey bee, which has an extremely matriarchal society. There are about twenty males only producing sperm. The queen controls the sex of the egg. Thus the colony is basically females. In sexual or asexual reproduction, there is one truth. Asexual reproduction will have the advantage of speed but the disadvantage of no genetic variation. Sexual reproduction will have the disadvantage of being slow but the advantage of much genetic variation. This means that if a virus finds out how to kill one asexual organism, it can wipe out the complete species. However, in a sexual organism the virus would just kill a small part of the population. The view of evolution has changed much since Darwin. The original natural selection (survival of the fittest) has been supplanted by group selection (survival of the group) and then afterwards a great man called William Hamilton changed completely the view of selection to that of survival of the genes, concluding that the point of sex as a whole is to pass on the genes. To complement this idea there is a whole explanation of how it could have been that the structure of the cell formed by the nucleus imprisoning the mitochondria in the beginning of the planet. Dr. Bryan Sykes starts playing with words and makes the reader start thinking of the nucleus as “evil” because it supposedly enslaved the mitochondria. If the mitochondria is there, it is because it got into contact with everything around it and fit perfectly with it. There is not any want in these things; there is no desire or possession of anything because there is no conscience. Our own conscience is the one that makes us start personalizing things without personality and makes our point of view err. Supposedly, to evade war within the cell the nucleus divided the cell into two sexes to prolong its own survival. Within men the Y-C is passed on to their sons and within woman the mtDNA is passed on to their daughters. Supposedly the Y-C wants this to keep on going and thus rule above all else but the mtDNA wants this to stop because it does not gain anything from it. Apparently even though this is going on, females seem to have fun with men. Through the concept called sexual selection. It is seen quite well in all species. It works like this: Both sexes wish to reproduce. A man will reproduce with the first female that steps in front of him. However, females are very picky with this and will only want to reproduce with the male that impresses her. The most popular example is that of the peacock where the male who has the most beautiful fail will spread it, do a little dance and hopefully if everything goes well. He will be able to spread his seed. There is another side to this. The constant demand for a more beautiful and bigger tail in males will lead to the species’ males to evolve bigger tails, until they are so big that the male will not be able to stand or will be too slow to run away from predators. Something similar happens with elephant seals. The demand for bigger males is so big that they end up stepping on their own offspring. This is the result of letting sexual selection take control of evolution. While analyzing mtDNA Dr. Sykes had discovered that all Europeans came from 7 “clan” mothers. They have been the ones that have survived for thousands of years through mtDNA. The oldest clan mother is called “eve” with about 140,000 years of age. However, when analyzing male Y-C he found out that the oldest genetic ancestor was about 49,000 years ago. After this there is a series of experiments done by Dr. Sykes himself. He first discovers that a small percentage of rarotonga men in the pacific islands had a European ancestor. Then the desperate attempt of the Vikings to pass on their Y-C. Afterwards, it is discovered that the Y-C of Somerled, a great Irish warrior of the days of yore, was able to create half a million copies of itself in just 900 years. Which is a huge achievement for a Y-C. But why? Perhaps because of the wealth Somerled left his descendants. The same thing happened with Genghis Khan. The influence his family had on Y-C’s is deduced today to 16 million copies. So, if a man has much wealth then there is a high chance his Y-C will be passed on with more frequency. Thus, property is the key to immortality, at least on the genetic level. In the figure shown in the book of Y-C frequency there were remnants of other Y-C’s but there had lost their battles and perished because of their weakness. What else is a factor in Y-C survival? What if the Y-C somehow discovered a way to shift the balance and have more chance of his offspring getting to be a male than a female? Or what if the mtDNA found another way to do the opposite? Apparently there are families with a tendency to have more males than females and vice-versa. However in men the probabilities of having more men than females is raised by the quantity of testosterone. Thus just demonstrates that there is a war going on between Y-C and mitochondria (mt). Before this got so clear, humanity was basically moving with nature until we acquired the concept of property. This changed everything and unlocked Adam’s curse. Property now was a tool the Y-C had to battle his proclaimed “enemy” the mt. This was a double edged sword so to speak, it brought many problems to humans. Thanks to this we are destroying our own planet and ourselves in the process. Property triggered a train that today is going too fast to stop and may eventually kill us all. Men are the pilots of this train sure, but they are not entirely at fault. Men did all this on the account that woman will like it with the purpose of mating they will do whatever it is asked from them. Where eve goes, Adam is bound to follow. Females have also the ability to fight back against males. It is shown in some insects and there has been one family in humans that had 78 daughters and not one son. Apparently some mt have the ability to influence the fertility of their sons. It is speculated that perhaps a homosexual son, is a way to benefit the female’s daughters. After this point there is mainly much speculation. I criticize the fact that he attempts to make the reader see the Y-C as “evil”, undesirable and useless. It is the Y-C who dropped the end of WWII and if one quotes history there are innumerable events that prove that men have caused much suffering to the planet and to itself. But it is exactly this that has gotten to us where we are now. For if we didn’t have this greed and ambition we would probably be just another species in a planet without intelligence. Life is about trial and error and through our existence in this planet humans have had to make ALL the errors so we might properly learn. Thus, we are how we are today, we still make errors yet we don’t err so often. True, 80% of females in third world countries have had the clitoris’ cut at birth and I can add countless deeds of this kind to our black book. But most men won’t kill a man for the same petty reasons we would have done so 2000 years ago. There is still a high percentage of murder in the world but I can confidently say we have gotten better at organizing ourselves. There is still hope in men. The Y-C will disappear in 125,000 years. Until then men can repent for what they did to woman, to gaia and to themselves. Do men deserve a second chance? That is not for me to decide, that is for the people living in that era to choose. I, however can just give my opinion and through actions persuade people to change. So instead of men ruling a society of destruction. Both male and woman can rule a society of peace."
4,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20481392-james-biser,4,"This book is a fantastic review of a huge amount of human genetic research of the past century since genetics was discovered and explored. This research is combined with historic knowledge of the world and the understanding of human migration and settling. This book is a wonderful education.The book also discusses the fact that unless some changes are made, the Y chromosome and also men will go extinct. One species of mammal has solved the problem through mutation. With human advancements in genetic manipulation, we should be capable of solving the problem. Perhaps we will keep men, perhaps not."
5,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23824348-mary,4,"a very readable book by a geneticist; surprisingly he links his research on human's y-chromosome and what he thinks is its link to the sexual attraction of wealth, power and influence to the demise of goddess worship; it's a fascinating premise which ties in so perfectly with my world view and interest in the goddess; I suspect that this view would diminish him among his fellow scientists; I definitely want to read his first book now, The Seven Daughters of Eve "
6,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11200007-douglas-cosby,5,"The best explanation of cell replication and recombinant DNA that I have ever read. Also, a spectacular explanation of why there are two sexes. The only reason this is not a perfect book is because some of Sykes conclusions/predictions/extrapolations are silly. I will keep this as a permanent part of the Science section of my personal library."
7,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4996855-timothy-riley,3,"Sykes interweaves discoveries of his own DNA in with larger points about fertilization, asexual and sexual reproduction and the general health of humans. I think I knew already about the large numbers of animals that ""decide"" on the sex of their offspring by the temperatures of the eggs before they hatch. There is a definite climate change connection here and the end result can be predicted but is unknown. Sykes goes through how humans have long tried to decide themselves the gender of their babies through fads and stories as well as taking deadly action after birth. He notes there are currently 40 million more men in India than women following decades, maybe centuries of aborting female embroyos. (It is my speculation that Indian men are hence a little ""grabby"" as a stereotype and they have a masculine dominated culture as well as possibly tens of millions of men who know they will never find a mate)There is a battle of the sexes going on between the Y chromosome and the mitochondria. Y chromosomes have been largely stripped of much of their genetic power-contain only mitochondria to power the sperm and are predominantly waste with very few viable working pieces. That being said the Y chromosome has found a way to spread over the globe in ways unlike mitochondrial DNA. For instance in Polynesia nearly one third of the seemingly native men did NOT arrive with other polynesian settlers but are direct male descendants of Europeans. Same is said for large groups of previously believed to be native americans in latin america and of course those of african descent in the US. Mitochondrial DNA is not so worried about this, as those populations are almost always nearly 100% ""authentic"" to the region-Incan, polynesian and african. The other example is of Iceland whose women are only half viking and have celtic or british while the men are almost completely nordic. Many of the vikings having settled in britain before sailing away with their local bride to iceland for cheap land. "
8,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11736614-dana,4,"This book talked clearly about the fever of Y chromosome and how it won against the X chromosome. The ancient battle between both chromosomes and how they even fight each other in the womb of the mother. How the fight can goes on after having a birth and how different cultures had to deal with the new babies. The age of Vikings and their insistent  urge of men to mate with as many women as they can and posibble. As their first born sons accumulated wealth enough to collect more women and the unfortunate brother should seek the mating apportunity far at another lands. Sexual selection acts through wealth and power. It has several distributions about the balance between the two sexesY chromosome is definitely involved in deciding the sex of the fetus, not Mitochondrial DNA. Even though both sexes need Mitochondrial DNA and the NUCLEAR chromosome did its best to capture Mitochondrial gene over the course of evolution. How SRY gene is the solution for the Y chromosome and how the Mole Vole came up and developed a self defense mechanism to protect its Y chromosome from going extinct How the sperms are getting less by time and how we are going to face an age with no sperms enough. With a percent of 1% each 5.000 years. It means no more than 125.000 years. Unless Y chromosome came up with a solution to save itself.  Plus the other obstacles that Y chromosome is facing, which is the mutations that hit the sperms more than the eggs in women. Because of the non stop producing of the sperms unlike the eggs. Each time a mutation happen in the DNA of the sperms. It weaken it till the time it will become extinct and vanish away"
9,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4474550-siobhan,4,"I have just begun this book, a recommendation from my sister, a biologist by profession and genetic researcher by inclination. I read The Seven Daughters of Eve and I think it helpful to have that in one's internal library prior to examining this thesis but the two can be read independently.He does worry about the future of the human race if only because of the problems faced by the Y chromosone but I have yet to reach the precise reasons. I have scanned the part where he tests with DNA many men with his last name in a part of England where numerous ""Sykes"" reside and discovers e vast majority of them all possess the exact same Y chromosone! Needless to say, I found the quite intriguing. He briefly raises the issue of adoption and grandparents who raise grankids this breaking the chain if you will or in geneological terms a branch of So, if my grandfather - and it has to be male obviously - and his spouse opted to raise a daughter's son and that son was presumed to be and for all intents and purposes was their son, that line of the family would disappear in biological terms! No identical Y chromosone. Mitochondrial DNA would of course be entirely different and this topic is covered in the book re Eve et al. I suspect in the final analysis between Sykes, the National Geographic research project and orhers, we may well find out forget the six degrees of separation and realize we are family (like the song says, ) which is what one certainly discovers in the NG program - which my sister used (and her DNA is close to mine, though we have no Y chromosome) and we discovered our roots go way back to parts of the promised land and near Egypt which really, one hardly needed to spend any money to know. There are a variety of others in there of course, with as family like mine, the Irish warriers and their Spanish/Viking influences for one.There are certain historical figures of the past (think 1500's) that we have been told during our lives we could be related to and certainly I scoffed at such notions but I doubt someone would allow just anyone to show up with a swabbed cheek result asking to compare it to some long buried historical figure,  I keep wondering if such individuals - think of Roman Catholic Saints who have alledgedly touched pieces of clothing and these tiny bits are included in ""medals"" and often sold. What if one conducted DNA on them? Would we find the Saint's DNA? Would the committee that oversees this even permit it to happen? (Congregation for the Promotion of Saints or some such organization) I renvision this parade of people visiting Rome to see if they might be related to say Theresa of Avilla or Joan of Arc or Francis of Assisi (an animal lover who seemed like a good guy and deserving of his ""stature""). However, I just see an entire new industry for groups seeking money and publicity here, not just the Vatican. Askanazi Jews could line up to check out how they might be related to Abraham and Sarah. Among others. However, this is NOT the thesis of the book! It is Sykes' very controversial prediction that unless serious action is taken, males could become extinct! Adam represent the typical male just as Eve was every woman in the first book. Granted, this may happen in 125,000 years which means the Y chromosome has a worse chance of disappearing should the Iranian be allowed to continue a nuclear program or an asteroid hits the earth. Sykes opins that ultimately the degredation of the Y chromosone which has played havoc with male procreation - for which a Y chromosone is absolutely essential.I still have to complete the book and it is really too early to write this much but I think I prefered the Seven Daughters of Eve which was a sientific map for all of us and allowed anyone- even people sans a genetics course or two or those like me who have and were urged to learn about work that emphasized the study of fruit flies, the emminant wotk of Watson and Crick and how to counsel families who might have to make difficult decisions regarding their family of they had a hereditary illness. Sykes at least brings it all together and adds it to the trendy hobby of North Americans and some Europeans of seeking their family history. I am frankly concerned about these instant companies offering to take your DNA and trace your history for a substantial fee. The money seems too much for too little work (They send the consumer a kit and s/he does all the work!) but ethically, what happens to the DNA? Just like emails and texting kept in huge servers literally forever or able to be tracked by several agencies, what happens to this DNA? Just like a large database of emails and other information people volnteer online, any organization with an incredible database of the DNA of millionsof people possesses a veritable ""gold"" mine of what should be very private data. However, one needs to ask how safe and secure irt is and how it will inevitably will be used? These are private companies with little govt regulation in most contries - almost all actually - and despite the good intentions of most, one can only imagine what nefarious actions could occur ofd the wrong people took over? This is not in the book but DNA is more and more being used even in nanotechnology and it is in a sense the last bastion of privacy yet the barriers are beginninhg to break down. I*n the meaantime, before I finish reading the book, perhaps those men in this generation can save their Y chromosones for the future should the worst occur 125 centuries or so from now.More later...."

Where? I think I know a couple of evil masterminds that are female. And that moment I saw the ""sex tips from fish"" chapter on the table of contents....

15,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/776599-steve,3,"I have previously read Sykes other popular science book - THE SEVEN DAUGHTERS OF EVE - and liked it immensely. I find this work to be something of a disappointment, actually, when compared to the prior work. Sykes does present valuable and useful information in this book, and his style is still very good, although not up to SEVEN DAUGHTERS standards. My overwhelming sense was that SEVEN DAUGHTERS was much more grounded and scientific, whereas this book was much more speculative. By the time Sykes wrote SEVEN DAUGHTERS, he had been engaged in at least a decade of debate and contention with other scientists about the meaning of mitochondrial DNA research. While the scientific consensus can suppress scientific creativity and innovation, it also has the function of weeding out weakness in arguments. Like DNA copying itself, this process is not perfect, but it has proven intellectual value. In SEVEN DAUGHTERS, Sykes, like any good academic, presents a balanced view of both sides while pushing his own opinion primarily. This is how the game is done. This is particularly important when it comes to popular science. It is important to canvass the field and to be careful and cautious with what is presented. Humility can be a virtue here. One of the signature qualities of the public is that they are not equipped to judge arguments alone, which is why good popular science writers do have to spell things out more.ADAM'S CURSE, however, feels and sounds much more like the kind of writing that scientists make to each other when trying to establish a new point of view within a discipline. When talking to other specialists, this is acceptable. All sides know much of the evidence, and they are equipped to judge the veracity of the points that are being made. Inevitably, weak aspects of the argument are stripped away, and if the core can marshall enough evidence, then at least some scientists will be persuaded. Sykes wrote SEVEN DAUGHTERS *after* this had happened. I feel that Sykes did a mischief publishing the material in ADAM'S CURSE because it is less nuanced and balanced. By profession and training I am a sociologist, so I am NOT knowledgable about the state of the discipline in DNA studies. However, *as*a sociologist, I can detect if an argument has been 'proven in the court of academic opinion' or not. Sykes makes the claim that the Y chromosome - which provides the genetic trigger to make an embryo male - is disintegrating. This is because it cannot fuse with the X chromosome, which would serve as a check on harmful mutation. However, a cursory Google search on this topic revealed that there still a lively scientific debate about the speed and the inevitablity of this process. This is NOT to say that Sykes is wrong, but he does not take care to present alternative evidence and he may have published this book too soon.Aside from this quibble, the book itself is in a inferior form to the SEVEN DAUGHTERS. One of the pitfalls of a good author is that they have to conform to expectations set by their own works. The better one's previous works are, the better one's subsequent books should be. This is of course one of the things that can lead to long gaps between an author's books, the fear that the second book will not be received anywhere as well as the first book. My sense is that ADAM'S CURSE was somewhat rushed, he does not clearly refer to the disintegration of the Y chromosome in the first third of the book. His writing is good, but the book could have stood several more rounds of editing. Having written and graded many papers, I well know the pain of revision, but it is a very necessary evil. Better organization would have helped me enjoy this book more. I am no less harsh on my own work. Still, this is a lot better than other dross out there, it is just that I expected more from Mr. Sykes. Hopefully, he will do better next time. "
16,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4568918-courtney,3,"Bryan Sykes is a scientist. Bryan Sykes is a very brilliant scientist. Bryan Sykes is worlds ahead of historians and sociologists. Bryan Sykes is, dare I say it, invincible. If you know anything by the end (or, even, the beginning) of Adam’s Curse, it will be this. Bryan Sykes himself never loses an opportunity to laud his own achievements. On his journey to find the origin of his own “Sykes Y-chromosome” (after, he assures us, he has mapped out the genetic history of all women on Earth, NBD), Adam’s Curse attempts to lead the reader on a journey to discover the triumphs, losses and probable future without the Y-chromosome, according to Bryan Sykes. What results is more of a mash-up of notes on the contentious relationship between mtDNA and the Y-chromosome, a brief interlude into the world of historical man whores and, you guessed it, the Triumphs and More Triumphs of Me, Bryan Sykes. True to his word, Adam’s Curse is initially a rundown of Sykes's own Y-chromosome and what a future without the chromosome could mean. Some species have learned to do with it, says Sykes, and so could potentially every species. But eventually I started seeing less and less of what the book promised, and more and more about mtDNA and, of all things, Genghis Khan. What readers may expect to be more about the male prospective of this material is really not, instead hijacked by Sykes's fascination with the maternally inherited mtDNA. It never truly becomes about the unique Y-chromosome, but more about the struggles between it and the female counterpart, mtDNA. And insert self-praises here. Sykes's initial voice was unpleasant and presumptuous, as if he had done the world some great favor by switching on his microscope everyday. This made Adam’s Curse difficult to read objectively, but eventually I stopped noticing it or Sykes really did scale back, and the language took on an unassuming delivery I much preferred. I was especially softened by chapter fourteen, when Sykes reprimanded various others scientists in his field for criticizing mitochondria for being only a single system, consequently only unveiling one facet of genetic history. He obviously has a great appreciation for the mitochondrial line.Expectedly, Adam’s Curse did have a small tendency to overindulge in information output. As it was written in a level meant to accommodate the non-scientist reader, I was surprised at how much emphasis was placed on Syke's various procedures and experiments. It grated, and did not contribute enough to the meat of the material to warrant its depth.Where my experience with Adam’s Curse suffered were in two places: his voice - he needed us to know how important he was at all times, and in the lack of any cohesive dedication to the book's premise. He ricochets from the so-called war between mtDNA and Y-chromosome to strange chapters about Mother Earth’s anger to the supposition that men are inherently violent. His thoughts never settled in any over-arching way, and it was hard to make conclusions about the information given and the information promised. If you want to know anything about your Y-chromosome, the endurance of the sexes or about the power-struggles of the Vikings, then Adam’s Curse may be to your liking. But if you were hoping for an organized and compelling read on the genetics of male-inherited violence or dominance, I would maybe search elsewhere. "
17,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1840534-matt,3,"There were a lot of interesting tidbits in this book, but I found Sykes' overall argument somewhat lacking. His thesis seemed to consist of two points: 1) our obsession with wealth and power (and the destruction of the Earth that has come from that) is attributable to the Y chromosome's desire to replicate itself, and its success in doing so through sexual selection, and 2) thankfully for us, the Y chromosome is particularly prone to mutation and has no natural means of fixing those mutations, so over time, the Y chromosome will disappear, and with it, men.If I understood his argument correctly, our Ferraris, and mansions, and attempts to conquer the globe, are essentially human males' version of peacock feathers. These things (wealth, power, etc.) are what human males use to attract (or, as he freely admits, coerce) human females. He attributes this drive to acquire more wealth, power, etc. at any cost to the Y chromosomes innate desire to replicate itself. He also discusses the rise of agriculture as the thing that allowed the Y chromosome to thrive. He argues that the hunter-gatherer lifestyle did not allow for women to have children more than once every four or five years, because they needed to pay more attention to the child and needed to contribute more to the community. Agriculture changed that, and allowed women to be, more or less, constantly pregnant. In other words, the Y chromosome could go wild.I'm not clear why agriculture changed the way women select their partners, though. Presumably for thousands and thousands of years, women selected their partners based on certain traits (our equivalent of the peacock's feathers). Why did that selection criteria change? He does freely admit that agriculture led to the abuse of women as well, so they were not always doing much ""selecting,"" in the common sense of the word. But still, this seems like a big shift in a fundamentally biological process. He presents a compelling argument, but I'm not fully convinced. I do think men are to blame for basically all of the problems facing the world today, but I'm not fully on board with saying it's the Y chromosome's desire to replicate itself.His second main argument is that the Y chromosome is doomed. And he presents a strong argument that this is the case - infertility among men is on the rise, and the Y chromosome is particularly prone to mutation, which will make that trend continue, until all men are infertile. But this is not simply the end of men, this is the end of humanity. He does state that two women, with laboratory assistance, could reproduce, and fair enough - we could have a future of all women, reproducing through an amended IVF process. But if we're willing to factor in IVF and similar procedures, then infertile men could still reproduce - even if their sperm are deformed, they can fertilize an egg with medical assistance. The likelihood of foregoing the latter for a future more like the former seems vanishingly slim. I see his point - the Y chromosome is fatally flawed, and maybe we'd be better off in a world with only women anyway, but the argument seems a bit overblown. On the whole, though, a very interesting and thought-provoking read!"
18,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549584-yzabel-ginsberg,3,"First thing first, I don't have a scientific background. I majored in human sciences (History and English Lit & Civilisation), and the only classes I've ever had about genetics were in my sophomore year in high school. Yet the subject holds quite some interest for me, and I was glad that I managed to understand pretty much what was written in this book. It wasn't that much of a given.I appreciated the picture Brian Sykes draws of species' reproduction—what happens with the 'cloning species' vs. the 'sexual species'. This book gave me quite a few things to mull about and look into. A lot of what was presented in it is closer to speculation, and thus can't be taken at face value, just like that, but I found the reasoning behind it compelling and quite justified. I also enjoyed reading about the scientific procedures involved, even though they probably occupy a little too much space in the text.On the other hand, this book could do with a different structure. At times, I had the feeling that the author was jumping to something different, only to go back later to his first point, and so on. It tends to disrupt the flow in the demonstration, so to speak. Other elements could and should have been put aside (I didn't care much for the passages in which he waxed lyrical—I wanted the scientific facts, after all). And in my opinion, too little space was devoted to properly dealing with the actual question of ""will men go extinct, or not?"" (it was quite the pitch on the cover, and in the end, it felt as if it hadn't been addressed as much as other points).All in all, I enjoyed reading it, but I'm not sure someone with a more solid scientific background than mine would get that much out of it."
19,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6441183-caf,4,"An incredibly interesting book on genetics! Sykes is an engaging writer and explains his ideas thoroughly, which is good as I didn't take any biological sciences during high school and only recently started looking into it. He doesn't really get onto the topic of men's inevitable extinction until the last couple of chapters, and everything before it, while very interesting, is basically a briefing on genetic history and his journey on developing this thesis statement. From what I can tell, he has agreeable ethical and political views, and is without a doubt exceptionally good at balancing science and entertainment, I just wish he'd have devoted at least a paragraph in the introduction to the reminder that his terminology is only in terms of genetics - a given for sure, and although he brings up the genetic discussion around homosexuality/males with XX & females with XY, and mentions transgender peoples, there is no mention of intersex peoples which itched me every time he said ""the two sexes""/""female vs. male""/any general implication that sex is 'one or the other'. Besides that, he is still feminist friendly and very informative, even if a little waffle-y with some of his metaphors, and I am very eager to read his other book The Seven Daughters of Eve."
20,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1080638-joyce,2,"Since a good part of what my company does is focused on genetic ancestry, I figured I ought to bone up on what the Y chromosome can tell us (and got the bonus of learning a bit more about mitochondrial DNA since he couldn't help but slip that in as well). While he did tell a number of interesting stories about discoveries led to through the study of the Y chromosome, the book eventually devolves into Dr. Sykes's self-indulgent and hypothesizing, which he generally doesn't support with fact. I find it a bit irresponsible to mix fact with possible fiction so blithely, because if you're not used to reading this sort of thing, it's not always obvious where one ends and the other begins.The self-consciously flowery prose got to me eventually too. It just wasn't evoking the Scottish Highlands and that gets tiring.That being said, he is a much better writer than most scientists. And at least he tries!"
21,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/918165-emma-kaufmann,4,"Pretty interesting stuff. In Sykes' view, the human male's chromosome has been the major factor in human evolution and cultural development. Not only determining gender, it acts through a feedback loop. More powerful, aggressive males tend to reinforce their role in selecting mates and propagating traits in offspring. Today the planet is carpeted with humanity, the result of a society dominated by the Y-chromosome. When hunter-gatherer societies took up agriculture, it ""chained women"" to ""serial pregnancies"", depriving them of the ""relaxation of a sedentary existence"" while producing additional farm workers. The resulting population explosion ultimately drove the creation of our industrialized, polluting society. This condition, in Sykes' view, is now leading to a depletion of the Y-chromosome's prowess. Ultimately, he argues, human males will be replaced by a society of women. Whether men will be kept as breeding stock he doesn't predict. "
22,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2616745-mark,4,"Very interesting indeed. I'm just not completely satisfied with Sykes' explanation of just how, mechanically, genes are really the driving, almost willful force behind natural selection. So the force of the Y-chromosome, not will as a neurological process, was what led the Vikings and Genghis Khan to conquer, dominate, acquire wealth, subjugate & impregnate the village women? The more I think about it, I can guess he's saying that the genes that make the body produce testosterone in a given quantity are switched on by the Y-chromosome. But to me there's just a little too much anthropomorphism going on in his explanations. But definitely a good read, for the most part. Not at all dry. I plan to read Sykes' Saxons, Vikings and Celts next, since I recently learned my Y-chromosome haplotype, coming by way of Scotland, probably means I'm descended from Viking marauders myself!"
23,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1008236-bookmarks-magazine,0,"Sykes, a geneticist at Oxford who studies DNA to help explain human history, explored mDNA and the origins of women in The Seven Daughters of Eve. Here, he turns to their stronger or weaker half, depending on who's talking. He draws from different scientific fields to map out the battle between the sexes at its tiniest level. Some parts are riveting, other parts are too speculative: is homosexuality really a subversive matriarchal tactic? Overall, Sykes fascinates with asides that resemble those of the best science writers, but leaves too many vague ideas about genetic determinism floating around. Still, it's a compelling read, the ""dark side of the maternal tale"" told in his previous book (Cleveland Plain Dealer). This is an excerpt from a review published in Bookmarks magazine."
24,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/278544-kara,5,"I've been interested in genetics since the 8th grade when I did my first punnett square. So that is probably why I really loved this book, despite it's controversial nature. (That women are the 'superior' sex, men's Y chromosome is a weakened one, and the entire gender will eventually be extinct)There's also an interesting (and also controversial) chapter on homosexuality -- nature vs nurture type stuff. Definitely open for argument though, I'm sure. For me it seemed a bit slow getting into it, but overall I found it to be very interesting from both a social and scientific standpoint. "
25,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/875883-lucas,3,"The biology of gender parts of this book are interesting, though there a couple of narrative sections I didn't care for at all: The first is a first person account of the author in the lab doing genetic tests in excessive detail, the other is a children's book like story of 'Gaia' watching the rise of humanity over geological time.Many experiments the author carries out lack scientific rigor but I'll grant that he his only making an illustration for a popular audience and not trying to submit something to a journal.Lots of speculative science and several very radical solutions to the 'Adam's Curse', all very intriguing and could be good material for a few science fiction stories."
26,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1420916-stef,2,"This book was disappointing after the author's earlier book on the Seven Daughters of Eve. In his study of the Y-chromosome and the genetic basis for sex, gender, and power, Sykes often spends too much time on tedious scientfic process and less time exploring the bigger picture of the scientific story. The history and genealogy that he explores are really interesting, but too small a part of the book. And his speculation about the social ramifications of genetics both now and looking way into the future just comes off as somewhere between wacky and infuriating. Skip this one, just read the Seven Daughters of Eve."
27,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/268947-austin-larson,3,"Sykes is a geneticist who's made his career studying the sex chromosomes. He explains the evolutionary origins of having two different sexes - there are some species - even as advanced as lizards - that reproduce by cloning and have only females. He explains the origins of the Y chromosome itself and the evolutionary pressures that are causing it to slowly degenerate. Overall, the book is fairly loose with its speculation; but taken as speculation it presents an interesting set of ideas about all of the aspects of out lives and those of our ancestors that have been influenced by the specific molecular mechanisms of sexual reproduction used by humans. "
28,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7291482-kelly,3,"Interesting read overall, initially sluggish, I eventually was captivated by the chapter where he discusses the strong female dominated family vs the male dominated family. Otherwise, the book provided some interesting points - great for some discussion & banter with my husband. Some of the technicalities took a wee bit long for my liking. I wish he would have expanded more on how he thought the Y chromosome was actually going to go extinct, or how women were going to evolve to reproduce asexually. He explains his theory for both sides of the survival/extinction of the Y chromosome, and yet came out kind of neutral?Wondering about his other book, Seven Daughters of Eve now."
29,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2584224-kelli,4,"It got me hooked with the line ""125,000 years from now, the human race will reach the ultimate evolutionary crisis that has been millions of years in the making: the extinction of men.""

273,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1231154-william-shep,5,Groundbreaker work on genetics and genealogy for the paternal line via tracing the Y chromosome. Professor Sykes is a pioneer in the field butwe could do without his oddly feminist critique of the embattled Y chromosome. One gets the sense he is actually looking forward to the day when women can breed more women without needing men or their sperm!
274,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/997245-carmen,4,"Another interesting story about genetic research. Bryan Sykes takes a look into the Y chromosome. He describes other ways than sex to propagate a species, using animals and plants. He theorizes how our species might change our ways in the future, and shows how some special men, like Genghis Khan, have left a huge genetic imprint on the world. Entertaining and informative. "
275,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108484-linsey,2,"It was really slow for the first half of the book, tedious plodding through Sikes' geneology but halfway through, it got more interesting. By the end of the book, I thought it was a decent read. Brings up some interesting points about the sexes."
276,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/988527-mairi,5,"A study of the Y chromosome, it's controll over the population, and the driving force behind men's struggle for power, wealth and property. Very informative and thought provoking. Explores homosexuality and the eventual demise of the Y chromosome. I highly recommend this. "
277,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2382641-sue,4,This was about the Y chromosome and how it has prospered. Lots of science and one I will have to read again. Was looking for some background on Y chromosome lineage as was presented in 7 Daughters of Eve and thought it would be a companion book to that. Lots of things to remember.
278,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6409925-janice-sebring,3,"Interesting information about Y-DNA, but he ties it to a rather lame thesis about Y-DNA being the source of humanity's problems and thus enthuses over the idea of a world without men. If you ignore the philosophizing, it is an interesting read."
279,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12667329-dora,3,"I have to say that this book surprised me at some points. I'm glad I read it because I've learned so many new things (some of which i won't really need in life, but it's always fun to learn :D). I'd recommend the book...though it's a bit hard to start reading it, it gets better towards the end ;)"
280,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10812045-vidya,4,This book made for an extremely interesting read. The theories proposed by the author are mind-boggling and yet make you wonder why you didn't question them before. Quite an un-put-down-able book by a scientist although I normally am very skeptical about their ability to narrate well.
281,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/769786-kirsty-buchanan,5,Great book on genetics and modern science research - written really well to keep you interested even if you aren't a science geek!!!
282,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1069044-ellen-toman,4,This is a difficult book to read but if you're into genetics or not it's still really fascinating. Who'd of thought that men could go extinct and leave all us ladies behind !!!
283,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2523907-bill,5,"Fascinating read, non-fiction. Not about social impacts, keeps to the science of the premise. Revisited parts of this book over and over."
284,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1488143-john-kern,4,An interesting book. Sykes has an easy reading style that can make this subject interesting and understandable.
285,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2476223-fay,5,This reads like a novel and contains so much information your brain swells. Very good
286,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/647596-stacey,3,Y chromosome is on the decline. Wow.
287,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1164483-erin,3,"The author tends much more to hyperbole in this book than in his other two, and you have to take his conclusions with a large grain of salt, but it still has some interesting information."
288,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4256401-eman-alraesi,4,"you don't really need a medical background to read this book, i find it highly informative and it explains why probably women are more capable of surviving(genetically) more than men"
289,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4865161-melanie,3,"An interesting perspective on our possible genetic future, but hardly earth-shattering."
290,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5717738-kara,4,"Science-y gobbledegook intertwined with intricate, emotional prose. It's the story of humans from a cytological perspective"
291,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5598937-rachel,4,"A good book looking at the Y-chromosome and the way it has shaped our world. Not as good as the Seven Daughters of Eve, but as thought provoking."
292,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7099594-megan,2,"An interesting idea, but Sykes spends far too much time bragging about his accomplishment. I love science, but I got bored reading this."
293,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2417209-tim-weakley,4,"The decline of the Y chromosome. Not sure I'm buying what Sykes is selling in this one, but I lack the background."
294,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12971754-adebayo-oyagbola,4,"A story of the constantly shortening, if not disappearing, Y chromosome and how the male sex may be on the cusp of extinction. Well related if perhaps rather implausible."
295,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10850348-lou,5,Awesome book!!! Really helped me understand my Y-DNA
296,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17971425-jelena,5,Brilliant and especially suitable for Biology (or any other science) students. Shows other aspects of science itself and it opened my scientific horizons.
297,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17469172-avinash-c-mishra,5,Science as interesting as an adventurous novel. Excellent read.
298,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16236373-kenneth,4,"A discussion of the male Y-chromosome, its history, genetics and possible future."
299,0393326802,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1997054-bob,2,I liked seven daughters of eve a whole lot better
