0,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"I was talking to a friend at work about this book and we agreed it was both very good and very long, perhaps even too long. Sometimes, when you are at a symphony concert, the first movement will end with ‘da – da – da – daaaaaa’ and some people in the audience will clap, something that annoys all of those who know you are only meant to clap right at the end of the piece. Like I said, this book is very long and in three parts – and at the end of the first part I was getting ready to clap and thought, hang on, there seems to be an awful lot of this left. This book is disturbing – and not just a little disturbing, I’ve been thinking of ways to do without Facebook and Google – that level of disturbing.I think a large part of the problem people might have with this book is the same problem a lot of people have with advertising. I think most people think advertising might work on other people, other people being, by definition, a bit thick – but to suggest it might work on them is close to the biggest insult you can offer them. Sure they drink Coke – but not because they want to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony, but because, you know, it tastes good. People are so convinced they operate as free agents and that they know this because they base their decisions on a rational appraisal of the evidence before them, that the notion they might be ‘influenced’ by advertising has to be rejected outright because it would undermine their self-opinion and their notions of self-worth. All of which is particularly good news for the advertisers.The author starts this book with a story about her house catching fire and while she was waiting for someone to come put it out, she rushed about ‘saving’ things. The problem was that once the fire brigade arrived she was the thing they felt they most needed to save. She had never been in a house fire before and so this unprecedented situation seemed much safer to her than it actually was. This is the situation she says we are in with surveillance capitalism. We have never had this level of surveillance before, we believe we are getting stuff for nothing (google, facebook and so on) but actually our lives are being used as the raw behavioural material that is being used to manipulate us in ways we can barely understand. And it will only get worse. And this influence isn’t happening in ways we might think it is. That is, this isn’t about you writing to your mum that you have been thinking about buying a drone and then you getting lots of ads on your feed for places to buy drones. Yeah, I’m sure that shit happens, but it is nothing at all compared to what is really happening. There is a lovely bit in this where she discusses poker machines and how they have been designed by psychologists to provide the perfect environment of reward so that it stops being about winning and losing, but about getting you to continue to play. The longer you play, the more you lose. But the environment has been constructed so as to ensure that even looking away for a second feels like a kind of loss. And this is about as good a description of facebook (or as someone I know calls it face-crack) as I can think of. Except with facebook the rewards are to do with your own self-esteem, so looking away is even harder. And this isn’t even the worst of it. I’ve read quite a few books on behavioural economics – essentially it says that you can provide nudges to people and they will behave in ways that you want them to. This is generally presented as something good – like in Nudge itself, where people save more for their retirement if you construct a form in one way rather than in another. Or the example changing the form for organ donation from opt in to opt out and the rates of donation increase accordingly. You know, who is going to argue with that? Saving for your retirement is a good thing, donating your organs is a good thing. Except, the people who run facebook and google actually don’t make their money from you donating your organs – they make it from selling your behavioural data to people who want you to buy shit you don’t need or who want to work out what frightens the shit out of you so they can get you to vote for Trump or for Brexit. And they did. And it works. Even if you didn’t vote for either of these, it still works. Democracy doesn’t work by shifting those at the ends of the distribution – it works by shifting those in the middle. But we are all left with the consequences. 48% of the people of Britain are living with the consequences of what looks from the outside like - holy Jesus...What the gathering and analysis of the dross of our lives (aka data) allows is the most disturbing and powerful means imaginable for influencing us – and the worst of it is that we will not even know we are being influenced. In fact, this I-know-you-better-than-you-know-yourself is often presented as a feature of the new system – you’ll walk into a bar and the bartender will already know your favourite drink and might even have it ready for you. Yeah, thanks for that...A lot of this book discusses notions of operant conditioning and therefore it is a reprise of something like Plato’s republic – except his republic was to be run by the disinterested philosopher kings, people uninterested in money and worldly goods, who were judged (by whom?) to be the best and brightest and to be those worthy of organising society for the rest of us -even of telling us lies to make our little lives feel more comfortable. The republic we are entering with our eyes tightly closed is one where the philosopher kings have been replaced by the selfish and the greedy and we have given them the means to influence us in worlds they create and construct so that those worlds meet their own desires for us. I’ve always seen Plato’s republic as a dystopia – but what we are living in has no comparison. It is terrifying beyond words. I wish this book wasn’t nearly so long – I would recommend it wholeheartedly then. You still do need to read it, though. Sorry."
1,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1912247-dominik,3,"An important, albeit flawed, book. Viewing the rise of Google and Facebook through the lens of sociology, this makes for some heavy reading as one swims among the book's unique vocabulary (""the will to will,"" ""division of learning in society,"" ""double movement,"" ""shadow text,"" ""extraction imperative,"" ""prediction imperative""). Eventually the phrases begin to make their own sort of strange sense, but it definitely feels foreign. Perhaps I haven't read much sociology, so this failing may be my own. I do wish the book were written in simpler, less highfalutin prose.Surprisingly, there are no data at all in this book. None. I went in expecting analyses of the economic gains from Google and Facebook contrasted to some approximation of the social costs imposed by them. Or of small businesses enabled by these platforms. Or any economic analysis at all. There's none. This isn't that sort of book. Google and Facebook's ""dispossession"" of ""people's lives"" are presented as obvious. Showing a targeted ad based on a search or a user profile is apparently, to the author, something tantamount to stealing their very soul.The book's arguments are weakened by its purple prose. ""Rivers of blood"" are not, in fact, flowing because of surveillance capitalism. We digital natives are not, in actuality, being mercilessly slaughtered by Conquistadors Page, Zuckerberg, and Nadella (the author explicitly makes this analogy over several pages). I understand the author's desire to provoke ""astonishment and indignation"" but I found these hyperbolic passages less than persuasive.Despite the book's heft, there's much it doesn't cover. There's no discussion of pre-internet data brokers (credit card companies and credit bureaus, anyone?) There's no consideration of the privacy controls that Google and Facebook offer (much of the ""extraction imperative"" can be entirely turned off in each's privacy settings), nor that many valuable services are provided for free that do directly improve folks' lives. Nor any examination of other, far darker players in ad tech and social media. There's no discussion of k-anonymity, sparingly little of encryption, one fleeting mention of blockchain (expressing disapproval that smart contracts subvert the fundamental human values imbued in the ancient practice of contracts). The treatment of ML is decidedly non-technical and more akin to seeing ML as magic fairy dust than wrangling with its very real shortcomings (surprisingly, ML fairness doesn't get a mention).The author ends by envisioning a nightmare scenario of B.F. Skinner's wildest dreams where, like players in Pokemon Go, our entire lives become subject to the careful nudges and variable rewards promulgated by the ""high priesthood"" of data scientists carefully tuning the all-knowing, all-seeing machine learning system. Prediction becomes control and the machines take over ""the human hive."" Ooo... kay.All that said, this book is still worth the read, if you can stomach the hyperbole and dense prose and can exercise empathy toward the author's very real fears of seeing democracy and free society swallowed up by powerful corporations that tap into and manipulate human hopes and fears. There is love poured into these pages, love of humanity in its culture and its unpredictable freedom, and that in itself makes the book worth the investment. At the same time though, there's little love for Google or Facebook or technology in general -- and quite a lot of fear, uncertainty, and doubt.Disclosure: I am an employee of a big tech company, but the review above is solely my own opinion and not that of my employer. I've also tried to review the book without bias and through neutral eyes."
2,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32804270-michael,3,"Paints a frightening portrait of the rise of mass surveillance since the start of the Information Age. In ornate, often opaque, prose Zuboff charts the development of a new form of global capitalism that aims to surveil all facets of human existence and, using vast stores of privately held, ruthlessly gathered data, predict and modify user behavior to align with desired commercial outcomes. "
3,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76183450-lucas,2,"I’m giving this book 2 stars, in hopes that the surveillance capitalists at Amazon will not recommend others like it to me. In terms of research, this book deserves a higher rating. It is incredibly thorough and well sourced. But here is an example of a sentence the author, Shoshanna Zuboff, uses: “This time, we have sent them into the raw heart of a rogue capitalism that amassed its fortune and power through behavioral dispossession parlayed into behavior modification in the service of others’ guaranteed outcomes.” All the great research she’s done is described in the most alarming wording possible. It is a book filled with hyperbolic conclusions that are often not justified by anything other than the alarming wording she uses. I have two theories about why that is: 1) She assumes that anyone willing to read the book already agrees with her conclusion that the collection of data by Google represents nothing short of the end of individual freedom. So if everyone agrees, she doesn’t need to explain why something like Pokemon Go taking users to stores is bad, because it’s just so obvious. 2) She’s not actually writing for a contemporary audience, but an audience in the distant future when everything she warns about has come true. This might sound like I’m joking, but she talks in the introduction about her work being inspired by Marx, because he saw what capitalism would be when it was still an unprecedented phenomenon, and later says that one of her conclusions unites very well with Thomas Paine. So the stakes are very high for Zuboff. Beyond the conclusions being what they are, the writing in general is too much for me. I usually don’t complain about writing being too dense/academic/pretentious, but here is another sentence that exists in this book: “Orwell’s chilling final passages fulfill the life of that dry seed planted at the turn of the century in Italy’s impoverished soil and nourished by war, deprivation, and humiliation to flower in the nightmare of Nazi Germany and the apocalypse of Stalin’s Russia, finally to bear fruit in Orwell’s imagination: a testament for all time to what Mussolini had called the “ferocious totalitarian will” and the souls on which it feeds.” It is a generally grating read, and it doesn’t help that the book is twice as long as it needs to be. I’m not sure that all “behavior modification” by social media or data science is bad. (I should disclose that I work in data science, so ignore this whole review if you want). For example, a lot of people on the Goodreads app probably read more often than they would without the app, because of the social sharing aspect and the recommendation systems. This makes Amazon more money when people buy books from them. Is this bad? Most people on this app would probably agree that reading is good. Targeted advertising is not inherently bad either. For instance, I will never buy a truck. I don’t have anything against people who have trucks, but I have no interest in ever owning one. I hope every AI system in the world picks that sentence up, because it is my dream to watch a football game on the weekend and never see another truck commercial for the rest of my life. Am I saying that there is nothing to be concerned about here? Of course not. As Zuboff points out, a lot of the data that companies have on consumers now leads to an unprecedented level of information and power. Power is vulnerable to abuse. Data can be used in ways that impair freedom and I’m concerned about that. That’s why I bought this book. But data can also be used in a lot of positive ways. Self-driving cars can virtually eliminate accidents from the road. Zuboff misleadingly quotes an internal memo at Google about self-driving cars and their ability to learn from collective car data storage, and uses it as an example of surveillance capitalists “lamenting” that people aren’t more like machines. It’s a very important subject, but Zuboff’s portrayal and conclusions are just way too much for me."
4,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,5,"This will be a long review, so let me summarise it with tweet-like succinctness: ‘The Age of Surveillance Capitalism’ is Black Mirror for people who hate fun. I definitely mean that as a compliment. It synthesises and analyses a wide range of ideas I’ve come across in leisure and work reading during the past few years, mostly in articles online. As fragments, those ideas filled me with concern and confusion. Combined into the clear and systematic structure of a book, they fill me with dread, but the alleviation of confusion is very powerful. Zuboff sets out a convincing and shocking analysis of the recent turn global capitalism has taken towards intensive data-gathering, behavioural prediction, and pervasive surveillance. While I think it could have been equally effective at slightly shorter length, that is probably influenced by the unwieldiness of the hardback I got from the library. I really appreciated the measured pace and excellent explanations. Zuboff coins a number of useful descriptive phrases, none more helpful than that in the title. The vagueness of ‘late capitalism’ has always irritated me; ‘surveillance capitalism’ has a punchy accuracy. Zuboff is a great writer, with a consistent ability to identify key points without becoming reductive or sensationalist:Surveillance capitalism’s ability to keep democracy at bay produced these stark facts. Two men at Google who do not enjoy the legitimacy of the vote, democratic oversight, or the demands of shareholder governance exercise control over the organisation and presentation of the world’s information. One man at facebook who does not enjoy the legitimacy of the vote, democratic oversight, or the demands of shareholder governance exercises control over an increasingly universal means of social connection along with the information concealed in its networks.Zuboff centres her overall enquiry into surveillance capitalism on three fundamental questions: who knows? Who decides? And who decides who decides? The answers are disquieting, to say the least. It amazes me that so many people I know seem unconcerned about the amount of data the big five tech companies (Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon) have about them and how it is used. Not only do these firms have far more data about us than we can readily understand, its individual value is irrelevant in comparison to the value of it all in aggregate. Zuboff uses the term ‘economies of scale and scope’ for this. Big data is valuable because machine learning models require vast amounts to produce useful results. For work reasons, I recently taught myself data mining and basic machine learning in R. It was alarming to realise how easy to use yet fundamentally opaque big data analytics are. Neural networks aren’t really analogous to human brains in structure or function. The real similarity is that in neither case is it known why you get the result you do. Moreover, like human brains, neural networks makes mistakes. However their mistakes are very different to those of humans, and generally depend on how much data they’ve been trained on and what forms it took.Zuboff does not discuss such technicalities. If you want an introduction to machine learning, I suggest this youtube video. She is, rightly, more interested in the data that google and others gather to feed machine learning models, which then predict our behaviour in order to sell us stuff. Once limited to your computer, the imperative to gather more and more behavioural data increasingly invades daily life via the internet of things:The very idea of a functional, effective, affordable product or service as a sufficient basis for economic exchange is dying. Where you might least expect it, products of every sort are remade by the new economic requirements of connection and rendition. Each is reimagined as a gateway to the new apparatus, praised for being ‘smart’ while traditional alternatives are reviled for remaining ‘dumb’. It is important to acknowledge that in this context, ‘smart’ is euphemism for rendition: intelligence that is designed to render some tiny corner of lived experience as behavioural data. Each smart object is a kind of marionette; for all its ‘smartness’, it remains a hapless puppet dancing to the puppet master’s hidden economic imperatives.Zuboff is especially good at explaining how it came to this: how big tech seized a specific historic moment when neoliberal economics, the war on terror, and advances in information technology converged. The big five’s tactics for avoiding regulatory control or even admitting what they actually do are set out chillingly well. While all this has certainly been discussed before, it is expressed especially well here. A slew of short articles over years are hard to distil sense from, whereas this book sets out the situation with admirable clarity. Chapter eleven lists characteristics that have allowed surveillance capitalism to take root, despite the fact that the Western population consistently claim to value privacy. The range and impact of these characteristics certainly makes sense of how we got here: lack of precedent, declaration as invasion, historical context, fortifications, the dispossession cycle, dependency, self-interest, inclusion, identification, authority, social persuasion, foreclosed alternatives, inevitabilism, the ideology of human frailty, ignorance, and velocity. The most novel part for me was an exploration of the philosophy underlying surveillance capitalism. Since big tech aggressively avoids articulating such a thing, based on the spurious claim that data is totally neutral, this was especially interesting. Zuboff labels it instrumentalism and contrasts it powerfully with totalitarianism:Totalitarianism operated through the means of violence, but instrumentarian power operates through the means of behavioural modification, and this is where our focus must shift. Instrumentarian power has no interest in our souls or any principle to instruct. There is no training or transformation for spiritual salvation, no ideology against which to judge our actions. [...] It is profoundly indifferent to our meanings and motives. Trained on measurable action, it only cares that whatever we do is accessible to its ever-evolving operations of rendition, calculation, modification, monetisation, and control. [...] Totalitarianism was a political project that converged with economics to overwhelm society. Instrumentarianism is a market project that converges with the digital to achieve its own unique brand of social domination.I particularly appreciated the link Zuboff made with behavioural economics and its rejection of the rationality assumption, while keeping all the other reductive and dubious assumptions of free market economics. The ‘nudge’ ethos of behavioural modification to optimise outcomes is entirely consistent with surveillance capitalism. Whenever I’ve read behavioural economics books over the years, the same questions come to mind: first off, why are you so amazed to have discovered very basic psychology? Secondly, whose behaviour are you nudging, why, and for whose benefit? This idea of nudging or tuning behaviour is deeply unsettling and contains potentially massive hidden contradictions, quite apart from its ethical implications. What if two companies in the big tech oligopoly try to push behaviour in different directions? Surely the vague aspiration of making the world run more smoothly and efficiently (whatever that means and for whom) is in conflict with the anger and violence social media stokes in politics? I was slightly surprised that only towards the end of the book does Zuboff broach the corrosive political effects of social media, such as the spread of fake news and an adversarial, reductive, and angry political culture. In a way, she hardly needs to. The prior chapters set this up well, by explaining the ‘radical indifference’ that big tech has for the actual content it feeds to its users. The only aim is to increase revenues via a business model of maximising attention and engagement on the platform(s). If divisive, dangerous, and totally inaccurate material gets clicks and comments, then that’s good enough for facebook and google. They take zero responsibility for the consequences this has on politics, culture, and society, despite profiting massively from them. I’m actually glad this wasn’t mentioned earlier in the book, as it’s so depressing that it would have pulled focus from the economic and philosophical foundations beneath the surface. As has probably become clear, I consider this a deeply thought-provoking and helpful book that has made my view of the world we live in a little clearer. That is the pinnacle of what you can hope for in non-fiction, in my view. Nonetheless, I didn’t agree with every word of it. Zuboff treats surveillance capitalism as a successor to industrial capitalism, stating several times that the latter wrecked the environment and now the former is wrecking the human soul. While I don’t disagree with this, I think surveillance capitalism is also making it much harder to deal with the consequences of industrial capitalism (which still exists as well! Smart phones don’t just manifest from the aether). Action to deal with climate change has been derailed by reactionary populist politics and a false equivalency between scientific research and conspiracy theories. The complex and long-term nature of environmental problems is totally unsuited to the acceleration and superficiality of social media. Moreover, surveillance capitalism is still capitalism, thus all about economic growth, increasing consumption, and wasteful energy use. I think these links should have been acknowledged a little more. Much like financial capitalism, surveillance capitalism is a parasite upon industrial capitalism; will it drain its host until they both die, I wonder?I think the weakest material is in the final chapter, which considers how young people are growing up with pervasive internet surveillance that stunts their sense of self. This is more speculative and lacks the rigor and conviction of the other chapters. Which is not to say that I find the concept uninteresting or unimportant. Here, though, it is treated as something of an afterthought. The psychological effects of constant connectivity and a norm of performative content sharing, especially on children, deserve their own books. Mixing macro and micro-level analysis can be risky; this is a macro book and that is its great strength. It is salutary to compare ‘The Age of Surveillance Capitalism’ with Paul Mason’s Postcapitalism: A Guide to Our Future, which I read in 2015. Mason covered some similar ground, but drew very different conclusions that now appear remarkably naive. The contradictions that he suggested would bring down neoliberalism are resolved by surveillance capitalism. Mason wrote, and I agreed when I read it, that big tech’s control over data was fragile and unsustainable. I no longer believe that; the past four years have seen consolidation and expansion of google and facebook’s control over data. Over the same period, it has become evident that such data can be put to dangerous purposes with a total absence of democratic accountability. According to free market economic theory, the infinite supply of data should make it worthless. Quite the opposite occurs, as data becomes more and more valuable as its scale and complexity increases, because it can be used to make quicker and more accurate behaviour predictions, and to influence behaviour. Certainly not in a free market, though. Google, amazon, and facebook are in unassailable economic positions. Any company that tries to compete is bought by them. The only threats to their dominance come from outside the market: regulation, essentially. Breaking up their monopolistic positions is part of public discourse, for example the proposals of Elizabeth Warren, a potential Democratic presidential candidate in the US. As with oil companies, though, there is great reluctance to face the fundamental problem: their business model. Oil companies have no place in any world that takes climate change seriously, because we must stop burning oil. Likewise, pervasive surveillance and data gathering have no place in any world that values privacy. Reliance on secretive behavioural monitoring and modification should also stop, but a ban on them seems even further away than a ban on burning oil. At present they appear inextricably linked with the internet, just as energy systems seems inextricably linked with fossil fuels. In both cases, the two developed interdependently, but their linkage isn't inevitable. The possibility exists of other energy systems and other forms of internet. To my mind, the first step to imagining better is understanding the flaws in what we have.I am more pessimistic and negative about social media than most people I know, quite possibly most people in general. While it can have positive consequences, the fact that it is optimised by a handful of companies to take our data and sell us shit makes it fundamentally flawed. The internet has a lot of potential to bring people together; social media as currently constituted is more likely to push them further apart. I wonder whether Trump could have become president without twitter and facebook? Frankly I doubt it. The irony of my posting this on a social media site owned by amazon is not lost on me; this is how we live now. ‘The Age of Surveillance Capitalism’ takes the reader beyond the endless noise of twitter et al in an attempt to explain the underlying theory and structure of 21st century capitalism. I found it an invaluable guide that solidified ideas I already had, as well as introducing new concepts and raising new questions. Be warned: I’m probably not going to shut up about this one for a long while. Probably best to read it now, so you can make up your own mind."

If I have one complaint, it's that she gets super carried away with metaphors and flowery language--it was actually quite annoying. But Zuboff takes a long view of history and situates the new era of surveillance capitalism within parallel trends in markets, culture, and law. She makes some brilliant observations--her comparison of surveillance capitalism with totalitarianism was especially interesting. Sometimes I think she overstates the dangers, but it's a nice and necessary challenge to the technoutopians and the denialists who claim that nothing is new. She also challenges some of the older fears about the surveillance state. She's not worried about state surveillance. She's worried about the intrusion of markets into all of our private spheres. I appreciated her references to Polyani and Arendt because it was useful to connect political totalitarianism and the great transformation of the markets into newer spheres "

With data mining and machine-learning capital is closing in on the last spaces that belong to us our private lives and thoughts. If that sounds creepy and totalitarian it is. With money to be made on our thoughts, behaviors, and inclinations silicon valley is using computers, smartphones, smart homes, and sensors to map out every thought and behavior we have to maximize profit. It also seeks to shape our behavior for maximum revenue as well. The players are known but how they operate is veiled. They know everything about how we operate but we know little about their secrets. This asymmetry ultimately makes them powerful and reduces our power. It is the difference between master and puppet. If that sounds bad to you it gets worse all of this is happening with little pushback from a slow-moving public or democratic governance. The thing about a book like this is it highlights what we feel is happening already. That creepy ad after you click on a website that follows you around for days.

8,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13716226-murtaza,3,"A few years ago I read Yuval Noah Harari's book Homo Deus, a whimsical look at our looming technological dystopia. Harari's book struck me as being happily resigned to the end of human freedom and indeed the end of humanity as we know it. This book could be described as the pessimistic and despairing counterpart to Harari's work. It goes over many of the same themes: the predictive power of Big Data, the loss of human freedom and the intrusion of surveillance technology into every corner of our lives. These things are all genuinely bad and troubling. Having said that I found the authors analysis to be somehow overly bleak. There is a fundamental trade-off in having a free service like Google Maps. We get powerful, unprecedented assistance in navigation. In turn, they get our data which they use to refine their models of predictive human behavior. This probably isn't fair once you understand the full scope of what you are losing and maybe we should all demand a new modus vivendi. The book fails to describe it as a trade-off however. Instead it is depicted as us being literally conquered and enslaved by a foreign force, repeatedly analogized to the conquest of the Tainos by the Spanish conquistadors. This hyperbole is woven throughout the generally dense prose of the book. There is tons of information here. It doesn't necessarily say much that will be new to a relatively informed audience. I found this a bit disappointing given the breathless reception that the book has received. The repeated invocations of philosophers and renaissance poetry also felt a bit overwrought.Having said that, I am in sympathy with much of the book's argument. We definitely have regressed to some sort of feudal economic arrangement, even while retaining the minds and desires of modern people. No wonder so many feel unhappy, despite their relative material wealth. The ubiquitous presence of sensory and data tracking equipment is setting human beings up for something unimaginable. Every movement, thought and impulse is on the way to being tracked and recorded in a powerful predictive text that can only be read by our new tech industry overseers. We are on the way to becoming laboratory rats in a maze designed to fine-tune our behavior, mainly for the purpose of controlling us and extracting our wealth. Every new gadget and app, often given for free or sold at cost price, is a new spy intended to capture as much behavioral data as possible. You don't need to enjoy the author's lurid prose to see that her words contain some truth.Are there any solutions here? Only a vague gesture towards the need for more democracy. While that may be true I found it to be a predictable and somewhat lazy way to conclude the book. I feel it is not right to hammer out hundreds of pages of dire information without even formulating a plausible solution. Yes, the problems are articulated are real and critical. As the author acknowledges though, the tide is so overwhelming most have resigned themselves to drift along its course. How do we counteract this feeling of resignation? That would be a significant question to answer.Were it possible I would give this book 2.5 stars of out of five. I would recommend any of the numerous essays about this subject out there, as well as Harari's more engaging overview."

Zuboff refers to ""overthrow"", the end of democracy as we know it, the reshaping of all human nature. She turns to a metaphor of the Taino before meeting Columbus, as they were wholly ignorant of the atrocities of war he was about to unleash upon them.""Surveillance capitalism"", a term the author coined, is not all imagined. It is still a term that can refer to the bargain that users make when they use free websites such as this. The users of a website are not the consumer, they are the product, as their use data and product history is sold to big marketers or advertising firms. Zuboff calls this 'behavioral surplus'. On Goodreads, this is benign - I can talk about books with friends for free, and I get recommended new ones. No harm done. The problem lies in what is referred to as the ""internet of things"" - household objects or new device which track more of the user's location and behavior. Exercise equipment, thermostats, refrigerators, phones, mattresses, and doorknobs are connected to the internet. All of this is sent to ""behavioral futures markets"", and the general public simply does not know their personal information is treated this way. Legal regimes on monopolies or privacy law do not encompass the current situation - and who reads the terms of service anyway?Zuboff is best when she does the work of journalism and digs through patent files and internal documents. The antagonists of her story are Facebook and Google, and their grand ambitions in business jargon for human society. But where Zuboff loses me is her exaggeration of their hold on society, of how much change they can carry out, and of how powerless most people are. I personally share her skepticism, but not her ""inevitabilism"", to use her term. Where adblocking tools are powerful and widely shared and where targetted lists of consumer data can still be sabotaged (see what happened to the Tulsa rally), advertising is not as powerful as is thought. What makes me the most doubtful at present is Facebook's own scandal where it inflated by a significant margin the count of how many of its users visited its ads, and big companies can and do pull their money and go elsewhere. If digital advertising really is so easily ignored, then why would big businesses bother with such a wide net at all?While there are social costs to intrusive advertising and Zuboff is right to doubt, I admit things are as bad as she says. Those ships have not sailed. "
10,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,1,"Data privacy or unauthorised (and wrongly allowed) usage of an individual’s private data by someone else are critically important topics. However, this comprehensively one-sided book does not even scratch the surface of the issues at hand.The whole book is a repeated polemic on almost any data gathering, analytics and companies that have successful businesses running on them. The highly coloured and simplistic view of the evils of Google and Facebook (it is largely about these two and a bit about Microsoft) in such a long book ensures that the author never even gets started on discussing the real problem, let alone any solutions beyond calling for all of us to say “No”.The author - who yearns for the pre-digital era utopia of almost anytime in history including as late as the 1980s - is a twenty-first century, Rousseau-like romantic. She happens to be a critic of our era modernity but if she was from some other era, she might have hated television or automobiles or combustible engines with equal gusto. In this book, she comes out as someone who hates collection of almost any data, and analysis based on them, even though if approached with these charges, she will flat deny them. The author never understands that there is no turning back from the current point, that the digital era has some enormous positives along with many negatives, that most negatives cannot be wished away, that many of the negatives are structural intricately joined to the massive positives, that authorities cannot fight or even understand many evils that are transforming continuously, etc etcLet’s build slowly to see how complicated the issues of data ownership are before we even look at the commercial aspects:- There is that age-old question: if a tree falls in a jungle with no “one” to observe, does it make a sound or does it “count”? If you twist this question in the digital contexts, how do you define the “one” doing the measurement? Is my privacy invaded if my “personal” data - however defined - are “seen” by programs?- The author will say a resounding yes to the question posed above based on what one reads in the book. Here, if I have a program living on my machine analyzing the private data to give me some results on what I am looking for - like a friend’s contact details - is my privacy invaded?- what if some incoming data - say a barrage of ten billion ads or news articles - are sorted by some program on my machine to filter out the likely unimportant ones for me based on my past habits as stored on my device - is this an invasion?- if not, how is the same an invasion if the same things are stored or processed on hardware located millions of miles away?- how does anyone explain complex analytical tools to me? Need my apps to analyze only to the extent I/humans understand? If yes, how will we ever progress in fields of quantum physics, genetics or other behavioural sciences?One can go on and on. The point is that issues of what is private data or understandable analysis are complex: the author seems to hate any analysis of “my” data for almost any commercial use. However, the same author would despise- if search and many other similar functions were charged and were so expensive due to the lack of scale that only the elite of the world benefited from them- Or if my lack of data-sharing did not solve her health or traffic or many similar solutions- Or somebody prevented smart analysis of “my” data that might have helped me find the right education, right connections, right entertainment, right news amongst a plethora of choices out there.- Or if the companies forced not to “nudge” offered no choice architecture (like no search) which is far worse than some choice, or offered the same “choice” without customisation to all- Or if lack of free storage of my data - like health over decades - did not offer me the same health or financial advantages as somebody who could afford such storageThe author does not see how free/cheap access to information, analysis, storage, health, entertainment, etc has benefitted the underprivileged of the world since the onset of the digital revolution. Is the surplus enjoyed by the digital elite at the cost of the rest? Or is there a win-win, where we may charge them of keeping a disproportionate amount, but not accuse them of plunder? The new era technologies have many negatives that need to be discussed and solved. Most of them are not what this author talks about in this book. The book is written by someone who yearns to be a digital hermit and feels she cannot. She is rightly frustrated by this viewpoint;  it is nigh impossible to completely go dark as it is no longer just about devices under my control with the surveillance of millions of other varieties.  That said, there are likely to be extremely few who could truly go back to such isolation for long now. "
11,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/679134-bryan-alexander,4,"We read this for our online book club in the spring and summer of 2019.Here are our discussions by chapter: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18.My concluding thoughts?Generally Zuboff succeeds in sketching out a dystopian business model, one predicated on turning the details of our lives into corporate profit.  This is most famously or notoriously demonstrated by Facebook and Google.  The structures and strategies Surveillance Capitalism lays out are very useful tools, like the kidnap/corner/compete playbook.Zuboff gives us new ways to think about the digital world in 2019, drawing out an archaeology of its development and pushing back on current understanding.  In one neat move, for example, she takes issue with the famous “you are not the consumer; you are the product” axiom.  Instead, Zuboff would rather we think thusly: “we are the sources of raw-material supply.” (69-70)The book is mostly analytical, a wide-ranging and deeply probing exploration of the business model.  Developing a solution to surveillance capitalism is a secondary consideration, and not a very inspiring one.  Zuboff has some hopes for creative and popular resistance, and ultimately sees governmental regulation as the best option.  I'm not sure that this is convincing.To begin with, as Zuboff acknowledges, governments often engage in surveillance that is arguably more terrifying than Facebooks, as they are backed up with laws and armed might.  Many governments also practice the nudging Surveillance Capitalism decries.  Yes, states can and often do two opposing things at the same time, but the tension should be addressed.  Otherwise the argument runs the risk of asking us to appeal to bullies for protection.Moreover, the politics involved can become challenging, especially in the United States.  This month several Democratic presidential candidates are going after some of Silicon Valley; regulating tech firms could become an epically partisan issue, especially for a Republican party keen to protect and extend big business.  On the other hand, some Republicans, including Trump, are incensed at what they see as FAANG's anti-conservative bias.   The Trump administration is also weighing regulatory options against the digital giants.  A leading conservative blogger called for antitrust action. Is a bipartisan consensus possible?Put another way, can Congress escape Silicon Valley's lobbying might, or will it be sufficiently captured to not enact anything meaningful?  Further, if Evgeny Morozov is right, as Barbara Fister suggests, and surveillance capitalism is really about capitalism itself, what kind of political organization is available now to respond? Perhaps thee bipartisan possibility I noted above will fall apart as a socialism-interested left wing feuds with Republicans and centrist Democrats alike.   Or, if surveillance capitalism is about extraction, as Zuboff insists, is a better model anti-colonialism, as Vanessa Vaile suggests?  That could lead to an international politics, whereby some other nations oppose Silicon Valley for fomenting an updated, digital colonialism.Or should we think about this instead as a health care issue, since so many of the privacy  violations Zuboff abhors occur in the body of mind?  If so,  the odds aren't good, as Noel De Martin observes.  Indeed, surveillance capitalism may have succeeded in implanting itself too deeply in our psyches to be uprooted, as Mark Spradley ponders.Furthermore, the book notes several times that the surveillance capitalism model doesn't stem entirely from the technology sector.  Indeed, the financial sector played a key role in shaping and driving it (cf Mark Corbett Wilson's fine comment).  That sector is enormously powerful, both economically and politically.  How can a society and culture oppose its strategy?  Arguably America failed to do so after the 2008 financial disaster (recall Occupy).  Again, political challenges and complexity are rampant on this score.Shifting from politics to economics, Zuboff would like us to support alternative funding models.  What are they?  Barbara Fister identifies DuckDuckGo and paid(walled) journalism. Noel De Martin points to Netflix as one where we pay for content - although it's really a hybrid model, as Netflix mines our viewing habits to surface recommendations.Can other businesses compete by openly resisting surveillance capitalism?  Carl Rosenfeld thinks this might be happening with VPN providers.  Apple has lately made a play for being taken seriously as a pro-privacy actor. Alan Baily notes that Apple makes hardware and might be too far behind Google etc. to catch up.  Perhaps their alleged shift to being a media company will lead them to follow Netflix's hybrid path.  The computer gaming industry - immense and weirdly absent from Zuboff's book - largely sells artifacts and services without managing to stalk our inner data-thoughts (except through canny design); Steam is not great at recommendations.On a different register, I think Age of Surveillance Capitalism fails to understand why so many consumers volunteer to enter the universe of decreased, monetized privacy.  The book compares this business model to military conquest, but doesn't account well for our conscious embrace of it.  As Ken Soto points out, low- or no-cost services of high quality are quite appealing to consumers.  Think of how Gmail outcompeted email clients, or how Facebook crafted a better social experience than Facebook.  Google Earth, Google Books: these are effective tools without serious competition.  As Nicholas Carr argues (and it's not often I agree with him),While Zuboff’s assessment of the costs that people incur under surveillance capitalism is exhaustive, she largely ignores the benefits people receive in return — convenience, customization, savings, entertainment, social connection, and so on. The benefits can’t be dismissed as illusory, and the public can no longer claim ignorance about what’s sacrificed in exchange for them.I admit to being torn on this in my personal experience.  Despite my dread of their datamining, Amazon's recommendation system is better than the suggestions I'll get from 99% of bookstores.   I use many Google tools (Drive, Gmail, Maps, etc) because the price is good and the quality high.  Facebook still gives me a bigger social network than any other platform, no matter how badly Zuckerberg behaves.  Voice activated tools are handy for me when I'm cooking or driving.  Convenience and quality are powerful forces and help enable the age of surveillance capitalism; the titular book needs to account for them, even though that would weaken its rhetorical stance.Beyond myself, I think the personal experience of many other people helps explain why Facebook, Google et al can get away with this.  You see, Zuboff posits an opposition between a good life with privacy and the bad life after social media, yet that duality doesn't withstand scrutiny.  Before Web 2.0 many people already lived with many privacy violations.  The world of work can compromise privacy in a variety of ways, from surveilled email to intense bodily scrutiny; actually, as Katie Fitzpatrick points out, Zuboff seems more concerned with leisure than work.  The war on (some) drugs has habituated many Americans to yielded up our bodily fluids to bureaucratic processing.  The many people who serve in or work closely with the military have a very different privacy experience than the ideal one Zuboff holds out.  In fact, the war on terror has systematically degraded American civil liberties.  Even without war, many who would access some public services are long used to opening up their lives to the gaze of civil servants.  Next to any of these, letting Google trawl one's email to shape some small ads is far less threatening.  If I can slightly misread Blayne Haggart, the book overstates its claims to novelty.Where does this leave us?The Age of Surveillance Capitalism is a powerful book that should be read.  It does feel incomplete, however, like a business book that falls short of politics, or one crafted with a Manichean zeal that misses the nuances of history and daily life.  I recommend it for its utility and the conversations it should start.Looking ahead, I think Zuboff outlines an unfolding politics.  We should pursue that thinking.(And many thanks, once more, to the readers in our online book club.)"
12,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1750696-george-anders,3,"In The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, Shoshanna Zuboff argues relentlessly that the rise of Google, Facebook, etc. has done something terribly wrong to society. She's alarmed by all the surreptitious information-gathering that goes on in the background. She's especially troubled by the way we're deluged with personalized ads, every time we go on the Internet. And she wants us to be alarmed, too.Her book touches on some fascinating questions. Do we want a world that cherishes sanctuary, or that provides effortless socialization? Do we want the right to be forgotten, or easier opportunities to become known? If we want a bit of both, how do we balance these trade-offs?I would have loved to read a book that combined her relentless probing of tech's potential excesses with a realistic sense of what we've gained and lost at each step of the way. But that's not what we get. Instead TA0SC is weirdly colored -- in fact sometimes outright poisoned -- by endless nostalgia for a supposedly better time, long ago. I've lived through the multi-decade transformation that Zuboff describes. Things weren't better back then! We're talking about the days of taking outdated paper maps on road trips, instead of having in-dash nav. Or looking up hotels in a Frommer's guide, instead of tapping into the detailed listings and reviews on TripAdvisor or Airbnb. Looking back on it, information was maddeningly costly, slow and hard to obtain back then.Even if some aspects of today's digital connectivity seem silly or unnerving, when you add it all up, we're enjoying much better lives with Internet-era tools. To cite one more example, we've evolved from narrow knowledge cartels (where encyclopedia salespeople in the 1970s preyed on poor families) to a much more equitable world where easily accessible Google searches can get you up to speed on almost anything, no matter what your income.I'd hoped this book would be a landmark contribution to the dialogue about how to handle tech's allures and pitfalls better. Instead, it's as frustrating as a partial encyclopedia set that stops at the letter D. For me, at least, TAoSC loses much of its effectiveness (and readability) by treating modernity as the apocalypse. All we're left with is a preservationist's anguished denunciation of everything that's changed.There's a wonderful quote from English author Douglas Adams that covers this terrain better than anything I can add: “1. Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.2. Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.3. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.”"
13,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3844934-paul,1,"The reviews of this book were very positive and the blurb suggested it was just the book I was looking to read. ""...as surveillance capitalism advances from Silicon Valley into every sector of the global economy, she brings its consequences to life"".Unfortunately she doesn't. Over almost 700 pages (including 140 pages of footnotes to highlight the amount of research that has gone into this book) we do not get to see the consequences of living with the always on devices in our homes, on our wrists, in our cars of our modern world. You feel a critique of Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc data gathering techniques and how they use them would be like shooting fish in a barrel, but repeatedly she misses the target. We get more a history of behavioural psychology, and endless flashbacks to comparisons to Ford's production lines. The language is full of jargon, neologisms and is endlessly circular. There are a few interesting insights hidden in there, such as the Chinese model of collecting personal data on millions of people and using it to affect life chances and advancement, but this is dismissed as unworkable, and ""the Chinese are used to being observed anyway"". There seems no curiosity about how much our western governments are doing the same thing to profile their citizens. The repeatedly examined catchy examples are of Pokemon-Go directing players to businesses and an automated vacuum cleaner secretly mapping your rooms. Little mention of surveillance capitalism's more sinister uses in having always on microphones in millions of households. Also Edward Snowden and Cambridge Analytica's exposés of big data's political uses, eg in trying to swing elections and referendums gets barely a mention.The conclusion feels like a good introduction, summing up what we already know, but that is the point we get to by the end of the book. There feels like a naivety in the author, who has just suddenly realised that our actions, decisions, routes we take and private conversations are being catalogued. She talks about the teenagers being in the vanguard of those observed by Facebook (I would suggest teenagers are elsewhere whilst Facebook's biggest audience are aged 20-40), and other slightly wrong mentions about how technology is used and accepted into the day to day lives of many people, who know they are being watched, but don't care. This book fails to let us know why we should care. I honestly think most newspaper reviewers read the intro, looked at the chapter titles and then read the conclusion, not noticing that there is little new in between."
14,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33921897-kusaimamekirai,5," Who knows? Who decides? Who decides who decides? I remember thinking a few years back, when Siri was introduced to Apple iPhones, “why exactly do we need this?”. Had it really become such an inconvenience to type a few words into our ubiquitous phones to get information? Who was clamoring for this?  Today Siri seems almost quaint. We’ve moved at the speed of light to voice recognition finding a restaurant for us to “smart homes” that play our music, regulate temperatures, adjust our mattresses, and (in theory at least) keep us safe from the outside world. These technologies have infiltrated our lives with such speed that they seem like they have always been here and to question their place in our lives seems almost like heresy. Any thought of a world without them seems antiquated and inconvenient. It is the future and everyone knows the future is inevitable. Or is it? Shoshana Zuboff’s “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism” asks just that question. Just how inevitable are these seemingly relentless incursions into our private lives? More importantly, at what cost do we allow them in? One of the main problems necessary to overcome before answering these questions however is distinguishing between technology and what Zuboff calls “surveillance capitalism”. The former is in and of itself neutral. It’s effect on society is entirely at the mercy of how it is used. It has no intrinsic morality. In contrast, “surveillance capitalism” is quite different:“Surveillance capitalism is not technology; it is a logic that imbues technology and commands it into action….That surveillance capitalism is a logic in action and not a technology is a vital point because surveillance capitalists want us to think that their practices are inevitable expressions of the technologies they employ….We cannot evaluate the current trajectory of information civilization without a clear appreciation that technology is not and never can be a thing in itself, isolated from economics and society. This means that technological inevitability does not exist. Technologies are always economic means, not ends in themselves"" “Surveillance capitalism” seeks to monetize the routines of our daily lives through collecting excruciatingly minute data about our every interaction and use it to modify our behavior and herd us toward a particular financial outcome. That emoji you posted on Facebook? That time you got angry at a friend on your Android? That video chat where you shifted uncomfortably in your chair? All logged and crunched into an extensive data profile that insurance companies can use to determine the cost of your policy, banks can use to determine if you’re a credit risk, and in China to determine if you are eligible for certain kinds of employment. This is not simply a digital footprint of websites you’ve visited where you can clear your history and move on. What companies like Facebook and Google are doing know is a radical reshaping of societies around the world. Consider:“In addition to Facebook’s already complex computational machinery for targeting ads, by 2016 the News Feed function depended upon one of the world’s most secretive predictive algorithms, derived from a God view of more than 100,000 elements of behavioral surplus that are continuously computed to determine the’personal relevancy’ score of thousands of possible posts as it scans and collects everything posted in the past week by each of your friends, everyone you follow, each group you belong to, and every Facebook page you’ve liked.” This is being done for financial gain to be sure (Pokemon Go directing players to paying advertisers or insurance companies purchasing customer profiles and shutting down cars remotely with drivers who they judge to be at risk) but more importantly it is shaping how we behave. As Zuboff writes, surveillance capitalists despise and seek to alleviate “friction”. Friction here meaning the unpredictability of human beings and their purchasing habits. It is no longer enough to simply hope they will want to by a particular product, we can now manipulate people toward desired outcomes based on their emotions and life patterns. It is truly terrifying and yet there is seemingly little outrage about this fundamental altering of who we are as human beings. Zuboff argues that this is in part due not only to the false feeling of inevitability these companies assure us of, but also due to the unprecedented nature of what is happening. As Zuboff writes:""In contrast, surveillance capitalism is a new actor in history, both original and sui generis. It is of its own kind and unlike anything else: a distinct new planet with its own physics of time and space, its sixty-seven-hour days, emerald sky, inverted mountain ranges, and dry water."" When contesting something that is familiar, we combat it with methods that are also familiar. Methods that have been tried, tested, and effective. However the unprecedented nature of surveillance capitalism upends all of that. Using existing law to legally restrain them takes years, during which time the incursions being resisted have either morphed into something totally different or have become such a habitual part of our lives to the point that we forget just what it was we were fighting. Zuboff calls this stage, habituation:“Whereas lawsuits and investigations unwind at the tedious pace of democratic institutions, Google continues the development of its contested practices at high velocity. During the elapsed time of FTC and FCC inquiries, court cases, judicial reviews, and EU Commission investigations, the new contested practices become more firmly established as institutional facts, rapidly bolstered by growing ecosystems of stakeholders. People habituate to the incursion with some combination of agreement, helplessness, and resignation. The sense of astonishment and outrage dissipates. The incursion itself, once unthinkable, slowly worms its way into the ordinary. Worse still, it gradually comes to seem inevitable. New dependencies develop. As populations grow numb, it becomes more difficult for individuals and groups to complain.” With surveillance capitalism moving at light speed, new methods of combatting it that move equally quickly must be used.  Particularly considering that surveillance capitalism, aware of the existential danger to its existence, is deeply imbedded in the governments in charge of regulating it. Consider the case of Google: “By April 2016, 197 individuals had migrated from the government into the Googlesphere, and 61 had moved in the other direction. Among these, 22 White House officials went to work for Google, and 31 Googlesphere executives joined the White House or federal advisory boards with direct relevance to Google’s business.” With tech companies firmly pitting a finger on the scale of regulation, a new way of controlling them is vital. Since we are increasingly not given a choice as to whether we assent to relinquishing the details of our personal lives, we must raise our voices and demand that choice. As surveillance capitalism creeps further and further into every facet of our lives, obliterating the concept of privacy while labeling it as being outdated, we must reclaim out humanity from their tyranny."

You know how I love secrecy. It is the only thing that can make modern life wonderful or mysterious to us. The commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it.Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian GrayThis is a book of extraordinary erudition and intelligence. She identifies the problem but also, where it is all leading, and why we are blithely going along with it. Arendt, Kafka, Rousseau, Paine, Piketty and many others are marshalled to her cause.So - in short, googlefacebookmicrosoftamazonverizon are making oodles of money from targeted ads, based on predictions of our behaviour which in turn are based on our activity online. Yeah yeah yeah, you say, we know this. Fine. But she goes further - their ultimate goal is not to stop at predicting our behaviour but shaping it. Cambridge Analytica, the targeted fake news aimed at influencing voting, was only the tip of the iceberg. The promise of the promise and the will to will run deeper than these deformities. They remind us of that place again where we humans heal the breach between the known and the unknowable, navigating the seas of uncertainty in our vessels of shared promises. In the real world of human endeavour there is no perfect information and no perfect rationality. Life inclines us to take action and to make commitments even when the future is unknown. Anyone who has brought a child into the world or has otherwise given her or his heart in love knows this to be true. God knows the future, but we move forward, take risks, and bind ourselves to others despite the fact that we can’t know everything about the present let alone the future. This is the essence of our freedom, expressed as the element right to the future tense. With the construction and ownership of the new means of behavioural modification, the fate of this right conforms to a pattern that we have already identified. Is it not extinguished but rather it is usurped, commandeered and accumulated by surveillance capital’s exclusive claims on our futures.

I’m so anxious to better understand how the tech giants like Google, Amazon and Facebook gather and use the vast amounts of data they collect. Unfortunately this book was a swing and a miss. The author is so passionately obsessed with vilifying these companies that the book regressed to a 700+ page vendetta. It’s obvious she did some amazing research but the portent of doom that pervades this book just got too annoying. Okay, I get it. These companies are invading our privacy. Can we get to the information now? The book starts with a mind-numbing 50 page tirade on how evil she thinks these companies have become. Why can’t she just let me make up my own mind after hearing the facts? She also has the annoying tendency of continually wandering into the weeds. She’ll just get going on the story of how a tech giant uses information and then suddenly we’re whisked off to 16th century Europe, or for some reason we’re discussing Homer. All of this is a vain attempt to make some tangential metaphorical point.I gave up on this book after 100 pages. Too bad. It’s a captivating topic. I know there is a lot of good insight buried somewhere inside this tome. I just wish someone with more focus and less of a score to settle had written this book."

What we are living through is a brand new kind of technology, and a brand new kind of business built on and for that. It astoundingly hard to grasp the nature of a paradigm shift while it is happening. Shoshanna Zuboff puts it all together into a single book: the history, the discovery, the development, from the Google taking the responsibility to find the right place to put the ad, to predicting behavior from digital exhaust, to the surprising technique of guaranteed outcomes.You already know that as users of Google search, we are not the customer. But we are not the product either. We are merely the source of something else: behavioral surplus. Google, and Facebook, and Amazon vacuum up that surplus which consists of old search queries, logs of mouse clicks, records of sites visited, and most importantly: ""like"" button clicks. None of this is of any value to us, but when aggregated it can tell a powerful story about each and every one of us. That behavioral surplus can be used to predict what we will do. If it was only prediction it would not be a particular problem. But this is where it turns dark: if you have a model that can predict what a person will do, then you can use that model to make people do things.Our democracy and capitalism is built on the idea of a free market. Adam Smith described the ""invisible hand"" of the market, that while millions of people made independent decisions for our own personal welfare, the market was structured to find a nearly optimal distribution of goods ans services. The hand is invisible because it was impossible to know everything the everyone was doing. The aggregate behavior of all people was unknowable.Until now.Google and Facebook have detailed profiles on most of the people in the country: some thorough and some not, but it is all getting much more complete as new devices emit ever more digital exhaust to be collected. It is surveillance-as-a-service. We can be quite sure the 2016 Brexit vote and the Trump victory were due in no small part to manipulation with the tools of surveillance capitalism. What happens to democracy when a company can sell guaranteed outcomes for a price? What happens to the free market when the invisible hand disappears and is replaced by plutocrats who simply manipulate the public will to their favor?We don't know the answers to these questions, and Zuboff doesn't either. It is too new. It is all just forming. Most of our legislators have only the faintest grasp of what is going on, much less what to do about it. But this is clearly the most important development of our time. If you want to understand it, this book is a monumental resource: well organized, well researched, well written.This is a timely book, not too soon, and not too late. On a five-star scale, I am giving it a six. It is that important.Wait ... we have had mass propaganda before that persuaded people and in some sense controlled them. Why is it any different this time? The difference is that through the collection of behavioral surplus, a very detailed model of every citizen can be constructed. From this model, algorithms can fashion a detailed plan for exactly what to display unique to each person. But it does not stop there: your behavior is further monitored to see which things you reacted to and which you didn't. This is used to further tune the model. Advertisements, memes, opinions, political statements, images are all thrust into the sidebars of the web pages. No two people get the exact same mix. Your response on every one can be captured and categorized independently. There has never in history been the ability to customize propaganda campaigns for individuals and be able to measure exactly how each individual responds. We have no precedence for this, and we have no idea where it is going or even how to change course if we see something amiss. Zuboff gives us detailed example after example of how this came about, how it is being used, and what the legal implications are. Even Roger McNamee who has just published a similarly themed book called ""Zucked"" admits that the big difference is that Zuboff has all the data. She compare this emergence to that of Totalitarianism just 100 years ago. Totalitarianism enveloped the individual in a state-wide system of total control. We are not to fear that this is all going toward totalitarianism -- that was last time, and this time is different. She coins the term ""Instrumentarianism"" to describe the way that unknown algorithms are at the root of collecting the data, building the models, and crafting the plan of persuasion. I guarantee in the next 5 to 10 years, you will be hearing a lot about Surveillance Capitalism and Instrumentarianism. We will need these new terms, and many other presented concepts just to understand what is happening. Only then, can we hope to navigate these stormy seas to the (hopefully) safe harbor once we know how to tame this new beast."

Unfortunately she seems to have attempted to do it in Klingon. A 250 page book without the repetitive, dense, unnecessarily high-flown prose would have been perfectly okay. Now this book will go down as a laborious, soul destroying pile of paper. 5 stars for the content, deduct three stars for the writing style."

21,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16848916-sasha-mircov,4,"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism is a very welcome and overdue attempt to provide a theory and critique of the information economy. Professor Soshana Zuboff does a great job of the former but the absolute and inescapable apocalypse her theory predicts is unconvincing. The two main concepts in Zuboff’s book are “surveillance capitalism” and “instrumentarian power” or, in less charged terms, the information economy and knowledge as power. In the spirit of some of the most prominent social theorists of the last century, such as Adorno, Arent, Weber, Marx and Foucault, Zuboff provides a coherent picture of the inner workings of big tech behind the information economy, notably Google and Facebook. She eloquently explains the effect of the quantified and all-connected world in which big tech is harvesting our ""digital behavioral surplus"" for profit, often without our informed and explicit consent. Zuboff’s prowess as a business professor shines through as she breaks down big tech’s business practices. From the business model of Google AdWords and Sheryl Sandberg’s influence to Google's lobbying strategies and Facebook's constant experimentation, the author gets it all right. She even ties it all together with the Internet of Things and The Fourth Industrial Revolution. As masterful as it is, the book is not without its shortfalls and deficiencies. The economic impact of the surveillance economy is barely discussed. In 2017, Google alone generated around $238B in economic activity. Google and Facebook are often the best-performing advertising platforms for millions of small and medium-size businesses. Another noticeable no-show in Zuboff's book is Amazon, perhaps because of its association with the concept of ""advocacy capitalism"" - a more favorable form of capitalism as described in Zuboff’s previous book, The Support Economy. The least convincing part of Zuboff’s most recent book is around what is at stake - our humanity, our freedom and even our free will. Free will, a finicky and controversial philosophical concept, is mutated into its meta-version, a will to will, which is the prerequisite for freedom and ultimately what defines us as humans. And it is precisely the ability to envision a future for ourselves that the “instrumentarian power” through “surveillance capitalism” is stealing away from us. Zuboff is not wrong. People are complex, dynamic systems and the very attempt to predict one’s future behavior can trigger adaptation. The information economy, mediated by prediction algorithms, does precisely that - it changes us. However, to fear the change because it will strip us of our free will leaves her worries hanging on a shaky nail. Zuboff is careful not to get entangled in the metaphysics of free will, leaving those inclined to question the concept with unanswered questions. Finally, for the 700 plus pages long polemic, the book is noticeably short of solutions. Zuboff acknowledges that regulation, such as the EU privacy regulation GDPR, are steps in the right direction and praises artists making clothing that can trick the image recognition software deployed by the surveillance capitalists. On a philosophical level, she calls for the development of synthetic declaration on surveillance capitalism ""to define and support other variants of information capitalism that participate in the social order, value people, and reflect democratic principles"". Blockchain, the one technology that sprung out of the need for privacy, is part of the problem according to Zuboff, especially smart contracts, or ""the anti-contracts"", as she calls them.In spite of the flaws, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism should be required reading for those who work in or with information technology. After all, what Professor Zuboff is doing in the book is predicting the future. And, in the same way Facebook's prediction and recommendation algorithms are slowly changing us, so will this book, but hopefully in the opposite direction."
22,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11407801-dramatika,4,"I read about this book in one of the Telegram channels, my only enjoyable source of the good news feed (not feel good news, just smth a little bit different and less mainstream) at the moment. I agree with the channel author (@hobbes_channel) that this book is as important as Capital by Thomas Piketty, and (I might add) flawed in many similar ways as well. This is a serious study on the ever changing world that we live now. I seem to experience a certain never ending feeling of doom and gloom ( if you live in Russia, this is more likely to be a semi permanent state for anyone with a conscience). The books I read lately reflect this all too well. This particular one is different in a sudden revelation how (once again) we came to live in completely new world order, where everything we took for granted and even guaranteed before now all in the past, a rare luxury available to a very few or none at all. Personal privacy is gone forever. I wouldn't repeat all the aspects of our life that are affected, you read it very well researched and excellently presented in this book. It is a not an enjoyable reading, unless you like horror or disaster genre, just prepare to lose a few night of sleep over the content it is that earth shattering in its scope and detail! For me it was just right up there continuing the beat of existential angst that is this life. The book is flawed in being too long and detailed in its research, (but less technical and more reader friendly than Piketty Talmud which I managed to fall asleep over many nights). Still I encouraged to read it in its entirety to understand step by step how we lost this battle of undeclared war over out own person hood of who we are as sentinel being. What I feel would be interesting add to this wonderful book is to show more how we still try to fight this war more. Deep web, vpn, migration to the unsmart simple phones (yes I knew a few ppl like that."

I decided to know what was behind the curtain and I am not sure I am happier now. This book unveils just how intrusive the big tech companies have been in our lives, mainly without our permission and without notifying us exactly what they were doing with the information. Google, Facebook, and others are directing our behavior even when we think we are choosing. Did you know know that it was proven in court that the Google Street View cars were capturing all our i.p addresses and other information as they drive by our homes? Zuck has spoken publically that the public doesn't care about privacy any more so FB doesn't really ask permission to steal your data and sell it for profit to other vendors without our knowing. The book was good but was way toooooooooooo long. I can't say I enjoyed it but I was enlightened."
25,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28060227-hannah-cook,2,"I really wanted to love this book as the subject is fascinating and horrifying and right up my alley. However it has a few things about it that i don't love. As I read it I was thinking man this is like someone's Phd thesis (ie impenetrable and a lot of ""as we saw in chapter 1 blah blah"" and ""we will see in chapter 2 blah blah"" - it's like, if you didn't do that every constantly the book would be half as long). And then I checked out the author and she is a Harvard academic. So that it explains it. Not that everything should be dumbed down, but this feels like it is purposefully trying to be hyper intellectual and the result is a giant yawn fest. My other issue with it is that she doesn't actually clearly enough articulate what the problem with surveillance capitalism is. Or rather, her argument is not that compelling to me. There is a lot of ""surveillance capitalism is causing us to lose the will to will"" (wtf) and it is ""stealing our right to a future tense"" (also wtf). But, as I mentioned in an earlier comment, my dad made a much better argument when he said that surveillance capitalism is bad for the environment. The author goes on about modifying human behaviour, but fails to spell out that it is modifying our behaviour so we BUY MORE STUFF. And consumption is what is destroying the planet. Because she focuses on the ""right to future tense"" stuff, and relegates environmental destruction to something that was caused by the industrial revolution onwards, rather than something that is caused by how we/corporations behave now, I think she is missing more than half the story (which is quite an achievement in a book so long). All that is not to say that I don't have a renewed distrust of Google and Facebook et al. They really are the absolute worst."

27,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17999985-brendan,5,"5Big data is a word you'll see constantly hitting the media and non fiction sections of your favourite shop, and as the technology grows, so will the capabilities of big data. The Age of Surveillance Capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff has come out at exactly the right moment, and it should be on your to-read list. This book is a thorough understanding of what is happening, much that isn't televised, or published by journalists. The gateway to our privacy has been open and it's not designed for our benefit. This book is a must read for the next decade, very relevant and informative. This book is tough work. Every page is information and it will test your patience. I do understand the low scores, but they don't reflect the truth about this book. It's an essential read for anyone with children, or is living in a world of ignorance. I will admit I knew big data before it was coined big data, but what the author has created is a bible of information on the biggest data companies in the world. Our information and digital imprint is going to be worth everything in this capitalistic world. This next decade is going to be interesting as AI and technology growth is outgrowing our laws and institutions. We're not protected, and this is where the book vividly demonstrates it's not a great thing. Shoshana Zuboff has done a lot of homework and I didn't rush this book like many others. I wanted to learn exactly what is going on, and it's quite scary. Consider the latest controversy with Facebook dialling in on the younger generations and twisting people's opinions for political means. I tend to think of the late bloomers with technology to be the luckiest. The chapters here are full of referencing and the research references are 200 pages. The author is passionate and if you're lucky enough to have taken the leap into the rabbit hole, finding that exit is going to be tough. Why the 5?Strong book. The author deliveries a book for the decade and it's a lot of information to process. This is a one time deal and I would recommend reading this, and maybe checking out some of the reference books or articles. Big data is allowing our lives to be penetrated by capitalism, and they essentially know you better than you know your self. They can predict what you want to buy, or predict patterns via GPS. Telecommunication and internet providers collect the data, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple are all collecting every bit of data they can. The customers of this data are not out to help you. The people buying your data are insurance companies and big business, capitalism on steroids. Imagine you drive over the speed limit because they collect the data and your GPS coordinates, and the police units just send you an email/letter for the fine. You sign up for fitness apps and the health insurance people decide to increase your premiums due to the fact you eat, or don't exercise enough. This is the future of big data. They will tell you they are doing it to improve their service, but why sell the data to corporations?There's an issue growing here and it's outgrowing our comfort zone, e.g. country laws. They are essentially using all the data against us for financial purposes, and the worst thing is that these companies are pushing technology boundaries. Imagine you buy a product and think I don't have to link it to anything. They won't allow you to upgrade functions, or patch tech issues if you don't allow them. There's a growing issue here and that's why I recommend this book for the next decade relevance. This is information overload, but worth the time. "
28,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58564-joshua,4,"As one might guess from the title, this book takes the dimmest possible view of the tech industry as currently constructed. It's a compelling and useful case, even if it overindulges in its own academic jargon and seems at time weirdly unaware of the industry is it comparing to the 21st century version of totalitarianism. Early in the book, Zuboff makes the important point that surveillance capitalism is not technology, but a business model. It requires technology to exist, but technology doesn't need surveillance capitalism. Instead, Google and Facebook found out that they could harvest ""behavioral surplus"" -- information that the use of their products created -- and turn it into a wholly new form of currency. Soon the entire economy followed in their footsteps, until today we are required to subject ourselves to commercial surveillance as a part of any economic interaction. ""The very idea of a functional, effective, affordable product or service as a sufficient basis for economy exchange is dying,"" as she writes. Zuboff notes that many eras of capitalism have been built on the discovery of an un-mined form of raw material that can be claimed at no cost and built into enormous empires. European imperialists sailed across the sea and claimed land without having to pay for it. Tech companies figured out ways to collect proprietary troves of personal data. Zuboff doesn't really bother even to frame this in the usual way, as an exchange, where users receive useful services in exchange for sharing this data. In her mind, any gains are so small they're not worth mentioning in comparison to what has been given up. If she glosses over the benefits of tech platforms, Zuboff also can get a bit carried away with downsides. The book suffers from her inability to pick the best examples to make her main point, which is that the collection of personal data leads to irresistible behavior modification and the loss of autonomy. One of Zuboff's two main illustrations is Pokemon Go, a fad from a few years back. She then attacks it with ominous and dense academic prose. Here she is describing how the ability of businesses to pay to promote their locations in the game is dystopian mind-control. ""The game had demonstrated that it was possible to achieve economies of action on a global scale while simultaneously directing specific individual actions towards precise local market opportunities where high bidders enjoy an ever-closer approximation of guaranteed outcomes."" Pokemon Go is not dystopian mind-control. But YouTube and Facebook may be! Yet Zuboff doesn't even seem aware of how content recommendation algorithms drive people towards conspiracy theories and extreme content because the computers learn that this is what keep people engaged with the content for the longest. This is totally what she's talking about when she goes about ""radical indifference"" -- the tendency of tech platforms to control people's behavior without caring what they're actually doing. These shortcomings are frustrating given that 1) this is a long-ass book, and 2) a lot of what she's getting at has real merit. Wading through the book's excesses is worth it, though, because the framework of a really scary argument is all here. Among Zuboff's many analogies, the one that lingered with me what her comparison of surveillance capitalism to industrial capitalism. In industrial capitalism, great economic fortunes were made at the expense of fundamental damage to the environment. With surveillance capitalism, the pollution is damaging human nature instead."
29,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3663809-alex-orr,1,"This is so poorly written, so horrendously edited (was it edited?), and so stupefyingly redundant that it's really hard to adequately capture in words. You really have to slog through it yourself to understand the depths of its faults. So, let me save you the frustration. The author basically is saying that the aim of much of our current cutting edge technology is to gather as much data about us as possible through everything from smart homes, smart cars, and (obviously) social media in order to construct a perfect simulacrum of ourselves in order to not just sell us more stuff, but to mold our behaviors...nay...our whole lives...as the companies deploying this tech see fit. That's about it. This book is a Ted Talk gone off the rails in the hands of an author who never met an ancillary idea she didn't want to include, and who really, really, REALLY loves to restate her hypotheses over, and over, and over... In the third part of the book, she literally devotes a whole chapter to summarizing the previous chapter. Every second or third paragraph exists solely to restate the preceeding paragraphs. Whole paragraphs exist only to lay out what she will tell us in the proceeding paragraphs and then later (you guessed it) she devotes whole paragraphs to summarizing the previous paragraphs. As for her central ideas? Ehhh.... Look, if you're aware of this book then you're already well aware of her central ideas because they're some of the most commonly discussed and hotly debated in the realms of big data, online privacy, and the growing sway Silicon Valley holds over our lives. The people who are unaware of these issues really could use a shorter, tighter, and just plain easier to read book to perhaps wake them up. The biggest problem I found (other than this being an atrociously written and edited book) is the author's extreme confidence in her beliefs of how this is all going to play out. By the end of the book she is talking of a near-future defined by a sort of techno-fascism in which the individual self has been exterminated from the world. Subtlety is not in her intellectual toolkit. If you decide to tackle this massive misfire at least take come comfort in knowing that it gets easier to read because you become far more comfortable skimming dozens of pages in a matter of seconds since most of it is usually just stuff she said earlier in the book that is repeated, often identically, for no other reason than...well...I don't know. This book reads like a wild and wooly first draft, not like a thoughtful, streamlined, well laid out, final version."
30,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1368664-loafingcactus,3,"Normally I wouldn't be so bold as to review a book I had read only partially, but looking over the other reviews available so far I am emboldened. I only had this massive book available to me for a short time, so I read the conclusion, which would stand alone as a pamphlet.The conclusion is basically Ellul's The Technological Society (another massive, and very worthwhile, book), albeit with the course of history narrowed and Ellul's supernatural solution replaced by a humanistic one. I find both authors' solutions unlikely, and Zuboff's has the added problem of arguing that surveillance capitalism is not the same thing as industrial capitalism and then arguing that the same (questionably effective) solutions to make it humane will work. Why would that be?Ellul would disagree that surveillance capitalism is in any way different from industrial capitalism. Rather, the logic of the one flows into the other and the other was completely predictable (he predicted it in his book).As far as I can tell no individual can swim against this tide, and changing the direction of the sea in which we live would require disrupting the entire logic of social organization, democratic or otherwise, that has existed for all time. I doubt that can be done without massive human destruction. I think it will be done, in this age of the Anthropocene, by the massive human destruction that will flow inevitably from environmental destruction, but that is not the outcome that either Ellul or Zuboff were looking for (though Zuboff makes a nod to it as a co-equal problem)."
31,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33253397-yury,1,"I could not finish the book. This book calls for a good editor. The writing in the book is really bad, wordy and watery. There are way too many romance novel cliches. There are too few facts and numbers in this book. Logic and reasoning is flawed in many places. The book reads like judgements and opinion piece. I have managed to get through only 100 pages. I strongly recommend to wait until this get edited into readable form. This edition is a torture to read."

34,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874435-manu,4,"Around the same time last year, I remember tweeting a quote attributed to Jamie Bartlett - ""The end result will be ad targeting so effective that you may well question the notion of free will altogether"". Connecting digital advertising to free will seems absurd, but it wasn't a facetious remark. It reflected the reality of our times. This is the reality that Shoshana Zuboff explores and confronts in The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, frequently echoing the thought that keeps cropping up in my mind - how did we get here? She begins with a deeply personal story about her home, and brings up an ""aware home"" project in 2000, which among other things, assumed that the rights to the knowledge would lie in the hands of the human living in it. She then juxtaposes it against the current privacy policy and usage agreements of Google's Nest, which all but completely gives the ownership to the search giant. This is just one example. Industrial capitalism thrived by exploiting nature, and surveillance capitalism is thriving by using human nature as a resource. That means that even though, due to rapid industrialisation and mass production, we got to a ""second modernity"" that provided millions access to experiences which were until then the preserve of a smaller elite, we are now being led back into a ""neofeudalism"", a consolidation of elite wealth and power. How did this happen?Google plays the primary antagonist in this narrative, and though Brin and Page were initially reluctant, the 2000 bust set Google on a path that used the ""behavioural surplus"" generated by users. At a basic level, it is probably difficult to imagine that when one carries out a search on Google, the machine is searching for patterns in the expressed intent, and making rapid incursions into one's life. And yet, that's exactly how it works. It then leads to prediction products, economies of action and future behaviour markets, fuelled by an ever expanding scope of information extraction. Those ridiculous permissions apps require make sense now? And how does a corporation create and grow a future behaviour market? Simple, behaviour modification, whether you realise it or not. Over a period of time, Google has institutionalised its invasions into private human domains, helped in the beginning by the national security imperative following the 9/11 attacks. Chrome, GMail, Android, Photos, YouTube and so on have created a dependency that now borders on feeling left out of the societal narrative if one is not using these. The behind-the-scenes look at Pokémon Go is chilling - in terms of how users were giving away data of their own volition, how partners were brought on board to expand the scope of surveillance, and how human behaviour was controlled at global scale. Facebook makes its presence felt in the latter half of the book, thanks to its exploitation of social connections. By creating a prototype of a hive mind through the weaponisation of peer group reinforcement, it increasingly shapes minds and behaviour, especially that of young adults. The author uses Goffman's framing in The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life and shows how the ""backstage"", where individuals are truly themselves, is now shrinking thanks to the omnipresence of social incursions. Where does this lead to? One example is when the state starts using this power - China's social credit system now has a direct impact on an individual's life, driving economies of action in the real world. More broadly, totalitarianism, driven by powerful corporations. The consequences are that there is increasingly no refuge, no sanctuary, from the relentless efforts of corporations that are intent on controlling every facet of an individual's existence. At a broader level, it threatens the fabric of society and democracy itself. Capitalism's latest avatar has clearly gone rogue, refusing to abide by the reciprocal nature of every kind of interaction we have experienced thus far. Regulation isn't really keeping up, except for some efforts by the EU. But there are those who refuse to give up - activists, and artists who use technology to keep out surveillance. However, this is a fight we have to contribute to, because what's at stake is what makes us human - free will, or at least the notion of it. This is not an easy read, but it is a must-read!"
35,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229510-scott-shjefte,3,"The concept presented is not simple and is made more difficult by the author. It is logical diverse in the presentation of ideas. This book is textually extremely difficult both in lexical difficulty and in syntactical difficulty. Also while in the misty fog of presentation you really don't know where the author intended to go until you reanalyze what you just read then you have to figure out the logic/truthfulness of what was presented followed by integrating it into the whole of the chapter/book. Basically what I got out of the book is that we consumer human beings are losing our freedom of choice and loss of our ability to self-determination by our being totally analyzed by a 'comprehensive intelligence databases' that can be used to trigger our behavior to do what companies, unknown agents, or even governments want. There is a lot of examples referenced with a slew of people quoted. Textual difficulty means how easy or hard a text is to read.

36,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11651139-john,3,"Whoof. I need time to put my opinions in order. This is a zeroth draft.I work at Google. This book is a direct attack on Google and Facebook and the industry they enable. So it covers topics I have thought about, and also felt like a personal attack, which I resented and had to repeatedly take a step back to listen to.My feeling is: to somebody who hasn't thought about the impact of modern internet systems on privacy, this is a critical eye-opener. Do not imagine your privacy doesn't matter; do not imagine the authorities will never target you because they have bigger fish to fry. The way surveillance -- and I'm thinking about the NSA here, but it works for internet companies -- works is that data is amassed ahead of time into a giant ""data lake,"" and then analyses are run over it. So if your data is being collected, it is going into the machine, and you do need to reason about how that might hurt you.To someone who has thought about privacy, this book is annoyingly naïve, in that ""shit-colored goggles"" way. That means that one the surface, it is so grim you assume it's sophisticated -- but it's actually naïve because it phrases everything in terms of an entity who wants to do you harm, but giving that entity a motive is a cop-out. The reality is much scarier: well-intentioned people, who from my experience may even have utopian motives and beliefs, are amassing data that they are going to their wits ends to protect against unauthorized access; and they exist in an environment in which the criticality of that privacy is paramount, and thus they feel safe amassing the data under those restrictions. But the data is still being amassed, and data is like toxic waste; the very fact that it exists creates a permanent risk. One risk is unauthorized third party access; another risk is that someday the regime running the company will not share the high ideals that currently allow these collection systems to thrive, and it'll be too late to protect the data against that regime.But if you don't work at Google or Facebook and don't have that insight into the seriousness applied to privacy [I have never worked at Facebook, and am only guessing, and might be being over-generous given Cambridge Analytica], it is reasonable to assume the worst, and it is reasonable to ask: what would be a better world, where data was shared only in derived forms with consent and had a time-to-live attached? I'm not sure this book asks that question, but it could lead you to the point where you would ask it.The book is consistently written in a polemical style, using very loaded language: data is always ""plundered,"" not ""collected,"" etc. Maybe that's necessary to wake up some of the audience to the issue; the problem for me is that it implies intent, intent which is being applied to an organization, and what does that mean? Surely not that every human in the organization has that intent; in fact, I don't think it means that the leaders have that intent, or that any individual has that intent. It can really only mean that an emergent behavior of the organization is to behave as if it has this intent, but that's a very abstract thing. If an emergent behavior of the organization can be explained by saying it has this intent, but also through the more reality-based statement that several individuals in that organization have a different intent (e.g. to make users happier by having tools that serve them better by understanding their usage patterns, and assuming that making users happy and profit are a virtuous cycle), does the former somehow swamp the latter?I found this book consistently insulting and frustrating, but it made me think about how to frame my own thoughts. Maybe it would be useful to others in that light."
37,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51266245-kath,4,"I struggled a bit with how I was going to rate this book. I do feel like I learned a lot from this book and it gave me a lot of ideas to chew on. I am the target audience for this book. I already agree with Zuboff on many of her ideas about the inherent issues when it comes to tech companies owning our data, even when that data is an essential part of our person. I don't like the idea that Facebook uses my face as data to be used in facial recognition software just because I put a picture of myself on Instagram. However, this was not a book that was ""fun"" to read. This isn't a devastating criticism. I've read a lot of very academic, hard-to-parse texts (Foucault comes to mind) and I understand that a lot can be gained from a book that is challenging to read. In this case though I felt that Zuboff did not always convey her ideas clearly and it was that and not the level of the ideas that made it hard to read. This book reads a lot like theory and that's probably because it basically is. This book is very well researched with the last 30% being made up of all the notes and sources and Zuboff should be commended for this effort. This makes this book very dense but also very informative. Even when I disagreed with Zuboff, I was able to look at the notes and look further into her claims. I do think Zuboff may overreach slightly in some of her claims, especially in the claim that tech companies and surveillance capitalists are trying to completely erase individuality and that they are already on the way to doing so. I actually don't think this is completely off base as those companies can make more profit if they know exactly how we will react and that is much easier to do if everyone acts the same. These companies also often discuss how the want to streamline our lives and this is much easier to do if they can stop us from making ""bad choices."" I think the problem with Zuboff's argument to this point is that she simply does not provide enough evidence to support her claim that tech companies are well on their way to controlling us to this extent. I think Zuboff's stronger claim comes with her argument that these companies are eroding our belief in democracy. I think this has become clear with their insistence to stand by the policies of taking a completely hands off approach. Recently, after Jack Dorsey of Twitter made the decision to flag some of Donald Trump tweets for misinformation surrounding mail-in ballots, Mark Zuckerberg went on Fox news and said he did not think Facebook should be the arbiter of truth. Well, unfortunately they already are and it sucks. People will often talk about how people need to get out of their echo-chambers but these companies make that really hard because showing people things they disagree with but won't get angry at is bad for their bottom line. I think Zuboff does a good job showing the history of how and why we got to this point. I was a little surprised at which social theorists and sociologists were not in this book. Zuboff does discuss Marx, Polanyi, and Goffman, all theorists I have read, and she does discuss Bentham's panopticon, but only cites Foucault once in this 704 page book. I don't understand how you write a book with this title and not address the ideas of the man who first explicitly connected surveillance and capital accumulation. I also think a discussion of how Louis Althusser's ideas of the ideological state apparatus applies to tech companies in their attempts to get us to act in a certain way would have added an interesting layer to her arguments. As a sociology student, I was left somewhat wanting for more sociological reasoning for her arguments and I think including more sociological theory would have strengthened her argument. I also would have liked to see at least some discussion of the basic flaws in the data these tech companies may be gather to full their algorithm and new technologies. One area I thought about on this topic for a while is predictive policing. Any data put into a predicitive policing algorithm will be biased due to the fact that communities of color have been subject to higher rates of policing for years due to many different racist reasons. Because people of color tend to live in segregated communities due to red-lining and those communities are over-policed, more people of color are arrested. Even if the algorithm somehow doesn't pick up on the race disparities in current police data, it will likely pick up on the geographic differences and therefore, communities of color will continue to be over policed. Zuboff makes the claim that tech companies gathering our data makes them all knowing about our behavior but she does not acknowledge the ways that this data could be biased going in and therefore their conclusions could contain those biases. Even the data provided by the users can be biased because of systematic issues of racism that create differences in access to education and other areas of knowledge. Zuboff makes claims about the ""division of learning."" I think she should have addressed how not all people are given equal access to this domain to begin with. This book also led to some ideas for me to think about in my own research and thinking as a sociologist. I really liked reading about Stanley Milgrams' breaching exercises and how it created such strong social anxiety because he was aware of the fact that he was breaking social norms. I think it would be interesting to think about and study how the increase of social norms related entirely to how we interact online and on social media adds to this social anxiety or transforms the sort of action we perceive as breaking social norms offline. I think this is a great and well researched argument about some of the problems with the way we currently allow private companies to own data we have given them no right to. We are no longer the customer. Targeted advertising does not help me. It is not something that I want, it is something advertisers want and it helps the companies bottom line. I think we should acknowledge this book for what it is; an excellent start to theorizing about this topic. I expect in the future other theorists will flesh out, push back on, build on, and improve the ideas presented in this book, as is the tradition of social theory."
38,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/729719-lance-eaton,5,"First off, I'm aware of the irony in writing and posting this review online through an Amazon product (GoodReads) and a Google product (Blogger) and how in doing so, I am further contributing to the exact problem and concern that Zuboff is offering. But that doesn't matter cause if you are on such a platform, you really need to read this powerful (though massive) book. The central argument is that the move into the digital realm created an opportunity for companies to capture what she refers to as ""behavioral surplus."" This surpluse comes in the forms of being able to completely track all behaviors of people when they move into the online world (through clicks, time on sites, scrolling, etc) and being able to use such surplus as means of testing and manipulating users down certain pathways; often unknowningly and often for the purpose of generating more revenue for companies. Ultimately, Zuboff is arguing that the move into the digital has turned humans into lab rats, constantly manipulated and used in the purpose of furthering the cache of the lab scientists, while the rats are often going about what they assume is their own business. If this idea feels overwhelming or scary, then you're on the right track. Zuboff wants readers to understand the depth and the degree to which companies nad the many thought leaders (such as Alex Pentland) who are offering such techno-utopias and what we can discover (or rather, control) about humanity is already enacted to a degree that we should find disturbing. Her work is so much more than just a critique of technology though but a complex exploration of how capitalism as an economic force has increasingly become coercive in ways that are violent to the body and mind. It's hard not to read her work and wonder where all of this will lead. Her work is one of those books that make you feel frustrated and maybe helpless but that you know you are the better for having read. "
39,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61750298-yvo-hunink,4,"I was already scared, but now I am terrified.For almost 2 years I have been advocating privacy-by-design solutions for a local government and been pointing out a failing digital infrastructure. Mostly, I did that from a perspective of giving more control to people over their own data. After reading Zuboff, I can safely say I feel uneasy about making any move on the internet, knowing it can create emotional profiles of me with the slightest bit of information. Even typing this review, and goodreads being owned by Amazon, makes me question if it is wise to share my thoughts on all the books I read. However, it not just the content of our data, but even the meta-data around it that can help to create detailed images of someone.We are way more f'cked than we think. It is not that big tech wants to know exactly what we do. It is that they want to be able to predict what we do, so that they can provide guaranteed outcomes to their advertising clients. And now they don't just want to predict our behaviour, they want to control it, in whatever way we are controllable. First it was modification of our digital steps, then it became modification of our physical steps, and now more and more we see the emotional modification that is invading the political sphere.Orwell was right to some extend, but not everything. Firstly, it was not the state, but the company that created this paradigm (though the US and China have jumped on this boat now too), and secondly, it was not the modification of our soul into a preset condition of belief, but our behaviour as a predictable organism that we are being seduced into. Especially young people are being damaged for life right now. We need to act soon.Let there be a digital future, but let there be a human one first. This quote from Zuboff says it all for me. We now need to focus on setting the right fundaments of a digital society, and retake what is ours -> our humanity.Why not 5? While the critique of Zuboff is very detailed, I am missing a toolbox to change this paradigm. What should we do? As individuals, but also as governments, or socially responsible companies. The book leaves us with only a few handles to act upon. Also I am missing some more statistics. Societal values are not always captured in numbers, but it would be good to reflect a bit on how big the problem actually is, or where the biggest impact is, so that we could specify corrective measures in a better way."
40,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43726398-apar-gupta,2,"Human cognition is a function of language. It may seem obvious, but in the absence of articulated legibility, we are bereft of comprehension, left without the ability of analysis, if not planned action. This is a difficult task for scholars at times when social change is occurring so visibly and dramatically that it challenges academic calm. In the rapidly changing ecology of a digitised society, the challenge becomes greater when analysis is not limited to the present but extended to the future. The Age of Surveillance Capitalism attempts precisely this.The phrase has a definite phonetic appeal. Though the coinage cannot be attributed neatly to Zuboff, she underlines its importance to the networked world. The polysemy of “surveillance capitalism” is defined in stark, clear terms of digital doom. Described as, “a new economic order that claims human experience as free raw material”, “a parasitic economic logic”, “a rogue mutation” even a “significant threat to human nature”. While to some this may seem polemical, the book serves an important function even as social invective.Monthly data breaches, disinformation spread over digital networks and the large-scale deployment of biometric technologies has sensitised large numbers of people in India. But to what? We lack the grammar and framework to understand the rapid changes in our environment. The pace of technological change is easily matched by its scale, creating a perpetual tension between the ways of the past and the reality of the present. As the firm roots of individual liberty of our constitutional values, democratic traditions of political participation and the relationship between the individual and the state are thrown into contest, we urgently need help. This has to start with language. Zuboff provides it readily, explaining this point of history as the “second modernity”: “[W]e live in this collision between a centuries-old story of modernisation and a decades-old story of economic violence that thwarts our pursuit of effective life.”These are big concepts which are parsed by documenting the project of conservative economic thought with the execution of state policy, particularly in the US. References to Europe are inadequate, indicating the geographical limitation of the work. This is an important limitation that also affects learning from countries like India. For instance, one of the underlying elements of surveillance capitalism, is what is termed as the “uncontract”. This goes beyond the terms of service which many smartphone users promptly agree to, swiping them away as an annoyance delaying the delivery of desired digital reward. It is explained as, “uncontract desocialises the contract… [and] human agency… [it] bypasses all that social work in favour of compulsion…” It is hard to read these sentences without thinking about the compulsory biometric programme, Aadhaar which remains voluntary only in theory, but for all practical purposes has become a mandatory requirement.Geographical limitation is not merely cosmetic. Large parts of the commentary are focussed on the rise and the commercial imperatives of Google and Facebook. As Zuboff explains, their actions are premeditated and with disregard for the harms that result from the ceaseless, pervasive and ubiquitous collection of personal data. Both companies service a large number of internet users in India, a number which continues to grow, even outstripping other countries. Hence, beyond Aadhaar, the entire project of surveillance capitalism is being implemented in India by Silicon Valley giants. It is only natural that the product choices made in such a large market will impact users even in Western liberal democracies, to which the book caters.This does not diminish the importance of Surveillance Capitalism, which is already providing fertile ground to scholars. But many of them have found it lacking in scholarly rigour. This is not to say that references are lacking — on the contrary, the endnotes are extensive, and care has been taken to make them engaging. However, there are obvious leaps of coinage, in which bridges to existing scholarship on surveillance are not built. For instance, influential conceptual frameworks which have been conventionally utilised for understanding surveillance and power asymmetries such as Michel Foucault’s Discipline and Punish (1975) are ignored.Equally troubling was the disregard for the existing legal doctrines of informational privacy and competition law. While Zuboff argues that this modern predicament is unprecedented, the law, even its conceptual boundaries, are being tested and explored. For instance, in the Supreme Court of India’s right to privacy judgment in 2017 (which is ignorantly derided as a “bundle of essays”), several individual opinions of judges link privacy to a broad swathe of fundamental rights. They even point to the dangers of unchecked expropriation of personal data to be a fundamental re-ordering of power that poses a danger to free will and autonomy.Given the importance of Surveillance Capitalism, even if isolated to the conversations prompted by it, criticisms will need to be engaged with in good faith. This will help us deepen human understanding of both the nature of the problems we face and the opportunity for a better world. This is a tough ask. Many analysts draw an artificial boundary between digital convenience enabling a multitude of human function, and its critical examination. No wonder important works fail to find popular resonance and subsequent political action. While the solution to these problems may not seem to be any closer, this book provides it’s readers many mental Lego pieces.This book is a reminder that words are not only created by bureaucratic reviews of the board of editors of an English dictionary. They are more often defined by emotional weight, as in the personal essays employed by Zuboff. To know what we are feeling, we need terms capable of describing it accurately. In this service of a basic human need to articulate, Surveillance Capitalism not only provides us with language, but also sounds a much-needed alarm."
41,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58559285-christina,4,"This book was really eye-opening, as in I knew this was a problem but did not realize how bad it really is. The book wasn't the easiest read though, because it felt very academic and had a lot of economics and sociology vocabulary (and a lot of repetition, but that's common in nonfiction), so the writing style was difficult for me. The author seems to have been thorough though, and did a good job covering both concrete events and announcements as well as abstracting it all (though the abstractions seem to be geared more towards economists/sociologists).It was interesting to read this while also reading the biography of John D. Rockefeller, Sr. There are interesting parallels, which will hopefully continue in the form of regulations eventually catching up to the industry....Anyway, why read science fiction when you can read about our current surveillance capitalist world instead?

It provides a lot of valuable information and seems to be very well researched. My biggest problem was that authorial voice struck me as shrill and whiney. I'm fine with a good polemic. Karl Marx was the master of that kind of thing, and if Ms. Zuboff had written her book in the Marxian tradition as Surveillance Kapital, I would have had a rollicking good time with it. But while she uses a lot of perjorative terminology and is consistently negative, she doesn't really land a lot of solid blows. Another possibly better way to have written the book would have been to write it in a neutral matter of fact style and let her targets damn themselves with their actions.By putting herself in full-on attack mode, Ms. Zuboff loses the ability to acknowledge that Google in particular and to a lesser extent Facebook have done a lot of good that has actually enriched our lives. I do agree that there is some dangerous bad stuff that comes along with the good. I'd like to have more control over my own identity than seems to be possible any longer, and I am uncomfortable with the idea that big data algorithms can be used to shape my behavior in ways that I might not like if I were conscious of what was being done to me. Still, I wouldn't throw the baby out with the bathwater. Anybody who remembers internet search before Google knows that we have come a long way, and though much of Facebook is bogus and mind numbing, it provides a nice way for people who are separated to stay connected. I don't like some of the darker sides of surveillance, but I am happy to have ads served to me for products that might actually interest me.I was surprised that Ms. Zuboff never mentions Foucault's famous ""Discipline and Punish"" which is clearly in synch with her point of view. Foucault points out that the rationalization of the prison system going from trial by ordeal and brutal public punishment to trial by jury and ""rehabilitation"" in prisons, though ostensibly a move in the direction of rationality, humanity and justice, was really a way for those in power to exercise greater control with a result that was ulitmately more dehumanizing than the system it replaced. Foucault also saw the modern prison as being the model for all dehumanizing mass organizations of modern socienty -- the factory, the army, bureaucracies and even hospitals and schools. At least Foucault had the courage to acknowledge that these same prison-based inhuman institutions are the basis for modern prosperity, so that we probably have to accept them if we want the good parts of the modern world. Interestingly, Ms Zuboff does briefly reference Jeremy Bentham's panopticon, which for Foucault was the utimate metaphor for the modern prison.Another issue that I had with this book is Ms. Zuboff's glorification of old fashioned individualism and democracy as the antidote to the problems that she describes. In this regard, I think that she is incredibly naive and even a bit of a Luddite. I don't have a problem with the idea of moving toward a more collective society. China and Japan have always had much more collective cultures than Western Europe and the United States, yet they seem to be doing just fine in the modern world. And democracy as practiced in the United States today is already so broken for other reasons that I'm reluctant to rely on it as the way out of these problems. The solution to the problems described in this book has to be forward looking to have any chance of success. We do need to find a way to rehumanize our culture, but let's do it by making the best use of the tools at hand, not by turning back the clock. It's not about throwing wrenches into the machine, it's about building better machines that facilitate and encourage real human interaction, and backing that up with humanistic education (not just STEM) that will build the values that we need to have to move hopefully into the future. We also need to have a regulatory framework that recognizes a stronger right to own our own information and that requires a much higher level of transparency and disclosure (GDPR is a good start in this direction, though it has many serious flaws.) I see this as a giant Red Queen's Race between the forces of humanity and inhumanity. The forces of humanity need to be running faster and faster just to stay in the same place, but I think that is absolutely possilble. The future will probably look very different from the present, and it will not necessarily be a place where I would be comfortable living, but it does not have to be awful or dehumanizing, and the further growth of technology and greater understaning of how to use big data will bring some incredible benefits along with some undoubted problems."
46,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70474434-carsten,5,"When I finished TAOSC last night, I knew that I just had finished an important book. The accumulation of data by Google, Facebook, Twitter and other internet giants has changed, and will further change, society from the ground-up. The question is: how much control will  we  have over the data and how it is used? Who has the power? As Zuboff asks:  Who knows? Who decides? Who decides who decides?  The book is divided in three parts. The first part (The Foundation of Surveillance Capitalism) traces the origins of SC (the stories of Google and Facebook are told here). The second part (The Advance of Surveillance Capitalism) describes how the internet giants (again Google, Facebook in particular) invaded every part of our lives and how it dealt with criticism. The last part (Instrumentarian Power for a Third Modernity) is rather theoretical but I felt that it is an essential part of TAOSC: How will SC affect democracy? How will a future society look like if SC is left unchecked? Chapter 16, in which Zuboff describes how we can witness life in a SC society (she calls it the ""hive"") by watching our children growing up, left me deeply worried that many politicians are too slow (unwillingly but possibly also willingly) in understanding the impact of unchecked SC on society. I have given the book 5 stars because I feel this is an important book and should be widely read. But it is a long book, possibly too long. The points made in this book can be written down in a book half that length. I found reading it hard work, but I can recommend TAOSC highly. If you are looking for a similar but shorter book on this topic, I recommend Jamie Bartlett's book  ""The People vs Tech"" , but Zuboff goes much deeper."

At least the Cliff's Notes version - it is quite long (19 cds). At times I felt I was in a classroom, and I certainly learned a lot of new vocabulary. Besides Surveillance Capitalism, some of the concepts Zuboff introduced were Instrumentarianism, Big Other, and Behavioral Surplus. The big 4 - Facebook, Google, Apple & Microsoft - are and have been collecting our behavioral surplus data and monetizing it for years. The questions we all need to be asking about our data are: Who knows? Who decides who knows? And who decides who decides? Search any of these terms and you'll find interviews with Zuboff.

It is not necessary to agree with every single point she makes here (and I don't) to be dumbstruck by the overall argument. To be astonished at how she manages to connect the dots on what's been happening in the past two decades, identifying and describing phenomena that's at once pervasive and yet somehow invisible. It's been in front of us all along -- we just didn't have a language for what we were seeing. Until now.How do we suppose that Google and Facebook became so immensely huge and rich companies in such a comparatively short time, when the services they are offering are free to the end user?

We need to know all this; but in a more accessible form."
51,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,4,"Yikes! They are taking all of our data and analyzing it so that they know more about us than we know about ourselves. They are using this data and their knowledge about it to sell us stuff. Now ... they are moving into the world of action to herd us into one direction or another and life as they wish within the hive, all the while fattening their pockets as they increasingly control our lives. There is nothing we can do about it. We all might as well sit back, sign in, and pretend like we are having fun.Get the idea??Shoshana Zuboff has produced a new political economy of the Internet Age. Some unpacking is needed to make sense of it.For starters, the argument provides an overall economic logic for the digital age. This is the idea of ""surveillance capitalism"", as opposed to industrial capitalism, which is what we had with Standard Oil or General Motors. For such an argument, you get a bit of costs, benefits, markets, capital investments, margins, and the like. But information economics has always been a bit strange. You do not use up informational assets, for example, the idea of reputation or brand - the while idea of intangible assets. Markets for informational products can be completely conquered and industry dominance is possible. Hitting the ""copy"" botton is easy as opposed to markets for durable goods such as autos or washing machines. There are also multiple users for the same product - this is the idea of multiple platforms. For example, I am interested in the information on my fitbit for its health implications whereas someone else might want my data and background for my likelihood of purchasing some other digital products. Zuboff provides an overall argument for how digital markets grow very big and lucrative on the basis of lots of small individual transactions that most users pay very little for. Google and Facebook, as well as others, collect your direct data as well as some metadata and lump it in with other massive data sets to provide the source for their lucrative business in various computer futures' markets. There is a profit logic here and an explanation for the huge growth of the FAANG firms. This logic does not exclude the possibility that these firms also provide valuable services to their users and offer real benefits. For example, if Google or Amazon server as a broad structure within which many small businesses and individual users may operate, then it is reasonable that they act to keep their structures safe, which may entail taking action against individuals or businesses that do not follow rules, such as regarding protection against malware and viruses. The ""greater good"" logic is not without merit in such cases.But wait, there is more. This is also a political economy, which means that the underlying values and normative directions of the parties are involved, as well as issues of ownership and property rights. Yes, they can and do sell your data and there is very little your can do about it by yourself. It is not quite like totalitarianism, but maybe it is. If not, why spend so much time explaining what totalitarianism is? I would add that when an author goes to the trouble to show how pointless it is to read all of the conditions offered in various terms of service by these firms and the huge difficulties of resisting, the reader is quite justified in responding - Well if I do not have a choice about it, then do I really have a problem? A bunch of very smart people are in the same situation as I am and cannot do anything about it, so what is the real issue?What's the problem? Privacy, of course. ...and the logic of accumulation (profit) means that the key firms will be doing more and more with your data and moving into areas where you will be ""nudged"" into thinking certain ways and not others and even pushed into acting as a herd with others. This is all for your own good, of course, and we should get beyond freedom and dignity. B.B. Skinner has come back from the grave. What people will lose in this is the chance to control their own futures, forge their own identities, and manage their own data. Those who object to being manipulated by ""big other"" need to get off the grid - oh, but you cannot get off the grid.I am starting to get worried again. Zuboff is a longtime professor and scholar on the future of ""smart machines"" at the Harvard Business School. This is the central temple of capitalism. Are we really all under the thumb of Google, Amazon, and Facebook? Perhaps not.Zuboff is clearly writing in the tradition of the great progressive muckrakers. In particular, the book reads as if she is auditioning to be the new Ida Tarbell, who took on the Standard Oil monopoly and was instrumental in breaking it up. The muckrakers had lots to say about how evil and powerful the industrial trusts were, how bad they were for society, and how impervious they were to individual resistance. And yet -- Standard Oil was broken up even though the world had failed to go to the devil on its account as anticipated. Besides, it was only after Standard Oil was broken up that John D. Rockefeller got really rich. Maybe we are not yet all doomed.If one reads enough dystopian fiction, it soon is clear that the dire predictions of the author reflect those aspects of the current world situation that the author finds most questionable. The world has proven notoriously resilient in the face of collusive big business, at least so far.Another way to see this is to consider the broader literature of digital and internet trade books, especially for business audiences. While they are generally informative, these book are also notorious in wildly exaggerating the likely course of invention and innovation. Far too many arguments about the promise of the digital age have proven overblown. It seems reasonable to me that negative predictions about the future of digital behemoths would also err towards overstatement rather than understatement. I would not suggest that the authors of business trade books are selling their arguments as hard as they can, but maybe they are. The extremes may need a bit of discounting.While the book is fun to read, it is written in a style that seems prone to extremes. For example, Zuboff goes to a lot of trouble to explain what totalitarianism is, but then argues that rule by FAANG is not totalitarian and that Facebook will not actually torture or execute anyone (I was relieved to know this.). But which is it? If the dominance of Google and Facebook is so threatening, then it is like totalitarianism. If not, why go through the analysis? If the digital firms want all of our data and can largely just take it, and we can do nothing about it, then what part of this is not totalitarian?This whole line of thought about whether the digital world of surveillance capitalism is our friend or not is hardly new. Of course there is The Matrix, but this are more philosophical problems at root (look up the ""brains in a vat"" argument behind the Matrix story), since there are not the capitalist villains to focus on like the leaders of Google, Alphabet, and Facebook. That tension even made it to popular music. Look up a recording of the song ""Chiron Beta Prime"" from 2009.At a basic level, it seems that Zuboff is more concerned that life in the Google or Facebook domains will lead to intellectually and emotionally impoverished lives for those who are connected all the time. This is akin to the arguments for the coddling of the newest college generation (gen z) which has grown up on Facebook and Google. This is a reasonable concern on its own terms, although way too much apocalypse is invoked in the book. But even here, there are earlier versions of the argument. One in particular is how capitalism itself triumphed versus the socialist world because it was successful at supplying rampant consumerism. The is Herbert Marcuse's argument from ""One Dimensional Man"" (1964), although I do not need networked computing for this.Overall, it is a thoughtful and thought provoking book, albeit a bit too long. Zuboff develops her own nomenclature for surveillance capitalism and related arguments and drums it into the reader through repetition. I am not sure I needed the repetition, however. It is a much better book than many of the HBS trade volumes, but that is unfortunately a low bar. I am glad I read the book."

I kept finding myself being interested, then having to spend the next few passages mentally screaming I get it, I GET IT MOVE ON."
53,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65200111-chris-young,5,"This is the first time that I can remember reading a book that made me feel both smarter and dumber upon finishing it, so there's that......So ""Surveillance Capitalism"" is definitely the most encompassing book I've read to date (ok, so maybe it was a bit long-winded) on the state of the digital industry and the potential long term implications that the likes of Google and Facebook may have on modern society. Yes, Google Glass seemed like a cool concept at the time, and sure, the Chromebook was so cheap that it proved irresistible for millions, and god only knows how many Android aficionados are out there.....but the reality is, these are all incurrences for ""behavioral surplus"" for the tech giants, whose power through data collection grows unchecked by the day. We all love free or subsidized tech stuff, but I don't disagree that the joke is on us as a society, because while this new subsidized data collection paradigm gives consumers like you and me plenty, as Zuboff drives home in spades in this book, oh does it take back so much more....I suppose the downright scary part to it all is that it all goes on unchecked (save for Europe's half hearted attempt to invoke privacy laws two years ago.) That's only going to continue until our current legal system figures out a way to become properly equipped to deal with this new phenomenon. History does provide hope through precedence however, as the industrial revolution 125 years ago brought about a complete upheaval of our legal system through both land and labor law. Perhaps the new age of surveillance capitalism will bring about ""digital privacy law."" The question is, who brings about this change in the near term? I may not buy whole-heartedly the doom and gloom instrumentarian society or ""hive-existence"" outcomes that the author is selling, but I don't disagree (not unlike the doomed proverbial frog in a pot whose temperature is rising by a degree a minute), that unless we do something soon current societal ""givens"" like privacy and sanctuary will become things of the past as the data giants grow unchecked in financial and political power. I also don't believe that ""individualism"" or ""free-will"" is a fleeting 18th Century phenomenon whose time has come and gone. When a society gets a taste of freedom/free-will, it will tend to fight like hell to keep it, rather than let it float away in exchange for the security of a ""Big Other."" That's just my hunch, and time will have to prove me right or wrong on that. Again, what I can't answer is what brings about this initiative to react and push back??One more issue I do have with Zuboff is her assertion that Facebook will be a long term player in the continuation of SC. User trends change at lightening speed these days. The generation Z kids that Zuboff claims have become hooked on their FB connectivity includes my own kids. My 15 year old son doesn't use facebook. He has no interest. Thinks its ""creepy and for old folks."" Nor do any of his friends use it. Clearly something is happening at the user level with the youth of today that's creating significant churn at FB that could possibly threaten FB's future dominance on social media. So who the true long term players are on this scene is still subject to scrutiny, but this is akin to focusing on the furniture on the Titanic... This is a highly thought provoking draconian wake up call to the modern world about what could possibly happen if current trends are not thwarted. While it doesn't provide possible solutions to the subject matter at hand, it will leave your wheels spinning long after you close out the final chapter of this book..."

Surveillance capitalism is the name Zuboff has given to a disturbing new threat, a novel, rapacious strain of capitalism that uses its ownership of the means of digital production to acquire behavioural data in increasingly invasive ways from its users to predict and, increasingly, to modify their behaviour. Zuboff has done important work in naming this threat and describing its genealogy.I have a few issues with this book. Firstly, I was not a fan of the writing style. It’s basically endless chiasmus, repetition, lists of threes, and hyperbole. It’s an irritating habit in a book of this length, and makes it difficult to appreciate the more profound passages (of which there are several).The latter - hyperbole - is also an issue of substance. While the more radical ambitions of the priests of surveillance capitalism are terrifying (and some of these ideas are already going in to prototype), the actual lived experience of surveillance capitalism for most people is markedly different. I watch a YouTube video on yoga; the next day, I get several ads for yoga mats next to a news article I am reading. Is this an existential threat to the very essence of human freedom, as Zuboff claims in her typically impassioned way? I’m not so sure. Of course, this may just be the beginning; I am sure I’m not even conscious of all the ways my data is being used to influence my actions. But the risk here is that Zuboff misses the tension that exists between what capitalism promises and what it delivers; the prospect of intelligent algorithims manifest as slightly more refined marketing tools (and the effectiveness of which, compared to traditional marketing, have been questioned elsewhere). The possibility that this gap is something systemic in capitalism drops out of Zuboff’s analysis. What does it mean that the titans of capitalism’s newest mutation are effectively advertising companies? Advertising companies were traditionally considered drains on the productive economy; advertising costs are ultimately still costs for businesses that take away from their bottom lines. The massive hoards of cash on the books of Google, Facebook and co., derived mainly from advertising revenue, come from firms which necessarily sell goods or services. What does this mean for profitability? What does this mean for investment and innovation? Is this really a system in rude health? (Tooze, Picketty, and Milankovic have all had recent takes on this question, and it’s a shame Zuboff doesn’t really address it.) But when governments are desperate to spark investment, including through record low interest rates, what does it mean when firms are spending fortunes on advertising, creating piles of cash which accumulate in offshore bank accounts? Zuboff misses this level of analysis, because in her approach the threat has already been identified and so must be made to look powerful.If anything, it’s the prospect of collusion between surveillance capitalism and the state that still worries me the most for now - though I’m not sure if the ‘behavioural surplus’ framework is best suited to describe this kind of threat. This isn’t to say that I don’t think surveillance capitalism is a concern. Zuboff is convincing enough in that respect. But as long as I can say no to that yoga mat, I’m not sure if I should fear it more than I do capitalism and massive hoards of wealth more generally. For now, at least..."

We know about the rise in power of Big Data, we know we're being surveilled through our devices and appliances, we know companies are using behavior modification to better serve us for their own profit. But this is a detailed look at the history and sociology of surveillance capitalism and how some companies are using it.Zuboff has a pessimistic take on these ideas, for sure, and the book goes heavy on Facebook and Google. I did feel at times that I would have liked a lot more statistics and real life examples. A little more story certainly would have broken up Zuboff's prose, which is incredibly dense in its philosophizing and sometimes hard to digest (I usually don't have a problem with dense writing, but I had to slog through sentences that I felt could have been written more simply). So I'm a little torn on this, because it's an important book people should read, but the writing and lack of examples and length (could have been shorter, or the same length but with more story and stats weaved in?) make it a challenging read. Maybe it's just a case of me having really high expectations and the book falling short, which still makes it good, just something I'll be recommending to fewer people."
56,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99939608-stephen-adams,5,"“If you are not paying for the product then you are the product.” Though this quote has been used since the 1980s in relation to television [1], it has seen a resurgence due to the popularity of social media. I have always found this idea to be troublesome because if my online behaviour was “the product” of social media it would have some value on its own. Shoshana Zuboff’s excellent “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism” closes this gap between our personal experiences online and the industry that is tracking as much of our lives as possible.  The book is broken into three parts. Part one focuses on the early history of Google and its discovery of the concept of “behavioural surplus.” Behavioral surplus is the digital “breadcrumbs” or “exhaust,” as the author puts it, that we leave behind on every website we visit. These breadcrumbs are the unrefined resource that surveillance capitalist products are constructed from. The second section of the book charts surveillance capitalism’s move from being an entirely online phenomenon into the “real” world. With the development of the internet of things, the success of Pokemon Go, and Facebook’s experiments affecting their user’s emotions and behaviours more of our daily lives have become commodities to be sold in “behavioural futures markets.”The final section is where Zuboff becomes more speculative about the future of surveillance capitalism. She describes a system of power known as “instrumentarianism” where the entirety of our lives is tracked and predicted, and power is centralised around controlling the means of behaviour modification. This section heavily references Hannah Arendt’s “The Origins of Totalitarianism” as a reference to how political movements get started and flourish despite their grim final state. Instrumentarianism is an existential threat to our lives as individuals. Under instrumentarian power our individual choices are pushed in the most predictable and profitable direction consuming our sense of self in the process.I think this is an excellent book. The first two extensively researched parts track the evolution of surveillance capitalism so far via public statements of the executives and engineers mostly from Google and Facebook, as well as employee interviews Zuboff conducted herself. Zuboff draws a clear thread from Google’s discovery of behavioural surplus in the early 2000s to today with more and more consumer products being always online. These two sections shed light on the underlying imperatives that drive surveillance capitalist decision making (e.g. why do they buy the companies they do?, why do they launch the products they do?).Instrumentarianism as a theoretical end state of surveillance capitalism is a terrifying warning. The powers that surveillance capitalists now wield are so new and unexpected that we must begin to ask where will all this lead? As the author points out surveillance capitalism is the first time in human history that a single power has held both knowledge of our lives along with the freedom of the market rather than in the hands of a government that is accountable to the people. Though not a certainty, Zuboff’s theory of instrumentarianism is feasible enough that everyone should hear her warning and make up their own minds.1. https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/07..."

It reminded me of Thomas Piketty’s magnum opus, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, in that it opens one’s eyes to the things we ought to have noticed, but hadn’t. If we fail to take the new capitalist rampaging through our societies, then we will only have ourselves to blame, for we can no longer plead ignorance. The combination of state surveillance and its capitalist counterpart means that digital technology is separating the citizens in all societies into two groups: the watchers (invisible, unknown, unaccountable) and the watched. This has profound consequences for democracy because asymmetry of knowledge translates to asymmetry of power. We currently have almost no regulatory oversight of this technological phenomenon. This is intolerable. Thank you Shoshana Zuboff. I am a changed man because of your book."
58,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1910680-steve,4,"""The Age of Surveillance Capitalism"" is a detailed explanation of the threat to freedom and our humanity present in big tech, the giants Google and Facebook, and their aspirations to know not only your preferences; to predict future actions and decisions and to construct a comprehensive view of the person and society. The idol and the end-game is comprehensive knowledge.Zuboff believes this is the new totalitarian threat, not only big government, but big tech, or even both working together to manage society. She explains how the ""social credit"" scheme in China uses universal monitoring to apportion resources and privileges based on lifestyle habits, behaviour and compliance.he greater concern for the West is that this new type of ""capitalism"" sees personal and behavioural data as a unclaimed reserve to be exploited to generate vast revenues, but also to build comprehensive data sets with massive predictive power. The reason why social media is free to the end user, and the tech giants have acquired numerous start-ups and new tech business is because of the new data sets that provide.Conservative readers will be slightly frustrated by Ms. Zuboff's left-leaning and sometimes shrill tone, but it would be a mistake to write-off her main thesis due to bias. True conservatives will find much to sympathise with here.A century ago, G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc warned that the threats to liberty come, not only from socialism and big government, but also from big business and its alliance with government. They obviously did not foresee these technological innovations and their coercive power, but they rightly drew attention to the duel nature of the threat."

The book also contains references to the usual Google & Facebook when it comes down to the data they collect on us (more or less with our consent nowadays), as well as what the information is used for (their own as well as sold for profit). Many examples as well as references are presented. It was a useful read, especially for people unaware of these things, but as a fan of Snowden and Assange, surveillance wasn't a topic strange to me and as a result the lack of extremely novel information didn't make this feel like a particularly stimulating read. #B"

The argument is blind to how Big Tech's surveillance is merely the most recent and sophisticated manifestation of capitalism's inherent drive to extract value; advertising and media companies have for centuries made a business of surveillance and control. But acknowledging that continuity would deflate the book's sensationalism, and undermine its premise that, before Big Tech, the only threat to liberalism was state power, and not also that of capital."
69,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89255731-mark-walker,5,"This book will boil your blood. Supported by extensive empirical research, Professor Shoshana Zuboff exposes the effective digital implementation of the late B. F. Skinner's Beyond Freedom and Dignity. It centers around three related factors: The distribution of knowledge: “Who knows?” Authority: “Who decides who knows?” and Power: “Who decides who decides who knows?” (Hint: it's not you). Orders of magnitude beyond just tracking cookies and the creepy anticipation of your interests by entities such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook, the new instrumentarianism is used by surveillance capitalists to control not just what you buy but also what you think about and how you think it. This is not even the theoretical Capitalism of Friedman, Hayek, or Adam Smith, as there is no equality of individual choice in it. In other words there's no free market here, as surveillance capitalists deliberately orchestrate your life for their benefit irrespective of yours. Thus it's not a fair trade; there is no reciprocity in the conveniences you think you receive from even the simplest transactions. You are not their customers (or even the ""product"" as in the cliché); their customers are the people purchasing the information harvested about you, which is extracted without your awareness. In this digital realm, it is as if you are the third world country having your natural resources extracted for the exclusive profits of foreign capitalists. Another clear analogy is we are like chickens being farmed for our eggs: they feed us with incentives, not for our well-being but so that we will lay more eggs to go into omelets not for us. You and your personal information are only the objects, the ""Other,"" that are for sale for the benefit of people who are not you. The key feature of all of this is that willingness is irrelevant, as we are unknowing and thus unwitting participants. Their salient objective is the obscene profits garnered from not just your profiles and posts, but the shadow text that you don't see from the fusion of the backscatter data about you that is harvested into separate secret databases. They actively hide that they have this information on you, as their modus operandi requires that you not be aware of it for this process to be successful. Much of this activity is beyond the reach of laws and courts, as the surveillance capitalists would just go underground with their operations if regulations were imposed. It is accompanied by an acceleration of the deliberate assault on democracy through lobbying and revolving door employment between government and the commercial interests that control it. Thus just voting for politicians that promise to tame surveillance capitalism will be of insufficient effect. Zuboff offers hope and some thoughts on what to do about it. European history has shown that when the people have had enough of oppression, they join together to rebel, as when the Berlin Wall came down without resistance from the guards. A similar event must occur today to escape the glass walls of the hive surveillance capitalists have put us in for the purpose of harvesting and orchestrating even our most personal thoughts, all for their profit and not ours. We need walls of our own, not to keep us in their hive, but to keep them out of our personal sanctuary. Public opinion is key to taming this monster. In the end if enough of the public rose up against surveillance capitalism, possibly by throwing its shadow text in disarray and diminishing its value, the money and influence behind it would then be of little effect. There is hope if humans would willingly help each other to the extent that surveillance capitalists take without asking. Then the world would be a much friendlier and more prosperous place for everyone. and not just the few."
70,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6192529-frieda-vizel,3,"The writing was a big problem for me. Sometimes, instead of relying on strong arguments, it relied on absurdly hyperbolic language. For instance, I didn’t feel like she explained clearly enough why monetizing our data is bad - say, because how it’s been destroying “the forth estate” that needs to constantly run after the clicks, or how our data is used to manipulate us to consume-consume-consume, to the detriment of the planet. Instead she went on for a while about our right to the “will to will” and a lot about how bad BF Skinner was. Maybe if I understood behaviorism better I’d have felt it as strongly as she seemed to, but I just didn’t feel like I totally got that whole part. Maybe that’s me.Speaking of Skinner, she seems to be of the school of public intellectualism that is very focused on individual actors instead of on the system. So she goes on a lot about the bad guys of our predicament, Skinner but also of course Zuck, the Google founders, the guy at Microsoft who didn’t seem to be extraordinarily villainous at all. Here’s where this type of focus in the individual derails us: it leads Zuboff to think that these people created the problems, and not the system. But actually, so long as the law allows for folks to make money by manipulating the masses, there will always be a sociopath to sink his teeth in. That’s why the problem is the system and that needs to be fixed. And Zuboff does argue for that - it’s just that she weakens her argument by being so focused on these insatiable idiot vampires. But all that is quibbling and frustration. The important take-away from the book is that it stakes the solution within the law. It does not fall for the “freedom of speech” idiocy, an argument mounted by economic interest as a way to stop the entire legal system from functioning as it should. Since when can’t we have laws? Since when is it tyranny for the government to create limits and parameters as a way of ensuring a healthy society? Since the tech companies have been telling us that we only deserve positive freedoms. Freedom to advertise, sure. Freedom from being manipulated by ads- it’s an Orwellian Communist murderous regime and soon we will be like North Korea!Zuboff talks about the slow speed of democracy. That’s what left me so despaired. Democracy is not getting faster, but the technological invasions are. And I don’t see how we’ll ever be able to catch up with them. Meanwhile, a screech on a decibel undetectable to the human ear is now screaming into your subconscious and telling you to buy another Alexa and a smart underwear plus to to vote for Kim Jung Il. True story."

The future of this narrative will depend upon the indignant citizens, journalists, and scholars drawn to this frontier project; indignant elected officials and policy makers who understand that their authority originates in the foundational values of democratic communities; and, especially, indignant young people who act in the knowledge that effectiveness without autonomy is not effective, dependency-induced compliance is no social contract, a hive with no exit can never be home, experience without sanctuary is but a shadow, a life that requires hiding is no life, touch without feel reveals no truth, and freedom from uncertainty is no freedom.This book is an incendiary work of immense scholarly and literary significance.With admiral restraint, Zuboff painstakingly dismantles, analyses, and lays bear the machinations of one of the greatest challenges that faces humanity in this century. We have be come not the product, as is so often said, but the raw material of an entirely novel industry. This industry's speed of ascent and adaptation and especially of innovation has left individuals and governments alike, completely unable to meaningfully understand, let alone reign-in, the advance of this all-pervading entity that increases its penetration into our lives and our communities with every passing minute.This book articulates the uncomfortable gut-feeling, the uneasy sense of cognitive dissonance, that I've felt about the level of access companies generally, but especially Alphabet and Facebook, have to my life and every piece of information living that life generates. I understand now why my no-choice participation in this new economy has generated these feelings, in all their expanded and terrifying entirety.While at times bombastic, and others poetic, and others still cool and clinical; the amount of research, time, and passion for humanity itself that went into the construction of this work has paid off. This work is a significant achievement, and an important moment that we can look back on to see whether we as a species can rise to overcome this new challenge, or whether this will be little but foreshadowing of the future we allow to follow.If you're alive right now, you owe it to yourself to read this."

The use and abuse of data and user trust is worth talking about, it's even worth shouting about.But not like this.Zuboff is alarmist, melodramatic, hyperbolic and tiring. Everything the tech companies do is not just wrong, it's a diabolic scheme to undermine the world as we know it. When something is wrong, it's never an unintended consequence, it's never human error, it's never just a silly gimmick not thought out far enough. It's always, always presented as a evil contrived mastermind plot to wreck your privacy and abuse you. And it's always presented like it's the rise of fascism in the 1930's with the most gut-wrenching tear-jerking vocabulary she could find. Get a few examples, simplify a theory somehow related to the issue, contrive a concept, give it a name like ""shadow text"" or ""behavioral surplus"" (preferably a bit ominous name), cherry pick more examples, portend doom. Rinse and repeat. And mention ""surveillance capitalism"" at least 15 times per page.It's kind of ironic that when she goes on for 700+ pages on how you should never trust these companies, that she takes their Silicon Valley hypetalk at face value. If a company claims they can do something, Zuboff gleefully integrates the claim into her narrative with zero criticism. Because it serves her point. But if a company apologises for something, it's of course disingenuous with them being the devil who wants to eat your children.By the time the book gets to behaviour manipulation, it turns from melodramatic to laughable. The obsession Zuboff has for B.F.Skinner and radical behaviorism (a 70-year-old psychology concept, the cognitive revolution would like to have a word...) is full on religious. The man wasn't wrong about anything and conditioning works on people with a hundred per cent efficiency!This is an important issue, but creating hyperbolic devils like this is not just bad writing and argumentation but counter-productive to the cause. It's just creates a shoddy boogeyman argument that is easy to shoot down.The very serious and dramatic reader Audible had for this didn't help btw. (she was very clear speaker though). "

Everyone knows that the technology we are living with is unprecedented and changing the world. If we aren't careful, we will cause more harm than good. This book is about the dangers of this new information age. But there are a lot of problems with how the information is presented. First, the author uses over-the-top insulting language to describe these companies and leaders--all book long. It's so obviously biased that it undermines her points again and again, prompting lots of eyerolling--about once a page. That's minor, though. More serious is that this book is way too long. It wasn't satisfied making the point, it had to list 10 examples for every point--the full quotes, too. It read more like a college term paper that needed show every piece of research the author did. It's a very long book and it didn't need to be. Finally, the author falls prey to the worst sin in this kind of cultural criticism: she treats her worldview and personality type as the perfect ideal. There was no honest acknowledgement that her era had any flaws, only lament that the world doesn't live more like she used to, that generations will not experience what she did as a child. I very much believe that there are real dangers with only a few companies controlling the information access to the world. I've personally experienced challenges with this (Amazon just recently removed me as a listed seller of my own books, saying I need to sign up for the next level of account--at more cost--before I have the chance to be displayed as the owner of the product again). But it's a mixed bag and the author can't see past her indignation to the true complexity of the situation.So, read this for an imbalanced, overly wordy way of getting one side of the story. If it's not this book, make sure you get both sides of the story, not just the story told by Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, etc."

Today the same practices meet little resistance or even discussion as they are routinely and pervasively deployed on the march towards surveillance revenues.”Welcome to a new and daunting landscape awash with sinister terminology like “permissionless innovation”, “digital totalitarianism”, “reality mining” and “behavioural surplus”. This is the new apparatus that dictates how we move through much of our lives, and just like most architecture out there, after a while, you almost become oblivious to the secret workings and dimensions which are influencing your behaviour and actions. And this is how the boys and girls down in Silicon Valley like it best.“The image of technology as autonomous force with unavoidable actions and consequences has been employed across the centuries to erase the fingerprints of power and absolve it of responsibility. The monster did it, not Victor Frankenstein.”Zuboff touches on many aspects surrounding surveillance capitalism, and we see the intimate relationship between the NSA and CIA and the mutual benefits to that relationship. “The agencies craved the lawlessness that a firm such as Google enjoyed.” We learn the huge significance of Section 230 and how far behind the US is behind the EU in terms of clamping down, one example being the EU law in May 2014 enforcing the right to be forgotten. She cites many sources, but without doubt the two most prominent reference points are the work of B.F. Skinner and Hannah Arendt and in particular her “The Origins of Totalitarianism”. “Google is to surveillance capitalism what the Ford Motor Company and General Motors were to mass-production-based managerial capitalism.”At one point the author sets out the four main areas of fortifications that have allowed Google to be so over protected and free to flourish away from political interference for so long, particularly in the USA,1.	Google showing their capabilities of competitive advantage in electoral politics. 2.	The deliberate blurring of public and private interests through relationships and aggressive lobbying. 3.	A revolving door of personnel who migrated between Google and the Obama administration, who shared mutual interests during Google’s crucial growth years of 2009-2016. By April 2016, 197 individuals had migrated from government to the Googlesphere and 61 had moved in the other direction. 4.	Google’s campaign of influence over academic work and the larger cultural conversation, which was vital to policy formation, public opinion and political perception. “Ford’s inventions revolutionised production. Google’s inventions revolutionised extraction and established surveillance capitalism’s first economic imperative: the extraction imperative.”This book is awash with horror stories befitting of sci-fi paperbacks. Like the one concerning Genesis Toys, who brought out, My Friend Cayla, a terrifying concept in which the child’s doll which relies on voice recognition, also harvests all sorts of data from the customer’s house. It is such a blatant violation that in 2017 Germany, (a country which knows a thing or two about surveillance), banned it as an illegal surveillance device, urging parents to destroy any such dolls in their possession.Due to the nature of this book it does have its harder going moments, but it still remains engaging, and overall Zuboff has completed a chilling, sagacious and damning book on the sinister and sophisticated ploys increasingly used in surveillance capitalism. The text is relatively, devoid of any superfluous academic verbiage, which many of these kinds of books suffer from. These companies and the people tied up with them are the people who hate big, bad words like privacy, tax and transparency. You can employ all the lawyers, lobbyists and accountants and actuaries, but when you strip it all away, what it really is a small, group of dangerous people making the rules up as they go along who have been given a suspiciously free and easy reign over how policy works around the world.Facebook has already admitted to and was even boasting about its power to influence people’s behaviour in US elections, and this was years before the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke. The billionaire owner of that company, Robert Mercer, backed Donald Trump. As Facebook is a private company it did not have to adhere to the legal standards for experimentation required of academic and government researchers. It remains to be seen what Facebook and Google cannot get away with. Providing a vast platform for hate speech, fostering chronic bullying, screening live suicides, streaming acts of terrorism. Where will the line be drawn?...Like bold, bratty toddlers they constantly challenge their boundaries and throw tantrums when anyone dare speaks out, but they needn’t worry a succession of US governments has them well protected as long as that money keeps on coming.Every law, rule or regulation is only as strong as the loopholes allow it to be. If these loopholes are known and continue to exist then we must ask why that is?... Who has the power to close them and more importantly why have they chosen not to close them?...These companies have consistently and effectively been left to self-regulate with predictable consequences. The problems have been known about the Wild West mentality of the internet for many, many years now, but yet little meaningful change has occurred, especially in the US.“Facebook’s $4.6 million in donations during the 2016 election cycle complemented its lobbying budget of $11.5 million in 2017.” But this is nothing compared to Google, which repeatedly spends more on lobbying than any other corporation, shelling out more than $18 million in 2018. It is also the second wealthiest registered lobbyist in the EU. Why are Facebook and Google choosing to spend such astronomical amounts of money?...What must they be getting in return?...What do they want?...What do they get?...Why are we not being told?...Welcome to “American Democracy”. Be afraid, be very afraid…"
75,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50996552-jp-beaty,4,"A really important text for digging out the political import of the data economy. I think the writing is slightly clumsy and I think the book underestimates the connection between Silicon Valley firms and the intelligence services/ the state. I also find the substantive responses to the issue to be a little milquetoast in comparison to the problem she diagnoses (I suppose that’s how it ended up on Obama’s books of the year list). Those problems aside at its best it is a searing look at the logic and function of the data economy. For understanding the ways that big data firms are altering society and how to think about the use and abuse of technology, this is a great book. It’s really at its best at the most conspiratorial and will leave you suspicious of what exactly your phone is doing and what Facebook ultimately wants. I’m sure posting this review will trigger a whole cascade of advertising material to make sure the big social media giants don’t loose my constant stream of crumbs I feed them. Don’t worry amazon algorithm reading this, I am much too trapped in the Skinner box to act on the suspicions raised by this book."

It is not a coup d’etat in the classic sense but rather a coup de gens: an overthrow of the people concealed as the technological Trojan horse that is Big Other”.This book is a huge, impressive piece of work. It feels like a relief to (at least) get some sort of overview over the way in which surveillance capitalism dominates our lives and orders society, despite the lack of suggestions for solutions. Understanding is the first step towards any form of meaningful resistance, and this feels like a solid first step :-)I do wish it were more accessible (as I do with most political theory) as its message feels like something that needs to be heard by more people than those who are willing to read 500 pages worth of academic language.Also - Zuboff’s idealization of the Henry Ford-era of capitalism rubs me the wrong way."
77,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24266382-ashley,3,"It’s been called “visionary,” but I don’t know that there’s anything entirely new here. What this felt like, to me, was a call to attention. The reader is not surprised by anything Shoshana Zuboff outlines, but is rather forced to acknowledge the problem in its entirety, all at once, in a 500-page package. That does make it feel revolutionary; Zuboff has written what very few people are willing to discuss in mainstream media, but which everyone has an inkling of, one way or another. I did find that it was a little too long-winded. It could have been significantly compressed, especially when a lot of the material was repetitive in order to emphasize certain themes and vocabulary.... and her preoccupation with B.F. Skinner was unnecessary. Zuboff was never so brilliant than when she illustrated, specifically, how Facebook and Google and Samsung (among others) are driving our behavior for their own profit, frequently at the expense of the law. I think that this strength was often drowned in vocabulary lessons and meandering observations, coming across as a little self-indulgent somewhere around the 200-page mark. It was unnecessary to spend so much time explaining Zuboff’s coined terms, such as “the uncontract”, “unprecedented”, “radical indifference”, “behavioural surplus”, and even “surveillance capitalism” itself. Especially in Part III, Zuboff’s self-indulgence became a running tangent, entire sections devoted to philosophy (and biology) lessons on the concept of “free will” and “utopia.”  In spite of that, it has definitely changed the way I think. It has also further fueled my nostalgia for a simpler time, and my distrust of social media and big corporations. The fact that it’s near-impossible to escape the clutches of these corporations is what really keeps me up at night; it’s not so much a privacy issue (I couldn’t care less if Mark Zuckerberg gets access to my old Instagram photos of cappuccinos) but rather a question of ethics. If I don’t want to give my data to third-parties, why are they able to access it anyway? If I don’t want to contribute to the rise of Facebook or Google, why are they still able to profit off of me anyway? Consent doesn’t really enter the conversation when it comes to what these rich tech companies have in mind, and evasive, incomplete privacy policies are nothing but “placebo effects” to pacify users.  Yes, I’m aware of the irony of publishing this review to Amazon-owned Goodreads.  ""Surveillance Capitalism"" is the kind of book that makes you want to throw your laptop into Lake Ontario and live in a cabin in the woods. I don’t know that I have the gumption for that kind of drastic change, but I’ll definitely think twice whenever I consider downloading an app or signing up for e-newsletters; I will certainly avoid buying any new smart devices by whatever means necessary. I do think it’s time for us to start protesting the free-reign that these conglomerates have been given, especially in North America. Our own behavior is being observed and herded by the rich 1% for financial gain; everything from our spending habits to our complacency is being mediated and controlled. I think, eventually, we have to reclaim our sense of autonomy and identity, and our understanding of reality.  Also, I just want to state for the record that I’ve always found it odd how North America experienced a period of mass rebellion, political protesting, and unrest during the 1960’s and 1970’s – and that this unrest suddenly came to a complete stop, save for a few exceptions here and there. Well, Zuboff has justified my unease, dedicating a sub-chapter to the behavior-control research conducted by the US Senate in the 70’s – research which became urgent as political protests escalated. And yes, surveillance capitalism has everything to do with it.  At the end of this heavy volume, Zuboff was really only trying to say one thing, re-stated from multiple angles: we are being rigorously and continuously exploited by capitalists. We don’t own our behavior anymore. Data collection and behavior control for the purpose of financial profit has crossed all ethical boundaries, and we as a society are content to let it happen.  This book is definitely recommended, if you have the patience and endurance to get through it. I almost didn’t. In a similar vein, I also recommend watching ‘Smithereens’, one of the recent Black Mirror episodes. Despite its melodrama, I think it has a lot of important things to say on society’s need to be “plugged in” and how this addiction is driving our lives. Some of Zuboff’s quotes that will stick with me: -“Its products are about predicting us, without actually caring what we do or what is done to us.” -“As populations grow numb, it becomes more difficult for individuals and groups to complain.” -“[Cortana] wants to know everything about you, but it does not want you to know how much it knows [...]” -“ ‘The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.’ ” [-Mark Weiser] -“Contemporary reviewers of Kahn’s book invariably seized upon the dark ‘nightmare scenarios’ of the computerized surveillance theme, the science-fiction–like forms of control that, they assumed, ‘will be actively feared and resented by many.’ Despite the wide range of scenarios that Kahn presented in his book on the distant year 2000, Kahn’s voyage into the ‘unthinkable’ was viewed by the public as a way to prepare for ‘the worst possible outcome’ in a terrifying ‘nightmare of social controls.’ Yet now, that same nightmare is rendered as an enthusiastic progress report on surveillance capitalism’s latest triumphs.” -“[…] Google wants us to accept that its rules simply reflect the requirements of autonomous processes, something that people cannot control. However, our grasp of the inner logic of surveillance capitalism suggests otherwise. Men and women made it, and they can control it. They merely choose not to do so.” -“Many people feel that if you are not on Facebook, you do not exist. People all over the world raced to participate in Pokémon Go. With so much energy, success, and capital flowing into the surveillance capitalist domain, standing outside of it, let alone against it, can feel like a lonely and risky prospect.”"

79,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85785571-laurence-lai,1,"The title “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism” evokes a weighty subject, and the book’s subtitle purports to something menacing to the future of humankind. It is to be seen if its contents are as substantial as the book’s 700-page length would suggest.The author, Shoshana Zuboff, is a professor emerita at Harvard Business School, not unimpressive an honor by any measure. A summary of assertions made in the book is as follows:1.	Big technological colossuses (Big Techs), epitomized by Google and Facebook, operate their business models by extracting data trails of online users, and in turn selling the extrapolated results (what Zuboff calls behavioral surplus) to their advertising customers.2.	Sophisticated algorithms are deployed and constantly refined to increase the predictive value of profiling data. At the same time, online users are passively served with moderated searches, federated news feeds, suggested connections, etc., all under the coercive power of the Big Techs. Such duress is as severe as not only to affect, shape, and compel, but with the aim to modify and manipulate user behaviors.3.	With the proliferation of sensors and Internet connectivity, Big Techs extend their reach far beyond the virtual realm to the real world. Regarding the surveillance operated by these techno-capitalists, in the author’s telling, its presence so pervasive and its impact so complete that any human free agency has receded entirely to the background and is ineffective.4.	While the above are not new to anyone who has casual understanding of current economics and culture, what Zuboff strives to accentuate is their connection to high-order issues such as self, liberty, democratic values, and human nature. She compares the dangers posed by “surveillance capitalism” to that of fascism, totalitarianism, behaviorist utopianism, and the like, that once presented real or potential detriments to humanity. For its thrilling effects, the agenda for the book is sweeping, even ambitious. Technological advancement, especially one that combines deep analytics, machine intelligence, and makes its ubiquitous presence in our intimate lives deserves a dispassionate evaluation as to its social impacts. Zuboff should be applauded for selecting this timely topic for her book.Yet one cannot help but feel frustrated by the lack of thematic organization of the whole book. Instead of explicating the economics involved in this different “capitalism”, Zuboff is more concerned with weaving her own narrative of abstruse euphemisms about how grave a danger the human future is facing. Materials are regurgitated, often word for word from the earlier part of the book and throughout. As to what actions Zuboff suggests to “fight for a human future…”? The author offers an ill-defined “synthetic declaration” (p. 345), and a skimpy, equally obscure advice of “friction, courage, and bearings” (p. 524). Specifics are sorely lacking in allusions to democratic institutions, public opinion, legislative and judicial recourse (p. 520). A whimper of a solution indeed to a loud bang of such a doorstopper.Zuboff obviously sets out to intend the book as a treatise that plumbs the depth of these to her as “unprecedented” developments in “surveillance capitalism”, and attempts to compare philosophically with past phenomena its manifold menaces to humanity. But it is exactly in such philosophizing that is the weakest of the book, for her arguments are at best tenuous and strained. On the other hand, the author wily limits her subject to mostly the socio-economic domain of the Western world, as is indicated in the book’s title. The picture would have been more complete if it had combined with surveillance authoritarianism. The “social credit” system practised unimpeded in China makes only passing reference in mere 6 pages (pgs. 388-394). Certainly, the threat to human liberty and dignity is far graver when the surveillance apparatus and capability are controlled by a police state, whereas in Western democracies competition among capitalists still exists. What is most infuriating is Zuboff’s penchant for fabricating catchphrases. Smug expressions such as “dispossession”, “behavioral futures”, “cultural misappropriation”, “economy of action”, “division of learning”, “shadow text”, “uncontract”, “hive”, “coup from above”, “Big Other”, “instrumentarian power”, “right to the future tense”, “third modernity*” …., litter throughout the book. The meanings of many of these are poorly articulated. Although she attempts to provide a brief rationale to her epithetic acrobatic (p. 66), such twisting of language is unnecessary and far from successful. It is an act of throwing spaghetti upon the wall; hoping that somehow one such phrase may stick with posterity with reference made to the author. As stated, the impression appears that the writer is more interested in weaving an esoteric narrative than presenting facts. Read a typical sentence on p. 488 of the book:“No exit” is the necessary condition for Big Other to flourish, and its flourishing is the necessary condition for all that is meant to follow: the tides of behavioral surplus and their transformation into revenue, the certainty that will meet every market player with guaranteed outcomes, the bypass of trust in favor of the uncontract’s radical indifference, the paradise of effortless connection that exploits the needs of harried second-modernity individuals and transforms their lives into the means to others’ ends, the plundering of the self, the extinction of autonomous moral judgment for the sake of frictionless control, the actuation and modification that quietly drains the will to will, the forfeit of your voice in the first person in favor of others’ plans, the destruction of the social relations and politics of the old and slow and still-unfulfilled ideals of self-determining citizens bound to the legitimate authority of democratic governance.” Long sentences can be beautiful in abler literary hands, but the above is downright egregious in form and meaning. Zuboff’s writing style can be aptly depicted as beating around the bush, with hyperboles and a plethora of inapt metaphors that ill befits so serious a subject she wants to convey. At times, she relishes so much staying with her metaphoric vehicles that the intended tenors are nowhere to be found. Long, winding sentences with chained substantives also further hamper readability.So, are readers more empowered at the end “with a more cogent and comprehensive understanding” (p. 18) of the menacing incursion exerted by the Big Techs? For the newly initiated, the writing style has done more to obfuscate than to illuminate. For the more inclined and those who look for some concrete societal antidotes, Zuboff has woefully under-delivered. More clear-eyed analyses are still awaited on the technologies proffered by the Big Techs, on the associated data-driven economy, and their consequent impacts to individuals and society at-large. * cf. Alan de Vulpian, 2003 (English , 2008)"

83,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4679583-myles,3,"This week my company officially got into the business of surveillance. People will pay us to surveil their home and business computers to protect them from rogue computer software, from losing data resulting from defective or aging components in their computers, and from misguided management of their computers themselves.Going forward this will be a growing and lucrative business segment because people rely on their computers to do so many important things for them, because they feel inadequate keeping up with changes in the computing environment, and because they justifiably fear cyber crime.It doesn’t mean they like it. I sure don’t.Being in retail business as I have for almost 25 years I have learned how to surveil myself, to protect my assets, and my employees. It is an ongoing challenge and it changes. I surveil for shoplifters, for currency and credit card counterfeiters, for daylight and after hours thieves. I surveil for dishonest employees, for honest mistakes, for poor buying decisions, and for the obsolescence of the products on my shelves. I surveil how the bank handles my money. I surveil my suppliers to prevent them from shipping me incomplete or broken goods. And I pay attention to my customers, to save them from making poor purchasing decisions.And when I am not surveilling, I am surveying. All the time. How were my customers’ experiences? What new products are on the horizon? How can I protect my liquidity, my profitability, and lastly, my sanity.I especially surveil myself, because I make mistakes, and because I too am growing old.These are some of the risks of operating a business.Then there are the people who surveil me. They include thieves looking for a weakness in my security. Government agencies to make sure I am paying the eight or ten different taxes I pay on an ongoing basis. Credit card companies surveil my transactions to make sure somebody hasn’t stolen my credit card, or that I am spending no more money than I can afford to pay back. My suppliers make sure I am paying them on time. Some manufacturers visit me in person or electronically to make sure I am representing their product lines fairly. They send me electronic training, and tests, and they regularly measure the efficiency and quality of our repair facilities. The utilities tell me when my operations (and home) are inefficient. And there are my landlords.Finally, we surveil at home. We surveil our daughter to make sure she is doing her homework and not falling in with the wrong crowd. My wife surveils me to make sure I’m not overeating, overspending, or being overly attentive to other women. I surveil my dog Seamus just in case he poops on the neighbour’s lawn so I can pick it up before someone notices. And Seamus surveils the front window and barks whenever a neighbouring dog saunters by. Last and not least are the gargantuan corporations who are watching what I do online. People like facebook, Google, amazon, and many, many more.So when somebody writes a book to tell me I live in an Age of Surveillance Capitalism...I GET IT! REALLY, I GET IT!But is it uniquely capitalist, or more generally an age of surveillance?And if it is more general to our society, where do we go from here?One thing for sure: it isn’t going away anytime soon.Shoshana Zuboff concentrates her guns on Google and facebook. She’s concerned that these companies are inherently different from the companies that came before it and they set a new standard for egregious capitalism. They are companies in the prediction business, predicting human behaviour and right now largely predicting purchasing behaviour by accumulating, as she called it, “surplus behaviour,” which kinda sounds like an oxymoron. She believes they abuse the freedoms of the marketplace to frustrate privacy, that they are built to enrich few and sidestep the traditional workplace which pays many employees fairly and creates consumers, and she argues that they are indifferent to social ills.She argues that Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” doesn’t operate in this marketplace because the new knowledge capitalists know everything happening in the market.A close reading of Andrew Carnegie’s life and legacy, perhaps John D. Rockefeller as well, could lead you to a similar conclusion, even though both men turned to philanthropy later in life. For sure, these men affected the course of capitalism.Is this a turn away from “good” capitalism toward an inherently evil capitalism?And if it is evil, can we create some rules for the big guys that us little guys can live with?Let’s take a step back and look at things in context: Google’s revenue is about $25 billion, Facebook’s $17 billion. The entire US economy is about $25 trillion and the world economy upwards of $107 trillion. Most of Google’s and Facebook’s revenue is advertising. The US advertising market is upwards of $80 billion so it is fair to say these two firms command quite strong positions in this industry. If you make the argument that America’s advertising industry is too concentrated then you’d have a pretty good argument to break up these firms which combined represent about 50% of all advertising dollars in the US. By comparison, Standard Oil at its peak commanded 88% of the market for processing crude. In its first year of operation, US Steel produced 67% of steel produced the the US.And they exhibit the classic behaviour of monopolists by dominating the markets for search and for social media on a global scale.In the US a case for breaking up the firms traditionally would have to be made that consumers are paying too much for their services or that competitors are being kept out of the market. Maybe breaking up these firms is a good idea, maybe it isn’t, but either way the technologies they employ for gathering, and analyzing, data isn’t going away.When I worked as an auditor, we used to gather lots of data, too, but what we eventually learned was that we could make assumptions about its meaning by sampling the information; that is, we cut down our work by only looking at some of the data. We tried to cut down on the wasted time. I sometimes wonder how much of what Google does is a total waste of time because the answers it seeks can be found in much faster time using much less data. And how much of “Big Data” is in fact a “Big Waste of Time.”Zuboff doesn’t consider that these firms may still be just in the early stages of figuring out what they are supposed to be doing. I think about it because so much time and resources are wasted paying attention to wholly irrelevant stuff.But we would do well to consider the affect of these companies on our freedoms and our government partially because they aren’t just national problems. They are transnational problems. What happens in China, and the extreme kind of surveillance practiced there on ethnic minorities like the Uigers, affects or will affect us here.They are transnational because the data collection is transnational and the very same data collected for the purpose of selling advertising is probably being used to develop artificial intelligence. The fastest developer of AI whether they be Chinese companies, transnational companies like Google or Facebook, or companies directly financed by government will have a big say in who has a job in the coming years and who doesn’t.No country on its own can hope to curb data collection and aggregation or perhaps more importantly, the control of what search results reveal on this scale any more than a country can curb money laundering, tax avoidance, or climate change without coordination between many if not all nations. Contemporary politics seems to be going in the opposite direction if Trump’s “America First,” Brexit, and Russian adventurism are any indication. If we are divided and our attention fractured we are susceptible to the influence or real or imagined “experts.” (To firms like Facebook I think we all have ADD, attention deficit disorder...they can never get enough of our attention!) That doesn’t mean we cannot continue to make decisions affecting our government, it more likely means that the decisions we make will more commonly resemble the imperatives of those desiring more of the same, read: the status quo.And that turns us to the question of how good is the status quo. If you believe that the universe ultimately bends toward the dilution of energy, total entropy, then the status quo is not too good. If you believe the status quo to be a teleological evolution toward a great singularity, perhaps a union with God, and a progression toward greater complexity in the universe, the status quo looks pretty good.Business executives, in my experience, tend to be of the more optimistic latter type of people. Like the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world and other people who have become incredibly wealthy in a short period of time.In the meantime, some of us have rather pedestrian concerns like the security of really private information. While convincingly arguing that there is insufficient transparency over who handles the big data and how they handle it, I think Zuboff fails to sufficiently weigh immense risk that the data will fall out of control of the aggregators and into the hands of rogue individuals.The hacking of credit card databases is one thing, and I think it a bigger risk than the hacking of a database which tells people how I like my hotdogs dressed. People made a big deal of the Cambridge Analytica scare. In the end, those people sold bogus claims to naive political organizations. The data predicted nothing and was of no use to anybody. And it didn’t get Donald Trump elected.Certainly big data aggregation has concrete effects on the economy. You get “free” Google searches. I get a cheaper smart TV because the data guys get first dibs on my TV watching preferences.This book is not the best guide for the good works these technologies enable (ie crowd sourcing, scientific research, epidemiology, etc). Self-driving cars benefit by machine learning. The acceleration and reductions in the friction in electronic commerce are generally good things.I don’t agree with Zuboff that the behavioural science behind the new data aggregation firms promotes a radical indifference to the lot of the common person. Nor do I agree that hyperscale doesn’t require competitive markets or for that matter democracy.This has yet to be proven.We all need participatory democracy, and more than ever on a global scale. Let’s make these damn machines work for us, not agin us."
84,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26854448-m-a,5,"This is a brilliant and important book about the future of mankind.It is unfortunately very difficult to read, due not only to the complexity of the subject matter, but also due to the constant use by the author of jargon and long complicated sentences. This is very ironic, considering that this book is intended as a warning and a call to action to the general public against the machinations of the Surveillance Capitalist elite. I can only hope that a more accessible version of this book will be published to accomplish that goal.Zuboff claims that surveillance capitalism is as big a change for our society as industrial capitalism was more than two centuries ago.It all started with Google, followed closely by Facebook, Microsoft and eventually by all digital industries.Google started collecting our private data (from our search terms on Google search, to our emails on Gmail, to our location data on Google Maps, our data stored on our Android devises etc..) without our knowledge or consent and turning them into predictions about our future behavior, which they sold for profit to marketers.Zuboff calls Google ""privacy kleptomaniacs"". She compares Google to the Spanish conquistadores invading the natives on the American continent and declaring the continent theirs by a monarchical edict declaring it so. So did Google invade our private data by declaring it theirs through obscure unilaterally imposed terms of service.She calls this data, the new raw material of capitalism ""Behavioral Surplus"".She traces the architecture of this new form of capitalism from its supply routes to its ""behavioral futures markets"".The production of digital data has far outpaced the human capacity to process/make sense of that data.Therefore, behavioral psychologists and data scientists have created algorithms to predict an individual's future behavior based on the billions of raw data of his/her every move and every thought.They use the 5 factor personality model, the 6 emotion model, affective computing, emotional analytics and sentiment analysis to predict our personalities and our future behavior.Surveillance Capitalists are prediction factories, based on raw materials from us.Google and co don't sell the raw data, they sell behavioral predictions based on that data.That information is not only useful to marketers, but to anyone with an interest in that knowledge and an interest in influencing that future behavior.Some examples of benefits of knowing a person's future behavior with very great accuracy include: predicting disease, financial risk, criminal risk, consumer preferences and political views. This knowledge about the future allows corporations to eliminate all risks in their business dealings.Zuboff calls this predictive data the ""shadow text"".This shadow text is only available to surveillance capitalists through their data extractions and algorithms.It is about us but not for us.Us being unaware of the surveillance is the precondition for surveillance capitalism to function properly- we are to remain unaware of the shadow text. Even if raw data are shared with us, the shadow data crafted for prediction purposes is not accessible to us.Remote digital observation and tele-stimulation ( the ""god view"") allows for distancing of the observed as ""the other"".Zuboff calls the Surveillance Capitalists the ""Big Other"".""The market reduces us to our behavior, transformed into another fictional commodity and packaged for others' consumption"" We are to be monitored and tele stimulated.Zuboff demonstrates how surveillance capitalism has expanded beyond cyberspace into our everyday life.Even the human body is treated as a computer, containing data in order to provide corporations certainty of profit.Take wearables for example: they form an unobtrusive integration to everyday life- internet connected fabrics, fitness trackers, diabetes apps etc.Zuboff quotes a study that shows that apps downloaded on a smart phone extract location data, contact lists, photos & videos etc without express consent of the user and that they sell this data to third parties.According to Zuboff, these companies' privacy policies should be called ""surveillance policies"".She predicts we will all end up with chips in our bodies for better surveillance, like animals. Telemetry is already used on animals to study their behavior. Humans will be next.We are already tracked in our cars, in our homes, in our kidneys (dialysis devices).By 2020, there will be 20 billion intelligent devices with the capability of tracking and monitoring us.Zuboff calls whatever data that is not yet tracked ""dark data"". Surveillance Capitalists are intent on tracking all behavior that is not (yet) informatized.They want to monetize every aspect of our lives, the entire human experience. They want to turn our entire life into profit for themselves.Power was once identified with the ownership of the means of production.Now power rests in the ownership of the means of behavioral prediction and behavioral modification of the other. Now our lives are turned into data without our knowledge or consent in order to benefit others.Zuboff explains how the system of Surveillance Capitalism is grounded in behavioral psychology.The goal of behaviorism is the prediction and control of behavior- the human being is nothing but an organism, an ""it"". According to behaviorists a human is in essence no different than a mushroom, only a bit more complex.Behaviorists (eg Skinner and Pentland) believe humans have no freedom of will, no autonomy, no agency. Freedom of will is an illusion. It is the environment that controls behavior. Individual behavior is caused by variables lying outside the individual himself.Hence the belief by behaviorists that behavioral control can lead to predicting future behavior with scientific accuracy. Behavior must be studied w/o limits and w/o knowledge of the ""organism"".Privacy is an illusion just like freedom- they must be forfeited in favor of the good life.BUT this view was meant to benefit all of humanity; the knowledge gained through behavioral tracking was to be used to improve human behavior towards a better future for humanity: fighting disease, crime, poverty etc..Instead, behaviorism has been hijacked by surveillance capitalism to benefit only the small class of surveillance capitalists and their customers. The lost freedom only affects us but the acquired knowledge and profit is all theirs.What are the dangers of Surveillance Capitalism?The more one knows about a person, the easier it is to control him.Besides being used for targeted marketing, knowledge of personal data can also be used to blackmail, defame, harass and discriminate against us.The dangers lie not only in corporate surveillance itself and the accompanying loss of privacy, but even more worrisome, in corporate mind manipulation and corporate behavioral modification, such as the creation of conformity and obedience but also the creation of desires that benefit commerce and emotions that benefit politicians. Surveillance capitalists wants ALL of you- your behavior, your thoughts, your emotions, your personality- so they can manipulate your behavior. Will you have any autonomy, any free will left? Surveillance Capitalism is not only a danger to privacy, but a danger to democracy which depends on autonomous moral judgment and individual determination and free will. Zuboff believes in free will as the basis for individuality, self determination, and the right to decide our future (She calls it ""The right to the future tense"").The right to be one's author of one's future should be cast as a human right-necessary because it is imperiled by ""the panvasive digital architecture of behavioral modification owned and operated by surveillance capital, necessitated by its economic imperatives and driven by its laws of motion, all for the sake of its guaranteed outcomes""Will Google, FB and co. lead to digital totalitarianism? According to Zuboff the answer is no, because the past offers no adequate compass for this new phenomenon.Zuboff calls the future of Surveillance Capitalism ""Instrumentarianism"".Totalitarianism, as impersonated by Hitler and Stalin was only understood after the facts. It entails the destruction of all human ties except total loyalty to the movement (fascism or communism). It operates through the means of violence, terror and fear- all who do not conform, the enemies of the ""people"", are executed.Instrumentarianism behaves through the means of behavioral modification.And, unlike in a totalitarian regime, there is no need to use force . All you need is adequate human engineering.""Instrumentarianism"" is a behaviorally controlled society, in which knowledge replaces freedom. In such a society, social change can be generated by social pressure from social networks to ""go with the flow, stay with the herd, return to the hive and take flight with the flock"". Identity yields to synchrony.Such a society leads to the death of individuality. The collective intelligence knows best and individuality is only unnecessary friction towards that goal.Instrumentarian society with its architecture of behavioral control, social pressure and asymmetrical power is a Panopticon - there is no exit possible.Once it was believed that there is no exit from an all knowing and all powerful God.Under Instrumentarianism, there will be no exit from the others, big other and the surveillance capitalists. Big Other knows no boundaries.Zuboff pleads for the right to sanctuary.It is a universal need for a safe refuge, for shelter.This right is as ancient as human history; originally it manifested itself in the form of a city, or a temple. Later on this right extended to the home: a sanctuary from arbitrary intrusion. Psychologists agree that this is important for development of the self and for mental health. With Big Other, the Universe takes up residence within our walls, there is no refuge. (thinkof internet connected security cameras, light switches, thermostats, appliances, rumbas, wearables,smart phones, tooth brushes, beds, personal assistants, TVs, toys,etc etc).What solution does Zuboff propose to avert the coming Instrumentarian Society?To just stop using the internet and internet connected devices?Surveillance Capitalists offer solutions to social connection, access to information, time saving convenience and ""illusionary"" support and this got us all addicted. It is not reasonable to expect us to go off the grid.Privacy regulation and monopoly regulation is inefficient at combating those risks- it will not be solved by encryption, anonymization or discussion of data ownership. This is a new condition that outruns the law, that has not been tamed by law. Zuboff discusses very briefly the new regulatory regime operating in the EU since May 2018, the GDPR ( General Data Protection Regulation). The GDPR is a good step forward, but only time will tell if it will be efficient in vanquishing surveillance capitalism's instrumentarian power. The individual is powerless against the surveillance capitalist machine because of asymmetrical power and knowledge. Only collective action on the ground, such as class actions, will determine if GDPR will be effective.Regulators will be up against well funded corporate lawyers and lobbyists.Zuboff concludes that Surveillance Capitalism is profoundly anti democratic. It is a market coup from above on the people. It is a form of tyranny, of absolutism; it imposes its rules from above; everyone except the tyrant is just an organism, the ""other one"", to be exploited for the profit of the tyrant.Industrial revolution has led to near destruction of our planet and extinction of many species. Instrumentarianism will lead to extinction of our individuality.Zuboff points to the critical role of public opinion on changing the laws. She proclaims passionately:It is NOT ok to strip search us for profit.It is a human expectation to be the author of one's life.There is still time to redirect the action to a future that we can call home.It is our responsibility to right was has gone wrong.We have to be indignant because this is an attack on human dignity.Freedom from uncertainty is no freedom.She refuses to seed the future to illegitimate power.She demands a human future.She calls the world to action to declare the digital future to be a human future."
85,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42693079-ryan-o-neill,4,"This ambitious and expansive book aims to define and explain the rise of surveillance capitalists like Google, Facebook and Microsoft as they play ever larger roles in our lives. Shoshana Zuboff briefly maps out the history of some of these companies and delves into the way in which they gradually encroach on our lives in ever more frightening ways.She argues persuasively that while sometimes driven by old capitalist imperatives, these companies represent a break from past eras such as that of industrial capitalism as they secretly and aggressively gather increasing amounts of personal information from us, but not for our benefit; rather than the traditional business-customer reciprocities, surveillance capitalists plunder every element of our lives, both online and offline, for the benefit of advertisers, and ultimately serve their economic benefit.Under surveillance capitalism, we are no longer the customers (although practices are often disguised under the auspices of 'personalisation') but rather our searches, browsing history, friends, likes, reactions, emotions and feelings are raw materials to be scraped for the benefit of companies who are free to operate outside the boundaries of traditional democracy and regulation. Our rights are ruthlessly and carelessly cast aside and rendered obsolete in this relentless pursuit of behavioural surplus without which surveillance capitalists cannot grow.These companies encroach upon our personal space in ever more intrusive ways - from the original Google Street View controversy in the mid-2000s to Facebook's hidden methods of gleaning info on our preferences, to TVs that listen to you, wearable devices, Alexa house alarms and even toys that listen to you, to the fight for our car dashboards. The speed and aggression is such that after initial outrage, we are worn down, helpless and numbed, resigned to our fate.Surveillance capitalism, Zuboff argues, attempts to create certainty of outcome for its actual customers - its advertisers. This is done by parsing human behaviour, exploiting feelings, emotions and beliefs even when we don't permit it to, so that our individual freedom, our rights to define our own experience, and to act and think in private are eroded as we are continuously moulded and directed towards specific courses of action by these companies. The inherent uncertainty that exists within how we think, how we act and interact - our right to an effective life - is replaced by collective certainty at the hands of surveillance capitalism.Zuboff also mines the effects of social media on young people's development. As they journey from being defined by their relationships at a young age to becoming separate from but connected to others in adulthood, young people are adversely affected by social media and its imperatives to forcing people to see themselves 'from the outside in' and define themselves based on the experiences and lives of others. The pervasiveness of social media means people often struggle to disconnect, their mental health even suffering from brief separation from their accounts. This crucially and savagely inhibits their ability to look inward and make that journey from people defined by their relationships in youth, to autonomous individuals who have relationships in adulthood.Zuboff argues that while the advent of new laws such as GDPR in Europe have been helpful, surveillance capitalism's overall success in evading proper regulation and legal scrutiny means that decisive action will depend on a turning of public opinion. Lots of us are passive about our distrust of social media, but it will take a re-establishment of indignation, a renewal of outrage, if we are to have any chance of stemming the flow.The book is a heavy undertaking; more than 500 pages long and often written in rather academic prose, and it can occasionally be quite dense and abstract. Given the ubiquity of technology in all of our lives, it could undoubtedly be more reader-friendly, and perhaps focus on more real-life examples that we are all familiar with. Despite its wealth of information, Xuboff's proposed solutions are vague, and it is arguably unclear what exactly you as an individual can do personally to reduce the insidious influence of surveillance capitalism in your everyday life; what strategies can be used to repell Facebook from building a strong profile based on your preferences, for example? Is there a feasible path to effective life without being on Facebook?Furthermore, it would have been helpful to have some more analysis on the gathering of information not related to economics - the how and why of information kept either by governments or corporations on citizens for reasons not linked to monetary benefits.Nevertheless, this is a hugely informative, well researched and important book on a subject which, as the author herself notes, is a story still unfolding and which still has some way to run. It's likely that many updates and more reader-friendly analyses on surveillance capitalism will follow, but this is a fantastic launch-pad for one of the defining issues of our time."
86,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45700308-tanmay-srivastava,1,"Shoshana Zuboff's book was highly recommended, was part of multiple lists and had glowing reviews on Goodreads. I was quite excited to pick it up and start reading.  Without calling it out, Zuboff treats incremental technological progress as a zero sum game. A win for the tech companies is a loss to someone. Take, for example when Zuboff talks about connected cars . She says an insurance company can stall a car if the premiums are not paid. She beats up this argument and brings up a case of how an elderly couple had to choose between car payments and medicine, which came to light only when the collection officers turned up at the door. A crowdfunding campaign was launched to help them and it had a happy ending. Using software however would have meant that this would have never happened. She fails to recognize that her example is the exception and not the norm. She chooses to ignore the positive impact connected cars would have on say, cars getting stolen going down leading to lower premiums or reduced premiums for drivers using their cars less or rewarding good drivers by reducing their premiums. Maybe, with such technological advances premiums would fall to such an extent that the couple wouldn't have to worry about premium payments altogether? She fails to acknowledge that progress is not a zero sum game. Tech companies have been bashed quite a bit through the book. There is no nod of appreciation for the positive impact they have had on societies. Here, In India - products of these tech companies are helping small businesses make moves that wouldn't have been possible before. Expensive POS Machines have been skipped (the same way how landlines didn't make it to parts of India but mobile phones did) in favor of Google Pay (QR Codes for Bank to Bank transfers). Book keeping doesn't required expensive licenses and can be managed online. Whatsapp is used to sell/communicate/deliver orders. YouTube is a learning platform for many, and a medium for news outside of the traditional media. The jobs these tech companies have created in India, directly and indirectly, also cannot be overlooked. There's a section where Zuboff talks about fake news and its impact on Brexit and the 2016 US Election. While I do agree fake news is a very big issue, the issue of voter discretion cannot be overlooked. In Zadie Smith's essay on Brexit -  ""Fences""  she writes how someone voted one way in referendum to get rid of the health secretary. Would it have been different if it was not targeted to a particular group (via the likes of Cambridge Analytica)? Would the results of Brexit and the 2016 US Election have been the same if there was no Facebook? Are we giving these incidents more importance than they deserve? ""Who knows?"" - I don't. I don't think we can ever conclusively state yes or no. The biggest issue is that a lot of topics covered in the book are in the grey area. Is it okay to give someone hungry a burger from McDonald's? The burger will make sure that they don't go hungry, but it's not a healthy meal. Can they afford to have a healthy meal? Can they stay hungry? Is there a way to grow healthy food to feed everyone? Is there a way to make everyone want/enjoy the healthy food? This sort of reasoning should have been the core of the book. You cannot do without technology companies today. Google, Microsoft, Facebook are essential parts of our day to day lives. Is there a business model where these companies can make enough money to create products that add value without compromising on data to drive revenue? Is there a market for people to pay for their services without any data getting collected? Do people bother to dig deep in their account settings to switch off optional data collection? Do people care? I feel the book is not asking the right questions needed to drive policy discussions. Data privacy is an important topic. The book is well researched in parts but jumps into pages of wishful thinking. The conclusions drawn are biased. The facts are presented in a way to scare you, and similar to how likes are garnered on social media with scary/angry posts, this book has scared people into giving it 5 stars on Goodreads. I wish this book was not one sided as it was - Not recommended."
87,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27470888-cool-breeze,1,"The subject of this book is very important. Unfortunately, this book fails miserably at contributing anything useful to the discussion. It is mind-numbingly long at 691 pages and an ordeal to read. Zuboff takes a few observations on surveillance technology issues and uses pretentious academic jargon to fluff them into this execrable doorstop of a book. The book does not offer any practical solutions to the issues she raises. A good editor could have reduced this to a pamphlet or a web article without leaving much notable out.This is possibly the worst non-fiction book I have ever read. I dreaded resuming it every time I picked it up and finally abandoned it on page 158. If I should ever be stuck on a desert island with only this book for reading material, I will be thankful at least that I have an abundant supply of toilet paper.Zuboff is a sociologist and the language she employs is tortured and tedious in the extreme. She insists on coining lots of neologisms and wallowing in her jargon. Amusingly, her favorite term is Behavioral Surplus, or BS for short. The book could have saved countless pages if she reduced a lot of her BS to abbreviations. Perhaps such Heideggerian writing impresses her academic colleagues, but it is excruciating for the average reader. She beats her core points to death – within the first 100 pages she must have repeated some version of the following point dozens of times – ‘the user isn’t the customer, nor are they the product, they are the raw material that is used to create the product’. You could have cut many more pages by limiting this point to three repetitions. It is as if she thinks her readers are idiots, or else she has dementia and doesn’t remember what she wrote a page or two ago. Even worse, Zuboff is a Luddite and a hard-core leftist. She obviously thinks the Industrial Revolution was largely a disaster. On page 11, she writes “industrial civilization… threatens to cost us the earth”. By page 12, she is hyperventilating “The industrial legacy of climate chaos fills us with dismay, remorse and fear”. No, it doesn’t. The reason Trump is President and the US has repudiated stupid climate treaties is that so many American voters think this is a non-issue or a very low priority (#18 out of 19 in a recent survey). On page 22, she writes that she has been inspired by a rogues' gallery of leftists, including Karl Marx, Theodor Adorno, Jean-Paul Sartre and Thomas Piketty (Robert Reich and Rachel Carson, who is responsible for millions of deaths, are also mentioned favorably). On page 33, she likens her great-grandparents fleeing the oppression of 1908 Russia to the oppression of the nuclear family (you poor, fragile snowflake!). On page 38 she viciously criticizes Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, although she admits their policies pulled the country out of the stagflation and “malaise” of the Jimmy Carter years. Unbelievably, Zuboff apparently thinks airline deregulation was a bad thing. On page 42, she is writes approvingly of rioters in London (she really should read some Theodore Dalrymple on the real problems involved) and the dilettante, astroturf Occupy “movement”. On page 43, she comments disapprovingly on those who would “pare regulations, cut taxes… and shrink entitlements”. Heaven forbid that anyone should want to take an ax to the leviathan state! By page 109, she is bemoaning the Supreme Court’s rejection of restrictions on political speech, “hate speech” (meaning anything she and her politically correct brethren disagree with), pornography (yeah, she’s puritanical as well as a Luddite) and free association. What a pinch-faced scold!Only at this point does she admit that her arch-villain, Google, has been totally in bed with the left-wing Obama administration, using their surveillance technology to mastermind his two Presidential campaigns and running a revolving door operation with 258 employees moving between Google and the Obama regime. Whoops! How inconvenient! It’s almost like leftism and this creepy surveillance technology go hand in hand! Curiously, in a 691-page book, the word “Clinton” does not appear even once in the 26-page index! I wonder who was President from 1996 to 2001, Google’s first five years? Or who was Hillary’s biggest corporate campaign contributor? It is a complete mystery, according to this book. Zuboff doesn’t actually appear to be a Clinton fan, so maybe she just doesn’t want to wind up adding to the Arkancide body count like Jeffrey Epstein.Zuboff must have felt terrible about documenting the extent of Obama’s collusion with Google’s abuses, because within a few pages she is back to bashing mainstream conservative organizations such as the Federalist Society, Heritage Action, Americans for Tax Reform and the Cato Institute as “Far Right”. Anyone to the right of Marx, Lenin and Mao is apparently “Far Right” to Zuboff.Chapter 5 elaborates Googles expanding abuses from 2009-2016. The Europeans attempt some pushback, but the US is feckless or oblivious. Just who controlled the government that was supposed to be preventing such abuses during this time? Zuboff couldn’t possibly guess, even if you spotted her an O, B and M. During this period, Zuboff’s Harvard Business School colleagues ride to the defense of Yelp, perhaps the only tech company more loathsome than Google.Strangely, Zuboff admits there were a number of potentially effective policy fixes being seriously considered in the years before 9/11. Why not revive those ideas and build a political coalition of like-minded classical-liberals, libertarians, small-government conservatives and Trump supporters (the tech giants being no friends of Trump) to implement them? She points out that the national security agencies are obstacles. Well, after Brennan, Comey, Holder and Lynch, a lot of people on the right need no further persuasion that the FBI, CIA and the rest of the Deep State are utterly corrupt rogue agencies. Zuboff doesn’t appear to consider this a possibility. I guess working with those icky right wingers is completely out of the question. Even worse, such allies are never going to go along with replacing the tech elite with the “benevolent” socialist dictatorship of Zuboff and her Harvard faculty elite. As it turns out, Zuboff’s problem is not so much with the creepy technology, it is that the creepy technology is not under the control of “enlightened” leftists like her and her comrades in academia and government.That was as much as I could take. I skimmed the book for any sign of practical solutions in the pages to come and, finding none, I abandoned the book on page 158.I agree with Zuboff that the tech giants represent a grave threat. However, if her prescription of more government and more socialism is the only alternative, I guess I will just have to find ways to live with it. The only thing worse than surveillance capitalism is surveillance statism run by socialist do-gooder “elites” like Zuboff, who always think they know better and want to engage in social engineering. Do you think the Chinese people would prefer annoying Google ads or their oppressive and ubiquitous social credit scores? The only people I would less like to see in control of this technology than Page, Brin and Zuckerberg are Zuboff and her comrades.In the nearer term, there are still practical steps one can take to mitigate the problem. Don’t use Google products. Use DuckDuckGo for search. Don’t use Gmail or Chrome. Use a good ad blocker, like AdBlockPlus on all devices. Don’t buy creepy surveillance technology like Nest, Ring or Alexa. Delete your Facebook account. Don’t use Twitter, it’s a surveillance sewer. Don’t buy from Amazon or use their products or services, especially the Washington Post. Don’t buy from Apple or use their products or services. Use Linux if that is viable for you or lock down you Windows privacy settings, if not. Check your app setting and cut them back to only those necessary to function. Don’t use non-essential apps like games, many of which are bad offenders.Support the breakup of the tech giants using antitrust laws. Support their prosecution for anti-competitive and anti-privacy violations. Having Page, Brin, Zuckerberg and Bezos doing some serious hard time would have a very salutary effect “pour encourager les autres”. Institute real and legally-binding privacy protections such as Zuboff mentions and dismisses. Yes, we will have to do it without the support of Zuboff and her comrades, but Trump’s upcoming second term could be a real opportunity to get this done (I think Zuboff’s head may have just exploded)."
88,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65435043-alan-tennyson,5,"I pored over this book, stayed with the words. Read and reread them. Drank deeply from their wisdom.  It was not an easy read, but ultimately it gave far more than it took. The Age of Surveillance Capitalism is a seminal text for our age. Zuboff's account of surveillance capitalism is elegant, poised and persuasive. Yet for all her brilliance, Shonanna's central thesis suffers some fundamental flaws.  Where The Age is at it's strongest is in the articulation of surveillance capitalism. Consider this, 'Who owns your face?', 'Who owns your behaviour?' What you do, where you go, who you know, all this has value and extracting value from these data is the business model of the surveillance capitalist.  But this is only the description, where Zuboff's account takes a darker turn, is in control. Once Surveillance Capitalists have provided a description of you, the next logical step is to determine how much this description can be used to predict and control you. Zuboff's account of these processes is beautifully rendered in perfect proses.  Know thyself, unless you don't like what you find, then, deny thyself, and pretend you are other. Zuboff goes for the latter.  We are born of this place, this pale blue dot, we are natural phenomena. Yet despite these self-evident truths, many continue to advance the notion that we apes are exceptional.  We are somehow other than the mere organisms with whom we share our earth and almost our entire genetic structure. Zuboff takes issue with humans being described as 'mere organisms'.  She is caged by this ideology of human exceptionalism, and it weakens her thesis considerably.  There are sacred cows here, and sacred cows will invariably be slaughtered.  The first heifer into the meat factory is autonomy. Shoshana strips us of our relations, our context and connections. She exalts 'autonomy' but fails to grapple with the weakness of the presumptions it contains. This leads her to assert that humans are and ought to be autonomous.  But Zuboff fails to address that we are born free, but everywhere in chains. From the traffic light to the electric chair, we are already in a context that seeks to control our behaviour. What does she think education and justice are? If not systems of changing our behaviour? But it's more than this, it's a scientific reality, we are our contexts, our environment, they shape us as we shape them.  This is a reality that an insistence on 'Freedom' cannot wish away.   For me, the issue is not that we are organisms', we are.  It is not that we are miraculous rational deities, we are not.  We need to embrace our human frailty, stare it down since we are wiser for this knowledge.  Here again, Zuboff takes issues with what she calls the 'ideology of human frailty'.  Respectfully I would ask that we,  put down our pride and look hard in the mirror, human frailty is not an ideology, it is a fundamental truth. We are 'mere organisms' and to claim anything else is to cling to a pernicious ideology. An ideology that has prompted human dominion over earth and animals, and all the ecological genocide that follows."

In fact, in a time like this I wish there was a more complex rating system than 5 stars. I digress.This was, in many ways, the first of its kind. There have, in my view, yet to be too many intelligent take downs of the dangers of big data. There is,of course, a brief mentioning of the a similar subject in many other modern texts - but not to this degree.So, you ask, what the hell is surveillance capitalism. It is, a term coined by the author. She first presented the concept publicly in 2014, in an article, where she described it as such :""[surveillance capitalism is a] radically dissembled and extractive variant of information capitalism"" based on the commodification of ""reality"" and its transformation into behavioral data for analysis and sales""*---- IN this book she presents the story of how it is that we have gotten to such a point in history, where the sentence in her 2014 article could even be spoken. In this she gives a small run down of facebook and google, and explains the origins of these sights in relation to their users. User-ship on these web pages began without much craziness, but as we all know many pages which were once small e.g. facebook, google, and youtube have more or less all become huge power houses of influence. They have now followings in the billions. This is presently praised by these web pages as a good thing. Initially. well. The servers couldn't take it. There was too much damn data. And its all so useless.Or is it?It was, with this question, in the eyes of zuboff, that this form of capitalism** was born. The data not only need not be an annoyance, but it could be a pathway towards making money. 'Perhaps', these tech giants thought 'we could predict the users behaviors by paying attention to the patterns in data'. Alas. we are truly all creatures of habit. Long story short. A great deal of people in the industrial world are using certain pages on the internet in ways that are useful for targeting for sales. This of course can eventually be sold to governments blah blah blah. Ask yourself. are you ok with people predicting your behaviors to increase user experience? What about to protect you? What about to just watch you?These are questions the book will make you reflect on.Overall, I think this was one of the most apropos books I have read in awhile towards understanding some issues in modernity.86/100 stars.Recommended for:Those thinking about big data in its prediction of human behaviorthose who dont trust facebook and googlethose worried about internet privacythose thinking about the future path of society*Hey guess what.

97,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7420241-nick-jacob,5,"A difficult read which chills the soul really, in terms of the scope of Facebook and Google to behaviourally modify us all without our consent in a pretty determined, if indifferent manner. Market and industrial capitalism are declining, long live surveillance capitalism say the social media giants, in whose tentacles it is we, rather than any thing useful for us as humans, who are grasped .It’s a bit long and at times repetitive, like Das Kapital, but it’s not really a criticism of the book, as the amount of research and work Zuboff must have done to produce this dizzying analysis of the current state of digital technology and its impact on us, is breathtaking. It’s the resistance to surveillance capitalism’s imperatives that she leaves as the challenge for society at the end of the book... How is that done when we hunger so much for its crumbs and are so addicted to the precision targeting of its algorithms?"
98,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86841474-aaron-lewis,1,"Here, a capitalist argues that Facebook and Google's approach to capitalism is a ""rogue"" capitalism, and represents an unprecedented threat to liberalism. The argument is blind to how Big Tech's surveillance is merely the most recent and sophisticated manifestation of capitalism's inherent drive to extract value; advertising and media companies have for centuries made a business of surveillance and control. But acknowledging that continuity would deflate the book's sensationalism, and undermine its premise that, before Big Tech, the only threat to liberalism was state power, and not also that of capital."
99,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89255731-mark-walker,5,"This book will boil your blood. Supported by extensive empirical research, Professor Shoshana Zuboff exposes the effective digital implementation of the late B. F. Skinner's Beyond Freedom and Dignity. It centers around three related factors: The distribution of knowledge: “Who knows?” Authority: “Who decides who knows?” and Power: “Who decides who decides who knows?” (Hint: it's not you). Orders of magnitude beyond just tracking cookies and the creepy anticipation of your interests by entities such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook, the new instrumentarianism is used by surveillance capitalists to control not just what you buy but also what you think about and how you think it. This is not even the theoretical Capitalism of Friedman, Hayek, or Adam Smith, as there is no equality of individual choice in it. In other words there's no free market here, as surveillance capitalists deliberately orchestrate your life for their benefit irrespective of yours. Thus it's not a fair trade; there is no reciprocity in the conveniences you think you receive from even the simplest transactions. You are not their customers (or even the ""product"" as in the cliché); their customers are the people purchasing the information harvested about you, which is extracted without your awareness. In this digital realm, it is as if you are the third world country having your natural resources extracted for the exclusive profits of foreign capitalists. Another clear analogy is we are like chickens being farmed for our eggs: they feed us with incentives, not for our well-being but so that we will lay more eggs to go into omelets not for us. You and your personal information are only the objects, the ""Other,"" that are for sale for the benefit of people who are not you. The key feature of all of this is that willingness is irrelevant, as we are unknowing and thus unwitting participants. Their salient objective is the obscene profits garnered from not just your profiles and posts, but the shadow text that you don't see from the fusion of the backscatter data about you that is harvested into separate secret databases. They actively hide that they have this information on you, as their modus operandi requires that you not be aware of it for this process to be successful. Much of this activity is beyond the reach of laws and courts, as the surveillance capitalists would just go underground with their operations if regulations were imposed. It is accompanied by an acceleration of the deliberate assault on democracy through lobbying and revolving door employment between government and the commercial interests that control it. Thus just voting for politicians that promise to tame surveillance capitalism will be of insufficient effect. Zuboff offers hope and some thoughts on what to do about it. European history has shown that when the people have had enough of oppression, they join together to rebel, as when the Berlin Wall came down without resistance from the guards. A similar event must occur today to escape the glass walls of the hive surveillance capitalists have put us in for the purpose of harvesting and orchestrating even our most personal thoughts, all for their profit and not ours. We need walls of our own, not to keep us in their hive, but to keep them out of our personal sanctuary. Public opinion is key to taming this monster. In the end if enough of the public rose up against surveillance capitalism, possibly by throwing its shadow text in disarray and diminishing its value, the money and influence behind it would then be of little effect. There is hope if humans would willingly help each other to the extent that surveillance capitalists take without asking. Then the world would be a much friendlier and more prosperous place for everyone. and not just the few."
100,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6192529-frieda-vizel,3,"The writing was a big problem for me. Sometimes, instead of relying on strong arguments, it relied on absurdly hyperbolic language. For instance, I didn’t feel like she explained clearly enough why monetizing our data is bad - say, because how it’s been destroying “the forth estate” that needs to constantly run after the clicks, or how our data is used to manipulate us to consume-consume-consume, to the detriment of the planet. Instead she went on for a while about our right to the “will to will” and a lot about how bad BF Skinner was. Maybe if I understood behaviorism better I’d have felt it as strongly as she seemed to, but I just didn’t feel like I totally got that whole part. Maybe that’s me.Speaking of Skinner, she seems to be of the school of public intellectualism that is very focused on individual actors instead of on the system. So she goes on a lot about the bad guys of our predicament, Skinner but also of course Zuck, the Google founders, the guy at Microsoft who didn’t seem to be extraordinarily villainous at all. Here’s where this type of focus in the individual derails us: it leads Zuboff to think that these people created the problems, and not the system. But actually, so long as the law allows for folks to make money by manipulating the masses, there will always be a sociopath to sink his teeth in. That’s why the problem is the system and that needs to be fixed. And Zuboff does argue for that - it’s just that she weakens her argument by being so focused on these insatiable idiot vampires. But all that is quibbling and frustration. The important take-away from the book is that it stakes the solution within the law. It does not fall for the “freedom of speech” idiocy, an argument mounted by economic interest as a way to stop the entire legal system from functioning as it should. Since when can’t we have laws? Since when is it tyranny for the government to create limits and parameters as a way of ensuring a healthy society? Since the tech companies have been telling us that we only deserve positive freedoms. Freedom to advertise, sure. Freedom from being manipulated by ads- it’s an Orwellian Communist murderous regime and soon we will be like North Korea!Zuboff talks about the slow speed of democracy. That’s what left me so despaired. Democracy is not getting faster, but the technological invasions are. And I don’t see how we’ll ever be able to catch up with them. Meanwhile, a screech on a decibel undetectable to the human ear is now screaming into your subconscious and telling you to buy another Alexa and a smart underwear plus to to vote for Kim Jung Il. True story."
101,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8040056-clancy,5,"[The] bare facts of surveillance capitalism necessarily arouse my indignation because they demean human dignity. The future of this narrative will depend upon the indignant citizens, journalists, and scholars drawn to this frontier project; indignant elected officials and policy makers who understand that their authority originates in the foundational values of democratic communities; and, especially, indignant young people who act in the knowledge that effectiveness without autonomy is not effective, dependency-induced compliance is no social contract, a hive with no exit can never be home, experience without sanctuary is but a shadow, a life that requires hiding is no life, touch without feel reveals no truth, and freedom from uncertainty is no freedom.This book is an incendiary work of immense scholarly and literary significance.With admiral restraint, Zuboff painstakingly dismantles, analyses, and lays bear the machinations of one of the greatest challenges that faces humanity in this century. We have be come not the product, as is so often said, but the raw material of an entirely novel industry. This industry's speed of ascent and adaptation and especially of innovation has left individuals and governments alike, completely unable to meaningfully understand, let alone reign-in, the advance of this all-pervading entity that increases its penetration into our lives and our communities with every passing minute.This book articulates the uncomfortable gut-feeling, the uneasy sense of cognitive dissonance, that I've felt about the level of access companies generally, but especially Alphabet and Facebook, have to my life and every piece of information living that life generates. I understand now why my no-choice participation in this new economy has generated these feelings, in all their expanded and terrifying entirety.While at times bombastic, and others poetic, and others still cool and clinical; the amount of research, time, and passion for humanity itself that went into the construction of this work has paid off. This work is a significant achievement, and an important moment that we can look back on to see whether we as a species can rise to overcome this new challenge, or whether this will be little but foreshadowing of the future we allow to follow.If you're alive right now, you owe it to yourself to read this."
102,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5225660-jouni-koskinen,2,"The issues this book is about are important and complicated and hard. The use and abuse of data and user trust is worth talking about, it's even worth shouting about.But not like this.Zuboff is alarmist, melodramatic, hyperbolic and tiring. Everything the tech companies do is not just wrong, it's a diabolic scheme to undermine the world as we know it. When something is wrong, it's never an unintended consequence, it's never human error, it's never just a silly gimmick not thought out far enough. It's always, always presented as a evil contrived mastermind plot to wreck your privacy and abuse you. And it's always presented like it's the rise of fascism in the 1930's with the most gut-wrenching tear-jerking vocabulary she could find. Get a few examples, simplify a theory somehow related to the issue, contrive a concept, give it a name like ""shadow text"" or ""behavioral surplus"" (preferably a bit ominous name), cherry pick more examples, portend doom. Rinse and repeat. And mention ""surveillance capitalism"" at least 15 times per page.It's kind of ironic that when she goes on for 700+ pages on how you should never trust these companies, that she takes their Silicon Valley hypetalk at face value. If a company claims they can do something, Zuboff gleefully integrates the claim into her narrative with zero criticism. Because it serves her point. But if a company apologises for something, it's of course disingenuous with them being the devil who wants to eat your children.By the time the book gets to behaviour manipulation, it turns from melodramatic to laughable. The obsession Zuboff has for B.F.Skinner and radical behaviorism (a 70-year-old psychology concept, the cognitive revolution would like to have a word...) is full on religious. The man wasn't wrong about anything and conditioning works on people with a hundred per cent efficiency!This is an important issue, but creating hyperbolic devils like this is not just bad writing and argumentation but counter-productive to the cause. It's just creates a shoddy boogeyman argument that is easy to shoot down.The very serious and dramatic reader Audible had for this didn't help btw. (she was very clear speaker though). "
103,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,3,"This is a really important topic and I wish I could give the book more than 3 stars. Everyone knows that the technology we are living with is unprecedented and changing the world. If we aren't careful, we will cause more harm than good. This book is about the dangers of this new information age. But there are a lot of problems with how the information is presented. First, the author uses over-the-top insulting language to describe these companies and leaders--all book long. It's so obviously biased that it undermines her points again and again, prompting lots of eyerolling--about once a page. That's minor, though. More serious is that this book is way too long. It wasn't satisfied making the point, it had to list 10 examples for every point--the full quotes, too. It read more like a college term paper that needed show every piece of research the author did. It's a very long book and it didn't need to be. Finally, the author falls prey to the worst sin in this kind of cultural criticism: she treats her worldview and personality type as the perfect ideal. There was no honest acknowledgement that her era had any flaws, only lament that the world doesn't live more like she used to, that generations will not experience what she did as a child. I very much believe that there are real dangers with only a few companies controlling the information access to the world. I've personally experienced challenges with this (Amazon just recently removed me as a listed seller of my own books, saying I need to sign up for the next level of account--at more cost--before I have the chance to be displayed as the owner of the product again). But it's a mixed bag and the author can't see past her indignation to the true complexity of the situation.So, read this for an imbalanced, overly wordy way of getting one side of the story. If it's not this book, make sure you get both sides of the story, not just the story told by Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, etc."
104,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66635467-keen,3,"3.5 Stars!“Only a few decades ago US society denounced mass behaviour-modification techniques as unacceptable threats to individual autonomy and the democratic order. Today the same practices meet little resistance or even discussion as they are routinely and pervasively deployed on the march towards surveillance revenues.”Welcome to a new and daunting landscape awash with sinister terminology like “permissionless innovation”, “digital totalitarianism”, “reality mining” and “behavioural surplus”. This is the new apparatus that dictates how we move through much of our lives, and just like most architecture out there, after a while, you almost become oblivious to the secret workings and dimensions which are influencing your behaviour and actions. And this is how the boys and girls down in Silicon Valley like it best.“The image of technology as autonomous force with unavoidable actions and consequences has been employed across the centuries to erase the fingerprints of power and absolve it of responsibility. The monster did it, not Victor Frankenstein.”Zuboff touches on many aspects surrounding surveillance capitalism, and we see the intimate relationship between the NSA and CIA and the mutual benefits to that relationship. “The agencies craved the lawlessness that a firm such as Google enjoyed.” We learn the huge significance of Section 230 and how far behind the US is behind the EU in terms of clamping down, one example being the EU law in May 2014 enforcing the right to be forgotten. She cites many sources, but without doubt the two most prominent reference points are the work of B.F. Skinner and Hannah Arendt and in particular her “The Origins of Totalitarianism”. “Google is to surveillance capitalism what the Ford Motor Company and General Motors were to mass-production-based managerial capitalism.”At one point the author sets out the four main areas of fortifications that have allowed Google to be so over protected and free to flourish away from political interference for so long, particularly in the USA,1.	Google showing their capabilities of competitive advantage in electoral politics. 2.	The deliberate blurring of public and private interests through relationships and aggressive lobbying. 3.	A revolving door of personnel who migrated between Google and the Obama administration, who shared mutual interests during Google’s crucial growth years of 2009-2016. By April 2016, 197 individuals had migrated from government to the Googlesphere and 61 had moved in the other direction. 4.	Google’s campaign of influence over academic work and the larger cultural conversation, which was vital to policy formation, public opinion and political perception. “Ford’s inventions revolutionised production. Google’s inventions revolutionised extraction and established surveillance capitalism’s first economic imperative: the extraction imperative.”This book is awash with horror stories befitting of sci-fi paperbacks. Like the one concerning Genesis Toys, who brought out, My Friend Cayla, a terrifying concept in which the child’s doll which relies on voice recognition, also harvests all sorts of data from the customer’s house. It is such a blatant violation that in 2017 Germany, (a country which knows a thing or two about surveillance), banned it as an illegal surveillance device, urging parents to destroy any such dolls in their possession.Due to the nature of this book it does have its harder going moments, but it still remains engaging, and overall Zuboff has completed a chilling, sagacious and damning book on the sinister and sophisticated ploys increasingly used in surveillance capitalism. The text is relatively, devoid of any superfluous academic verbiage, which many of these kinds of books suffer from. These companies and the people tied up with them are the people who hate big, bad words like privacy, tax and transparency. You can employ all the lawyers, lobbyists and accountants and actuaries, but when you strip it all away, what it really is a small, group of dangerous people making the rules up as they go along who have been given a suspiciously free and easy reign over how policy works around the world.Facebook has already admitted to and was even boasting about its power to influence people’s behaviour in US elections, and this was years before the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke. The billionaire owner of that company, Robert Mercer, backed Donald Trump. As Facebook is a private company it did not have to adhere to the legal standards for experimentation required of academic and government researchers. It remains to be seen what Facebook and Google cannot get away with. Providing a vast platform for hate speech, fostering chronic bullying, screening live suicides, streaming acts of terrorism. Where will the line be drawn?...Like bold, bratty toddlers they constantly challenge their boundaries and throw tantrums when anyone dare speaks out, but they needn’t worry a succession of US governments has them well protected as long as that money keeps on coming.Every law, rule or regulation is only as strong as the loopholes allow it to be. If these loopholes are known and continue to exist then we must ask why that is?... Who has the power to close them and more importantly why have they chosen not to close them?...These companies have consistently and effectively been left to self-regulate with predictable consequences. The problems have been known about the Wild West mentality of the internet for many, many years now, but yet little meaningful change has occurred, especially in the US.“Facebook’s $4.6 million in donations during the 2016 election cycle complemented its lobbying budget of $11.5 million in 2017.” But this is nothing compared to Google, which repeatedly spends more on lobbying than any other corporation, shelling out more than $18 million in 2018. It is also the second wealthiest registered lobbyist in the EU. Why are Facebook and Google choosing to spend such astronomical amounts of money?...What must they be getting in return?...What do they want?...What do they get?...Why are we not being told?...Welcome to “American Democracy”. Be afraid, be very afraid…"
105,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50996552-jp-beaty,4,"A really important text for digging out the political import of the data economy. I think the writing is slightly clumsy and I think the book underestimates the connection between Silicon Valley firms and the intelligence services/ the state. I also find the substantive responses to the issue to be a little milquetoast in comparison to the problem she diagnoses (I suppose that’s how it ended up on Obama’s books of the year list). Those problems aside at its best it is a searing look at the logic and function of the data economy. For understanding the ways that big data firms are altering society and how to think about the use and abuse of technology, this is a great book. It’s really at its best at the most conspiratorial and will leave you suspicious of what exactly your phone is doing and what Facebook ultimately wants. I’m sure posting this review will trigger a whole cascade of advertising material to make sure the big social media giants don’t loose my constant stream of crumbs I feed them. Don’t worry amazon algorithm reading this, I am much too trapped in the Skinner box to act on the suspicions raised by this book."
106,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33041497-anna,4,"“Surveillance capitalism’s antidemocratic and antiegalitarian juggernaut is best described as a market-driven coup from above. It is not a coup d’etat in the classic sense but rather a coup de gens: an overthrow of the people concealed as the technological Trojan horse that is Big Other”.This book is a huge, impressive piece of work. It feels like a relief to (at least) get some sort of overview over the way in which surveillance capitalism dominates our lives and orders society, despite the lack of suggestions for solutions. Understanding is the first step towards any form of meaningful resistance, and this feels like a solid first step :-)I do wish it were more accessible (as I do with most political theory) as its message feels like something that needs to be heard by more people than those who are willing to read 500 pages worth of academic language.Also - Zuboff’s idealization of the Henry Ford-era of capitalism rubs me the wrong way."
107,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24266382-ashley,3,"It’s been called “visionary,” but I don’t know that there’s anything entirely new here. What this felt like, to me, was a call to attention. The reader is not surprised by anything Shoshana Zuboff outlines, but is rather forced to acknowledge the problem in its entirety, all at once, in a 500-page package. That does make it feel revolutionary; Zuboff has written what very few people are willing to discuss in mainstream media, but which everyone has an inkling of, one way or another. I did find that it was a little too long-winded. It could have been significantly compressed, especially when a lot of the material was repetitive in order to emphasize certain themes and vocabulary.... and her preoccupation with B.F. Skinner was unnecessary. Zuboff was never so brilliant than when she illustrated, specifically, how Facebook and Google and Samsung (among others) are driving our behavior for their own profit, frequently at the expense of the law. I think that this strength was often drowned in vocabulary lessons and meandering observations, coming across as a little self-indulgent somewhere around the 200-page mark. It was unnecessary to spend so much time explaining Zuboff’s coined terms, such as “the uncontract”, “unprecedented”, “radical indifference”, “behavioural surplus”, and even “surveillance capitalism” itself. Especially in Part III, Zuboff’s self-indulgence became a running tangent, entire sections devoted to philosophy (and biology) lessons on the concept of “free will” and “utopia.”  In spite of that, it has definitely changed the way I think. It has also further fueled my nostalgia for a simpler time, and my distrust of social media and big corporations. The fact that it’s near-impossible to escape the clutches of these corporations is what really keeps me up at night; it’s not so much a privacy issue (I couldn’t care less if Mark Zuckerberg gets access to my old Instagram photos of cappuccinos) but rather a question of ethics. If I don’t want to give my data to third-parties, why are they able to access it anyway? If I don’t want to contribute to the rise of Facebook or Google, why are they still able to profit off of me anyway? Consent doesn’t really enter the conversation when it comes to what these rich tech companies have in mind, and evasive, incomplete privacy policies are nothing but “placebo effects” to pacify users.  Yes, I’m aware of the irony of publishing this review to Amazon-owned Goodreads.  ""Surveillance Capitalism"" is the kind of book that makes you want to throw your laptop into Lake Ontario and live in a cabin in the woods. I don’t know that I have the gumption for that kind of drastic change, but I’ll definitely think twice whenever I consider downloading an app or signing up for e-newsletters; I will certainly avoid buying any new smart devices by whatever means necessary. I do think it’s time for us to start protesting the free-reign that these conglomerates have been given, especially in North America. Our own behavior is being observed and herded by the rich 1% for financial gain; everything from our spending habits to our complacency is being mediated and controlled. I think, eventually, we have to reclaim our sense of autonomy and identity, and our understanding of reality.  Also, I just want to state for the record that I’ve always found it odd how North America experienced a period of mass rebellion, political protesting, and unrest during the 1960’s and 1970’s – and that this unrest suddenly came to a complete stop, save for a few exceptions here and there. Well, Zuboff has justified my unease, dedicating a sub-chapter to the behavior-control research conducted by the US Senate in the 70’s – research which became urgent as political protests escalated. And yes, surveillance capitalism has everything to do with it.  At the end of this heavy volume, Zuboff was really only trying to say one thing, re-stated from multiple angles: we are being rigorously and continuously exploited by capitalists. We don’t own our behavior anymore. Data collection and behavior control for the purpose of financial profit has crossed all ethical boundaries, and we as a society are content to let it happen.  This book is definitely recommended, if you have the patience and endurance to get through it. I almost didn’t. In a similar vein, I also recommend watching ‘Smithereens’, one of the recent Black Mirror episodes. Despite its melodrama, I think it has a lot of important things to say on society’s need to be “plugged in” and how this addiction is driving our lives. Some of Zuboff’s quotes that will stick with me: -“Its products are about predicting us, without actually caring what we do or what is done to us.” -“As populations grow numb, it becomes more difficult for individuals and groups to complain.” -“[Cortana] wants to know everything about you, but it does not want you to know how much it knows [...]” -“ ‘The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.’ ” [-Mark Weiser] -“Contemporary reviewers of Kahn’s book invariably seized upon the dark ‘nightmare scenarios’ of the computerized surveillance theme, the science-fiction–like forms of control that, they assumed, ‘will be actively feared and resented by many.’ Despite the wide range of scenarios that Kahn presented in his book on the distant year 2000, Kahn’s voyage into the ‘unthinkable’ was viewed by the public as a way to prepare for ‘the worst possible outcome’ in a terrifying ‘nightmare of social controls.’ Yet now, that same nightmare is rendered as an enthusiastic progress report on surveillance capitalism’s latest triumphs.” -“[…] Google wants us to accept that its rules simply reflect the requirements of autonomous processes, something that people cannot control. However, our grasp of the inner logic of surveillance capitalism suggests otherwise. Men and women made it, and they can control it. They merely choose not to do so.” -“Many people feel that if you are not on Facebook, you do not exist. People all over the world raced to participate in Pokémon Go. With so much energy, success, and capital flowing into the surveillance capitalist domain, standing outside of it, let alone against it, can feel like a lonely and risky prospect.”"

109,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85785571-laurence-lai,1,"The title “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism” evokes a weighty subject, and the book’s subtitle purports to something menacing to the future of humankind. It is to be seen if its contents are as substantial as the book’s 700-page length would suggest.The author, Shoshana Zuboff, is a professor emerita at Harvard Business School, not unimpressive an honor by any measure. A summary of assertions made in the book is as follows:1.	Big technological colossuses (Big Techs), epitomized by Google and Facebook, operate their business models by extracting data trails of online users, and in turn selling the extrapolated results (what Zuboff calls behavioral surplus) to their advertising customers.2.	Sophisticated algorithms are deployed and constantly refined to increase the predictive value of profiling data. At the same time, online users are passively served with moderated searches, federated news feeds, suggested connections, etc., all under the coercive power of the Big Techs. Such duress is as severe as not only to affect, shape, and compel, but with the aim to modify and manipulate user behaviors.3.	With the proliferation of sensors and Internet connectivity, Big Techs extend their reach far beyond the virtual realm to the real world. Regarding the surveillance operated by these techno-capitalists, in the author’s telling, its presence so pervasive and its impact so complete that any human free agency has receded entirely to the background and is ineffective.4.	While the above are not new to anyone who has casual understanding of current economics and culture, what Zuboff strives to accentuate is their connection to high-order issues such as self, liberty, democratic values, and human nature. She compares the dangers posed by “surveillance capitalism” to that of fascism, totalitarianism, behaviorist utopianism, and the like, that once presented real or potential detriments to humanity. For its thrilling effects, the agenda for the book is sweeping, even ambitious. Technological advancement, especially one that combines deep analytics, machine intelligence, and makes its ubiquitous presence in our intimate lives deserves a dispassionate evaluation as to its social impacts. Zuboff should be applauded for selecting this timely topic for her book.Yet one cannot help but feel frustrated by the lack of thematic organization of the whole book. Instead of explicating the economics involved in this different “capitalism”, Zuboff is more concerned with weaving her own narrative of abstruse euphemisms about how grave a danger the human future is facing. Materials are regurgitated, often word for word from the earlier part of the book and throughout. As to what actions Zuboff suggests to “fight for a human future…”? The author offers an ill-defined “synthetic declaration” (p. 345), and a skimpy, equally obscure advice of “friction, courage, and bearings” (p. 524). Specifics are sorely lacking in allusions to democratic institutions, public opinion, legislative and judicial recourse (p. 520). A whimper of a solution indeed to a loud bang of such a doorstopper.Zuboff obviously sets out to intend the book as a treatise that plumbs the depth of these to her as “unprecedented” developments in “surveillance capitalism”, and attempts to compare philosophically with past phenomena its manifold menaces to humanity. But it is exactly in such philosophizing that is the weakest of the book, for her arguments are at best tenuous and strained. On the other hand, the author wily limits her subject to mostly the socio-economic domain of the Western world, as is indicated in the book’s title. The picture would have been more complete if it had combined with surveillance authoritarianism. The “social credit” system practised unimpeded in China makes only passing reference in mere 6 pages (pgs. 388-394). Certainly, the threat to human liberty and dignity is far graver when the surveillance apparatus and capability are controlled by a police state, whereas in Western democracies competition among capitalists still exists. What is most infuriating is Zuboff’s penchant for fabricating catchphrases. Smug expressions such as “dispossession”, “behavioral futures”, “cultural misappropriation”, “economy of action”, “division of learning”, “shadow text”, “uncontract”, “hive”, “coup from above”, “Big Other”, “instrumentarian power”, “right to the future tense”, “third modernity*” …., litter throughout the book. The meanings of many of these are poorly articulated. Although she attempts to provide a brief rationale to her epithetic acrobatic (p. 66), such twisting of language is unnecessary and far from successful. It is an act of throwing spaghetti upon the wall; hoping that somehow one such phrase may stick with posterity with reference made to the author. As stated, the impression appears that the writer is more interested in weaving an esoteric narrative than presenting facts. Read a typical sentence on p. 488 of the book:“No exit” is the necessary condition for Big Other to flourish, and its flourishing is the necessary condition for all that is meant to follow: the tides of behavioral surplus and their transformation into revenue, the certainty that will meet every market player with guaranteed outcomes, the bypass of trust in favor of the uncontract’s radical indifference, the paradise of effortless connection that exploits the needs of harried second-modernity individuals and transforms their lives into the means to others’ ends, the plundering of the self, the extinction of autonomous moral judgment for the sake of frictionless control, the actuation and modification that quietly drains the will to will, the forfeit of your voice in the first person in favor of others’ plans, the destruction of the social relations and politics of the old and slow and still-unfulfilled ideals of self-determining citizens bound to the legitimate authority of democratic governance.” Long sentences can be beautiful in abler literary hands, but the above is downright egregious in form and meaning. Zuboff’s writing style can be aptly depicted as beating around the bush, with hyperboles and a plethora of inapt metaphors that ill befits so serious a subject she wants to convey. At times, she relishes so much staying with her metaphoric vehicles that the intended tenors are nowhere to be found. Long, winding sentences with chained substantives also further hamper readability.So, are readers more empowered at the end “with a more cogent and comprehensive understanding” (p. 18) of the menacing incursion exerted by the Big Techs? For the newly initiated, the writing style has done more to obfuscate than to illuminate. For the more inclined and those who look for some concrete societal antidotes, Zuboff has woefully under-delivered. More clear-eyed analyses are still awaited on the technologies proffered by the Big Techs, on the associated data-driven economy, and their consequent impacts to individuals and society at-large. * cf.

113,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4679583-myles,3,"This week my company officially got into the business of surveillance. People will pay us to surveil their home and business computers to protect them from rogue computer software, from losing data resulting from defective or aging components in their computers, and from misguided management of their computers themselves.Going forward this will be a growing and lucrative business segment because people rely on their computers to do so many important things for them, because they feel inadequate keeping up with changes in the computing environment, and because they justifiably fear cyber crime.It doesn’t mean they like it. I sure don’t.Being in retail business as I have for almost 25 years I have learned how to surveil myself, to protect my assets, and my employees. It is an ongoing challenge and it changes. I surveil for shoplifters, for currency and credit card counterfeiters, for daylight and after hours thieves. I surveil for dishonest employees, for honest mistakes, for poor buying decisions, and for the obsolescence of the products on my shelves. I surveil how the bank handles my money. I surveil my suppliers to prevent them from shipping me incomplete or broken goods. And I pay attention to my customers, to save them from making poor purchasing decisions.And when I am not surveilling, I am surveying. All the time. How were my customers’ experiences? What new products are on the horizon? How can I protect my liquidity, my profitability, and lastly, my sanity.I especially surveil myself, because I make mistakes, and because I too am growing old.These are some of the risks of operating a business.Then there are the people who surveil me. They include thieves looking for a weakness in my security. Government agencies to make sure I am paying the eight or ten different taxes I pay on an ongoing basis. Credit card companies surveil my transactions to make sure somebody hasn’t stolen my credit card, or that I am spending no more money than I can afford to pay back. My suppliers make sure I am paying them on time. Some manufacturers visit me in person or electronically to make sure I am representing their product lines fairly. They send me electronic training, and tests, and they regularly measure the efficiency and quality of our repair facilities. The utilities tell me when my operations (and home) are inefficient. And there are my landlords.Finally, we surveil at home. We surveil our daughter to make sure she is doing her homework and not falling in with the wrong crowd. My wife surveils me to make sure I’m not overeating, overspending, or being overly attentive to other women. I surveil my dog Seamus just in case he poops on the neighbour’s lawn so I can pick it up before someone notices. And Seamus surveils the front window and barks whenever a neighbouring dog saunters by. Last and not least are the gargantuan corporations who are watching what I do online. People like facebook, Google, amazon, and many, many more.So when somebody writes a book to tell me I live in an Age of Surveillance Capitalism...I GET IT! REALLY, I GET IT!But is it uniquely capitalist, or more generally an age of surveillance?And if it is more general to our society, where do we go from here?One thing for sure: it isn’t going away anytime soon.Shoshana Zuboff concentrates her guns on Google and facebook. She’s concerned that these companies are inherently different from the companies that came before it and they set a new standard for egregious capitalism. They are companies in the prediction business, predicting human behaviour and right now largely predicting purchasing behaviour by accumulating, as she called it, “surplus behaviour,” which kinda sounds like an oxymoron. She believes they abuse the freedoms of the marketplace to frustrate privacy, that they are built to enrich few and sidestep the traditional workplace which pays many employees fairly and creates consumers, and she argues that they are indifferent to social ills.She argues that Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” doesn’t operate in this marketplace because the new knowledge capitalists know everything happening in the market.A close reading of Andrew Carnegie’s life and legacy, perhaps John D. Rockefeller as well, could lead you to a similar conclusion, even though both men turned to philanthropy later in life. For sure, these men affected the course of capitalism.Is this a turn away from “good” capitalism toward an inherently evil capitalism?And if it is evil, can we create some rules for the big guys that us little guys can live with?Let’s take a step back and look at things in context: Google’s revenue is about $25 billion, Facebook’s $17 billion. The entire US economy is about $25 trillion and the world economy upwards of $107 trillion. Most of Google’s and Facebook’s revenue is advertising. The US advertising market is upwards of $80 billion so it is fair to say these two firms command quite strong positions in this industry. If you make the argument that America’s advertising industry is too concentrated then you’d have a pretty good argument to break up these firms which combined represent about 50% of all advertising dollars in the US. By comparison, Standard Oil at its peak commanded 88% of the market for processing crude. In its first year of operation, US Steel produced 67% of steel produced the the US.And they exhibit the classic behaviour of monopolists by dominating the markets for search and for social media on a global scale.In the US a case for breaking up the firms traditionally would have to be made that consumers are paying too much for their services or that competitors are being kept out of the market. Maybe breaking up these firms is a good idea, maybe it isn’t, but either way the technologies they employ for gathering, and analyzing, data isn’t going away.When I worked as an auditor, we used to gather lots of data, too, but what we eventually learned was that we could make assumptions about its meaning by sampling the information; that is, we cut down our work by only looking at some of the data. We tried to cut down on the wasted time. I sometimes wonder how much of what Google does is a total waste of time because the answers it seeks can be found in much faster time using much less data. And how much of “Big Data” is in fact a “Big Waste of Time.”Zuboff doesn’t consider that these firms may still be just in the early stages of figuring out what they are supposed to be doing. I think about it because so much time and resources are wasted paying attention to wholly irrelevant stuff.But we would do well to consider the affect of these companies on our freedoms and our government partially because they aren’t just national problems. They are transnational problems. What happens in China, and the extreme kind of surveillance practiced there on ethnic minorities like the Uigers, affects or will affect us here.They are transnational because the data collection is transnational and the very same data collected for the purpose of selling advertising is probably being used to develop artificial intelligence. The fastest developer of AI whether they be Chinese companies, transnational companies like Google or Facebook, or companies directly financed by government will have a big say in who has a job in the coming years and who doesn’t.No country on its own can hope to curb data collection and aggregation or perhaps more importantly, the control of what search results reveal on this scale any more than a country can curb money laundering, tax avoidance, or climate change without coordination between many if not all nations. Contemporary politics seems to be going in the opposite direction if Trump’s “America First,” Brexit, and Russian adventurism are any indication. If we are divided and our attention fractured we are susceptible to the influence or real or imagined “experts.” (To firms like Facebook I think we all have ADD, attention deficit disorder...they can never get enough of our attention!) That doesn’t mean we cannot continue to make decisions affecting our government, it more likely means that the decisions we make will more commonly resemble the imperatives of those desiring more of the same, read: the status quo.And that turns us to the question of how good is the status quo. If you believe that the universe ultimately bends toward the dilution of energy, total entropy, then the status quo is not too good. If you believe the status quo to be a teleological evolution toward a great singularity, perhaps a union with God, and a progression toward greater complexity in the universe, the status quo looks pretty good.Business executives, in my experience, tend to be of the more optimistic latter type of people. Like the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world and other people who have become incredibly wealthy in a short period of time.In the meantime, some of us have rather pedestrian concerns like the security of really private information. While convincingly arguing that there is insufficient transparency over who handles the big data and how they handle it, I think Zuboff fails to sufficiently weigh immense risk that the data will fall out of control of the aggregators and into the hands of rogue individuals.The hacking of credit card databases is one thing, and I think it a bigger risk than the hacking of a database which tells people how I like my hotdogs dressed. People made a big deal of the Cambridge Analytica scare. In the end, those people sold bogus claims to naive political organizations. The data predicted nothing and was of no use to anybody. And it didn’t get Donald Trump elected.Certainly big data aggregation has concrete effects on the economy. You get “free” Google searches. I get a cheaper smart TV because the data guys get first dibs on my TV watching preferences.This book is not the best guide for the good works these technologies enable (ie crowd sourcing, scientific research, epidemiology, etc). Self-driving cars benefit by machine learning. The acceleration and reductions in the friction in electronic commerce are generally good things.I don’t agree with Zuboff that the behavioural science behind the new data aggregation firms promotes a radical indifference to the lot of the common person. Nor do I agree that hyperscale doesn’t require competitive markets or for that matter democracy.This has yet to be proven.We all need participatory democracy, and more than ever on a global scale. Let’s make these damn machines work for us, not agin us."
114,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26854448-m-a,5,"This is a brilliant and important book about the future of mankind.It is unfortunately very difficult to read, due not only to the complexity of the subject matter, but also due to the constant use by the author of jargon and long complicated sentences. This is very ironic, considering that this book is intended as a warning and a call to action to the general public against the machinations of the Surveillance Capitalist elite. I can only hope that a more accessible version of this book will be published to accomplish that goal.Zuboff claims that surveillance capitalism is as big a change for our society as industrial capitalism was more than two centuries ago.It all started with Google, followed closely by Facebook, Microsoft and eventually by all digital industries.Google started collecting our private data (from our search terms on Google search, to our emails on Gmail, to our location data on Google Maps, our data stored on our Android devises etc..) without our knowledge or consent and turning them into predictions about our future behavior, which they sold for profit to marketers.Zuboff calls Google ""privacy kleptomaniacs"". She compares Google to the Spanish conquistadores invading the natives on the American continent and declaring the continent theirs by a monarchical edict declaring it so. So did Google invade our private data by declaring it theirs through obscure unilaterally imposed terms of service.She calls this data, the new raw material of capitalism ""Behavioral Surplus"".She traces the architecture of this new form of capitalism from its supply routes to its ""behavioral futures markets"".The production of digital data has far outpaced the human capacity to process/make sense of that data.Therefore, behavioral psychologists and data scientists have created algorithms to predict an individual's future behavior based on the billions of raw data of his/her every move and every thought.They use the 5 factor personality model, the 6 emotion model, affective computing, emotional analytics and sentiment analysis to predict our personalities and our future behavior.Surveillance Capitalists are prediction factories, based on raw materials from us.Google and co don't sell the raw data, they sell behavioral predictions based on that data.That information is not only useful to marketers, but to anyone with an interest in that knowledge and an interest in influencing that future behavior.Some examples of benefits of knowing a person's future behavior with very great accuracy include: predicting disease, financial risk, criminal risk, consumer preferences and political views. This knowledge about the future allows corporations to eliminate all risks in their business dealings.Zuboff calls this predictive data the ""shadow text"".This shadow text is only available to surveillance capitalists through their data extractions and algorithms.It is about us but not for us.Us being unaware of the surveillance is the precondition for surveillance capitalism to function properly- we are to remain unaware of the shadow text. Even if raw data are shared with us, the shadow data crafted for prediction purposes is not accessible to us.Remote digital observation and tele-stimulation ( the ""god view"") allows for distancing of the observed as ""the other"".Zuboff calls the Surveillance Capitalists the ""Big Other"".""The market reduces us to our behavior, transformed into another fictional commodity and packaged for others' consumption"" We are to be monitored and tele stimulated.Zuboff demonstrates how surveillance capitalism has expanded beyond cyberspace into our everyday life.Even the human body is treated as a computer, containing data in order to provide corporations certainty of profit.Take wearables for example: they form an unobtrusive integration to everyday life- internet connected fabrics, fitness trackers, diabetes apps etc.Zuboff quotes a study that shows that apps downloaded on a smart phone extract location data, contact lists, photos & videos etc without express consent of the user and that they sell this data to third parties.According to Zuboff, these companies' privacy policies should be called ""surveillance policies"".She predicts we will all end up with chips in our bodies for better surveillance, like animals. Telemetry is already used on animals to study their behavior. Humans will be next.We are already tracked in our cars, in our homes, in our kidneys (dialysis devices).By 2020, there will be 20 billion intelligent devices with the capability of tracking and monitoring us.Zuboff calls whatever data that is not yet tracked ""dark data"". Surveillance Capitalists are intent on tracking all behavior that is not (yet) informatized.They want to monetize every aspect of our lives, the entire human experience. They want to turn our entire life into profit for themselves.Power was once identified with the ownership of the means of production.Now power rests in the ownership of the means of behavioral prediction and behavioral modification of the other. Now our lives are turned into data without our knowledge or consent in order to benefit others.Zuboff explains how the system of Surveillance Capitalism is grounded in behavioral psychology.The goal of behaviorism is the prediction and control of behavior- the human being is nothing but an organism, an ""it"". According to behaviorists a human is in essence no different than a mushroom, only a bit more complex.Behaviorists (eg Skinner and Pentland) believe humans have no freedom of will, no autonomy, no agency. Freedom of will is an illusion. It is the environment that controls behavior. Individual behavior is caused by variables lying outside the individual himself.Hence the belief by behaviorists that behavioral control can lead to predicting future behavior with scientific accuracy. Behavior must be studied w/o limits and w/o knowledge of the ""organism"".Privacy is an illusion just like freedom- they must be forfeited in favor of the good life.BUT this view was meant to benefit all of humanity; the knowledge gained through behavioral tracking was to be used to improve human behavior towards a better future for humanity: fighting disease, crime, poverty etc..Instead, behaviorism has been hijacked by surveillance capitalism to benefit only the small class of surveillance capitalists and their customers. The lost freedom only affects us but the acquired knowledge and profit is all theirs.What are the dangers of Surveillance Capitalism?The more one knows about a person, the easier it is to control him.Besides being used for targeted marketing, knowledge of personal data can also be used to blackmail, defame, harass and discriminate against us.The dangers lie not only in corporate surveillance itself and the accompanying loss of privacy, but even more worrisome, in corporate mind manipulation and corporate behavioral modification, such as the creation of conformity and obedience but also the creation of desires that benefit commerce and emotions that benefit politicians. Surveillance capitalists wants ALL of you- your behavior, your thoughts, your emotions, your personality- so they can manipulate your behavior. Will you have any autonomy, any free will left? Surveillance Capitalism is not only a danger to privacy, but a danger to democracy which depends on autonomous moral judgment and individual determination and free will. Zuboff believes in free will as the basis for individuality, self determination, and the right to decide our future (She calls it ""The right to the future tense"").The right to be one's author of one's future should be cast as a human right-necessary because it is imperiled by ""the panvasive digital architecture of behavioral modification owned and operated by surveillance capital, necessitated by its economic imperatives and driven by its laws of motion, all for the sake of its guaranteed outcomes""Will Google, FB and co. lead to digital totalitarianism? According to Zuboff the answer is no, because the past offers no adequate compass for this new phenomenon.Zuboff calls the future of Surveillance Capitalism ""Instrumentarianism"".Totalitarianism, as impersonated by Hitler and Stalin was only understood after the facts. It entails the destruction of all human ties except total loyalty to the movement (fascism or communism). It operates through the means of violence, terror and fear- all who do not conform, the enemies of the ""people"", are executed.Instrumentarianism behaves through the means of behavioral modification.And, unlike in a totalitarian regime, there is no need to use force . All you need is adequate human engineering.""Instrumentarianism"" is a behaviorally controlled society, in which knowledge replaces freedom. In such a society, social change can be generated by social pressure from social networks to ""go with the flow, stay with the herd, return to the hive and take flight with the flock"". Identity yields to synchrony.Such a society leads to the death of individuality. The collective intelligence knows best and individuality is only unnecessary friction towards that goal.Instrumentarian society with its architecture of behavioral control, social pressure and asymmetrical power is a Panopticon - there is no exit possible.Once it was believed that there is no exit from an all knowing and all powerful God.Under Instrumentarianism, there will be no exit from the others, big other and the surveillance capitalists. Big Other knows no boundaries.Zuboff pleads for the right to sanctuary.It is a universal need for a safe refuge, for shelter.This right is as ancient as human history; originally it manifested itself in the form of a city, or a temple. Later on this right extended to the home: a sanctuary from arbitrary intrusion. Psychologists agree that this is important for development of the self and for mental health. With Big Other, the Universe takes up residence within our walls, there is no refuge. (thinkof internet connected security cameras, light switches, thermostats, appliances, rumbas, wearables,smart phones, tooth brushes, beds, personal assistants, TVs, toys,etc etc).What solution does Zuboff propose to avert the coming Instrumentarian Society?To just stop using the internet and internet connected devices?Surveillance Capitalists offer solutions to social connection, access to information, time saving convenience and ""illusionary"" support and this got us all addicted. It is not reasonable to expect us to go off the grid.Privacy regulation and monopoly regulation is inefficient at combating those risks- it will not be solved by encryption, anonymization or discussion of data ownership. This is a new condition that outruns the law, that has not been tamed by law. Zuboff discusses very briefly the new regulatory regime operating in the EU since May 2018, the GDPR ( General Data Protection Regulation). The GDPR is a good step forward, but only time will tell if it will be efficient in vanquishing surveillance capitalism's instrumentarian power. The individual is powerless against the surveillance capitalist machine because of asymmetrical power and knowledge. Only collective action on the ground, such as class actions, will determine if GDPR will be effective.Regulators will be up against well funded corporate lawyers and lobbyists.Zuboff concludes that Surveillance Capitalism is profoundly anti democratic. It is a market coup from above on the people. It is a form of tyranny, of absolutism; it imposes its rules from above; everyone except the tyrant is just an organism, the ""other one"", to be exploited for the profit of the tyrant.Industrial revolution has led to near destruction of our planet and extinction of many species. Instrumentarianism will lead to extinction of our individuality.Zuboff points to the critical role of public opinion on changing the laws. She proclaims passionately:It is NOT ok to strip search us for profit.It is a human expectation to be the author of one's life.There is still time to redirect the action to a future that we can call home.It is our responsibility to right was has gone wrong.We have to be indignant because this is an attack on human dignity.Freedom from uncertainty is no freedom.She refuses to seed the future to illegitimate power.She demands a human future.She calls the world to action to declare the digital future to be a human future."
115,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42693079-ryan-o-neill,4,"This ambitious and expansive book aims to define and explain the rise of surveillance capitalists like Google, Facebook and Microsoft as they play ever larger roles in our lives. Shoshana Zuboff briefly maps out the history of some of these companies and delves into the way in which they gradually encroach on our lives in ever more frightening ways.She argues persuasively that while sometimes driven by old capitalist imperatives, these companies represent a break from past eras such as that of industrial capitalism as they secretly and aggressively gather increasing amounts of personal information from us, but not for our benefit; rather than the traditional business-customer reciprocities, surveillance capitalists plunder every element of our lives, both online and offline, for the benefit of advertisers, and ultimately serve their economic benefit.Under surveillance capitalism, we are no longer the customers (although practices are often disguised under the auspices of 'personalisation') but rather our searches, browsing history, friends, likes, reactions, emotions and feelings are raw materials to be scraped for the benefit of companies who are free to operate outside the boundaries of traditional democracy and regulation. Our rights are ruthlessly and carelessly cast aside and rendered obsolete in this relentless pursuit of behavioural surplus without which surveillance capitalists cannot grow.These companies encroach upon our personal space in ever more intrusive ways - from the original Google Street View controversy in the mid-2000s to Facebook's hidden methods of gleaning info on our preferences, to TVs that listen to you, wearable devices, Alexa house alarms and even toys that listen to you, to the fight for our car dashboards. The speed and aggression is such that after initial outrage, we are worn down, helpless and numbed, resigned to our fate.Surveillance capitalism, Zuboff argues, attempts to create certainty of outcome for its actual customers - its advertisers. This is done by parsing human behaviour, exploiting feelings, emotions and beliefs even when we don't permit it to, so that our individual freedom, our rights to define our own experience, and to act and think in private are eroded as we are continuously moulded and directed towards specific courses of action by these companies. The inherent uncertainty that exists within how we think, how we act and interact - our right to an effective life - is replaced by collective certainty at the hands of surveillance capitalism.Zuboff also mines the effects of social media on young people's development. As they journey from being defined by their relationships at a young age to becoming separate from but connected to others in adulthood, young people are adversely affected by social media and its imperatives to forcing people to see themselves 'from the outside in' and define themselves based on the experiences and lives of others. The pervasiveness of social media means people often struggle to disconnect, their mental health even suffering from brief separation from their accounts. This crucially and savagely inhibits their ability to look inward and make that journey from people defined by their relationships in youth, to autonomous individuals who have relationships in adulthood.Zuboff argues that while the advent of new laws such as GDPR in Europe have been helpful, surveillance capitalism's overall success in evading proper regulation and legal scrutiny means that decisive action will depend on a turning of public opinion. Lots of us are passive about our distrust of social media, but it will take a re-establishment of indignation, a renewal of outrage, if we are to have any chance of stemming the flow.The book is a heavy undertaking; more than 500 pages long and often written in rather academic prose, and it can occasionally be quite dense and abstract. Given the ubiquity of technology in all of our lives, it could undoubtedly be more reader-friendly, and perhaps focus on more real-life examples that we are all familiar with. Despite its wealth of information, Xuboff's proposed solutions are vague, and it is arguably unclear what exactly you as an individual can do personally to reduce the insidious influence of surveillance capitalism in your everyday life; what strategies can be used to repell Facebook from building a strong profile based on your preferences, for example? Is there a feasible path to effective life without being on Facebook?Furthermore, it would have been helpful to have some more analysis on the gathering of information not related to economics - the how and why of information kept either by governments or corporations on citizens for reasons not linked to monetary benefits.Nevertheless, this is a hugely informative, well researched and important book on a subject which, as the author herself notes, is a story still unfolding and which still has some way to run. It's likely that many updates and more reader-friendly analyses on surveillance capitalism will follow, but this is a fantastic launch-pad for one of the defining issues of our time."
116,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45700308-tanmay-srivastava,1,"Shoshana Zuboff's book was highly recommended, was part of multiple lists and had glowing reviews on Goodreads. I was quite excited to pick it up and start reading.  Without calling it out, Zuboff treats incremental technological progress as a zero sum game. A win for the tech companies is a loss to someone. Take, for example when Zuboff talks about connected cars . She says an insurance company can stall a car if the premiums are not paid. She beats up this argument and brings up a case of how an elderly couple had to choose between car payments and medicine, which came to light only when the collection officers turned up at the door. A crowdfunding campaign was launched to help them and it had a happy ending. Using software however would have meant that this would have never happened. She fails to recognize that her example is the exception and not the norm. She chooses to ignore the positive impact connected cars would have on say, cars getting stolen going down leading to lower premiums or reduced premiums for drivers using their cars less or rewarding good drivers by reducing their premiums. Maybe, with such technological advances premiums would fall to such an extent that the couple wouldn't have to worry about premium payments altogether? She fails to acknowledge that progress is not a zero sum game. Tech companies have been bashed quite a bit through the book. There is no nod of appreciation for the positive impact they have had on societies. Here, In India - products of these tech companies are helping small businesses make moves that wouldn't have been possible before. Expensive POS Machines have been skipped (the same way how landlines didn't make it to parts of India but mobile phones did) in favor of Google Pay (QR Codes for Bank to Bank transfers). Book keeping doesn't required expensive licenses and can be managed online. Whatsapp is used to sell/communicate/deliver orders. YouTube is a learning platform for many, and a medium for news outside of the traditional media. The jobs these tech companies have created in India, directly and indirectly, also cannot be overlooked. There's a section where Zuboff talks about fake news and its impact on Brexit and the 2016 US Election. While I do agree fake news is a very big issue, the issue of voter discretion cannot be overlooked. In Zadie Smith's essay on Brexit -  ""Fences""  she writes how someone voted one way in referendum to get rid of the health secretary. Would it have been different if it was not targeted to a particular group (via the likes of Cambridge Analytica)? Would the results of Brexit and the 2016 US Election have been the same if there was no Facebook? Are we giving these incidents more importance than they deserve? ""Who knows?"" - I don't. I don't think we can ever conclusively state yes or no. The biggest issue is that a lot of topics covered in the book are in the grey area. Is it okay to give someone hungry a burger from McDonald's? The burger will make sure that they don't go hungry, but it's not a healthy meal. Can they afford to have a healthy meal? Can they stay hungry? Is there a way to grow healthy food to feed everyone? Is there a way to make everyone want/enjoy the healthy food? This sort of reasoning should have been the core of the book. You cannot do without technology companies today. Google, Microsoft, Facebook are essential parts of our day to day lives. Is there a business model where these companies can make enough money to create products that add value without compromising on data to drive revenue? Is there a market for people to pay for their services without any data getting collected? Do people bother to dig deep in their account settings to switch off optional data collection? Do people care? I feel the book is not asking the right questions needed to drive policy discussions. Data privacy is an important topic. The book is well researched in parts but jumps into pages of wishful thinking. The conclusions drawn are biased. The facts are presented in a way to scare you, and similar to how likes are garnered on social media with scary/angry posts, this book has scared people into giving it 5 stars on Goodreads. I wish this book was not one sided as it was - Not recommended."
117,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27470888-cool-breeze,1,"The subject of this book is very important. Unfortunately, this book fails miserably at contributing anything useful to the discussion. It is mind-numbingly long at 691 pages and an ordeal to read. Zuboff takes a few observations on surveillance technology issues and uses pretentious academic jargon to fluff them into this execrable doorstop of a book. The book does not offer any practical solutions to the issues she raises. A good editor could have reduced this to a pamphlet or a web article without leaving much notable out.This is possibly the worst non-fiction book I have ever read. I dreaded resuming it every time I picked it up and finally abandoned it on page 158. If I should ever be stuck on a desert island with only this book for reading material, I will be thankful at least that I have an abundant supply of toilet paper.Zuboff is a sociologist and the language she employs is tortured and tedious in the extreme. She insists on coining lots of neologisms and wallowing in her jargon. Amusingly, her favorite term is Behavioral Surplus, or BS for short. The book could have saved countless pages if she reduced a lot of her BS to abbreviations. Perhaps such Heideggerian writing impresses her academic colleagues, but it is excruciating for the average reader. She beats her core points to death – within the first 100 pages she must have repeated some version of the following point dozens of times – ‘the user isn’t the customer, nor are they the product, they are the raw material that is used to create the product’. You could have cut many more pages by limiting this point to three repetitions. It is as if she thinks her readers are idiots, or else she has dementia and doesn’t remember what she wrote a page or two ago. Even worse, Zuboff is a Luddite and a hard-core leftist. She obviously thinks the Industrial Revolution was largely a disaster. On page 11, she writes “industrial civilization… threatens to cost us the earth”. By page 12, she is hyperventilating “The industrial legacy of climate chaos fills us with dismay, remorse and fear”. No, it doesn’t. The reason Trump is President and the US has repudiated stupid climate treaties is that so many American voters think this is a non-issue or a very low priority (#18 out of 19 in a recent survey). On page 22, she writes that she has been inspired by a rogues' gallery of leftists, including Karl Marx, Theodor Adorno, Jean-Paul Sartre and Thomas Piketty (Robert Reich and Rachel Carson, who is responsible for millions of deaths, are also mentioned favorably). On page 33, she likens her great-grandparents fleeing the oppression of 1908 Russia to the oppression of the nuclear family (you poor, fragile snowflake!). On page 38 she viciously criticizes Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, although she admits their policies pulled the country out of the stagflation and “malaise” of the Jimmy Carter years. Unbelievably, Zuboff apparently thinks airline deregulation was a bad thing. On page 42, she is writes approvingly of rioters in London (she really should read some Theodore Dalrymple on the real problems involved) and the dilettante, astroturf Occupy “movement”. On page 43, she comments disapprovingly on those who would “pare regulations, cut taxes… and shrink entitlements”. Heaven forbid that anyone should want to take an ax to the leviathan state! By page 109, she is bemoaning the Supreme Court’s rejection of restrictions on political speech, “hate speech” (meaning anything she and her politically correct brethren disagree with), pornography (yeah, she’s puritanical as well as a Luddite) and free association. What a pinch-faced scold!Only at this point does she admit that her arch-villain, Google, has been totally in bed with the left-wing Obama administration, using their surveillance technology to mastermind his two Presidential campaigns and running a revolving door operation with 258 employees moving between Google and the Obama regime. Whoops! How inconvenient! It’s almost like leftism and this creepy surveillance technology go hand in hand! Curiously, in a 691-page book, the word “Clinton” does not appear even once in the 26-page index! I wonder who was President from 1996 to 2001, Google’s first five years? Or who was Hillary’s biggest corporate campaign contributor? It is a complete mystery, according to this book. Zuboff doesn’t actually appear to be a Clinton fan, so maybe she just doesn’t want to wind up adding to the Arkancide body count like Jeffrey Epstein.Zuboff must have felt terrible about documenting the extent of Obama’s collusion with Google’s abuses, because within a few pages she is back to bashing mainstream conservative organizations such as the Federalist Society, Heritage Action, Americans for Tax Reform and the Cato Institute as “Far Right”. Anyone to the right of Marx, Lenin and Mao is apparently “Far Right” to Zuboff.Chapter 5 elaborates Googles expanding abuses from 2009-2016. The Europeans attempt some pushback, but the US is feckless or oblivious. Just who controlled the government that was supposed to be preventing such abuses during this time? Zuboff couldn’t possibly guess, even if you spotted her an O, B and M. During this period, Zuboff’s Harvard Business School colleagues ride to the defense of Yelp, perhaps the only tech company more loathsome than Google.Strangely, Zuboff admits there were a number of potentially effective policy fixes being seriously considered in the years before 9/11. Why not revive those ideas and build a political coalition of like-minded classical-liberals, libertarians, small-government conservatives and Trump supporters (the tech giants being no friends of Trump) to implement them? She points out that the national security agencies are obstacles. Well, after Brennan, Comey, Holder and Lynch, a lot of people on the right need no further persuasion that the FBI, CIA and the rest of the Deep State are utterly corrupt rogue agencies. Zuboff doesn’t appear to consider this a possibility. I guess working with those icky right wingers is completely out of the question. Even worse, such allies are never going to go along with replacing the tech elite with the “benevolent” socialist dictatorship of Zuboff and her Harvard faculty elite. As it turns out, Zuboff’s problem is not so much with the creepy technology, it is that the creepy technology is not under the control of “enlightened” leftists like her and her comrades in academia and government.That was as much as I could take. I skimmed the book for any sign of practical solutions in the pages to come and, finding none, I abandoned the book on page 158.I agree with Zuboff that the tech giants represent a grave threat. However, if her prescription of more government and more socialism is the only alternative, I guess I will just have to find ways to live with it. The only thing worse than surveillance capitalism is surveillance statism run by socialist do-gooder “elites” like Zuboff, who always think they know better and want to engage in social engineering. Do you think the Chinese people would prefer annoying Google ads or their oppressive and ubiquitous social credit scores? The only people I would less like to see in control of this technology than Page, Brin and Zuckerberg are Zuboff and her comrades.In the nearer term, there are still practical steps one can take to mitigate the problem. Don’t use Google products. Use DuckDuckGo for search. Don’t use Gmail or Chrome. Use a good ad blocker, like AdBlockPlus on all devices. Don’t buy creepy surveillance technology like Nest, Ring or Alexa. Delete your Facebook account. Don’t use Twitter, it’s a surveillance sewer. Don’t buy from Amazon or use their products or services, especially the Washington Post. Don’t buy from Apple or use their products or services. Use Linux if that is viable for you or lock down you Windows privacy settings, if not. Check your app setting and cut them back to only those necessary to function. Don’t use non-essential apps like games, many of which are bad offenders.Support the breakup of the tech giants using antitrust laws. Support their prosecution for anti-competitive and anti-privacy violations. Having Page, Brin, Zuckerberg and Bezos doing some serious hard time would have a very salutary effect “pour encourager les autres”. Institute real and legally-binding privacy protections such as Zuboff mentions and dismisses. Yes, we will have to do it without the support of Zuboff and her comrades, but Trump’s upcoming second term could be a real opportunity to get this done (I think Zuboff’s head may have just exploded)."
118,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65435043-alan-tennyson,5,"I pored over this book, stayed with the words. Read and reread them. Drank deeply from their wisdom.  It was not an easy read, but ultimately it gave far more than it took. The Age of Surveillance Capitalism is a seminal text for our age. Zuboff's account of surveillance capitalism is elegant, poised and persuasive. Yet for all her brilliance, Shonanna's central thesis suffers some fundamental flaws.  Where The Age is at it's strongest is in the articulation of surveillance capitalism. Consider this, 'Who owns your face?', 'Who owns your behaviour?' What you do, where you go, who you know, all this has value and extracting value from these data is the business model of the surveillance capitalist.  But this is only the description, where Zuboff's account takes a darker turn, is in control. Once Surveillance Capitalists have provided a description of you, the next logical step is to determine how much this description can be used to predict and control you. Zuboff's account of these processes is beautifully rendered in perfect proses.  Know thyself, unless you don't like what you find, then, deny thyself, and pretend you are other. Zuboff goes for the latter.  We are born of this place, this pale blue dot, we are natural phenomena. Yet despite these self-evident truths, many continue to advance the notion that we apes are exceptional.  We are somehow other than the mere organisms with whom we share our earth and almost our entire genetic structure. Zuboff takes issue with humans being described as 'mere organisms'.  She is caged by this ideology of human exceptionalism, and it weakens her thesis considerably.  There are sacred cows here, and sacred cows will invariably be slaughtered.  The first heifer into the meat factory is autonomy. Shoshana strips us of our relations, our context and connections. She exalts 'autonomy' but fails to grapple with the weakness of the presumptions it contains. This leads her to assert that humans are and ought to be autonomous.  But Zuboff fails to address that we are born free, but everywhere in chains. From the traffic light to the electric chair, we are already in a context that seeks to control our behaviour. What does she think education and justice are? If not systems of changing our behaviour? But it's more than this, it's a scientific reality, we are our contexts, our environment, they shape us as we shape them.  This is a reality that an insistence on 'Freedom' cannot wish away.   For me, the issue is not that we are organisms', we are.  It is not that we are miraculous rational deities, we are not.  We need to embrace our human frailty, stare it down since we are wiser for this knowledge.  Here again, Zuboff takes issues with what she calls the 'ideology of human frailty'.  Respectfully I would ask that we,  put down our pride and look hard in the mirror, human frailty is not an ideology, it is a fundamental truth. We are 'mere organisms' and to claim anything else is to cling to a pernicious ideology. An ideology that has prompted human dominion over earth and animals, and all the ecological genocide that follows."

In fact, in a time like this I wish there was a more complex rating system than 5 stars. I digress.This was, in many ways, the first of its kind. There have, in my view, yet to be too many intelligent take downs of the dangers of big data. There is,of course, a brief mentioning of the a similar subject in many other modern texts - but not to this degree.So, you ask, what the hell is surveillance capitalism. It is, a term coined by the author. She first presented the concept publicly in 2014, in an article, where she described it as such :""[surveillance capitalism is a] radically dissembled and extractive variant of information capitalism"" based on the commodification of ""reality"" and its transformation into behavioral data for analysis and sales""*---- IN this book she presents the story of how it is that we have gotten to such a point in history, where the sentence in her 2014 article could even be spoken. In this she gives a small run down of facebook and google, and explains the origins of these sights in relation to their users. User-ship on these web pages began without much craziness, but as we all know many pages which were once small e.g. facebook, google, and youtube have more or less all become huge power houses of influence. They have now followings in the billions. This is presently praised by these web pages as a good thing. Initially. well. The servers couldn't take it. There was too much damn data. And its all so useless.Or is it?It was, with this question, in the eyes of zuboff, that this form of capitalism** was born. The data not only need not be an annoyance, but it could be a pathway towards making money. 'Perhaps', these tech giants thought 'we could predict the users behaviors by paying attention to the patterns in data'. Alas. we are truly all creatures of habit. Long story short. A great deal of people in the industrial world are using certain pages on the internet in ways that are useful for targeting for sales. This of course can eventually be sold to governments blah blah blah. Ask yourself. are you ok with people predicting your behaviors to increase user experience? What about to protect you? What about to just watch you?These are questions the book will make you reflect on.Overall, I think this was one of the most apropos books I have read in awhile towards understanding some issues in modernity.86/100 stars.Recommended for:Those thinking about big data in its prediction of human behaviorthose who dont trust facebook and googlethose worried about internet privacythose thinking about the future path of society*Hey guess what.

Market and industrial capitalism are declining, long live surveillance capitalism say the social media giants, in whose tentacles it is we, rather than any thing useful for us as humans, who are grasped .It’s a bit long and at times repetitive, like Das Kapital, but it’s not really a criticism of the book, as the amount of research and work Zuboff must have done to produce this dizzying analysis of the current state of digital technology and its impact on us, is breathtaking. It’s the resistance to surveillance capitalism’s imperatives that she leaves as the challenge for society at the end of the book... How is that done when we hunger so much for its crumbs and are so addicted to the precision targeting of its algorithms?"

The argument is blind to how Big Tech's surveillance is merely the most recent and sophisticated manifestation of capitalism's inherent drive to extract value; advertising and media companies have for centuries made a business of surveillance and control. But acknowledging that continuity would deflate the book's sensationalism, and undermine its premise that, before Big Tech, the only threat to liberalism was state power, and not also that of capital."
129,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89255731-mark-walker,5,"This book will boil your blood. Supported by extensive empirical research, Professor Shoshana Zuboff exposes the effective digital implementation of the late B. F. Skinner's Beyond Freedom and Dignity. It centers around three related factors: The distribution of knowledge: “Who knows?” Authority: “Who decides who knows?” and Power: “Who decides who decides who knows?” (Hint: it's not you). Orders of magnitude beyond just tracking cookies and the creepy anticipation of your interests by entities such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook, the new instrumentarianism is used by surveillance capitalists to control not just what you buy but also what you think about and how you think it. This is not even the theoretical Capitalism of Friedman, Hayek, or Adam Smith, as there is no equality of individual choice in it. In other words there's no free market here, as surveillance capitalists deliberately orchestrate your life for their benefit irrespective of yours. Thus it's not a fair trade; there is no reciprocity in the conveniences you think you receive from even the simplest transactions. You are not their customers (or even the ""product"" as in the cliché); their customers are the people purchasing the information harvested about you, which is extracted without your awareness. In this digital realm, it is as if you are the third world country having your natural resources extracted for the exclusive profits of foreign capitalists. Another clear analogy is we are like chickens being farmed for our eggs: they feed us with incentives, not for our well-being but so that we will lay more eggs to go into omelets not for us. You and your personal information are only the objects, the ""Other,"" that are for sale for the benefit of people who are not you. The key feature of all of this is that willingness is irrelevant, as we are unknowing and thus unwitting participants. Their salient objective is the obscene profits garnered from not just your profiles and posts, but the shadow text that you don't see from the fusion of the backscatter data about you that is harvested into separate secret databases. They actively hide that they have this information on you, as their modus operandi requires that you not be aware of it for this process to be successful. Much of this activity is beyond the reach of laws and courts, as the surveillance capitalists would just go underground with their operations if regulations were imposed. It is accompanied by an acceleration of the deliberate assault on democracy through lobbying and revolving door employment between government and the commercial interests that control it. Thus just voting for politicians that promise to tame surveillance capitalism will be of insufficient effect. Zuboff offers hope and some thoughts on what to do about it. European history has shown that when the people have had enough of oppression, they join together to rebel, as when the Berlin Wall came down without resistance from the guards. A similar event must occur today to escape the glass walls of the hive surveillance capitalists have put us in for the purpose of harvesting and orchestrating even our most personal thoughts, all for their profit and not ours. We need walls of our own, not to keep us in their hive, but to keep them out of our personal sanctuary. Public opinion is key to taming this monster. In the end if enough of the public rose up against surveillance capitalism, possibly by throwing its shadow text in disarray and diminishing its value, the money and influence behind it would then be of little effect. There is hope if humans would willingly help each other to the extent that surveillance capitalists take without asking. Then the world would be a much friendlier and more prosperous place for everyone. and not just the few."
130,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6192529-frieda-vizel,3,"The writing was a big problem for me. Sometimes, instead of relying on strong arguments, it relied on absurdly hyperbolic language. For instance, I didn’t feel like she explained clearly enough why monetizing our data is bad - say, because how it’s been destroying “the forth estate” that needs to constantly run after the clicks, or how our data is used to manipulate us to consume-consume-consume, to the detriment of the planet. Instead she went on for a while about our right to the “will to will” and a lot about how bad BF Skinner was. Maybe if I understood behaviorism better I’d have felt it as strongly as she seemed to, but I just didn’t feel like I totally got that whole part. Maybe that’s me.Speaking of Skinner, she seems to be of the school of public intellectualism that is very focused on individual actors instead of on the system. So she goes on a lot about the bad guys of our predicament, Skinner but also of course Zuck, the Google founders, the guy at Microsoft who didn’t seem to be extraordinarily villainous at all. Here’s where this type of focus in the individual derails us: it leads Zuboff to think that these people created the problems, and not the system. But actually, so long as the law allows for folks to make money by manipulating the masses, there will always be a sociopath to sink his teeth in. That’s why the problem is the system and that needs to be fixed. And Zuboff does argue for that - it’s just that she weakens her argument by being so focused on these insatiable idiot vampires. But all that is quibbling and frustration. The important take-away from the book is that it stakes the solution within the law. It does not fall for the “freedom of speech” idiocy, an argument mounted by economic interest as a way to stop the entire legal system from functioning as it should. Since when can’t we have laws? Since when is it tyranny for the government to create limits and parameters as a way of ensuring a healthy society? Since the tech companies have been telling us that we only deserve positive freedoms. Freedom to advertise, sure. Freedom from being manipulated by ads- it’s an Orwellian Communist murderous regime and soon we will be like North Korea!Zuboff talks about the slow speed of democracy. That’s what left me so despaired. Democracy is not getting faster, but the technological invasions are. And I don’t see how we’ll ever be able to catch up with them. Meanwhile, a screech on a decibel undetectable to the human ear is now screaming into your subconscious and telling you to buy another Alexa and a smart underwear plus to to vote for Kim Jung Il. True story."
131,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8040056-clancy,5,"[The] bare facts of surveillance capitalism necessarily arouse my indignation because they demean human dignity. The future of this narrative will depend upon the indignant citizens, journalists, and scholars drawn to this frontier project; indignant elected officials and policy makers who understand that their authority originates in the foundational values of democratic communities; and, especially, indignant young people who act in the knowledge that effectiveness without autonomy is not effective, dependency-induced compliance is no social contract, a hive with no exit can never be home, experience without sanctuary is but a shadow, a life that requires hiding is no life, touch without feel reveals no truth, and freedom from uncertainty is no freedom.This book is an incendiary work of immense scholarly and literary significance.With admiral restraint, Zuboff painstakingly dismantles, analyses, and lays bear the machinations of one of the greatest challenges that faces humanity in this century. We have be come not the product, as is so often said, but the raw material of an entirely novel industry. This industry's speed of ascent and adaptation and especially of innovation has left individuals and governments alike, completely unable to meaningfully understand, let alone reign-in, the advance of this all-pervading entity that increases its penetration into our lives and our communities with every passing minute.This book articulates the uncomfortable gut-feeling, the uneasy sense of cognitive dissonance, that I've felt about the level of access companies generally, but especially Alphabet and Facebook, have to my life and every piece of information living that life generates. I understand now why my no-choice participation in this new economy has generated these feelings, in all their expanded and terrifying entirety.While at times bombastic, and others poetic, and others still cool and clinical; the amount of research, time, and passion for humanity itself that went into the construction of this work has paid off. This work is a significant achievement, and an important moment that we can look back on to see whether we as a species can rise to overcome this new challenge, or whether this will be little but foreshadowing of the future we allow to follow.If you're alive right now, you owe it to yourself to read this."
132,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5225660-jouni-koskinen,2,"The issues this book is about are important and complicated and hard. The use and abuse of data and user trust is worth talking about, it's even worth shouting about.But not like this.Zuboff is alarmist, melodramatic, hyperbolic and tiring. Everything the tech companies do is not just wrong, it's a diabolic scheme to undermine the world as we know it. When something is wrong, it's never an unintended consequence, it's never human error, it's never just a silly gimmick not thought out far enough. It's always, always presented as a evil contrived mastermind plot to wreck your privacy and abuse you. And it's always presented like it's the rise of fascism in the 1930's with the most gut-wrenching tear-jerking vocabulary she could find. Get a few examples, simplify a theory somehow related to the issue, contrive a concept, give it a name like ""shadow text"" or ""behavioral surplus"" (preferably a bit ominous name), cherry pick more examples, portend doom. Rinse and repeat. And mention ""surveillance capitalism"" at least 15 times per page.It's kind of ironic that when she goes on for 700+ pages on how you should never trust these companies, that she takes their Silicon Valley hypetalk at face value. If a company claims they can do something, Zuboff gleefully integrates the claim into her narrative with zero criticism. Because it serves her point. But if a company apologises for something, it's of course disingenuous with them being the devil who wants to eat your children.By the time the book gets to behaviour manipulation, it turns from melodramatic to laughable. The obsession Zuboff has for B.F.Skinner and radical behaviorism (a 70-year-old psychology concept, the cognitive revolution would like to have a word...) is full on religious. The man wasn't wrong about anything and conditioning works on people with a hundred per cent efficiency!This is an important issue, but creating hyperbolic devils like this is not just bad writing and argumentation but counter-productive to the cause. It's just creates a shoddy boogeyman argument that is easy to shoot down.The very serious and dramatic reader Audible had for this didn't help btw. (she was very clear speaker though). "
133,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,3,"This is a really important topic and I wish I could give the book more than 3 stars. Everyone knows that the technology we are living with is unprecedented and changing the world. If we aren't careful, we will cause more harm than good. This book is about the dangers of this new information age. But there are a lot of problems with how the information is presented. First, the author uses over-the-top insulting language to describe these companies and leaders--all book long. It's so obviously biased that it undermines her points again and again, prompting lots of eyerolling--about once a page. That's minor, though. More serious is that this book is way too long. It wasn't satisfied making the point, it had to list 10 examples for every point--the full quotes, too. It read more like a college term paper that needed show every piece of research the author did. It's a very long book and it didn't need to be. Finally, the author falls prey to the worst sin in this kind of cultural criticism: she treats her worldview and personality type as the perfect ideal. There was no honest acknowledgement that her era had any flaws, only lament that the world doesn't live more like she used to, that generations will not experience what she did as a child. I very much believe that there are real dangers with only a few companies controlling the information access to the world. I've personally experienced challenges with this (Amazon just recently removed me as a listed seller of my own books, saying I need to sign up for the next level of account--at more cost--before I have the chance to be displayed as the owner of the product again). But it's a mixed bag and the author can't see past her indignation to the true complexity of the situation.So, read this for an imbalanced, overly wordy way of getting one side of the story. If it's not this book, make sure you get both sides of the story, not just the story told by Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, etc."

Today the same practices meet little resistance or even discussion as they are routinely and pervasively deployed on the march towards surveillance revenues.”Welcome to a new and daunting landscape awash with sinister terminology like “permissionless innovation”, “digital totalitarianism”, “reality mining” and “behavioural surplus”. This is the new apparatus that dictates how we move through much of our lives, and just like most architecture out there, after a while, you almost become oblivious to the secret workings and dimensions which are influencing your behaviour and actions. And this is how the boys and girls down in Silicon Valley like it best.“The image of technology as autonomous force with unavoidable actions and consequences has been employed across the centuries to erase the fingerprints of power and absolve it of responsibility. The monster did it, not Victor Frankenstein.”Zuboff touches on many aspects surrounding surveillance capitalism, and we see the intimate relationship between the NSA and CIA and the mutual benefits to that relationship. “The agencies craved the lawlessness that a firm such as Google enjoyed.” We learn the huge significance of Section 230 and how far behind the US is behind the EU in terms of clamping down, one example being the EU law in May 2014 enforcing the right to be forgotten. She cites many sources, but without doubt the two most prominent reference points are the work of B.F. Skinner and Hannah Arendt and in particular her “The Origins of Totalitarianism”. “Google is to surveillance capitalism what the Ford Motor Company and General Motors were to mass-production-based managerial capitalism.”At one point the author sets out the four main areas of fortifications that have allowed Google to be so over protected and free to flourish away from political interference for so long, particularly in the USA,1.	Google showing their capabilities of competitive advantage in electoral politics. 2.	The deliberate blurring of public and private interests through relationships and aggressive lobbying. 3.	A revolving door of personnel who migrated between Google and the Obama administration, who shared mutual interests during Google’s crucial growth years of 2009-2016. By April 2016, 197 individuals had migrated from government to the Googlesphere and 61 had moved in the other direction. 4.	Google’s campaign of influence over academic work and the larger cultural conversation, which was vital to policy formation, public opinion and political perception. “Ford’s inventions revolutionised production. Google’s inventions revolutionised extraction and established surveillance capitalism’s first economic imperative: the extraction imperative.”This book is awash with horror stories befitting of sci-fi paperbacks. Like the one concerning Genesis Toys, who brought out, My Friend Cayla, a terrifying concept in which the child’s doll which relies on voice recognition, also harvests all sorts of data from the customer’s house. It is such a blatant violation that in 2017 Germany, (a country which knows a thing or two about surveillance), banned it as an illegal surveillance device, urging parents to destroy any such dolls in their possession.Due to the nature of this book it does have its harder going moments, but it still remains engaging, and overall Zuboff has completed a chilling, sagacious and damning book on the sinister and sophisticated ploys increasingly used in surveillance capitalism. The text is relatively, devoid of any superfluous academic verbiage, which many of these kinds of books suffer from. These companies and the people tied up with them are the people who hate big, bad words like privacy, tax and transparency. You can employ all the lawyers, lobbyists and accountants and actuaries, but when you strip it all away, what it really is a small, group of dangerous people making the rules up as they go along who have been given a suspiciously free and easy reign over how policy works around the world.Facebook has already admitted to and was even boasting about its power to influence people’s behaviour in US elections, and this was years before the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke. The billionaire owner of that company, Robert Mercer, backed Donald Trump. As Facebook is a private company it did not have to adhere to the legal standards for experimentation required of academic and government researchers. It remains to be seen what Facebook and Google cannot get away with. Providing a vast platform for hate speech, fostering chronic bullying, screening live suicides, streaming acts of terrorism. Where will the line be drawn?...Like bold, bratty toddlers they constantly challenge their boundaries and throw tantrums when anyone dare speaks out, but they needn’t worry a succession of US governments has them well protected as long as that money keeps on coming.Every law, rule or regulation is only as strong as the loopholes allow it to be. If these loopholes are known and continue to exist then we must ask why that is?... Who has the power to close them and more importantly why have they chosen not to close them?...These companies have consistently and effectively been left to self-regulate with predictable consequences. The problems have been known about the Wild West mentality of the internet for many, many years now, but yet little meaningful change has occurred, especially in the US.“Facebook’s $4.6 million in donations during the 2016 election cycle complemented its lobbying budget of $11.5 million in 2017.” But this is nothing compared to Google, which repeatedly spends more on lobbying than any other corporation, shelling out more than $18 million in 2018. It is also the second wealthiest registered lobbyist in the EU. Why are Facebook and Google choosing to spend such astronomical amounts of money?...What must they be getting in return?...What do they want?...What do they get?...Why are we not being told?...Welcome to “American Democracy”. Be afraid, be very afraid…"

I think the writing is slightly clumsy and I think the book underestimates the connection between Silicon Valley firms and the intelligence services/ the state. I also find the substantive responses to the issue to be a little milquetoast in comparison to the problem she diagnoses (I suppose that’s how it ended up on Obama’s books of the year list). Those problems aside at its best it is a searing look at the logic and function of the data economy. For understanding the ways that big data firms are altering society and how to think about the use and abuse of technology, this is a great book. It’s really at its best at the most conspiratorial and will leave you suspicious of what exactly your phone is doing and what Facebook ultimately wants. I’m sure posting this review will trigger a whole cascade of advertising material to make sure the big social media giants don’t loose my constant stream of crumbs I feed them. Don’t worry amazon algorithm reading this, I am much too trapped in the Skinner box to act on the suspicions raised by this book."

It is not a coup d’etat in the classic sense but rather a coup de gens: an overthrow of the people concealed as the technological Trojan horse that is Big Other”.This book is a huge, impressive piece of work. It feels like a relief to (at least) get some sort of overview over the way in which surveillance capitalism dominates our lives and orders society, despite the lack of suggestions for solutions. Understanding is the first step towards any form of meaningful resistance, and this feels like a solid first step :-)I do wish it were more accessible (as I do with most political theory) as its message feels like something that needs to be heard by more people than those who are willing to read 500 pages worth of academic language.Also - Zuboff’s idealization of the Henry Ford-era of capitalism rubs me the wrong way."
137,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24266382-ashley,3,"It’s been called “visionary,” but I don’t know that there’s anything entirely new here. What this felt like, to me, was a call to attention. The reader is not surprised by anything Shoshana Zuboff outlines, but is rather forced to acknowledge the problem in its entirety, all at once, in a 500-page package. That does make it feel revolutionary; Zuboff has written what very few people are willing to discuss in mainstream media, but which everyone has an inkling of, one way or another. I did find that it was a little too long-winded. It could have been significantly compressed, especially when a lot of the material was repetitive in order to emphasize certain themes and vocabulary.... and her preoccupation with B.F. Skinner was unnecessary. Zuboff was never so brilliant than when she illustrated, specifically, how Facebook and Google and Samsung (among others) are driving our behavior for their own profit, frequently at the expense of the law. I think that this strength was often drowned in vocabulary lessons and meandering observations, coming across as a little self-indulgent somewhere around the 200-page mark. It was unnecessary to spend so much time explaining Zuboff’s coined terms, such as “the uncontract”, “unprecedented”, “radical indifference”, “behavioural surplus”, and even “surveillance capitalism” itself. Especially in Part III, Zuboff’s self-indulgence became a running tangent, entire sections devoted to philosophy (and biology) lessons on the concept of “free will” and “utopia.”  In spite of that, it has definitely changed the way I think. It has also further fueled my nostalgia for a simpler time, and my distrust of social media and big corporations. The fact that it’s near-impossible to escape the clutches of these corporations is what really keeps me up at night; it’s not so much a privacy issue (I couldn’t care less if Mark Zuckerberg gets access to my old Instagram photos of cappuccinos) but rather a question of ethics. If I don’t want to give my data to third-parties, why are they able to access it anyway? If I don’t want to contribute to the rise of Facebook or Google, why are they still able to profit off of me anyway? Consent doesn’t really enter the conversation when it comes to what these rich tech companies have in mind, and evasive, incomplete privacy policies are nothing but “placebo effects” to pacify users.  Yes, I’m aware of the irony of publishing this review to Amazon-owned Goodreads.  ""Surveillance Capitalism"" is the kind of book that makes you want to throw your laptop into Lake Ontario and live in a cabin in the woods. I don’t know that I have the gumption for that kind of drastic change, but I’ll definitely think twice whenever I consider downloading an app or signing up for e-newsletters; I will certainly avoid buying any new smart devices by whatever means necessary. I do think it’s time for us to start protesting the free-reign that these conglomerates have been given, especially in North America. Our own behavior is being observed and herded by the rich 1% for financial gain; everything from our spending habits to our complacency is being mediated and controlled. I think, eventually, we have to reclaim our sense of autonomy and identity, and our understanding of reality.  Also, I just want to state for the record that I’ve always found it odd how North America experienced a period of mass rebellion, political protesting, and unrest during the 1960’s and 1970’s – and that this unrest suddenly came to a complete stop, save for a few exceptions here and there. Well, Zuboff has justified my unease, dedicating a sub-chapter to the behavior-control research conducted by the US Senate in the 70’s – research which became urgent as political protests escalated. And yes, surveillance capitalism has everything to do with it.  At the end of this heavy volume, Zuboff was really only trying to say one thing, re-stated from multiple angles: we are being rigorously and continuously exploited by capitalists. We don’t own our behavior anymore. Data collection and behavior control for the purpose of financial profit has crossed all ethical boundaries, and we as a society are content to let it happen.  This book is definitely recommended, if you have the patience and endurance to get through it. I almost didn’t. In a similar vein, I also recommend watching ‘Smithereens’, one of the recent Black Mirror episodes. Despite its melodrama, I think it has a lot of important things to say on society’s need to be “plugged in” and how this addiction is driving our lives. Some of Zuboff’s quotes that will stick with me: -“Its products are about predicting us, without actually caring what we do or what is done to us.” -“As populations grow numb, it becomes more difficult for individuals and groups to complain.” -“[Cortana] wants to know everything about you, but it does not want you to know how much it knows [...]” -“ ‘The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.’ ” [-Mark Weiser] -“Contemporary reviewers of Kahn’s book invariably seized upon the dark ‘nightmare scenarios’ of the computerized surveillance theme, the science-fiction–like forms of control that, they assumed, ‘will be actively feared and resented by many.’ Despite the wide range of scenarios that Kahn presented in his book on the distant year 2000, Kahn’s voyage into the ‘unthinkable’ was viewed by the public as a way to prepare for ‘the worst possible outcome’ in a terrifying ‘nightmare of social controls.’ Yet now, that same nightmare is rendered as an enthusiastic progress report on surveillance capitalism’s latest triumphs.” -“[…] Google wants us to accept that its rules simply reflect the requirements of autonomous processes, something that people cannot control. However, our grasp of the inner logic of surveillance capitalism suggests otherwise. Men and women made it, and they can control it. They merely choose not to do so.” -“Many people feel that if you are not on Facebook, you do not exist. People all over the world raced to participate in Pokémon Go. With so much energy, success, and capital flowing into the surveillance capitalist domain, standing outside of it, let alone against it, can feel like a lonely and risky prospect.”"

139,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85785571-laurence-lai,1,"The title “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism” evokes a weighty subject, and the book’s subtitle purports to something menacing to the future of humankind. It is to be seen if its contents are as substantial as the book’s 700-page length would suggest.The author, Shoshana Zuboff, is a professor emerita at Harvard Business School, not unimpressive an honor by any measure. A summary of assertions made in the book is as follows:1.	Big technological colossuses (Big Techs), epitomized by Google and Facebook, operate their business models by extracting data trails of online users, and in turn selling the extrapolated results (what Zuboff calls behavioral surplus) to their advertising customers.2.	Sophisticated algorithms are deployed and constantly refined to increase the predictive value of profiling data. At the same time, online users are passively served with moderated searches, federated news feeds, suggested connections, etc., all under the coercive power of the Big Techs. Such duress is as severe as not only to affect, shape, and compel, but with the aim to modify and manipulate user behaviors.3.	With the proliferation of sensors and Internet connectivity, Big Techs extend their reach far beyond the virtual realm to the real world. Regarding the surveillance operated by these techno-capitalists, in the author’s telling, its presence so pervasive and its impact so complete that any human free agency has receded entirely to the background and is ineffective.4.	While the above are not new to anyone who has casual understanding of current economics and culture, what Zuboff strives to accentuate is their connection to high-order issues such as self, liberty, democratic values, and human nature. She compares the dangers posed by “surveillance capitalism” to that of fascism, totalitarianism, behaviorist utopianism, and the like, that once presented real or potential detriments to humanity. For its thrilling effects, the agenda for the book is sweeping, even ambitious. Technological advancement, especially one that combines deep analytics, machine intelligence, and makes its ubiquitous presence in our intimate lives deserves a dispassionate evaluation as to its social impacts. Zuboff should be applauded for selecting this timely topic for her book.Yet one cannot help but feel frustrated by the lack of thematic organization of the whole book. Instead of explicating the economics involved in this different “capitalism”, Zuboff is more concerned with weaving her own narrative of abstruse euphemisms about how grave a danger the human future is facing. Materials are regurgitated, often word for word from the earlier part of the book and throughout. As to what actions Zuboff suggests to “fight for a human future…”? The author offers an ill-defined “synthetic declaration” (p. 345), and a skimpy, equally obscure advice of “friction, courage, and bearings” (p. 524). Specifics are sorely lacking in allusions to democratic institutions, public opinion, legislative and judicial recourse (p. 520). A whimper of a solution indeed to a loud bang of such a doorstopper.Zuboff obviously sets out to intend the book as a treatise that plumbs the depth of these to her as “unprecedented” developments in “surveillance capitalism”, and attempts to compare philosophically with past phenomena its manifold menaces to humanity. But it is exactly in such philosophizing that is the weakest of the book, for her arguments are at best tenuous and strained. On the other hand, the author wily limits her subject to mostly the socio-economic domain of the Western world, as is indicated in the book’s title. The picture would have been more complete if it had combined with surveillance authoritarianism. The “social credit” system practised unimpeded in China makes only passing reference in mere 6 pages (pgs. 388-394). Certainly, the threat to human liberty and dignity is far graver when the surveillance apparatus and capability are controlled by a police state, whereas in Western democracies competition among capitalists still exists. What is most infuriating is Zuboff’s penchant for fabricating catchphrases. Smug expressions such as “dispossession”, “behavioral futures”, “cultural misappropriation”, “economy of action”, “division of learning”, “shadow text”, “uncontract”, “hive”, “coup from above”, “Big Other”, “instrumentarian power”, “right to the future tense”, “third modernity*” …., litter throughout the book. The meanings of many of these are poorly articulated. Although she attempts to provide a brief rationale to her epithetic acrobatic (p. 66), such twisting of language is unnecessary and far from successful. It is an act of throwing spaghetti upon the wall; hoping that somehow one such phrase may stick with posterity with reference made to the author. As stated, the impression appears that the writer is more interested in weaving an esoteric narrative than presenting facts. Read a typical sentence on p. 488 of the book:“No exit” is the necessary condition for Big Other to flourish, and its flourishing is the necessary condition for all that is meant to follow: the tides of behavioral surplus and their transformation into revenue, the certainty that will meet every market player with guaranteed outcomes, the bypass of trust in favor of the uncontract’s radical indifference, the paradise of effortless connection that exploits the needs of harried second-modernity individuals and transforms their lives into the means to others’ ends, the plundering of the self, the extinction of autonomous moral judgment for the sake of frictionless control, the actuation and modification that quietly drains the will to will, the forfeit of your voice in the first person in favor of others’ plans, the destruction of the social relations and politics of the old and slow and still-unfulfilled ideals of self-determining citizens bound to the legitimate authority of democratic governance.” Long sentences can be beautiful in abler literary hands, but the above is downright egregious in form and meaning. Zuboff’s writing style can be aptly depicted as beating around the bush, with hyperboles and a plethora of inapt metaphors that ill befits so serious a subject she wants to convey. At times, she relishes so much staying with her metaphoric vehicles that the intended tenors are nowhere to be found. Long, winding sentences with chained substantives also further hamper readability.So, are readers more empowered at the end “with a more cogent and comprehensive understanding” (p. 18) of the menacing incursion exerted by the Big Techs? For the newly initiated, the writing style has done more to obfuscate than to illuminate. For the more inclined and those who look for some concrete societal antidotes, Zuboff has woefully under-delivered. More clear-eyed analyses are still awaited on the technologies proffered by the Big Techs, on the associated data-driven economy, and their consequent impacts to individuals and society at-large. * cf. Alan de Vulpian, 2003 (English , 2008)"

143,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4679583-myles,3,"This week my company officially got into the business of surveillance. People will pay us to surveil their home and business computers to protect them from rogue computer software, from losing data resulting from defective or aging components in their computers, and from misguided management of their computers themselves.Going forward this will be a growing and lucrative business segment because people rely on their computers to do so many important things for them, because they feel inadequate keeping up with changes in the computing environment, and because they justifiably fear cyber crime.It doesn’t mean they like it. I sure don’t.Being in retail business as I have for almost 25 years I have learned how to surveil myself, to protect my assets, and my employees. It is an ongoing challenge and it changes. I surveil for shoplifters, for currency and credit card counterfeiters, for daylight and after hours thieves. I surveil for dishonest employees, for honest mistakes, for poor buying decisions, and for the obsolescence of the products on my shelves. I surveil how the bank handles my money. I surveil my suppliers to prevent them from shipping me incomplete or broken goods. And I pay attention to my customers, to save them from making poor purchasing decisions.And when I am not surveilling, I am surveying. All the time. How were my customers’ experiences? What new products are on the horizon? How can I protect my liquidity, my profitability, and lastly, my sanity.I especially surveil myself, because I make mistakes, and because I too am growing old.These are some of the risks of operating a business.Then there are the people who surveil me. They include thieves looking for a weakness in my security. Government agencies to make sure I am paying the eight or ten different taxes I pay on an ongoing basis. Credit card companies surveil my transactions to make sure somebody hasn’t stolen my credit card, or that I am spending no more money than I can afford to pay back. My suppliers make sure I am paying them on time. Some manufacturers visit me in person or electronically to make sure I am representing their product lines fairly. They send me electronic training, and tests, and they regularly measure the efficiency and quality of our repair facilities. The utilities tell me when my operations (and home) are inefficient. And there are my landlords.Finally, we surveil at home. We surveil our daughter to make sure she is doing her homework and not falling in with the wrong crowd. My wife surveils me to make sure I’m not overeating, overspending, or being overly attentive to other women. I surveil my dog Seamus just in case he poops on the neighbour’s lawn so I can pick it up before someone notices. And Seamus surveils the front window and barks whenever a neighbouring dog saunters by. Last and not least are the gargantuan corporations who are watching what I do online. People like facebook, Google, amazon, and many, many more.So when somebody writes a book to tell me I live in an Age of Surveillance Capitalism...I GET IT! REALLY, I GET IT!But is it uniquely capitalist, or more generally an age of surveillance?And if it is more general to our society, where do we go from here?One thing for sure: it isn’t going away anytime soon.Shoshana Zuboff concentrates her guns on Google and facebook. She’s concerned that these companies are inherently different from the companies that came before it and they set a new standard for egregious capitalism. They are companies in the prediction business, predicting human behaviour and right now largely predicting purchasing behaviour by accumulating, as she called it, “surplus behaviour,” which kinda sounds like an oxymoron. She believes they abuse the freedoms of the marketplace to frustrate privacy, that they are built to enrich few and sidestep the traditional workplace which pays many employees fairly and creates consumers, and she argues that they are indifferent to social ills.She argues that Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” doesn’t operate in this marketplace because the new knowledge capitalists know everything happening in the market.A close reading of Andrew Carnegie’s life and legacy, perhaps John D. Rockefeller as well, could lead you to a similar conclusion, even though both men turned to philanthropy later in life. For sure, these men affected the course of capitalism.Is this a turn away from “good” capitalism toward an inherently evil capitalism?And if it is evil, can we create some rules for the big guys that us little guys can live with?Let’s take a step back and look at things in context: Google’s revenue is about $25 billion, Facebook’s $17 billion. The entire US economy is about $25 trillion and the world economy upwards of $107 trillion. Most of Google’s and Facebook’s revenue is advertising. The US advertising market is upwards of $80 billion so it is fair to say these two firms command quite strong positions in this industry. If you make the argument that America’s advertising industry is too concentrated then you’d have a pretty good argument to break up these firms which combined represent about 50% of all advertising dollars in the US. By comparison, Standard Oil at its peak commanded 88% of the market for processing crude. In its first year of operation, US Steel produced 67% of steel produced the the US.And they exhibit the classic behaviour of monopolists by dominating the markets for search and for social media on a global scale.In the US a case for breaking up the firms traditionally would have to be made that consumers are paying too much for their services or that competitors are being kept out of the market. Maybe breaking up these firms is a good idea, maybe it isn’t, but either way the technologies they employ for gathering, and analyzing, data isn’t going away.When I worked as an auditor, we used to gather lots of data, too, but what we eventually learned was that we could make assumptions about its meaning by sampling the information; that is, we cut down our work by only looking at some of the data. We tried to cut down on the wasted time. I sometimes wonder how much of what Google does is a total waste of time because the answers it seeks can be found in much faster time using much less data. And how much of “Big Data” is in fact a “Big Waste of Time.”Zuboff doesn’t consider that these firms may still be just in the early stages of figuring out what they are supposed to be doing. I think about it because so much time and resources are wasted paying attention to wholly irrelevant stuff.But we would do well to consider the affect of these companies on our freedoms and our government partially because they aren’t just national problems. They are transnational problems. What happens in China, and the extreme kind of surveillance practiced there on ethnic minorities like the Uigers, affects or will affect us here.They are transnational because the data collection is transnational and the very same data collected for the purpose of selling advertising is probably being used to develop artificial intelligence. The fastest developer of AI whether they be Chinese companies, transnational companies like Google or Facebook, or companies directly financed by government will have a big say in who has a job in the coming years and who doesn’t.No country on its own can hope to curb data collection and aggregation or perhaps more importantly, the control of what search results reveal on this scale any more than a country can curb money laundering, tax avoidance, or climate change without coordination between many if not all nations. Contemporary politics seems to be going in the opposite direction if Trump’s “America First,” Brexit, and Russian adventurism are any indication. If we are divided and our attention fractured we are susceptible to the influence or real or imagined “experts.” (To firms like Facebook I think we all have ADD, attention deficit disorder...they can never get enough of our attention!) That doesn’t mean we cannot continue to make decisions affecting our government, it more likely means that the decisions we make will more commonly resemble the imperatives of those desiring more of the same, read: the status quo.And that turns us to the question of how good is the status quo. If you believe that the universe ultimately bends toward the dilution of energy, total entropy, then the status quo is not too good. If you believe the status quo to be a teleological evolution toward a great singularity, perhaps a union with God, and a progression toward greater complexity in the universe, the status quo looks pretty good.Business executives, in my experience, tend to be of the more optimistic latter type of people. Like the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world and other people who have become incredibly wealthy in a short period of time.In the meantime, some of us have rather pedestrian concerns like the security of really private information. While convincingly arguing that there is insufficient transparency over who handles the big data and how they handle it, I think Zuboff fails to sufficiently weigh immense risk that the data will fall out of control of the aggregators and into the hands of rogue individuals.The hacking of credit card databases is one thing, and I think it a bigger risk than the hacking of a database which tells people how I like my hotdogs dressed. People made a big deal of the Cambridge Analytica scare. In the end, those people sold bogus claims to naive political organizations. The data predicted nothing and was of no use to anybody. And it didn’t get Donald Trump elected.Certainly big data aggregation has concrete effects on the economy. You get “free” Google searches. I get a cheaper smart TV because the data guys get first dibs on my TV watching preferences.This book is not the best guide for the good works these technologies enable (ie crowd sourcing, scientific research, epidemiology, etc). Self-driving cars benefit by machine learning. The acceleration and reductions in the friction in electronic commerce are generally good things.I don’t agree with Zuboff that the behavioural science behind the new data aggregation firms promotes a radical indifference to the lot of the common person. Nor do I agree that hyperscale doesn’t require competitive markets or for that matter democracy.This has yet to be proven.We all need participatory democracy, and more than ever on a global scale. Let’s make these damn machines work for us, not agin us."
144,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26854448-m-a,5,"This is a brilliant and important book about the future of mankind.It is unfortunately very difficult to read, due not only to the complexity of the subject matter, but also due to the constant use by the author of jargon and long complicated sentences. This is very ironic, considering that this book is intended as a warning and a call to action to the general public against the machinations of the Surveillance Capitalist elite. I can only hope that a more accessible version of this book will be published to accomplish that goal.Zuboff claims that surveillance capitalism is as big a change for our society as industrial capitalism was more than two centuries ago.It all started with Google, followed closely by Facebook, Microsoft and eventually by all digital industries.Google started collecting our private data (from our search terms on Google search, to our emails on Gmail, to our location data on Google Maps, our data stored on our Android devises etc..) without our knowledge or consent and turning them into predictions about our future behavior, which they sold for profit to marketers.Zuboff calls Google ""privacy kleptomaniacs"". She compares Google to the Spanish conquistadores invading the natives on the American continent and declaring the continent theirs by a monarchical edict declaring it so. So did Google invade our private data by declaring it theirs through obscure unilaterally imposed terms of service.She calls this data, the new raw material of capitalism ""Behavioral Surplus"".She traces the architecture of this new form of capitalism from its supply routes to its ""behavioral futures markets"".The production of digital data has far outpaced the human capacity to process/make sense of that data.Therefore, behavioral psychologists and data scientists have created algorithms to predict an individual's future behavior based on the billions of raw data of his/her every move and every thought.They use the 5 factor personality model, the 6 emotion model, affective computing, emotional analytics and sentiment analysis to predict our personalities and our future behavior.Surveillance Capitalists are prediction factories, based on raw materials from us.Google and co don't sell the raw data, they sell behavioral predictions based on that data.That information is not only useful to marketers, but to anyone with an interest in that knowledge and an interest in influencing that future behavior.Some examples of benefits of knowing a person's future behavior with very great accuracy include: predicting disease, financial risk, criminal risk, consumer preferences and political views. This knowledge about the future allows corporations to eliminate all risks in their business dealings.Zuboff calls this predictive data the ""shadow text"".This shadow text is only available to surveillance capitalists through their data extractions and algorithms.It is about us but not for us.Us being unaware of the surveillance is the precondition for surveillance capitalism to function properly- we are to remain unaware of the shadow text. Even if raw data are shared with us, the shadow data crafted for prediction purposes is not accessible to us.Remote digital observation and tele-stimulation ( the ""god view"") allows for distancing of the observed as ""the other"".Zuboff calls the Surveillance Capitalists the ""Big Other"".""The market reduces us to our behavior, transformed into another fictional commodity and packaged for others' consumption"" We are to be monitored and tele stimulated.Zuboff demonstrates how surveillance capitalism has expanded beyond cyberspace into our everyday life.Even the human body is treated as a computer, containing data in order to provide corporations certainty of profit.Take wearables for example: they form an unobtrusive integration to everyday life- internet connected fabrics, fitness trackers, diabetes apps etc.Zuboff quotes a study that shows that apps downloaded on a smart phone extract location data, contact lists, photos & videos etc without express consent of the user and that they sell this data to third parties.According to Zuboff, these companies' privacy policies should be called ""surveillance policies"".She predicts we will all end up with chips in our bodies for better surveillance, like animals. Telemetry is already used on animals to study their behavior. Humans will be next.We are already tracked in our cars, in our homes, in our kidneys (dialysis devices).By 2020, there will be 20 billion intelligent devices with the capability of tracking and monitoring us.Zuboff calls whatever data that is not yet tracked ""dark data"". Surveillance Capitalists are intent on tracking all behavior that is not (yet) informatized.They want to monetize every aspect of our lives, the entire human experience. They want to turn our entire life into profit for themselves.Power was once identified with the ownership of the means of production.Now power rests in the ownership of the means of behavioral prediction and behavioral modification of the other. Now our lives are turned into data without our knowledge or consent in order to benefit others.Zuboff explains how the system of Surveillance Capitalism is grounded in behavioral psychology.The goal of behaviorism is the prediction and control of behavior- the human being is nothing but an organism, an ""it"". According to behaviorists a human is in essence no different than a mushroom, only a bit more complex.Behaviorists (eg Skinner and Pentland) believe humans have no freedom of will, no autonomy, no agency. Freedom of will is an illusion. It is the environment that controls behavior. Individual behavior is caused by variables lying outside the individual himself.Hence the belief by behaviorists that behavioral control can lead to predicting future behavior with scientific accuracy. Behavior must be studied w/o limits and w/o knowledge of the ""organism"".Privacy is an illusion just like freedom- they must be forfeited in favor of the good life.BUT this view was meant to benefit all of humanity; the knowledge gained through behavioral tracking was to be used to improve human behavior towards a better future for humanity: fighting disease, crime, poverty etc..Instead, behaviorism has been hijacked by surveillance capitalism to benefit only the small class of surveillance capitalists and their customers. The lost freedom only affects us but the acquired knowledge and profit is all theirs.What are the dangers of Surveillance Capitalism?The more one knows about a person, the easier it is to control him.Besides being used for targeted marketing, knowledge of personal data can also be used to blackmail, defame, harass and discriminate against us.The dangers lie not only in corporate surveillance itself and the accompanying loss of privacy, but even more worrisome, in corporate mind manipulation and corporate behavioral modification, such as the creation of conformity and obedience but also the creation of desires that benefit commerce and emotions that benefit politicians. Surveillance capitalists wants ALL of you- your behavior, your thoughts, your emotions, your personality- so they can manipulate your behavior. Will you have any autonomy, any free will left? Surveillance Capitalism is not only a danger to privacy, but a danger to democracy which depends on autonomous moral judgment and individual determination and free will. Zuboff believes in free will as the basis for individuality, self determination, and the right to decide our future (She calls it ""The right to the future tense"").The right to be one's author of one's future should be cast as a human right-necessary because it is imperiled by ""the panvasive digital architecture of behavioral modification owned and operated by surveillance capital, necessitated by its economic imperatives and driven by its laws of motion, all for the sake of its guaranteed outcomes""Will Google, FB and co. lead to digital totalitarianism? According to Zuboff the answer is no, because the past offers no adequate compass for this new phenomenon.Zuboff calls the future of Surveillance Capitalism ""Instrumentarianism"".Totalitarianism, as impersonated by Hitler and Stalin was only understood after the facts. It entails the destruction of all human ties except total loyalty to the movement (fascism or communism). It operates through the means of violence, terror and fear- all who do not conform, the enemies of the ""people"", are executed.Instrumentarianism behaves through the means of behavioral modification.And, unlike in a totalitarian regime, there is no need to use force . All you need is adequate human engineering.""Instrumentarianism"" is a behaviorally controlled society, in which knowledge replaces freedom. In such a society, social change can be generated by social pressure from social networks to ""go with the flow, stay with the herd, return to the hive and take flight with the flock"". Identity yields to synchrony.Such a society leads to the death of individuality. The collective intelligence knows best and individuality is only unnecessary friction towards that goal.Instrumentarian society with its architecture of behavioral control, social pressure and asymmetrical power is a Panopticon - there is no exit possible.Once it was believed that there is no exit from an all knowing and all powerful God.Under Instrumentarianism, there will be no exit from the others, big other and the surveillance capitalists. Big Other knows no boundaries.Zuboff pleads for the right to sanctuary.It is a universal need for a safe refuge, for shelter.This right is as ancient as human history; originally it manifested itself in the form of a city, or a temple. Later on this right extended to the home: a sanctuary from arbitrary intrusion. Psychologists agree that this is important for development of the self and for mental health. With Big Other, the Universe takes up residence within our walls, there is no refuge. (thinkof internet connected security cameras, light switches, thermostats, appliances, rumbas, wearables,smart phones, tooth brushes, beds, personal assistants, TVs, toys,etc etc).What solution does Zuboff propose to avert the coming Instrumentarian Society?To just stop using the internet and internet connected devices?Surveillance Capitalists offer solutions to social connection, access to information, time saving convenience and ""illusionary"" support and this got us all addicted. It is not reasonable to expect us to go off the grid.Privacy regulation and monopoly regulation is inefficient at combating those risks- it will not be solved by encryption, anonymization or discussion of data ownership. This is a new condition that outruns the law, that has not been tamed by law. Zuboff discusses very briefly the new regulatory regime operating in the EU since May 2018, the GDPR ( General Data Protection Regulation). The GDPR is a good step forward, but only time will tell if it will be efficient in vanquishing surveillance capitalism's instrumentarian power. The individual is powerless against the surveillance capitalist machine because of asymmetrical power and knowledge. Only collective action on the ground, such as class actions, will determine if GDPR will be effective.Regulators will be up against well funded corporate lawyers and lobbyists.Zuboff concludes that Surveillance Capitalism is profoundly anti democratic. It is a market coup from above on the people. It is a form of tyranny, of absolutism; it imposes its rules from above; everyone except the tyrant is just an organism, the ""other one"", to be exploited for the profit of the tyrant.Industrial revolution has led to near destruction of our planet and extinction of many species. Instrumentarianism will lead to extinction of our individuality.Zuboff points to the critical role of public opinion on changing the laws. She proclaims passionately:It is NOT ok to strip search us for profit.It is a human expectation to be the author of one's life.There is still time to redirect the action to a future that we can call home.It is our responsibility to right was has gone wrong.We have to be indignant because this is an attack on human dignity.Freedom from uncertainty is no freedom.She refuses to seed the future to illegitimate power.She demands a human future.She calls the world to action to declare the digital future to be a human future."
145,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42693079-ryan-o-neill,4,"This ambitious and expansive book aims to define and explain the rise of surveillance capitalists like Google, Facebook and Microsoft as they play ever larger roles in our lives. Shoshana Zuboff briefly maps out the history of some of these companies and delves into the way in which they gradually encroach on our lives in ever more frightening ways.She argues persuasively that while sometimes driven by old capitalist imperatives, these companies represent a break from past eras such as that of industrial capitalism as they secretly and aggressively gather increasing amounts of personal information from us, but not for our benefit; rather than the traditional business-customer reciprocities, surveillance capitalists plunder every element of our lives, both online and offline, for the benefit of advertisers, and ultimately serve their economic benefit.Under surveillance capitalism, we are no longer the customers (although practices are often disguised under the auspices of 'personalisation') but rather our searches, browsing history, friends, likes, reactions, emotions and feelings are raw materials to be scraped for the benefit of companies who are free to operate outside the boundaries of traditional democracy and regulation. Our rights are ruthlessly and carelessly cast aside and rendered obsolete in this relentless pursuit of behavioural surplus without which surveillance capitalists cannot grow.These companies encroach upon our personal space in ever more intrusive ways - from the original Google Street View controversy in the mid-2000s to Facebook's hidden methods of gleaning info on our preferences, to TVs that listen to you, wearable devices, Alexa house alarms and even toys that listen to you, to the fight for our car dashboards. The speed and aggression is such that after initial outrage, we are worn down, helpless and numbed, resigned to our fate.Surveillance capitalism, Zuboff argues, attempts to create certainty of outcome for its actual customers - its advertisers. This is done by parsing human behaviour, exploiting feelings, emotions and beliefs even when we don't permit it to, so that our individual freedom, our rights to define our own experience, and to act and think in private are eroded as we are continuously moulded and directed towards specific courses of action by these companies. The inherent uncertainty that exists within how we think, how we act and interact - our right to an effective life - is replaced by collective certainty at the hands of surveillance capitalism.Zuboff also mines the effects of social media on young people's development. As they journey from being defined by their relationships at a young age to becoming separate from but connected to others in adulthood, young people are adversely affected by social media and its imperatives to forcing people to see themselves 'from the outside in' and define themselves based on the experiences and lives of others. The pervasiveness of social media means people often struggle to disconnect, their mental health even suffering from brief separation from their accounts. This crucially and savagely inhibits their ability to look inward and make that journey from people defined by their relationships in youth, to autonomous individuals who have relationships in adulthood.Zuboff argues that while the advent of new laws such as GDPR in Europe have been helpful, surveillance capitalism's overall success in evading proper regulation and legal scrutiny means that decisive action will depend on a turning of public opinion. Lots of us are passive about our distrust of social media, but it will take a re-establishment of indignation, a renewal of outrage, if we are to have any chance of stemming the flow.The book is a heavy undertaking; more than 500 pages long and often written in rather academic prose, and it can occasionally be quite dense and abstract. Given the ubiquity of technology in all of our lives, it could undoubtedly be more reader-friendly, and perhaps focus on more real-life examples that we are all familiar with. Despite its wealth of information, Xuboff's proposed solutions are vague, and it is arguably unclear what exactly you as an individual can do personally to reduce the insidious influence of surveillance capitalism in your everyday life; what strategies can be used to repell Facebook from building a strong profile based on your preferences, for example? Is there a feasible path to effective life without being on Facebook?Furthermore, it would have been helpful to have some more analysis on the gathering of information not related to economics - the how and why of information kept either by governments or corporations on citizens for reasons not linked to monetary benefits.Nevertheless, this is a hugely informative, well researched and important book on a subject which, as the author herself notes, is a story still unfolding and which still has some way to run. It's likely that many updates and more reader-friendly analyses on surveillance capitalism will follow, but this is a fantastic launch-pad for one of the defining issues of our time."
146,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45700308-tanmay-srivastava,1,"Shoshana Zuboff's book was highly recommended, was part of multiple lists and had glowing reviews on Goodreads. I was quite excited to pick it up and start reading.  Without calling it out, Zuboff treats incremental technological progress as a zero sum game. A win for the tech companies is a loss to someone. Take, for example when Zuboff talks about connected cars . She says an insurance company can stall a car if the premiums are not paid. She beats up this argument and brings up a case of how an elderly couple had to choose between car payments and medicine, which came to light only when the collection officers turned up at the door. A crowdfunding campaign was launched to help them and it had a happy ending. Using software however would have meant that this would have never happened. She fails to recognize that her example is the exception and not the norm. She chooses to ignore the positive impact connected cars would have on say, cars getting stolen going down leading to lower premiums or reduced premiums for drivers using their cars less or rewarding good drivers by reducing their premiums. Maybe, with such technological advances premiums would fall to such an extent that the couple wouldn't have to worry about premium payments altogether? She fails to acknowledge that progress is not a zero sum game. Tech companies have been bashed quite a bit through the book. There is no nod of appreciation for the positive impact they have had on societies. Here, In India - products of these tech companies are helping small businesses make moves that wouldn't have been possible before. Expensive POS Machines have been skipped (the same way how landlines didn't make it to parts of India but mobile phones did) in favor of Google Pay (QR Codes for Bank to Bank transfers). Book keeping doesn't required expensive licenses and can be managed online. Whatsapp is used to sell/communicate/deliver orders. YouTube is a learning platform for many, and a medium for news outside of the traditional media. The jobs these tech companies have created in India, directly and indirectly, also cannot be overlooked. There's a section where Zuboff talks about fake news and its impact on Brexit and the 2016 US Election. While I do agree fake news is a very big issue, the issue of voter discretion cannot be overlooked. In Zadie Smith's essay on Brexit -  ""Fences""  she writes how someone voted one way in referendum to get rid of the health secretary. Would it have been different if it was not targeted to a particular group (via the likes of Cambridge Analytica)? Would the results of Brexit and the 2016 US Election have been the same if there was no Facebook? Are we giving these incidents more importance than they deserve? ""Who knows?"" - I don't. I don't think we can ever conclusively state yes or no. The biggest issue is that a lot of topics covered in the book are in the grey area. Is it okay to give someone hungry a burger from McDonald's? The burger will make sure that they don't go hungry, but it's not a healthy meal. Can they afford to have a healthy meal? Can they stay hungry? Is there a way to grow healthy food to feed everyone? Is there a way to make everyone want/enjoy the healthy food? This sort of reasoning should have been the core of the book. You cannot do without technology companies today. Google, Microsoft, Facebook are essential parts of our day to day lives. Is there a business model where these companies can make enough money to create products that add value without compromising on data to drive revenue? Is there a market for people to pay for their services without any data getting collected? Do people bother to dig deep in their account settings to switch off optional data collection? Do people care? I feel the book is not asking the right questions needed to drive policy discussions. Data privacy is an important topic. The book is well researched in parts but jumps into pages of wishful thinking. The conclusions drawn are biased. The facts are presented in a way to scare you, and similar to how likes are garnered on social media with scary/angry posts, this book has scared people into giving it 5 stars on Goodreads. I wish this book was not one sided as it was - Not recommended."
147,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27470888-cool-breeze,1,"The subject of this book is very important. Unfortunately, this book fails miserably at contributing anything useful to the discussion. It is mind-numbingly long at 691 pages and an ordeal to read. Zuboff takes a few observations on surveillance technology issues and uses pretentious academic jargon to fluff them into this execrable doorstop of a book. The book does not offer any practical solutions to the issues she raises. A good editor could have reduced this to a pamphlet or a web article without leaving much notable out.This is possibly the worst non-fiction book I have ever read. I dreaded resuming it every time I picked it up and finally abandoned it on page 158. If I should ever be stuck on a desert island with only this book for reading material, I will be thankful at least that I have an abundant supply of toilet paper.Zuboff is a sociologist and the language she employs is tortured and tedious in the extreme. She insists on coining lots of neologisms and wallowing in her jargon. Amusingly, her favorite term is Behavioral Surplus, or BS for short. The book could have saved countless pages if she reduced a lot of her BS to abbreviations. Perhaps such Heideggerian writing impresses her academic colleagues, but it is excruciating for the average reader. She beats her core points to death – within the first 100 pages she must have repeated some version of the following point dozens of times – ‘the user isn’t the customer, nor are they the product, they are the raw material that is used to create the product’. You could have cut many more pages by limiting this point to three repetitions. It is as if she thinks her readers are idiots, or else she has dementia and doesn’t remember what she wrote a page or two ago. Even worse, Zuboff is a Luddite and a hard-core leftist. She obviously thinks the Industrial Revolution was largely a disaster. On page 11, she writes “industrial civilization… threatens to cost us the earth”. By page 12, she is hyperventilating “The industrial legacy of climate chaos fills us with dismay, remorse and fear”. No, it doesn’t. The reason Trump is President and the US has repudiated stupid climate treaties is that so many American voters think this is a non-issue or a very low priority (#18 out of 19 in a recent survey). On page 22, she writes that she has been inspired by a rogues' gallery of leftists, including Karl Marx, Theodor Adorno, Jean-Paul Sartre and Thomas Piketty (Robert Reich and Rachel Carson, who is responsible for millions of deaths, are also mentioned favorably). On page 33, she likens her great-grandparents fleeing the oppression of 1908 Russia to the oppression of the nuclear family (you poor, fragile snowflake!). On page 38 she viciously criticizes Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, although she admits their policies pulled the country out of the stagflation and “malaise” of the Jimmy Carter years. Unbelievably, Zuboff apparently thinks airline deregulation was a bad thing. On page 42, she is writes approvingly of rioters in London (she really should read some Theodore Dalrymple on the real problems involved) and the dilettante, astroturf Occupy “movement”. On page 43, she comments disapprovingly on those who would “pare regulations, cut taxes… and shrink entitlements”. Heaven forbid that anyone should want to take an ax to the leviathan state! By page 109, she is bemoaning the Supreme Court’s rejection of restrictions on political speech, “hate speech” (meaning anything she and her politically correct brethren disagree with), pornography (yeah, she’s puritanical as well as a Luddite) and free association. What a pinch-faced scold!Only at this point does she admit that her arch-villain, Google, has been totally in bed with the left-wing Obama administration, using their surveillance technology to mastermind his two Presidential campaigns and running a revolving door operation with 258 employees moving between Google and the Obama regime. Whoops! How inconvenient! It’s almost like leftism and this creepy surveillance technology go hand in hand! Curiously, in a 691-page book, the word “Clinton” does not appear even once in the 26-page index! I wonder who was President from 1996 to 2001, Google’s first five years? Or who was Hillary’s biggest corporate campaign contributor? It is a complete mystery, according to this book. Zuboff doesn’t actually appear to be a Clinton fan, so maybe she just doesn’t want to wind up adding to the Arkancide body count like Jeffrey Epstein.Zuboff must have felt terrible about documenting the extent of Obama’s collusion with Google’s abuses, because within a few pages she is back to bashing mainstream conservative organizations such as the Federalist Society, Heritage Action, Americans for Tax Reform and the Cato Institute as “Far Right”. Anyone to the right of Marx, Lenin and Mao is apparently “Far Right” to Zuboff.Chapter 5 elaborates Googles expanding abuses from 2009-2016. The Europeans attempt some pushback, but the US is feckless or oblivious. Just who controlled the government that was supposed to be preventing such abuses during this time? Zuboff couldn’t possibly guess, even if you spotted her an O, B and M. During this period, Zuboff’s Harvard Business School colleagues ride to the defense of Yelp, perhaps the only tech company more loathsome than Google.Strangely, Zuboff admits there were a number of potentially effective policy fixes being seriously considered in the years before 9/11. Why not revive those ideas and build a political coalition of like-minded classical-liberals, libertarians, small-government conservatives and Trump supporters (the tech giants being no friends of Trump) to implement them? She points out that the national security agencies are obstacles. Well, after Brennan, Comey, Holder and Lynch, a lot of people on the right need no further persuasion that the FBI, CIA and the rest of the Deep State are utterly corrupt rogue agencies. Zuboff doesn’t appear to consider this a possibility. I guess working with those icky right wingers is completely out of the question. Even worse, such allies are never going to go along with replacing the tech elite with the “benevolent” socialist dictatorship of Zuboff and her Harvard faculty elite. As it turns out, Zuboff’s problem is not so much with the creepy technology, it is that the creepy technology is not under the control of “enlightened” leftists like her and her comrades in academia and government.That was as much as I could take. I skimmed the book for any sign of practical solutions in the pages to come and, finding none, I abandoned the book on page 158.I agree with Zuboff that the tech giants represent a grave threat. However, if her prescription of more government and more socialism is the only alternative, I guess I will just have to find ways to live with it. The only thing worse than surveillance capitalism is surveillance statism run by socialist do-gooder “elites” like Zuboff, who always think they know better and want to engage in social engineering. Do you think the Chinese people would prefer annoying Google ads or their oppressive and ubiquitous social credit scores? The only people I would less like to see in control of this technology than Page, Brin and Zuckerberg are Zuboff and her comrades.In the nearer term, there are still practical steps one can take to mitigate the problem. Don’t use Google products. Use DuckDuckGo for search. Don’t use Gmail or Chrome. Use a good ad blocker, like AdBlockPlus on all devices. Don’t buy creepy surveillance technology like Nest, Ring or Alexa. Delete your Facebook account. Don’t use Twitter, it’s a surveillance sewer. Don’t buy from Amazon or use their products or services, especially the Washington Post. Don’t buy from Apple or use their products or services. Use Linux if that is viable for you or lock down you Windows privacy settings, if not. Check your app setting and cut them back to only those necessary to function. Don’t use non-essential apps like games, many of which are bad offenders.Support the breakup of the tech giants using antitrust laws. Support their prosecution for anti-competitive and anti-privacy violations. Having Page, Brin, Zuckerberg and Bezos doing some serious hard time would have a very salutary effect “pour encourager les autres”. Institute real and legally-binding privacy protections such as Zuboff mentions and dismisses. Yes, we will have to do it without the support of Zuboff and her comrades, but Trump’s upcoming second term could be a real opportunity to get this done (I think Zuboff’s head may have just exploded)."
148,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65435043-alan-tennyson,5,"I pored over this book, stayed with the words. Read and reread them. Drank deeply from their wisdom.  It was not an easy read, but ultimately it gave far more than it took. The Age of Surveillance Capitalism is a seminal text for our age. Zuboff's account of surveillance capitalism is elegant, poised and persuasive. Yet for all her brilliance, Shonanna's central thesis suffers some fundamental flaws.  Where The Age is at it's strongest is in the articulation of surveillance capitalism. Consider this, 'Who owns your face?', 'Who owns your behaviour?' What you do, where you go, who you know, all this has value and extracting value from these data is the business model of the surveillance capitalist.  But this is only the description, where Zuboff's account takes a darker turn, is in control. Once Surveillance Capitalists have provided a description of you, the next logical step is to determine how much this description can be used to predict and control you. Zuboff's account of these processes is beautifully rendered in perfect proses.  Know thyself, unless you don't like what you find, then, deny thyself, and pretend you are other. Zuboff goes for the latter.  We are born of this place, this pale blue dot, we are natural phenomena. Yet despite these self-evident truths, many continue to advance the notion that we apes are exceptional.  We are somehow other than the mere organisms with whom we share our earth and almost our entire genetic structure. Zuboff takes issue with humans being described as 'mere organisms'.  She is caged by this ideology of human exceptionalism, and it weakens her thesis considerably.  There are sacred cows here, and sacred cows will invariably be slaughtered.  The first heifer into the meat factory is autonomy. Shoshana strips us of our relations, our context and connections. She exalts 'autonomy' but fails to grapple with the weakness of the presumptions it contains. This leads her to assert that humans are and ought to be autonomous.  But Zuboff fails to address that we are born free, but everywhere in chains. From the traffic light to the electric chair, we are already in a context that seeks to control our behaviour. What does she think education and justice are? If not systems of changing our behaviour? But it's more than this, it's a scientific reality, we are our contexts, our environment, they shape us as we shape them.  This is a reality that an insistence on 'Freedom' cannot wish away.   For me, the issue is not that we are organisms', we are.  It is not that we are miraculous rational deities, we are not.  We need to embrace our human frailty, stare it down since we are wiser for this knowledge.  Here again, Zuboff takes issues with what she calls the 'ideology of human frailty'.  Respectfully I would ask that we,  put down our pride and look hard in the mirror, human frailty is not an ideology, it is a fundamental truth. We are 'mere organisms' and to claim anything else is to cling to a pernicious ideology. An ideology that has prompted human dominion over earth and animals, and all the ecological genocide that follows."

In fact, in a time like this I wish there was a more complex rating system than 5 stars. I digress.This was, in many ways, the first of its kind. There have, in my view, yet to be too many intelligent take downs of the dangers of big data. There is,of course, a brief mentioning of the a similar subject in many other modern texts - but not to this degree.So, you ask, what the hell is surveillance capitalism. It is, a term coined by the author. She first presented the concept publicly in 2014, in an article, where she described it as such :""[surveillance capitalism is a] radically dissembled and extractive variant of information capitalism"" based on the commodification of ""reality"" and its transformation into behavioral data for analysis and sales""*---- IN this book she presents the story of how it is that we have gotten to such a point in history, where the sentence in her 2014 article could even be spoken. In this she gives a small run down of facebook and google, and explains the origins of these sights in relation to their users. User-ship on these web pages began without much craziness, but as we all know many pages which were once small e.g. facebook, google, and youtube have more or less all become huge power houses of influence. They have now followings in the billions. This is presently praised by these web pages as a good thing. Initially. well. The servers couldn't take it. There was too much damn data. And its all so useless.Or is it?It was, with this question, in the eyes of zuboff, that this form of capitalism** was born. The data not only need not be an annoyance, but it could be a pathway towards making money. 'Perhaps', these tech giants thought 'we could predict the users behaviors by paying attention to the patterns in data'. Alas. we are truly all creatures of habit. Long story short. A great deal of people in the industrial world are using certain pages on the internet in ways that are useful for targeting for sales. This of course can eventually be sold to governments blah blah blah. Ask yourself. are you ok with people predicting your behaviors to increase user experience? What about to protect you? What about to just watch you?These are questions the book will make you reflect on.Overall, I think this was one of the most apropos books I have read in awhile towards understanding some issues in modernity.86/100 stars.Recommended for:Those thinking about big data in its prediction of human behaviorthose who dont trust facebook and googlethose worried about internet privacythose thinking about the future path of society*Hey guess what.

Market and industrial capitalism are declining, long live surveillance capitalism say the social media giants, in whose tentacles it is we, rather than any thing useful for us as humans, who are grasped .It’s a bit long and at times repetitive, like Das Kapital, but it’s not really a criticism of the book, as the amount of research and work Zuboff must have done to produce this dizzying analysis of the current state of digital technology and its impact on us, is breathtaking. It’s the resistance to surveillance capitalism’s imperatives that she leaves as the challenge for society at the end of the book... How is that done when we hunger so much for its crumbs and are so addicted to the precision targeting of its algorithms?"

The argument is blind to how Big Tech's surveillance is merely the most recent and sophisticated manifestation of capitalism's inherent drive to extract value; advertising and media companies have for centuries made a business of surveillance and control. But acknowledging that continuity would deflate the book's sensationalism, and undermine its premise that, before Big Tech, the only threat to liberalism was state power, and not also that of capital."
159,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89255731-mark-walker,5,"This book will boil your blood. Supported by extensive empirical research, Professor Shoshana Zuboff exposes the effective digital implementation of the late B. F. Skinner's Beyond Freedom and Dignity. It centers around three related factors: The distribution of knowledge: “Who knows?” Authority: “Who decides who knows?” and Power: “Who decides who decides who knows?” (Hint: it's not you). Orders of magnitude beyond just tracking cookies and the creepy anticipation of your interests by entities such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook, the new instrumentarianism is used by surveillance capitalists to control not just what you buy but also what you think about and how you think it. This is not even the theoretical Capitalism of Friedman, Hayek, or Adam Smith, as there is no equality of individual choice in it. In other words there's no free market here, as surveillance capitalists deliberately orchestrate your life for their benefit irrespective of yours. Thus it's not a fair trade; there is no reciprocity in the conveniences you think you receive from even the simplest transactions. You are not their customers (or even the ""product"" as in the cliché); their customers are the people purchasing the information harvested about you, which is extracted without your awareness. In this digital realm, it is as if you are the third world country having your natural resources extracted for the exclusive profits of foreign capitalists. Another clear analogy is we are like chickens being farmed for our eggs: they feed us with incentives, not for our well-being but so that we will lay more eggs to go into omelets not for us. You and your personal information are only the objects, the ""Other,"" that are for sale for the benefit of people who are not you. The key feature of all of this is that willingness is irrelevant, as we are unknowing and thus unwitting participants. Their salient objective is the obscene profits garnered from not just your profiles and posts, but the shadow text that you don't see from the fusion of the backscatter data about you that is harvested into separate secret databases. They actively hide that they have this information on you, as their modus operandi requires that you not be aware of it for this process to be successful. Much of this activity is beyond the reach of laws and courts, as the surveillance capitalists would just go underground with their operations if regulations were imposed. It is accompanied by an acceleration of the deliberate assault on democracy through lobbying and revolving door employment between government and the commercial interests that control it. Thus just voting for politicians that promise to tame surveillance capitalism will be of insufficient effect. Zuboff offers hope and some thoughts on what to do about it. European history has shown that when the people have had enough of oppression, they join together to rebel, as when the Berlin Wall came down without resistance from the guards. A similar event must occur today to escape the glass walls of the hive surveillance capitalists have put us in for the purpose of harvesting and orchestrating even our most personal thoughts, all for their profit and not ours. We need walls of our own, not to keep us in their hive, but to keep them out of our personal sanctuary. Public opinion is key to taming this monster. In the end if enough of the public rose up against surveillance capitalism, possibly by throwing its shadow text in disarray and diminishing its value, the money and influence behind it would then be of little effect. There is hope if humans would willingly help each other to the extent that surveillance capitalists take without asking. Then the world would be a much friendlier and more prosperous place for everyone. and not just the few."

Sometimes, instead of relying on strong arguments, it relied on absurdly hyperbolic language. For instance, I didn’t feel like she explained clearly enough why monetizing our data is bad - say, because how it’s been destroying “the forth estate” that needs to constantly run after the clicks, or how our data is used to manipulate us to consume-consume-consume, to the detriment of the planet. Instead she went on for a while about our right to the “will to will” and a lot about how bad BF Skinner was. Maybe if I understood behaviorism better I’d have felt it as strongly as she seemed to, but I just didn’t feel like I totally got that whole part. Maybe that’s me.Speaking of Skinner, she seems to be of the school of public intellectualism that is very focused on individual actors instead of on the system. So she goes on a lot about the bad guys of our predicament, Skinner but also of course Zuck, the Google founders, the guy at Microsoft who didn’t seem to be extraordinarily villainous at all. Here’s where this type of focus in the individual derails us: it leads Zuboff to think that these people created the problems, and not the system. But actually, so long as the law allows for folks to make money by manipulating the masses, there will always be a sociopath to sink his teeth in. That’s why the problem is the system and that needs to be fixed. And Zuboff does argue for that - it’s just that she weakens her argument by being so focused on these insatiable idiot vampires. But all that is quibbling and frustration. The important take-away from the book is that it stakes the solution within the law. It does not fall for the “freedom of speech” idiocy, an argument mounted by economic interest as a way to stop the entire legal system from functioning as it should. Since when can’t we have laws? Since when is it tyranny for the government to create limits and parameters as a way of ensuring a healthy society? Since the tech companies have been telling us that we only deserve positive freedoms. Freedom to advertise, sure. Freedom from being manipulated by ads- it’s an Orwellian Communist murderous regime and soon we will be like North Korea!Zuboff talks about the slow speed of democracy. That’s what left me so despaired. Democracy is not getting faster, but the technological invasions are. And I don’t see how we’ll ever be able to catch up with them. Meanwhile, a screech on a decibel undetectable to the human ear is now screaming into your subconscious and telling you to buy another Alexa and a smart underwear plus to to vote for Kim Jung Il. True story."

The future of this narrative will depend upon the indignant citizens, journalists, and scholars drawn to this frontier project; indignant elected officials and policy makers who understand that their authority originates in the foundational values of democratic communities; and, especially, indignant young people who act in the knowledge that effectiveness without autonomy is not effective, dependency-induced compliance is no social contract, a hive with no exit can never be home, experience without sanctuary is but a shadow, a life that requires hiding is no life, touch without feel reveals no truth, and freedom from uncertainty is no freedom.This book is an incendiary work of immense scholarly and literary significance.With admiral restraint, Zuboff painstakingly dismantles, analyses, and lays bear the machinations of one of the greatest challenges that faces humanity in this century. We have be come not the product, as is so often said, but the raw material of an entirely novel industry. This industry's speed of ascent and adaptation and especially of innovation has left individuals and governments alike, completely unable to meaningfully understand, let alone reign-in, the advance of this all-pervading entity that increases its penetration into our lives and our communities with every passing minute.This book articulates the uncomfortable gut-feeling, the uneasy sense of cognitive dissonance, that I've felt about the level of access companies generally, but especially Alphabet and Facebook, have to my life and every piece of information living that life generates. I understand now why my no-choice participation in this new economy has generated these feelings, in all their expanded and terrifying entirety.While at times bombastic, and others poetic, and others still cool and clinical; the amount of research, time, and passion for humanity itself that went into the construction of this work has paid off. This work is a significant achievement, and an important moment that we can look back on to see whether we as a species can rise to overcome this new challenge, or whether this will be little but foreshadowing of the future we allow to follow.If you're alive right now, you owe it to yourself to read this."
162,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5225660-jouni-koskinen,2,"The issues this book is about are important and complicated and hard. The use and abuse of data and user trust is worth talking about, it's even worth shouting about.But not like this.Zuboff is alarmist, melodramatic, hyperbolic and tiring. Everything the tech companies do is not just wrong, it's a diabolic scheme to undermine the world as we know it. When something is wrong, it's never an unintended consequence, it's never human error, it's never just a silly gimmick not thought out far enough. It's always, always presented as a evil contrived mastermind plot to wreck your privacy and abuse you. And it's always presented like it's the rise of fascism in the 1930's with the most gut-wrenching tear-jerking vocabulary she could find. Get a few examples, simplify a theory somehow related to the issue, contrive a concept, give it a name like ""shadow text"" or ""behavioral surplus"" (preferably a bit ominous name), cherry pick more examples, portend doom. Rinse and repeat. And mention ""surveillance capitalism"" at least 15 times per page.It's kind of ironic that when she goes on for 700+ pages on how you should never trust these companies, that she takes their Silicon Valley hypetalk at face value. If a company claims they can do something, Zuboff gleefully integrates the claim into her narrative with zero criticism. Because it serves her point. But if a company apologises for something, it's of course disingenuous with them being the devil who wants to eat your children.By the time the book gets to behaviour manipulation, it turns from melodramatic to laughable. The obsession Zuboff has for B.F.Skinner and radical behaviorism (a 70-year-old psychology concept, the cognitive revolution would like to have a word...) is full on religious. The man wasn't wrong about anything and conditioning works on people with a hundred per cent efficiency!This is an important issue, but creating hyperbolic devils like this is not just bad writing and argumentation but counter-productive to the cause. It's just creates a shoddy boogeyman argument that is easy to shoot down.The very serious and dramatic reader Audible had for this didn't help btw. (she was very clear speaker though). "
163,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,3,"This is a really important topic and I wish I could give the book more than 3 stars. Everyone knows that the technology we are living with is unprecedented and changing the world. If we aren't careful, we will cause more harm than good. This book is about the dangers of this new information age. But there are a lot of problems with how the information is presented. First, the author uses over-the-top insulting language to describe these companies and leaders--all book long. It's so obviously biased that it undermines her points again and again, prompting lots of eyerolling--about once a page. That's minor, though. More serious is that this book is way too long. It wasn't satisfied making the point, it had to list 10 examples for every point--the full quotes, too. It read more like a college term paper that needed show every piece of research the author did. It's a very long book and it didn't need to be. Finally, the author falls prey to the worst sin in this kind of cultural criticism: she treats her worldview and personality type as the perfect ideal. There was no honest acknowledgement that her era had any flaws, only lament that the world doesn't live more like she used to, that generations will not experience what she did as a child. I very much believe that there are real dangers with only a few companies controlling the information access to the world. I've personally experienced challenges with this (Amazon just recently removed me as a listed seller of my own books, saying I need to sign up for the next level of account--at more cost--before I have the chance to be displayed as the owner of the product again). But it's a mixed bag and the author can't see past her indignation to the true complexity of the situation.So, read this for an imbalanced, overly wordy way of getting one side of the story. If it's not this book, make sure you get both sides of the story, not just the story told by Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, etc."
164,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66635467-keen,3,"3.5 Stars!“Only a few decades ago US society denounced mass behaviour-modification techniques as unacceptable threats to individual autonomy and the democratic order. Today the same practices meet little resistance or even discussion as they are routinely and pervasively deployed on the march towards surveillance revenues.”Welcome to a new and daunting landscape awash with sinister terminology like “permissionless innovation”, “digital totalitarianism”, “reality mining” and “behavioural surplus”. This is the new apparatus that dictates how we move through much of our lives, and just like most architecture out there, after a while, you almost become oblivious to the secret workings and dimensions which are influencing your behaviour and actions. And this is how the boys and girls down in Silicon Valley like it best.“The image of technology as autonomous force with unavoidable actions and consequences has been employed across the centuries to erase the fingerprints of power and absolve it of responsibility. The monster did it, not Victor Frankenstein.”Zuboff touches on many aspects surrounding surveillance capitalism, and we see the intimate relationship between the NSA and CIA and the mutual benefits to that relationship. “The agencies craved the lawlessness that a firm such as Google enjoyed.” We learn the huge significance of Section 230 and how far behind the US is behind the EU in terms of clamping down, one example being the EU law in May 2014 enforcing the right to be forgotten. She cites many sources, but without doubt the two most prominent reference points are the work of B.F. Skinner and Hannah Arendt and in particular her “The Origins of Totalitarianism”. “Google is to surveillance capitalism what the Ford Motor Company and General Motors were to mass-production-based managerial capitalism.”At one point the author sets out the four main areas of fortifications that have allowed Google to be so over protected and free to flourish away from political interference for so long, particularly in the USA,1.	Google showing their capabilities of competitive advantage in electoral politics. 2.	The deliberate blurring of public and private interests through relationships and aggressive lobbying. 3.	A revolving door of personnel who migrated between Google and the Obama administration, who shared mutual interests during Google’s crucial growth years of 2009-2016. By April 2016, 197 individuals had migrated from government to the Googlesphere and 61 had moved in the other direction. 4.	Google’s campaign of influence over academic work and the larger cultural conversation, which was vital to policy formation, public opinion and political perception. “Ford’s inventions revolutionised production. Google’s inventions revolutionised extraction and established surveillance capitalism’s first economic imperative: the extraction imperative.”This book is awash with horror stories befitting of sci-fi paperbacks. Like the one concerning Genesis Toys, who brought out, My Friend Cayla, a terrifying concept in which the child’s doll which relies on voice recognition, also harvests all sorts of data from the customer’s house. It is such a blatant violation that in 2017 Germany, (a country which knows a thing or two about surveillance), banned it as an illegal surveillance device, urging parents to destroy any such dolls in their possession.Due to the nature of this book it does have its harder going moments, but it still remains engaging, and overall Zuboff has completed a chilling, sagacious and damning book on the sinister and sophisticated ploys increasingly used in surveillance capitalism. The text is relatively, devoid of any superfluous academic verbiage, which many of these kinds of books suffer from. These companies and the people tied up with them are the people who hate big, bad words like privacy, tax and transparency. You can employ all the lawyers, lobbyists and accountants and actuaries, but when you strip it all away, what it really is a small, group of dangerous people making the rules up as they go along who have been given a suspiciously free and easy reign over how policy works around the world.Facebook has already admitted to and was even boasting about its power to influence people’s behaviour in US elections, and this was years before the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke. The billionaire owner of that company, Robert Mercer, backed Donald Trump. As Facebook is a private company it did not have to adhere to the legal standards for experimentation required of academic and government researchers. It remains to be seen what Facebook and Google cannot get away with. Providing a vast platform for hate speech, fostering chronic bullying, screening live suicides, streaming acts of terrorism. Where will the line be drawn?...Like bold, bratty toddlers they constantly challenge their boundaries and throw tantrums when anyone dare speaks out, but they needn’t worry a succession of US governments has them well protected as long as that money keeps on coming.Every law, rule or regulation is only as strong as the loopholes allow it to be. If these loopholes are known and continue to exist then we must ask why that is?... Who has the power to close them and more importantly why have they chosen not to close them?...These companies have consistently and effectively been left to self-regulate with predictable consequences. The problems have been known about the Wild West mentality of the internet for many, many years now, but yet little meaningful change has occurred, especially in the US.“Facebook’s $4.6 million in donations during the 2016 election cycle complemented its lobbying budget of $11.5 million in 2017.” But this is nothing compared to Google, which repeatedly spends more on lobbying than any other corporation, shelling out more than $18 million in 2018. It is also the second wealthiest registered lobbyist in the EU. Why are Facebook and Google choosing to spend such astronomical amounts of money?...What must they be getting in return?...What do they want?...What do they get?...Why are we not being told?...Welcome to “American Democracy”. Be afraid, be very afraid…"
165,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50996552-jp-beaty,4,"A really important text for digging out the political import of the data economy. I think the writing is slightly clumsy and I think the book underestimates the connection between Silicon Valley firms and the intelligence services/ the state. I also find the substantive responses to the issue to be a little milquetoast in comparison to the problem she diagnoses (I suppose that’s how it ended up on Obama’s books of the year list). Those problems aside at its best it is a searing look at the logic and function of the data economy. For understanding the ways that big data firms are altering society and how to think about the use and abuse of technology, this is a great book. It’s really at its best at the most conspiratorial and will leave you suspicious of what exactly your phone is doing and what Facebook ultimately wants. I’m sure posting this review will trigger a whole cascade of advertising material to make sure the big social media giants don’t loose my constant stream of crumbs I feed them. Don’t worry amazon algorithm reading this, I am much too trapped in the Skinner box to act on the suspicions raised by this book."
166,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33041497-anna,4,"“Surveillance capitalism’s antidemocratic and antiegalitarian juggernaut is best described as a market-driven coup from above. It is not a coup d’etat in the classic sense but rather a coup de gens: an overthrow of the people concealed as the technological Trojan horse that is Big Other”.This book is a huge, impressive piece of work. It feels like a relief to (at least) get some sort of overview over the way in which surveillance capitalism dominates our lives and orders society, despite the lack of suggestions for solutions. Understanding is the first step towards any form of meaningful resistance, and this feels like a solid first step :-)I do wish it were more accessible (as I do with most political theory) as its message feels like something that needs to be heard by more people than those who are willing to read 500 pages worth of academic language.Also - Zuboff’s idealization of the Henry Ford-era of capitalism rubs me the wrong way."
167,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24266382-ashley,3,"It’s been called “visionary,” but I don’t know that there’s anything entirely new here. What this felt like, to me, was a call to attention. The reader is not surprised by anything Shoshana Zuboff outlines, but is rather forced to acknowledge the problem in its entirety, all at once, in a 500-page package. That does make it feel revolutionary; Zuboff has written what very few people are willing to discuss in mainstream media, but which everyone has an inkling of, one way or another. I did find that it was a little too long-winded. It could have been significantly compressed, especially when a lot of the material was repetitive in order to emphasize certain themes and vocabulary.... and her preoccupation with B.F. Skinner was unnecessary. Zuboff was never so brilliant than when she illustrated, specifically, how Facebook and Google and Samsung (among others) are driving our behavior for their own profit, frequently at the expense of the law. I think that this strength was often drowned in vocabulary lessons and meandering observations, coming across as a little self-indulgent somewhere around the 200-page mark. It was unnecessary to spend so much time explaining Zuboff’s coined terms, such as “the uncontract”, “unprecedented”, “radical indifference”, “behavioural surplus”, and even “surveillance capitalism” itself. Especially in Part III, Zuboff’s self-indulgence became a running tangent, entire sections devoted to philosophy (and biology) lessons on the concept of “free will” and “utopia.”  In spite of that, it has definitely changed the way I think. It has also further fueled my nostalgia for a simpler time, and my distrust of social media and big corporations. The fact that it’s near-impossible to escape the clutches of these corporations is what really keeps me up at night; it’s not so much a privacy issue (I couldn’t care less if Mark Zuckerberg gets access to my old Instagram photos of cappuccinos) but rather a question of ethics. If I don’t want to give my data to third-parties, why are they able to access it anyway? If I don’t want to contribute to the rise of Facebook or Google, why are they still able to profit off of me anyway? Consent doesn’t really enter the conversation when it comes to what these rich tech companies have in mind, and evasive, incomplete privacy policies are nothing but “placebo effects” to pacify users.  Yes, I’m aware of the irony of publishing this review to Amazon-owned Goodreads.  ""Surveillance Capitalism"" is the kind of book that makes you want to throw your laptop into Lake Ontario and live in a cabin in the woods. I don’t know that I have the gumption for that kind of drastic change, but I’ll definitely think twice whenever I consider downloading an app or signing up for e-newsletters; I will certainly avoid buying any new smart devices by whatever means necessary. I do think it’s time for us to start protesting the free-reign that these conglomerates have been given, especially in North America. Our own behavior is being observed and herded by the rich 1% for financial gain; everything from our spending habits to our complacency is being mediated and controlled. I think, eventually, we have to reclaim our sense of autonomy and identity, and our understanding of reality.  Also, I just want to state for the record that I’ve always found it odd how North America experienced a period of mass rebellion, political protesting, and unrest during the 1960’s and 1970’s – and that this unrest suddenly came to a complete stop, save for a few exceptions here and there. Well, Zuboff has justified my unease, dedicating a sub-chapter to the behavior-control research conducted by the US Senate in the 70’s – research which became urgent as political protests escalated. And yes, surveillance capitalism has everything to do with it.  At the end of this heavy volume, Zuboff was really only trying to say one thing, re-stated from multiple angles: we are being rigorously and continuously exploited by capitalists. We don’t own our behavior anymore. Data collection and behavior control for the purpose of financial profit has crossed all ethical boundaries, and we as a society are content to let it happen.  This book is definitely recommended, if you have the patience and endurance to get through it. I almost didn’t. In a similar vein, I also recommend watching ‘Smithereens’, one of the recent Black Mirror episodes. Despite its melodrama, I think it has a lot of important things to say on society’s need to be “plugged in” and how this addiction is driving our lives. Some of Zuboff’s quotes that will stick with me: -“Its products are about predicting us, without actually caring what we do or what is done to us.” -“As populations grow numb, it becomes more difficult for individuals and groups to complain.” -“[Cortana] wants to know everything about you, but it does not want you to know how much it knows [...]” -“ ‘The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.’ ” [-Mark Weiser] -“Contemporary reviewers of Kahn’s book invariably seized upon the dark ‘nightmare scenarios’ of the computerized surveillance theme, the science-fiction–like forms of control that, they assumed, ‘will be actively feared and resented by many.’ Despite the wide range of scenarios that Kahn presented in his book on the distant year 2000, Kahn’s voyage into the ‘unthinkable’ was viewed by the public as a way to prepare for ‘the worst possible outcome’ in a terrifying ‘nightmare of social controls.’ Yet now, that same nightmare is rendered as an enthusiastic progress report on surveillance capitalism’s latest triumphs.” -“[…] Google wants us to accept that its rules simply reflect the requirements of autonomous processes, something that people cannot control. However, our grasp of the inner logic of surveillance capitalism suggests otherwise. Men and women made it, and they can control it. They merely choose not to do so.” -“Many people feel that if you are not on Facebook, you do not exist. People all over the world raced to participate in Pokémon Go. With so much energy, success, and capital flowing into the surveillance capitalist domain, standing outside of it, let alone against it, can feel like a lonely and risky prospect.”"

169,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85785571-laurence-lai,1,"The title “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism” evokes a weighty subject, and the book’s subtitle purports to something menacing to the future of humankind. It is to be seen if its contents are as substantial as the book’s 700-page length would suggest.The author, Shoshana Zuboff, is a professor emerita at Harvard Business School, not unimpressive an honor by any measure. A summary of assertions made in the book is as follows:1.	Big technological colossuses (Big Techs), epitomized by Google and Facebook, operate their business models by extracting data trails of online users, and in turn selling the extrapolated results (what Zuboff calls behavioral surplus) to their advertising customers.2.	Sophisticated algorithms are deployed and constantly refined to increase the predictive value of profiling data. At the same time, online users are passively served with moderated searches, federated news feeds, suggested connections, etc., all under the coercive power of the Big Techs. Such duress is as severe as not only to affect, shape, and compel, but with the aim to modify and manipulate user behaviors.3.	With the proliferation of sensors and Internet connectivity, Big Techs extend their reach far beyond the virtual realm to the real world. Regarding the surveillance operated by these techno-capitalists, in the author’s telling, its presence so pervasive and its impact so complete that any human free agency has receded entirely to the background and is ineffective.4.	While the above are not new to anyone who has casual understanding of current economics and culture, what Zuboff strives to accentuate is their connection to high-order issues such as self, liberty, democratic values, and human nature. She compares the dangers posed by “surveillance capitalism” to that of fascism, totalitarianism, behaviorist utopianism, and the like, that once presented real or potential detriments to humanity. For its thrilling effects, the agenda for the book is sweeping, even ambitious. Technological advancement, especially one that combines deep analytics, machine intelligence, and makes its ubiquitous presence in our intimate lives deserves a dispassionate evaluation as to its social impacts. Zuboff should be applauded for selecting this timely topic for her book.Yet one cannot help but feel frustrated by the lack of thematic organization of the whole book. Instead of explicating the economics involved in this different “capitalism”, Zuboff is more concerned with weaving her own narrative of abstruse euphemisms about how grave a danger the human future is facing. Materials are regurgitated, often word for word from the earlier part of the book and throughout. As to what actions Zuboff suggests to “fight for a human future…”? The author offers an ill-defined “synthetic declaration” (p. 345), and a skimpy, equally obscure advice of “friction, courage, and bearings” (p. 524). Specifics are sorely lacking in allusions to democratic institutions, public opinion, legislative and judicial recourse (p. 520). A whimper of a solution indeed to a loud bang of such a doorstopper.Zuboff obviously sets out to intend the book as a treatise that plumbs the depth of these to her as “unprecedented” developments in “surveillance capitalism”, and attempts to compare philosophically with past phenomena its manifold menaces to humanity. But it is exactly in such philosophizing that is the weakest of the book, for her arguments are at best tenuous and strained. On the other hand, the author wily limits her subject to mostly the socio-economic domain of the Western world, as is indicated in the book’s title. The picture would have been more complete if it had combined with surveillance authoritarianism. The “social credit” system practised unimpeded in China makes only passing reference in mere 6 pages (pgs. 388-394). Certainly, the threat to human liberty and dignity is far graver when the surveillance apparatus and capability are controlled by a police state, whereas in Western democracies competition among capitalists still exists. What is most infuriating is Zuboff’s penchant for fabricating catchphrases. Smug expressions such as “dispossession”, “behavioral futures”, “cultural misappropriation”, “economy of action”, “division of learning”, “shadow text”, “uncontract”, “hive”, “coup from above”, “Big Other”, “instrumentarian power”, “right to the future tense”, “third modernity*” …., litter throughout the book. The meanings of many of these are poorly articulated. Although she attempts to provide a brief rationale to her epithetic acrobatic (p. 66), such twisting of language is unnecessary and far from successful. It is an act of throwing spaghetti upon the wall; hoping that somehow one such phrase may stick with posterity with reference made to the author. As stated, the impression appears that the writer is more interested in weaving an esoteric narrative than presenting facts. Read a typical sentence on p. 488 of the book:“No exit” is the necessary condition for Big Other to flourish, and its flourishing is the necessary condition for all that is meant to follow: the tides of behavioral surplus and their transformation into revenue, the certainty that will meet every market player with guaranteed outcomes, the bypass of trust in favor of the uncontract’s radical indifference, the paradise of effortless connection that exploits the needs of harried second-modernity individuals and transforms their lives into the means to others’ ends, the plundering of the self, the extinction of autonomous moral judgment for the sake of frictionless control, the actuation and modification that quietly drains the will to will, the forfeit of your voice in the first person in favor of others’ plans, the destruction of the social relations and politics of the old and slow and still-unfulfilled ideals of self-determining citizens bound to the legitimate authority of democratic governance.” Long sentences can be beautiful in abler literary hands, but the above is downright egregious in form and meaning. Zuboff’s writing style can be aptly depicted as beating around the bush, with hyperboles and a plethora of inapt metaphors that ill befits so serious a subject she wants to convey. At times, she relishes so much staying with her metaphoric vehicles that the intended tenors are nowhere to be found. Long, winding sentences with chained substantives also further hamper readability.So, are readers more empowered at the end “with a more cogent and comprehensive understanding” (p. 18) of the menacing incursion exerted by the Big Techs? For the newly initiated, the writing style has done more to obfuscate than to illuminate. For the more inclined and those who look for some concrete societal antidotes, Zuboff has woefully under-delivered. More clear-eyed analyses are still awaited on the technologies proffered by the Big Techs, on the associated data-driven economy, and their consequent impacts to individuals and society at-large. * cf. Alan de Vulpian, 2003 (English , 2008)"

173,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4679583-myles,3,"This week my company officially got into the business of surveillance. People will pay us to surveil their home and business computers to protect them from rogue computer software, from losing data resulting from defective or aging components in their computers, and from misguided management of their computers themselves.Going forward this will be a growing and lucrative business segment because people rely on their computers to do so many important things for them, because they feel inadequate keeping up with changes in the computing environment, and because they justifiably fear cyber crime.It doesn’t mean they like it. I sure don’t.Being in retail business as I have for almost 25 years I have learned how to surveil myself, to protect my assets, and my employees. It is an ongoing challenge and it changes. I surveil for shoplifters, for currency and credit card counterfeiters, for daylight and after hours thieves. I surveil for dishonest employees, for honest mistakes, for poor buying decisions, and for the obsolescence of the products on my shelves. I surveil how the bank handles my money. I surveil my suppliers to prevent them from shipping me incomplete or broken goods. And I pay attention to my customers, to save them from making poor purchasing decisions.And when I am not surveilling, I am surveying. All the time. How were my customers’ experiences? What new products are on the horizon? How can I protect my liquidity, my profitability, and lastly, my sanity.I especially surveil myself, because I make mistakes, and because I too am growing old.These are some of the risks of operating a business.Then there are the people who surveil me. They include thieves looking for a weakness in my security. Government agencies to make sure I am paying the eight or ten different taxes I pay on an ongoing basis. Credit card companies surveil my transactions to make sure somebody hasn’t stolen my credit card, or that I am spending no more money than I can afford to pay back. My suppliers make sure I am paying them on time. Some manufacturers visit me in person or electronically to make sure I am representing their product lines fairly. They send me electronic training, and tests, and they regularly measure the efficiency and quality of our repair facilities. The utilities tell me when my operations (and home) are inefficient. And there are my landlords.Finally, we surveil at home. We surveil our daughter to make sure she is doing her homework and not falling in with the wrong crowd. My wife surveils me to make sure I’m not overeating, overspending, or being overly attentive to other women. I surveil my dog Seamus just in case he poops on the neighbour’s lawn so I can pick it up before someone notices. And Seamus surveils the front window and barks whenever a neighbouring dog saunters by. Last and not least are the gargantuan corporations who are watching what I do online. People like facebook, Google, amazon, and many, many more.So when somebody writes a book to tell me I live in an Age of Surveillance Capitalism...I GET IT! REALLY, I GET IT!But is it uniquely capitalist, or more generally an age of surveillance?And if it is more general to our society, where do we go from here?One thing for sure: it isn’t going away anytime soon.Shoshana Zuboff concentrates her guns on Google and facebook. She’s concerned that these companies are inherently different from the companies that came before it and they set a new standard for egregious capitalism. They are companies in the prediction business, predicting human behaviour and right now largely predicting purchasing behaviour by accumulating, as she called it, “surplus behaviour,” which kinda sounds like an oxymoron. She believes they abuse the freedoms of the marketplace to frustrate privacy, that they are built to enrich few and sidestep the traditional workplace which pays many employees fairly and creates consumers, and she argues that they are indifferent to social ills.She argues that Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” doesn’t operate in this marketplace because the new knowledge capitalists know everything happening in the market.A close reading of Andrew Carnegie’s life and legacy, perhaps John D. Rockefeller as well, could lead you to a similar conclusion, even though both men turned to philanthropy later in life. For sure, these men affected the course of capitalism.Is this a turn away from “good” capitalism toward an inherently evil capitalism?And if it is evil, can we create some rules for the big guys that us little guys can live with?Let’s take a step back and look at things in context: Google’s revenue is about $25 billion, Facebook’s $17 billion. The entire US economy is about $25 trillion and the world economy upwards of $107 trillion. Most of Google’s and Facebook’s revenue is advertising. The US advertising market is upwards of $80 billion so it is fair to say these two firms command quite strong positions in this industry. If you make the argument that America’s advertising industry is too concentrated then you’d have a pretty good argument to break up these firms which combined represent about 50% of all advertising dollars in the US. By comparison, Standard Oil at its peak commanded 88% of the market for processing crude. In its first year of operation, US Steel produced 67% of steel produced the the US.And they exhibit the classic behaviour of monopolists by dominating the markets for search and for social media on a global scale.In the US a case for breaking up the firms traditionally would have to be made that consumers are paying too much for their services or that competitors are being kept out of the market. Maybe breaking up these firms is a good idea, maybe it isn’t, but either way the technologies they employ for gathering, and analyzing, data isn’t going away.When I worked as an auditor, we used to gather lots of data, too, but what we eventually learned was that we could make assumptions about its meaning by sampling the information; that is, we cut down our work by only looking at some of the data. We tried to cut down on the wasted time. I sometimes wonder how much of what Google does is a total waste of time because the answers it seeks can be found in much faster time using much less data. And how much of “Big Data” is in fact a “Big Waste of Time.”Zuboff doesn’t consider that these firms may still be just in the early stages of figuring out what they are supposed to be doing. I think about it because so much time and resources are wasted paying attention to wholly irrelevant stuff.But we would do well to consider the affect of these companies on our freedoms and our government partially because they aren’t just national problems. They are transnational problems. What happens in China, and the extreme kind of surveillance practiced there on ethnic minorities like the Uigers, affects or will affect us here.They are transnational because the data collection is transnational and the very same data collected for the purpose of selling advertising is probably being used to develop artificial intelligence. The fastest developer of AI whether they be Chinese companies, transnational companies like Google or Facebook, or companies directly financed by government will have a big say in who has a job in the coming years and who doesn’t.No country on its own can hope to curb data collection and aggregation or perhaps more importantly, the control of what search results reveal on this scale any more than a country can curb money laundering, tax avoidance, or climate change without coordination between many if not all nations. Contemporary politics seems to be going in the opposite direction if Trump’s “America First,” Brexit, and Russian adventurism are any indication. If we are divided and our attention fractured we are susceptible to the influence or real or imagined “experts.” (To firms like Facebook I think we all have ADD, attention deficit disorder...they can never get enough of our attention!) That doesn’t mean we cannot continue to make decisions affecting our government, it more likely means that the decisions we make will more commonly resemble the imperatives of those desiring more of the same, read: the status quo.And that turns us to the question of how good is the status quo. If you believe that the universe ultimately bends toward the dilution of energy, total entropy, then the status quo is not too good. If you believe the status quo to be a teleological evolution toward a great singularity, perhaps a union with God, and a progression toward greater complexity in the universe, the status quo looks pretty good.Business executives, in my experience, tend to be of the more optimistic latter type of people. Like the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world and other people who have become incredibly wealthy in a short period of time.In the meantime, some of us have rather pedestrian concerns like the security of really private information. While convincingly arguing that there is insufficient transparency over who handles the big data and how they handle it, I think Zuboff fails to sufficiently weigh immense risk that the data will fall out of control of the aggregators and into the hands of rogue individuals.The hacking of credit card databases is one thing, and I think it a bigger risk than the hacking of a database which tells people how I like my hotdogs dressed. People made a big deal of the Cambridge Analytica scare. In the end, those people sold bogus claims to naive political organizations. The data predicted nothing and was of no use to anybody. And it didn’t get Donald Trump elected.Certainly big data aggregation has concrete effects on the economy. You get “free” Google searches. I get a cheaper smart TV because the data guys get first dibs on my TV watching preferences.This book is not the best guide for the good works these technologies enable (ie crowd sourcing, scientific research, epidemiology, etc). Self-driving cars benefit by machine learning. The acceleration and reductions in the friction in electronic commerce are generally good things.I don’t agree with Zuboff that the behavioural science behind the new data aggregation firms promotes a radical indifference to the lot of the common person. Nor do I agree that hyperscale doesn’t require competitive markets or for that matter democracy.This has yet to be proven.We all need participatory democracy, and more than ever on a global scale. Let’s make these damn machines work for us, not agin us."
174,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26854448-m-a,5,"This is a brilliant and important book about the future of mankind.It is unfortunately very difficult to read, due not only to the complexity of the subject matter, but also due to the constant use by the author of jargon and long complicated sentences. This is very ironic, considering that this book is intended as a warning and a call to action to the general public against the machinations of the Surveillance Capitalist elite. I can only hope that a more accessible version of this book will be published to accomplish that goal.Zuboff claims that surveillance capitalism is as big a change for our society as industrial capitalism was more than two centuries ago.It all started with Google, followed closely by Facebook, Microsoft and eventually by all digital industries.Google started collecting our private data (from our search terms on Google search, to our emails on Gmail, to our location data on Google Maps, our data stored on our Android devises etc..) without our knowledge or consent and turning them into predictions about our future behavior, which they sold for profit to marketers.Zuboff calls Google ""privacy kleptomaniacs"". She compares Google to the Spanish conquistadores invading the natives on the American continent and declaring the continent theirs by a monarchical edict declaring it so. So did Google invade our private data by declaring it theirs through obscure unilaterally imposed terms of service.She calls this data, the new raw material of capitalism ""Behavioral Surplus"".She traces the architecture of this new form of capitalism from its supply routes to its ""behavioral futures markets"".The production of digital data has far outpaced the human capacity to process/make sense of that data.Therefore, behavioral psychologists and data scientists have created algorithms to predict an individual's future behavior based on the billions of raw data of his/her every move and every thought.They use the 5 factor personality model, the 6 emotion model, affective computing, emotional analytics and sentiment analysis to predict our personalities and our future behavior.Surveillance Capitalists are prediction factories, based on raw materials from us.Google and co don't sell the raw data, they sell behavioral predictions based on that data.That information is not only useful to marketers, but to anyone with an interest in that knowledge and an interest in influencing that future behavior.Some examples of benefits of knowing a person's future behavior with very great accuracy include: predicting disease, financial risk, criminal risk, consumer preferences and political views. This knowledge about the future allows corporations to eliminate all risks in their business dealings.Zuboff calls this predictive data the ""shadow text"".This shadow text is only available to surveillance capitalists through their data extractions and algorithms.It is about us but not for us.Us being unaware of the surveillance is the precondition for surveillance capitalism to function properly- we are to remain unaware of the shadow text. Even if raw data are shared with us, the shadow data crafted for prediction purposes is not accessible to us.Remote digital observation and tele-stimulation ( the ""god view"") allows for distancing of the observed as ""the other"".Zuboff calls the Surveillance Capitalists the ""Big Other"".""The market reduces us to our behavior, transformed into another fictional commodity and packaged for others' consumption"" We are to be monitored and tele stimulated.Zuboff demonstrates how surveillance capitalism has expanded beyond cyberspace into our everyday life.Even the human body is treated as a computer, containing data in order to provide corporations certainty of profit.Take wearables for example: they form an unobtrusive integration to everyday life- internet connected fabrics, fitness trackers, diabetes apps etc.Zuboff quotes a study that shows that apps downloaded on a smart phone extract location data, contact lists, photos & videos etc without express consent of the user and that they sell this data to third parties.According to Zuboff, these companies' privacy policies should be called ""surveillance policies"".She predicts we will all end up with chips in our bodies for better surveillance, like animals. Telemetry is already used on animals to study their behavior. Humans will be next.We are already tracked in our cars, in our homes, in our kidneys (dialysis devices).By 2020, there will be 20 billion intelligent devices with the capability of tracking and monitoring us.Zuboff calls whatever data that is not yet tracked ""dark data"". Surveillance Capitalists are intent on tracking all behavior that is not (yet) informatized.They want to monetize every aspect of our lives, the entire human experience. They want to turn our entire life into profit for themselves.Power was once identified with the ownership of the means of production.Now power rests in the ownership of the means of behavioral prediction and behavioral modification of the other. Now our lives are turned into data without our knowledge or consent in order to benefit others.Zuboff explains how the system of Surveillance Capitalism is grounded in behavioral psychology.The goal of behaviorism is the prediction and control of behavior- the human being is nothing but an organism, an ""it"". According to behaviorists a human is in essence no different than a mushroom, only a bit more complex.Behaviorists (eg Skinner and Pentland) believe humans have no freedom of will, no autonomy, no agency. Freedom of will is an illusion. It is the environment that controls behavior. Individual behavior is caused by variables lying outside the individual himself.Hence the belief by behaviorists that behavioral control can lead to predicting future behavior with scientific accuracy. Behavior must be studied w/o limits and w/o knowledge of the ""organism"".Privacy is an illusion just like freedom- they must be forfeited in favor of the good life.BUT this view was meant to benefit all of humanity; the knowledge gained through behavioral tracking was to be used to improve human behavior towards a better future for humanity: fighting disease, crime, poverty etc..Instead, behaviorism has been hijacked by surveillance capitalism to benefit only the small class of surveillance capitalists and their customers. The lost freedom only affects us but the acquired knowledge and profit is all theirs.What are the dangers of Surveillance Capitalism?The more one knows about a person, the easier it is to control him.Besides being used for targeted marketing, knowledge of personal data can also be used to blackmail, defame, harass and discriminate against us.The dangers lie not only in corporate surveillance itself and the accompanying loss of privacy, but even more worrisome, in corporate mind manipulation and corporate behavioral modification, such as the creation of conformity and obedience but also the creation of desires that benefit commerce and emotions that benefit politicians. Surveillance capitalists wants ALL of you- your behavior, your thoughts, your emotions, your personality- so they can manipulate your behavior. Will you have any autonomy, any free will left? Surveillance Capitalism is not only a danger to privacy, but a danger to democracy which depends on autonomous moral judgment and individual determination and free will. Zuboff believes in free will as the basis for individuality, self determination, and the right to decide our future (She calls it ""The right to the future tense"").The right to be one's author of one's future should be cast as a human right-necessary because it is imperiled by ""the panvasive digital architecture of behavioral modification owned and operated by surveillance capital, necessitated by its economic imperatives and driven by its laws of motion, all for the sake of its guaranteed outcomes""Will Google, FB and co. lead to digital totalitarianism? According to Zuboff the answer is no, because the past offers no adequate compass for this new phenomenon.Zuboff calls the future of Surveillance Capitalism ""Instrumentarianism"".Totalitarianism, as impersonated by Hitler and Stalin was only understood after the facts. It entails the destruction of all human ties except total loyalty to the movement (fascism or communism). It operates through the means of violence, terror and fear- all who do not conform, the enemies of the ""people"", are executed.Instrumentarianism behaves through the means of behavioral modification.And, unlike in a totalitarian regime, there is no need to use force . All you need is adequate human engineering.""Instrumentarianism"" is a behaviorally controlled society, in which knowledge replaces freedom. In such a society, social change can be generated by social pressure from social networks to ""go with the flow, stay with the herd, return to the hive and take flight with the flock"". Identity yields to synchrony.Such a society leads to the death of individuality. The collective intelligence knows best and individuality is only unnecessary friction towards that goal.Instrumentarian society with its architecture of behavioral control, social pressure and asymmetrical power is a Panopticon - there is no exit possible.Once it was believed that there is no exit from an all knowing and all powerful God.Under Instrumentarianism, there will be no exit from the others, big other and the surveillance capitalists. Big Other knows no boundaries.Zuboff pleads for the right to sanctuary.It is a universal need for a safe refuge, for shelter.This right is as ancient as human history; originally it manifested itself in the form of a city, or a temple. Later on this right extended to the home: a sanctuary from arbitrary intrusion. Psychologists agree that this is important for development of the self and for mental health. With Big Other, the Universe takes up residence within our walls, there is no refuge. (thinkof internet connected security cameras, light switches, thermostats, appliances, rumbas, wearables,smart phones, tooth brushes, beds, personal assistants, TVs, toys,etc etc).What solution does Zuboff propose to avert the coming Instrumentarian Society?To just stop using the internet and internet connected devices?Surveillance Capitalists offer solutions to social connection, access to information, time saving convenience and ""illusionary"" support and this got us all addicted. It is not reasonable to expect us to go off the grid.Privacy regulation and monopoly regulation is inefficient at combating those risks- it will not be solved by encryption, anonymization or discussion of data ownership. This is a new condition that outruns the law, that has not been tamed by law. Zuboff discusses very briefly the new regulatory regime operating in the EU since May 2018, the GDPR ( General Data Protection Regulation). The GDPR is a good step forward, but only time will tell if it will be efficient in vanquishing surveillance capitalism's instrumentarian power. The individual is powerless against the surveillance capitalist machine because of asymmetrical power and knowledge. Only collective action on the ground, such as class actions, will determine if GDPR will be effective.Regulators will be up against well funded corporate lawyers and lobbyists.Zuboff concludes that Surveillance Capitalism is profoundly anti democratic. It is a market coup from above on the people. It is a form of tyranny, of absolutism; it imposes its rules from above; everyone except the tyrant is just an organism, the ""other one"", to be exploited for the profit of the tyrant.Industrial revolution has led to near destruction of our planet and extinction of many species. Instrumentarianism will lead to extinction of our individuality.Zuboff points to the critical role of public opinion on changing the laws. She proclaims passionately:It is NOT ok to strip search us for profit.It is a human expectation to be the author of one's life.There is still time to redirect the action to a future that we can call home.It is our responsibility to right was has gone wrong.We have to be indignant because this is an attack on human dignity.Freedom from uncertainty is no freedom.She refuses to seed the future to illegitimate power.She demands a human future.She calls the world to action to declare the digital future to be a human future."
175,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42693079-ryan-o-neill,4,"This ambitious and expansive book aims to define and explain the rise of surveillance capitalists like Google, Facebook and Microsoft as they play ever larger roles in our lives. Shoshana Zuboff briefly maps out the history of some of these companies and delves into the way in which they gradually encroach on our lives in ever more frightening ways.She argues persuasively that while sometimes driven by old capitalist imperatives, these companies represent a break from past eras such as that of industrial capitalism as they secretly and aggressively gather increasing amounts of personal information from us, but not for our benefit; rather than the traditional business-customer reciprocities, surveillance capitalists plunder every element of our lives, both online and offline, for the benefit of advertisers, and ultimately serve their economic benefit.Under surveillance capitalism, we are no longer the customers (although practices are often disguised under the auspices of 'personalisation') but rather our searches, browsing history, friends, likes, reactions, emotions and feelings are raw materials to be scraped for the benefit of companies who are free to operate outside the boundaries of traditional democracy and regulation. Our rights are ruthlessly and carelessly cast aside and rendered obsolete in this relentless pursuit of behavioural surplus without which surveillance capitalists cannot grow.These companies encroach upon our personal space in ever more intrusive ways - from the original Google Street View controversy in the mid-2000s to Facebook's hidden methods of gleaning info on our preferences, to TVs that listen to you, wearable devices, Alexa house alarms and even toys that listen to you, to the fight for our car dashboards. The speed and aggression is such that after initial outrage, we are worn down, helpless and numbed, resigned to our fate.Surveillance capitalism, Zuboff argues, attempts to create certainty of outcome for its actual customers - its advertisers. This is done by parsing human behaviour, exploiting feelings, emotions and beliefs even when we don't permit it to, so that our individual freedom, our rights to define our own experience, and to act and think in private are eroded as we are continuously moulded and directed towards specific courses of action by these companies. The inherent uncertainty that exists within how we think, how we act and interact - our right to an effective life - is replaced by collective certainty at the hands of surveillance capitalism.Zuboff also mines the effects of social media on young people's development. As they journey from being defined by their relationships at a young age to becoming separate from but connected to others in adulthood, young people are adversely affected by social media and its imperatives to forcing people to see themselves 'from the outside in' and define themselves based on the experiences and lives of others. The pervasiveness of social media means people often struggle to disconnect, their mental health even suffering from brief separation from their accounts. This crucially and savagely inhibits their ability to look inward and make that journey from people defined by their relationships in youth, to autonomous individuals who have relationships in adulthood.Zuboff argues that while the advent of new laws such as GDPR in Europe have been helpful, surveillance capitalism's overall success in evading proper regulation and legal scrutiny means that decisive action will depend on a turning of public opinion. Lots of us are passive about our distrust of social media, but it will take a re-establishment of indignation, a renewal of outrage, if we are to have any chance of stemming the flow.The book is a heavy undertaking; more than 500 pages long and often written in rather academic prose, and it can occasionally be quite dense and abstract. Given the ubiquity of technology in all of our lives, it could undoubtedly be more reader-friendly, and perhaps focus on more real-life examples that we are all familiar with. Despite its wealth of information, Xuboff's proposed solutions are vague, and it is arguably unclear what exactly you as an individual can do personally to reduce the insidious influence of surveillance capitalism in your everyday life; what strategies can be used to repell Facebook from building a strong profile based on your preferences, for example? Is there a feasible path to effective life without being on Facebook?Furthermore, it would have been helpful to have some more analysis on the gathering of information not related to economics - the how and why of information kept either by governments or corporations on citizens for reasons not linked to monetary benefits.Nevertheless, this is a hugely informative, well researched and important book on a subject which, as the author herself notes, is a story still unfolding and which still has some way to run. It's likely that many updates and more reader-friendly analyses on surveillance capitalism will follow, but this is a fantastic launch-pad for one of the defining issues of our time."
176,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45700308-tanmay-srivastava,1,"Shoshana Zuboff's book was highly recommended, was part of multiple lists and had glowing reviews on Goodreads. I was quite excited to pick it up and start reading.  Without calling it out, Zuboff treats incremental technological progress as a zero sum game. A win for the tech companies is a loss to someone. Take, for example when Zuboff talks about connected cars . She says an insurance company can stall a car if the premiums are not paid. She beats up this argument and brings up a case of how an elderly couple had to choose between car payments and medicine, which came to light only when the collection officers turned up at the door. A crowdfunding campaign was launched to help them and it had a happy ending. Using software however would have meant that this would have never happened. She fails to recognize that her example is the exception and not the norm. She chooses to ignore the positive impact connected cars would have on say, cars getting stolen going down leading to lower premiums or reduced premiums for drivers using their cars less or rewarding good drivers by reducing their premiums. Maybe, with such technological advances premiums would fall to such an extent that the couple wouldn't have to worry about premium payments altogether? She fails to acknowledge that progress is not a zero sum game. Tech companies have been bashed quite a bit through the book. There is no nod of appreciation for the positive impact they have had on societies. Here, In India - products of these tech companies are helping small businesses make moves that wouldn't have been possible before. Expensive POS Machines have been skipped (the same way how landlines didn't make it to parts of India but mobile phones did) in favor of Google Pay (QR Codes for Bank to Bank transfers). Book keeping doesn't required expensive licenses and can be managed online. Whatsapp is used to sell/communicate/deliver orders. YouTube is a learning platform for many, and a medium for news outside of the traditional media. The jobs these tech companies have created in India, directly and indirectly, also cannot be overlooked. There's a section where Zuboff talks about fake news and its impact on Brexit and the 2016 US Election. While I do agree fake news is a very big issue, the issue of voter discretion cannot be overlooked. In Zadie Smith's essay on Brexit -  ""Fences""  she writes how someone voted one way in referendum to get rid of the health secretary. Would it have been different if it was not targeted to a particular group (via the likes of Cambridge Analytica)? Would the results of Brexit and the 2016 US Election have been the same if there was no Facebook? Are we giving these incidents more importance than they deserve? ""Who knows?"" - I don't. I don't think we can ever conclusively state yes or no. The biggest issue is that a lot of topics covered in the book are in the grey area. Is it okay to give someone hungry a burger from McDonald's? The burger will make sure that they don't go hungry, but it's not a healthy meal. Can they afford to have a healthy meal? Can they stay hungry? Is there a way to grow healthy food to feed everyone? Is there a way to make everyone want/enjoy the healthy food? This sort of reasoning should have been the core of the book. You cannot do without technology companies today. Google, Microsoft, Facebook are essential parts of our day to day lives. Is there a business model where these companies can make enough money to create products that add value without compromising on data to drive revenue? Is there a market for people to pay for their services without any data getting collected? Do people bother to dig deep in their account settings to switch off optional data collection? Do people care? I feel the book is not asking the right questions needed to drive policy discussions. Data privacy is an important topic. The book is well researched in parts but jumps into pages of wishful thinking. The conclusions drawn are biased. The facts are presented in a way to scare you, and similar to how likes are garnered on social media with scary/angry posts, this book has scared people into giving it 5 stars on Goodreads. I wish this book was not one sided as it was - Not recommended."
177,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27470888-cool-breeze,1,"The subject of this book is very important. Unfortunately, this book fails miserably at contributing anything useful to the discussion. It is mind-numbingly long at 691 pages and an ordeal to read. Zuboff takes a few observations on surveillance technology issues and uses pretentious academic jargon to fluff them into this execrable doorstop of a book. The book does not offer any practical solutions to the issues she raises. A good editor could have reduced this to a pamphlet or a web article without leaving much notable out.This is possibly the worst non-fiction book I have ever read. I dreaded resuming it every time I picked it up and finally abandoned it on page 158. If I should ever be stuck on a desert island with only this book for reading material, I will be thankful at least that I have an abundant supply of toilet paper.Zuboff is a sociologist and the language she employs is tortured and tedious in the extreme. She insists on coining lots of neologisms and wallowing in her jargon. Amusingly, her favorite term is Behavioral Surplus, or BS for short. The book could have saved countless pages if she reduced a lot of her BS to abbreviations. Perhaps such Heideggerian writing impresses her academic colleagues, but it is excruciating for the average reader. She beats her core points to death – within the first 100 pages she must have repeated some version of the following point dozens of times – ‘the user isn’t the customer, nor are they the product, they are the raw material that is used to create the product’. You could have cut many more pages by limiting this point to three repetitions. It is as if she thinks her readers are idiots, or else she has dementia and doesn’t remember what she wrote a page or two ago. Even worse, Zuboff is a Luddite and a hard-core leftist. She obviously thinks the Industrial Revolution was largely a disaster. On page 11, she writes “industrial civilization… threatens to cost us the earth”. By page 12, she is hyperventilating “The industrial legacy of climate chaos fills us with dismay, remorse and fear”. No, it doesn’t. The reason Trump is President and the US has repudiated stupid climate treaties is that so many American voters think this is a non-issue or a very low priority (#18 out of 19 in a recent survey). On page 22, she writes that she has been inspired by a rogues' gallery of leftists, including Karl Marx, Theodor Adorno, Jean-Paul Sartre and Thomas Piketty (Robert Reich and Rachel Carson, who is responsible for millions of deaths, are also mentioned favorably). On page 33, she likens her great-grandparents fleeing the oppression of 1908 Russia to the oppression of the nuclear family (you poor, fragile snowflake!). On page 38 she viciously criticizes Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, although she admits their policies pulled the country out of the stagflation and “malaise” of the Jimmy Carter years. Unbelievably, Zuboff apparently thinks airline deregulation was a bad thing. On page 42, she is writes approvingly of rioters in London (she really should read some Theodore Dalrymple on the real problems involved) and the dilettante, astroturf Occupy “movement”. On page 43, she comments disapprovingly on those who would “pare regulations, cut taxes… and shrink entitlements”. Heaven forbid that anyone should want to take an ax to the leviathan state! By page 109, she is bemoaning the Supreme Court’s rejection of restrictions on political speech, “hate speech” (meaning anything she and her politically correct brethren disagree with), pornography (yeah, she’s puritanical as well as a Luddite) and free association. What a pinch-faced scold!Only at this point does she admit that her arch-villain, Google, has been totally in bed with the left-wing Obama administration, using their surveillance technology to mastermind his two Presidential campaigns and running a revolving door operation with 258 employees moving between Google and the Obama regime. Whoops! How inconvenient! It’s almost like leftism and this creepy surveillance technology go hand in hand! Curiously, in a 691-page book, the word “Clinton” does not appear even once in the 26-page index! I wonder who was President from 1996 to 2001, Google’s first five years? Or who was Hillary’s biggest corporate campaign contributor? It is a complete mystery, according to this book. Zuboff doesn’t actually appear to be a Clinton fan, so maybe she just doesn’t want to wind up adding to the Arkancide body count like Jeffrey Epstein.Zuboff must have felt terrible about documenting the extent of Obama’s collusion with Google’s abuses, because within a few pages she is back to bashing mainstream conservative organizations such as the Federalist Society, Heritage Action, Americans for Tax Reform and the Cato Institute as “Far Right”. Anyone to the right of Marx, Lenin and Mao is apparently “Far Right” to Zuboff.Chapter 5 elaborates Googles expanding abuses from 2009-2016. The Europeans attempt some pushback, but the US is feckless or oblivious. Just who controlled the government that was supposed to be preventing such abuses during this time? Zuboff couldn’t possibly guess, even if you spotted her an O, B and M. During this period, Zuboff’s Harvard Business School colleagues ride to the defense of Yelp, perhaps the only tech company more loathsome than Google.Strangely, Zuboff admits there were a number of potentially effective policy fixes being seriously considered in the years before 9/11. Why not revive those ideas and build a political coalition of like-minded classical-liberals, libertarians, small-government conservatives and Trump supporters (the tech giants being no friends of Trump) to implement them? She points out that the national security agencies are obstacles. Well, after Brennan, Comey, Holder and Lynch, a lot of people on the right need no further persuasion that the FBI, CIA and the rest of the Deep State are utterly corrupt rogue agencies. Zuboff doesn’t appear to consider this a possibility. I guess working with those icky right wingers is completely out of the question. Even worse, such allies are never going to go along with replacing the tech elite with the “benevolent” socialist dictatorship of Zuboff and her Harvard faculty elite. As it turns out, Zuboff’s problem is not so much with the creepy technology, it is that the creepy technology is not under the control of “enlightened” leftists like her and her comrades in academia and government.That was as much as I could take. I skimmed the book for any sign of practical solutions in the pages to come and, finding none, I abandoned the book on page 158.I agree with Zuboff that the tech giants represent a grave threat. However, if her prescription of more government and more socialism is the only alternative, I guess I will just have to find ways to live with it. The only thing worse than surveillance capitalism is surveillance statism run by socialist do-gooder “elites” like Zuboff, who always think they know better and want to engage in social engineering. Do you think the Chinese people would prefer annoying Google ads or their oppressive and ubiquitous social credit scores? The only people I would less like to see in control of this technology than Page, Brin and Zuckerberg are Zuboff and her comrades.In the nearer term, there are still practical steps one can take to mitigate the problem. Don’t use Google products. Use DuckDuckGo for search. Don’t use Gmail or Chrome. Use a good ad blocker, like AdBlockPlus on all devices. Don’t buy creepy surveillance technology like Nest, Ring or Alexa. Delete your Facebook account. Don’t use Twitter, it’s a surveillance sewer.

178,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65435043-alan-tennyson,5,"I pored over this book, stayed with the words. Read and reread them. Drank deeply from their wisdom.  It was not an easy read, but ultimately it gave far more than it took. The Age of Surveillance Capitalism is a seminal text for our age. Zuboff's account of surveillance capitalism is elegant, poised and persuasive. Yet for all her brilliance, Shonanna's central thesis suffers some fundamental flaws.  Where The Age is at it's strongest is in the articulation of surveillance capitalism. Consider this, 'Who owns your face?', 'Who owns your behaviour?' What you do, where you go, who you know, all this has value and extracting value from these data is the business model of the surveillance capitalist.  But this is only the description, where Zuboff's account takes a darker turn, is in control. Once Surveillance Capitalists have provided a description of you, the next logical step is to determine how much this description can be used to predict and control you. Zuboff's account of these processes is beautifully rendered in perfect proses.  Know thyself, unless you don't like what you find, then, deny thyself, and pretend you are other. Zuboff goes for the latter.  We are born of this place, this pale blue dot, we are natural phenomena. Yet despite these self-evident truths, many continue to advance the notion that we apes are exceptional.  We are somehow other than the mere organisms with whom we share our earth and almost our entire genetic structure. Zuboff takes issue with humans being described as 'mere organisms'.  She is caged by this ideology of human exceptionalism, and it weakens her thesis considerably.  There are sacred cows here, and sacred cows will invariably be slaughtered.  The first heifer into the meat factory is autonomy. Shoshana strips us of our relations, our context and connections. She exalts 'autonomy' but fails to grapple with the weakness of the presumptions it contains. This leads her to assert that humans are and ought to be autonomous.  But Zuboff fails to address that we are born free, but everywhere in chains. From the traffic light to the electric chair, we are already in a context that seeks to control our behaviour. What does she think education and justice are? If not systems of changing our behaviour? But it's more than this, it's a scientific reality, we are our contexts, our environment, they shape us as we shape them.  This is a reality that an insistence on 'Freedom' cannot wish away.   For me, the issue is not that we are organisms', we are.  It is not that we are miraculous rational deities, we are not.  We need to embrace our human frailty, stare it down since we are wiser for this knowledge.  Here again, Zuboff takes issues with what she calls the 'ideology of human frailty'.  Respectfully I would ask that we,  put down our pride and look hard in the mirror, human frailty is not an ideology, it is a fundamental truth. We are 'mere organisms' and to claim anything else is to cling to a pernicious ideology. An ideology that has prompted human dominion over earth and animals, and all the ecological genocide that follows."

In fact, in a time like this I wish there was a more complex rating system than 5 stars. I digress.This was, in many ways, the first of its kind. There have, in my view, yet to be too many intelligent take downs of the dangers of big data. There is,of course, a brief mentioning of the a similar subject in many other modern texts - but not to this degree.So, you ask, what the hell is surveillance capitalism. It is, a term coined by the author. She first presented the concept publicly in 2014, in an article, where she described it as such :""[surveillance capitalism is a] radically dissembled and extractive variant of information capitalism"" based on the commodification of ""reality"" and its transformation into behavioral data for analysis and sales""*---- IN this book she presents the story of how it is that we have gotten to such a point in history, where the sentence in her 2014 article could even be spoken. In this she gives a small run down of facebook and google, and explains the origins of these sights in relation to their users. User-ship on these web pages began without much craziness, but as we all know many pages which were once small e.g. facebook, google, and youtube have more or less all become huge power houses of influence. They have now followings in the billions. This is presently praised by these web pages as a good thing. Initially. well. The servers couldn't take it. There was too much damn data. And its all so useless.Or is it?It was, with this question, in the eyes of zuboff, that this form of capitalism** was born. The data not only need not be an annoyance, but it could be a pathway towards making money. 'Perhaps', these tech giants thought 'we could predict the users behaviors by paying attention to the patterns in data'. Alas. we are truly all creatures of habit. Long story short. A great deal of people in the industrial world are using certain pages on the internet in ways that are useful for targeting for sales. This of course can eventually be sold to governments blah blah blah. Ask yourself. are you ok with people predicting your behaviors to increase user experience? What about to protect you? What about to just watch you?These are questions the book will make you reflect on.Overall, I think this was one of the most apropos books I have read in awhile towards understanding some issues in modernity.86/100 stars.Recommended for:Those thinking about big data in its prediction of human behaviorthose who dont trust facebook and googlethose worried about internet privacythose thinking about the future path of society*Hey guess what.

Market and industrial capitalism are declining, long live surveillance capitalism say the social media giants, in whose tentacles it is we, rather than any thing useful for us as humans, who are grasped .It’s a bit long and at times repetitive, like Das Kapital, but it’s not really a criticism of the book, as the amount of research and work Zuboff must have done to produce this dizzying analysis of the current state of digital technology and its impact on us, is breathtaking. It’s the resistance to surveillance capitalism’s imperatives that she leaves as the challenge for society at the end of the book... How is that done when we hunger so much for its crumbs and are so addicted to the precision targeting of its algorithms?"
188,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86841474-aaron-lewis,1,"Here, a capitalist argues that Facebook and Google's approach to capitalism is a ""rogue"" capitalism, and represents an unprecedented threat to liberalism. The argument is blind to how Big Tech's surveillance is merely the most recent and sophisticated manifestation of capitalism's inherent drive to extract value; advertising and media companies have for centuries made a business of surveillance and control. But acknowledging that continuity would deflate the book's sensationalism, and undermine its premise that, before Big Tech, the only threat to liberalism was state power, and not also that of capital."
189,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89255731-mark-walker,5,"This book will boil your blood. Supported by extensive empirical research, Professor Shoshana Zuboff exposes the effective digital implementation of the late B. F. Skinner's Beyond Freedom and Dignity. It centers around three related factors: The distribution of knowledge: “Who knows?” Authority: “Who decides who knows?” and Power: “Who decides who decides who knows?” (Hint: it's not you). Orders of magnitude beyond just tracking cookies and the creepy anticipation of your interests by entities such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook, the new instrumentarianism is used by surveillance capitalists to control not just what you buy but also what you think about and how you think it. This is not even the theoretical Capitalism of Friedman, Hayek, or Adam Smith, as there is no equality of individual choice in it. In other words there's no free market here, as surveillance capitalists deliberately orchestrate your life for their benefit irrespective of yours. Thus it's not a fair trade; there is no reciprocity in the conveniences you think you receive from even the simplest transactions. You are not their customers (or even the ""product"" as in the cliché); their customers are the people purchasing the information harvested about you, which is extracted without your awareness. In this digital realm, it is as if you are the third world country having your natural resources extracted for the exclusive profits of foreign capitalists. Another clear analogy is we are like chickens being farmed for our eggs: they feed us with incentives, not for our well-being but so that we will lay more eggs to go into omelets not for us. You and your personal information are only the objects, the ""Other,"" that are for sale for the benefit of people who are not you. The key feature of all of this is that willingness is irrelevant, as we are unknowing and thus unwitting participants. Their salient objective is the obscene profits garnered from not just your profiles and posts, but the shadow text that you don't see from the fusion of the backscatter data about you that is harvested into separate secret databases. They actively hide that they have this information on you, as their modus operandi requires that you not be aware of it for this process to be successful. Much of this activity is beyond the reach of laws and courts, as the surveillance capitalists would just go underground with their operations if regulations were imposed. It is accompanied by an acceleration of the deliberate assault on democracy through lobbying and revolving door employment between government and the commercial interests that control it. Thus just voting for politicians that promise to tame surveillance capitalism will be of insufficient effect. Zuboff offers hope and some thoughts on what to do about it. European history has shown that when the people have had enough of oppression, they join together to rebel, as when the Berlin Wall came down without resistance from the guards. A similar event must occur today to escape the glass walls of the hive surveillance capitalists have put us in for the purpose of harvesting and orchestrating even our most personal thoughts, all for their profit and not ours. We need walls of our own, not to keep us in their hive, but to keep them out of our personal sanctuary. Public opinion is key to taming this monster. In the end if enough of the public rose up against surveillance capitalism, possibly by throwing its shadow text in disarray and diminishing its value, the money and influence behind it would then be of little effect. There is hope if humans would willingly help each other to the extent that surveillance capitalists take without asking. Then the world would be a much friendlier and more prosperous place for everyone. and not just the few."
190,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6192529-frieda-vizel,3,"The writing was a big problem for me. Sometimes, instead of relying on strong arguments, it relied on absurdly hyperbolic language. For instance, I didn’t feel like she explained clearly enough why monetizing our data is bad - say, because how it’s been destroying “the forth estate” that needs to constantly run after the clicks, or how our data is used to manipulate us to consume-consume-consume, to the detriment of the planet. Instead she went on for a while about our right to the “will to will” and a lot about how bad BF Skinner was. Maybe if I understood behaviorism better I’d have felt it as strongly as she seemed to, but I just didn’t feel like I totally got that whole part. Maybe that’s me.Speaking of Skinner, she seems to be of the school of public intellectualism that is very focused on individual actors instead of on the system. So she goes on a lot about the bad guys of our predicament, Skinner but also of course Zuck, the Google founders, the guy at Microsoft who didn’t seem to be extraordinarily villainous at all. Here’s where this type of focus in the individual derails us: it leads Zuboff to think that these people created the problems, and not the system. But actually, so long as the law allows for folks to make money by manipulating the masses, there will always be a sociopath to sink his teeth in. That’s why the problem is the system and that needs to be fixed. And Zuboff does argue for that - it’s just that she weakens her argument by being so focused on these insatiable idiot vampires. But all that is quibbling and frustration. The important take-away from the book is that it stakes the solution within the law. It does not fall for the “freedom of speech” idiocy, an argument mounted by economic interest as a way to stop the entire legal system from functioning as it should. Since when can’t we have laws? Since when is it tyranny for the government to create limits and parameters as a way of ensuring a healthy society? Since the tech companies have been telling us that we only deserve positive freedoms. Freedom to advertise, sure. Freedom from being manipulated by ads- it’s an Orwellian Communist murderous regime and soon we will be like North Korea!Zuboff talks about the slow speed of democracy. That’s what left me so despaired. Democracy is not getting faster, but the technological invasions are. And I don’t see how we’ll ever be able to catch up with them. Meanwhile, a screech on a decibel undetectable to the human ear is now screaming into your subconscious and telling you to buy another Alexa and a smart underwear plus to to vote for Kim Jung Il. True story."
191,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8040056-clancy,5,"[The] bare facts of surveillance capitalism necessarily arouse my indignation because they demean human dignity. The future of this narrative will depend upon the indignant citizens, journalists, and scholars drawn to this frontier project; indignant elected officials and policy makers who understand that their authority originates in the foundational values of democratic communities; and, especially, indignant young people who act in the knowledge that effectiveness without autonomy is not effective, dependency-induced compliance is no social contract, a hive with no exit can never be home, experience without sanctuary is but a shadow, a life that requires hiding is no life, touch without feel reveals no truth, and freedom from uncertainty is no freedom.This book is an incendiary work of immense scholarly and literary significance.With admiral restraint, Zuboff painstakingly dismantles, analyses, and lays bear the machinations of one of the greatest challenges that faces humanity in this century. We have be come not the product, as is so often said, but the raw material of an entirely novel industry. This industry's speed of ascent and adaptation and especially of innovation has left individuals and governments alike, completely unable to meaningfully understand, let alone reign-in, the advance of this all-pervading entity that increases its penetration into our lives and our communities with every passing minute.This book articulates the uncomfortable gut-feeling, the uneasy sense of cognitive dissonance, that I've felt about the level of access companies generally, but especially Alphabet and Facebook, have to my life and every piece of information living that life generates. I understand now why my no-choice participation in this new economy has generated these feelings, in all their expanded and terrifying entirety.While at times bombastic, and others poetic, and others still cool and clinical; the amount of research, time, and passion for humanity itself that went into the construction of this work has paid off. This work is a significant achievement, and an important moment that we can look back on to see whether we as a species can rise to overcome this new challenge, or whether this will be little but foreshadowing of the future we allow to follow.If you're alive right now, you owe it to yourself to read this."
192,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5225660-jouni-koskinen,2,"The issues this book is about are important and complicated and hard. The use and abuse of data and user trust is worth talking about, it's even worth shouting about.But not like this.Zuboff is alarmist, melodramatic, hyperbolic and tiring. Everything the tech companies do is not just wrong, it's a diabolic scheme to undermine the world as we know it. When something is wrong, it's never an unintended consequence, it's never human error, it's never just a silly gimmick not thought out far enough. It's always, always presented as a evil contrived mastermind plot to wreck your privacy and abuse you. And it's always presented like it's the rise of fascism in the 1930's with the most gut-wrenching tear-jerking vocabulary she could find. Get a few examples, simplify a theory somehow related to the issue, contrive a concept, give it a name like ""shadow text"" or ""behavioral surplus"" (preferably a bit ominous name), cherry pick more examples, portend doom. Rinse and repeat. And mention ""surveillance capitalism"" at least 15 times per page.It's kind of ironic that when she goes on for 700+ pages on how you should never trust these companies, that she takes their Silicon Valley hypetalk at face value. If a company claims they can do something, Zuboff gleefully integrates the claim into her narrative with zero criticism. Because it serves her point. But if a company apologises for something, it's of course disingenuous with them being the devil who wants to eat your children.By the time the book gets to behaviour manipulation, it turns from melodramatic to laughable. The obsession Zuboff has for B.F.Skinner and radical behaviorism (a 70-year-old psychology concept, the cognitive revolution would like to have a word...) is full on religious. The man wasn't wrong about anything and conditioning works on people with a hundred per cent efficiency!This is an important issue, but creating hyperbolic devils like this is not just bad writing and argumentation but counter-productive to the cause. It's just creates a shoddy boogeyman argument that is easy to shoot down.The very serious and dramatic reader Audible had for this didn't help btw. (she was very clear speaker though). "
193,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,3,"This is a really important topic and I wish I could give the book more than 3 stars. Everyone knows that the technology we are living with is unprecedented and changing the world. If we aren't careful, we will cause more harm than good. This book is about the dangers of this new information age. But there are a lot of problems with how the information is presented. First, the author uses over-the-top insulting language to describe these companies and leaders--all book long. It's so obviously biased that it undermines her points again and again, prompting lots of eyerolling--about once a page. That's minor, though. More serious is that this book is way too long. It wasn't satisfied making the point, it had to list 10 examples for every point--the full quotes, too. It read more like a college term paper that needed show every piece of research the author did. It's a very long book and it didn't need to be. Finally, the author falls prey to the worst sin in this kind of cultural criticism: she treats her worldview and personality type as the perfect ideal. There was no honest acknowledgement that her era had any flaws, only lament that the world doesn't live more like she used to, that generations will not experience what she did as a child. I very much believe that there are real dangers with only a few companies controlling the information access to the world. I've personally experienced challenges with this (Amazon just recently removed me as a listed seller of my own books, saying I need to sign up for the next level of account--at more cost--before I have the chance to be displayed as the owner of the product again). But it's a mixed bag and the author can't see past her indignation to the true complexity of the situation.So, read this for an imbalanced, overly wordy way of getting one side of the story. If it's not this book, make sure you get both sides of the story, not just the story told by Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, etc."

Today the same practices meet little resistance or even discussion as they are routinely and pervasively deployed on the march towards surveillance revenues.”Welcome to a new and daunting landscape awash with sinister terminology like “permissionless innovation”, “digital totalitarianism”, “reality mining” and “behavioural surplus”. This is the new apparatus that dictates how we move through much of our lives, and just like most architecture out there, after a while, you almost become oblivious to the secret workings and dimensions which are influencing your behaviour and actions. And this is how the boys and girls down in Silicon Valley like it best.“The image of technology as autonomous force with unavoidable actions and consequences has been employed across the centuries to erase the fingerprints of power and absolve it of responsibility. The monster did it, not Victor Frankenstein.”Zuboff touches on many aspects surrounding surveillance capitalism, and we see the intimate relationship between the NSA and CIA and the mutual benefits to that relationship. “The agencies craved the lawlessness that a firm such as Google enjoyed.” We learn the huge significance of Section 230 and how far behind the US is behind the EU in terms of clamping down, one example being the EU law in May 2014 enforcing the right to be forgotten. She cites many sources, but without doubt the two most prominent reference points are the work of B.F. Skinner and Hannah Arendt and in particular her “The Origins of Totalitarianism”. “Google is to surveillance capitalism what the Ford Motor Company and General Motors were to mass-production-based managerial capitalism.”At one point the author sets out the four main areas of fortifications that have allowed Google to be so over protected and free to flourish away from political interference for so long, particularly in the USA,1.	Google showing their capabilities of competitive advantage in electoral politics. 2.	The deliberate blurring of public and private interests through relationships and aggressive lobbying. 3.	A revolving door of personnel who migrated between Google and the Obama administration, who shared mutual interests during Google’s crucial growth years of 2009-2016. By April 2016, 197 individuals had migrated from government to the Googlesphere and 61 had moved in the other direction. 4.	Google’s campaign of influence over academic work and the larger cultural conversation, which was vital to policy formation, public opinion and political perception. “Ford’s inventions revolutionised production. Google’s inventions revolutionised extraction and established surveillance capitalism’s first economic imperative: the extraction imperative.”This book is awash with horror stories befitting of sci-fi paperbacks. Like the one concerning Genesis Toys, who brought out, My Friend Cayla, a terrifying concept in which the child’s doll which relies on voice recognition, also harvests all sorts of data from the customer’s house. It is such a blatant violation that in 2017 Germany, (a country which knows a thing or two about surveillance), banned it as an illegal surveillance device, urging parents to destroy any such dolls in their possession.Due to the nature of this book it does have its harder going moments, but it still remains engaging, and overall Zuboff has completed a chilling, sagacious and damning book on the sinister and sophisticated ploys increasingly used in surveillance capitalism. The text is relatively, devoid of any superfluous academic verbiage, which many of these kinds of books suffer from. These companies and the people tied up with them are the people who hate big, bad words like privacy, tax and transparency. You can employ all the lawyers, lobbyists and accountants and actuaries, but when you strip it all away, what it really is a small, group of dangerous people making the rules up as they go along who have been given a suspiciously free and easy reign over how policy works around the world.Facebook has already admitted to and was even boasting about its power to influence people’s behaviour in US elections, and this was years before the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke. The billionaire owner of that company, Robert Mercer, backed Donald Trump. As Facebook is a private company it did not have to adhere to the legal standards for experimentation required of academic and government researchers. It remains to be seen what Facebook and Google cannot get away with. Providing a vast platform for hate speech, fostering chronic bullying, screening live suicides, streaming acts of terrorism. Where will the line be drawn?...Like bold, bratty toddlers they constantly challenge their boundaries and throw tantrums when anyone dare speaks out, but they needn’t worry a succession of US governments has them well protected as long as that money keeps on coming.Every law, rule or regulation is only as strong as the loopholes allow it to be. If these loopholes are known and continue to exist then we must ask why that is?... Who has the power to close them and more importantly why have they chosen not to close them?...These companies have consistently and effectively been left to self-regulate with predictable consequences. The problems have been known about the Wild West mentality of the internet for many, many years now, but yet little meaningful change has occurred, especially in the US.“Facebook’s $4.6 million in donations during the 2016 election cycle complemented its lobbying budget of $11.5 million in 2017.” But this is nothing compared to Google, which repeatedly spends more on lobbying than any other corporation, shelling out more than $18 million in 2018. It is also the second wealthiest registered lobbyist in the EU. Why are Facebook and Google choosing to spend such astronomical amounts of money?...What must they be getting in return?...What do they want?...What do they get?...Why are we not being told?...Welcome to “American Democracy”. Be afraid, be very afraid…"

I think the writing is slightly clumsy and I think the book underestimates the connection between Silicon Valley firms and the intelligence services/ the state. I also find the substantive responses to the issue to be a little milquetoast in comparison to the problem she diagnoses (I suppose that’s how it ended up on Obama’s books of the year list). Those problems aside at its best it is a searing look at the logic and function of the data economy. For understanding the ways that big data firms are altering society and how to think about the use and abuse of technology, this is a great book. It’s really at its best at the most conspiratorial and will leave you suspicious of what exactly your phone is doing and what Facebook ultimately wants. I’m sure posting this review will trigger a whole cascade of advertising material to make sure the big social media giants don’t loose my constant stream of crumbs I feed them.

It is not a coup d’etat in the classic sense but rather a coup de gens: an overthrow of the people concealed as the technological Trojan horse that is Big Other”.This book is a huge, impressive piece of work. It feels like a relief to (at least) get some sort of overview over the way in which surveillance capitalism dominates our lives and orders society, despite the lack of suggestions for solutions. Understanding is the first step towards any form of meaningful resistance, and this feels like a solid first step :-)I do wish it were more accessible (as I do with most political theory) as its message feels like something that needs to be heard by more people than those who are willing to read 500 pages worth of academic language.Also - Zuboff’s idealization of the Henry Ford-era of capitalism rubs me the wrong way."
197,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24266382-ashley,3,"It’s been called “visionary,” but I don’t know that there’s anything entirely new here. What this felt like, to me, was a call to attention. The reader is not surprised by anything Shoshana Zuboff outlines, but is rather forced to acknowledge the problem in its entirety, all at once, in a 500-page package. That does make it feel revolutionary; Zuboff has written what very few people are willing to discuss in mainstream media, but which everyone has an inkling of, one way or another. I did find that it was a little too long-winded. It could have been significantly compressed, especially when a lot of the material was repetitive in order to emphasize certain themes and vocabulary.... and her preoccupation with B.F. Skinner was unnecessary. Zuboff was never so brilliant than when she illustrated, specifically, how Facebook and Google and Samsung (among others) are driving our behavior for their own profit, frequently at the expense of the law. I think that this strength was often drowned in vocabulary lessons and meandering observations, coming across as a little self-indulgent somewhere around the 200-page mark. It was unnecessary to spend so much time explaining Zuboff’s coined terms, such as “the uncontract”, “unprecedented”, “radical indifference”, “behavioural surplus”, and even “surveillance capitalism” itself. Especially in Part III, Zuboff’s self-indulgence became a running tangent, entire sections devoted to philosophy (and biology) lessons on the concept of “free will” and “utopia.”  In spite of that, it has definitely changed the way I think. It has also further fueled my nostalgia for a simpler time, and my distrust of social media and big corporations. The fact that it’s near-impossible to escape the clutches of these corporations is what really keeps me up at night; it’s not so much a privacy issue (I couldn’t care less if Mark Zuckerberg gets access to my old Instagram photos of cappuccinos) but rather a question of ethics. If I don’t want to give my data to third-parties, why are they able to access it anyway? If I don’t want to contribute to the rise of Facebook or Google, why are they still able to profit off of me anyway? Consent doesn’t really enter the conversation when it comes to what these rich tech companies have in mind, and evasive, incomplete privacy policies are nothing but “placebo effects” to pacify users.  Yes, I’m aware of the irony of publishing this review to Amazon-owned Goodreads.  ""Surveillance Capitalism"" is the kind of book that makes you want to throw your laptop into Lake Ontario and live in a cabin in the woods. I don’t know that I have the gumption for that kind of drastic change, but I’ll definitely think twice whenever I consider downloading an app or signing up for e-newsletters; I will certainly avoid buying any new smart devices by whatever means necessary. I do think it’s time for us to start protesting the free-reign that these conglomerates have been given, especially in North America. Our own behavior is being observed and herded by the rich 1% for financial gain; everything from our spending habits to our complacency is being mediated and controlled. I think, eventually, we have to reclaim our sense of autonomy and identity, and our understanding of reality.  Also, I just want to state for the record that I’ve always found it odd how North America experienced a period of mass rebellion, political protesting, and unrest during the 1960’s and 1970’s – and that this unrest suddenly came to a complete stop, save for a few exceptions here and there. Well, Zuboff has justified my unease, dedicating a sub-chapter to the behavior-control research conducted by the US Senate in the 70’s – research which became urgent as political protests escalated. And yes, surveillance capitalism has everything to do with it.  At the end of this heavy volume, Zuboff was really only trying to say one thing, re-stated from multiple angles: we are being rigorously and continuously exploited by capitalists. We don’t own our behavior anymore. Data collection and behavior control for the purpose of financial profit has crossed all ethical boundaries, and we as a society are content to let it happen.  This book is definitely recommended, if you have the patience and endurance to get through it. I almost didn’t. In a similar vein, I also recommend watching ‘Smithereens’, one of the recent Black Mirror episodes. Despite its melodrama, I think it has a lot of important things to say on society’s need to be “plugged in” and how this addiction is driving our lives. Some of Zuboff’s quotes that will stick with me: -“Its products are about predicting us, without actually caring what we do or what is done to us.” -“As populations grow numb, it becomes more difficult for individuals and groups to complain.” -“[Cortana] wants to know everything about you, but it does not want you to know how much it knows [...]” -“ ‘The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.’ ” [-Mark Weiser] -“Contemporary reviewers of Kahn’s book invariably seized upon the dark ‘nightmare scenarios’ of the computerized surveillance theme, the science-fiction–like forms of control that, they assumed, ‘will be actively feared and resented by many.’ Despite the wide range of scenarios that Kahn presented in his book on the distant year 2000, Kahn’s voyage into the ‘unthinkable’ was viewed by the public as a way to prepare for ‘the worst possible outcome’ in a terrifying ‘nightmare of social controls.’ Yet now, that same nightmare is rendered as an enthusiastic progress report on surveillance capitalism’s latest triumphs.” -“[…] Google wants us to accept that its rules simply reflect the requirements of autonomous processes, something that people cannot control. However, our grasp of the inner logic of surveillance capitalism suggests otherwise. Men and women made it, and they can control it. They merely choose not to do so.” -“Many people feel that if you are not on Facebook, you do not exist. People all over the world raced to participate in Pokémon Go. With so much energy, success, and capital flowing into the surveillance capitalist domain, standing outside of it, let alone against it, can feel like a lonely and risky prospect.”"

199,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85785571-laurence-lai,1,"The title “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism” evokes a weighty subject, and the book’s subtitle purports to something menacing to the future of humankind. It is to be seen if its contents are as substantial as the book’s 700-page length would suggest.The author, Shoshana Zuboff, is a professor emerita at Harvard Business School, not unimpressive an honor by any measure. A summary of assertions made in the book is as follows:1.	Big technological colossuses (Big Techs), epitomized by Google and Facebook, operate their business models by extracting data trails of online users, and in turn selling the extrapolated results (what Zuboff calls behavioral surplus) to their advertising customers.2.	Sophisticated algorithms are deployed and constantly refined to increase the predictive value of profiling data. At the same time, online users are passively served with moderated searches, federated news feeds, suggested connections, etc., all under the coercive power of the Big Techs. Such duress is as severe as not only to affect, shape, and compel, but with the aim to modify and manipulate user behaviors.3.	With the proliferation of sensors and Internet connectivity, Big Techs extend their reach far beyond the virtual realm to the real world. Regarding the surveillance operated by these techno-capitalists, in the author’s telling, its presence so pervasive and its impact so complete that any human free agency has receded entirely to the background and is ineffective.4.	While the above are not new to anyone who has casual understanding of current economics and culture, what Zuboff strives to accentuate is their connection to high-order issues such as self, liberty, democratic values, and human nature. She compares the dangers posed by “surveillance capitalism” to that of fascism, totalitarianism, behaviorist utopianism, and the like, that once presented real or potential detriments to humanity. For its thrilling effects, the agenda for the book is sweeping, even ambitious. Technological advancement, especially one that combines deep analytics, machine intelligence, and makes its ubiquitous presence in our intimate lives deserves a dispassionate evaluation as to its social impacts. Zuboff should be applauded for selecting this timely topic for her book.Yet one cannot help but feel frustrated by the lack of thematic organization of the whole book. Instead of explicating the economics involved in this different “capitalism”, Zuboff is more concerned with weaving her own narrative of abstruse euphemisms about how grave a danger the human future is facing. Materials are regurgitated, often word for word from the earlier part of the book and throughout. As to what actions Zuboff suggests to “fight for a human future…”? The author offers an ill-defined “synthetic declaration” (p. 345), and a skimpy, equally obscure advice of “friction, courage, and bearings” (p. 524). Specifics are sorely lacking in allusions to democratic institutions, public opinion, legislative and judicial recourse (p. 520). A whimper of a solution indeed to a loud bang of such a doorstopper.Zuboff obviously sets out to intend the book as a treatise that plumbs the depth of these to her as “unprecedented” developments in “surveillance capitalism”, and attempts to compare philosophically with past phenomena its manifold menaces to humanity. But it is exactly in such philosophizing that is the weakest of the book, for her arguments are at best tenuous and strained. On the other hand, the author wily limits her subject to mostly the socio-economic domain of the Western world, as is indicated in the book’s title. The picture would have been more complete if it had combined with surveillance authoritarianism. The “social credit” system practised unimpeded in China makes only passing reference in mere 6 pages (pgs. 388-394). Certainly, the threat to human liberty and dignity is far graver when the surveillance apparatus and capability are controlled by a police state, whereas in Western democracies competition among capitalists still exists. What is most infuriating is Zuboff’s penchant for fabricating catchphrases. Smug expressions such as “dispossession”, “behavioral futures”, “cultural misappropriation”, “economy of action”, “division of learning”, “shadow text”, “uncontract”, “hive”, “coup from above”, “Big Other”, “instrumentarian power”, “right to the future tense”, “third modernity*” …., litter throughout the book. The meanings of many of these are poorly articulated. Although she attempts to provide a brief rationale to her epithetic acrobatic (p. 66), such twisting of language is unnecessary and far from successful. It is an act of throwing spaghetti upon the wall; hoping that somehow one such phrase may stick with posterity with reference made to the author. As stated, the impression appears that the writer is more interested in weaving an esoteric narrative than presenting facts. Read a typical sentence on p. 488 of the book:“No exit” is the necessary condition for Big Other to flourish, and its flourishing is the necessary condition for all that is meant to follow: the tides of behavioral surplus and their transformation into revenue, the certainty that will meet every market player with guaranteed outcomes, the bypass of trust in favor of the uncontract’s radical indifference, the paradise of effortless connection that exploits the needs of harried second-modernity individuals and transforms their lives into the means to others’ ends, the plundering of the self, the extinction of autonomous moral judgment for the sake of frictionless control, the actuation and modification that quietly drains the will to will, the forfeit of your voice in the first person in favor of others’ plans, the destruction of the social relations and politics of the old and slow and still-unfulfilled ideals of self-determining citizens bound to the legitimate authority of democratic governance.” Long sentences can be beautiful in abler literary hands, but the above is downright egregious in form and meaning. Zuboff’s writing style can be aptly depicted as beating around the bush, with hyperboles and a plethora of inapt metaphors that ill befits so serious a subject she wants to convey. At times, she relishes so much staying with her metaphoric vehicles that the intended tenors are nowhere to be found. Long, winding sentences with chained substantives also further hamper readability.So, are readers more empowered at the end “with a more cogent and comprehensive understanding” (p. 18) of the menacing incursion exerted by the Big Techs? For the newly initiated, the writing style has done more to obfuscate than to illuminate. For the more inclined and those who look for some concrete societal antidotes, Zuboff has woefully under-delivered. More clear-eyed analyses are still awaited on the technologies proffered by the Big Techs, on the associated data-driven economy, and their consequent impacts to individuals and society at-large. * cf.

203,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4679583-myles,3,"This week my company officially got into the business of surveillance. People will pay us to surveil their home and business computers to protect them from rogue computer software, from losing data resulting from defective or aging components in their computers, and from misguided management of their computers themselves.Going forward this will be a growing and lucrative business segment because people rely on their computers to do so many important things for them, because they feel inadequate keeping up with changes in the computing environment, and because they justifiably fear cyber crime.It doesn’t mean they like it. I sure don’t.Being in retail business as I have for almost 25 years I have learned how to surveil myself, to protect my assets, and my employees. It is an ongoing challenge and it changes. I surveil for shoplifters, for currency and credit card counterfeiters, for daylight and after hours thieves. I surveil for dishonest employees, for honest mistakes, for poor buying decisions, and for the obsolescence of the products on my shelves. I surveil how the bank handles my money. I surveil my suppliers to prevent them from shipping me incomplete or broken goods. And I pay attention to my customers, to save them from making poor purchasing decisions.And when I am not surveilling, I am surveying. All the time. How were my customers’ experiences? What new products are on the horizon? How can I protect my liquidity, my profitability, and lastly, my sanity.I especially surveil myself, because I make mistakes, and because I too am growing old.These are some of the risks of operating a business.Then there are the people who surveil me. They include thieves looking for a weakness in my security. Government agencies to make sure I am paying the eight or ten different taxes I pay on an ongoing basis. Credit card companies surveil my transactions to make sure somebody hasn’t stolen my credit card, or that I am spending no more money than I can afford to pay back. My suppliers make sure I am paying them on time. Some manufacturers visit me in person or electronically to make sure I am representing their product lines fairly. They send me electronic training, and tests, and they regularly measure the efficiency and quality of our repair facilities. The utilities tell me when my operations (and home) are inefficient. And there are my landlords.Finally, we surveil at home. We surveil our daughter to make sure she is doing her homework and not falling in with the wrong crowd. My wife surveils me to make sure I’m not overeating, overspending, or being overly attentive to other women. I surveil my dog Seamus just in case he poops on the neighbour’s lawn so I can pick it up before someone notices. And Seamus surveils the front window and barks whenever a neighbouring dog saunters by. Last and not least are the gargantuan corporations who are watching what I do online. People like facebook, Google, amazon, and many, many more.So when somebody writes a book to tell me I live in an Age of Surveillance Capitalism...I GET IT! REALLY, I GET IT!But is it uniquely capitalist, or more generally an age of surveillance?And if it is more general to our society, where do we go from here?One thing for sure: it isn’t going away anytime soon.Shoshana Zuboff concentrates her guns on Google and facebook. She’s concerned that these companies are inherently different from the companies that came before it and they set a new standard for egregious capitalism. They are companies in the prediction business, predicting human behaviour and right now largely predicting purchasing behaviour by accumulating, as she called it, “surplus behaviour,” which kinda sounds like an oxymoron. She believes they abuse the freedoms of the marketplace to frustrate privacy, that they are built to enrich few and sidestep the traditional workplace which pays many employees fairly and creates consumers, and she argues that they are indifferent to social ills.She argues that Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” doesn’t operate in this marketplace because the new knowledge capitalists know everything happening in the market.A close reading of Andrew Carnegie’s life and legacy, perhaps John D. Rockefeller as well, could lead you to a similar conclusion, even though both men turned to philanthropy later in life. For sure, these men affected the course of capitalism.Is this a turn away from “good” capitalism toward an inherently evil capitalism?And if it is evil, can we create some rules for the big guys that us little guys can live with?Let’s take a step back and look at things in context: Google’s revenue is about $25 billion, Facebook’s $17 billion. The entire US economy is about $25 trillion and the world economy upwards of $107 trillion. Most of Google’s and Facebook’s revenue is advertising. The US advertising market is upwards of $80 billion so it is fair to say these two firms command quite strong positions in this industry. If you make the argument that America’s advertising industry is too concentrated then you’d have a pretty good argument to break up these firms which combined represent about 50% of all advertising dollars in the US. By comparison, Standard Oil at its peak commanded 88% of the market for processing crude. In its first year of operation, US Steel produced 67% of steel produced the the US.And they exhibit the classic behaviour of monopolists by dominating the markets for search and for social media on a global scale.In the US a case for breaking up the firms traditionally would have to be made that consumers are paying too much for their services or that competitors are being kept out of the market. Maybe breaking up these firms is a good idea, maybe it isn’t, but either way the technologies they employ for gathering, and analyzing, data isn’t going away.When I worked as an auditor, we used to gather lots of data, too, but what we eventually learned was that we could make assumptions about its meaning by sampling the information; that is, we cut down our work by only looking at some of the data. We tried to cut down on the wasted time. I sometimes wonder how much of what Google does is a total waste of time because the answers it seeks can be found in much faster time using much less data. And how much of “Big Data” is in fact a “Big Waste of Time.”Zuboff doesn’t consider that these firms may still be just in the early stages of figuring out what they are supposed to be doing. I think about it because so much time and resources are wasted paying attention to wholly irrelevant stuff.But we would do well to consider the affect of these companies on our freedoms and our government partially because they aren’t just national problems. They are transnational problems. What happens in China, and the extreme kind of surveillance practiced there on ethnic minorities like the Uigers, affects or will affect us here.They are transnational because the data collection is transnational and the very same data collected for the purpose of selling advertising is probably being used to develop artificial intelligence. The fastest developer of AI whether they be Chinese companies, transnational companies like Google or Facebook, or companies directly financed by government will have a big say in who has a job in the coming years and who doesn’t.No country on its own can hope to curb data collection and aggregation or perhaps more importantly, the control of what search results reveal on this scale any more than a country can curb money laundering, tax avoidance, or climate change without coordination between many if not all nations. Contemporary politics seems to be going in the opposite direction if Trump’s “America First,” Brexit, and Russian adventurism are any indication. If we are divided and our attention fractured we are susceptible to the influence or real or imagined “experts.” (To firms like Facebook I think we all have ADD, attention deficit disorder...they can never get enough of our attention!) That doesn’t mean we cannot continue to make decisions affecting our government, it more likely means that the decisions we make will more commonly resemble the imperatives of those desiring more of the same, read: the status quo.And that turns us to the question of how good is the status quo. If you believe that the universe ultimately bends toward the dilution of energy, total entropy, then the status quo is not too good. If you believe the status quo to be a teleological evolution toward a great singularity, perhaps a union with God, and a progression toward greater complexity in the universe, the status quo looks pretty good.Business executives, in my experience, tend to be of the more optimistic latter type of people. Like the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world and other people who have become incredibly wealthy in a short period of time.In the meantime, some of us have rather pedestrian concerns like the security of really private information. While convincingly arguing that there is insufficient transparency over who handles the big data and how they handle it, I think Zuboff fails to sufficiently weigh immense risk that the data will fall out of control of the aggregators and into the hands of rogue individuals.The hacking of credit card databases is one thing, and I think it a bigger risk than the hacking of a database which tells people how I like my hotdogs dressed. People made a big deal of the Cambridge Analytica scare. In the end, those people sold bogus claims to naive political organizations. The data predicted nothing and was of no use to anybody. And it didn’t get Donald Trump elected.Certainly big data aggregation has concrete effects on the economy. You get “free” Google searches. I get a cheaper smart TV because the data guys get first dibs on my TV watching preferences.This book is not the best guide for the good works these technologies enable (ie crowd sourcing, scientific research, epidemiology, etc). Self-driving cars benefit by machine learning. The acceleration and reductions in the friction in electronic commerce are generally good things.I don’t agree with Zuboff that the behavioural science behind the new data aggregation firms promotes a radical indifference to the lot of the common person. Nor do I agree that hyperscale doesn’t require competitive markets or for that matter democracy.This has yet to be proven.We all need participatory democracy, and more than ever on a global scale. Let’s make these damn machines work for us, not agin us."
204,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26854448-m-a,5,"This is a brilliant and important book about the future of mankind.It is unfortunately very difficult to read, due not only to the complexity of the subject matter, but also due to the constant use by the author of jargon and long complicated sentences. This is very ironic, considering that this book is intended as a warning and a call to action to the general public against the machinations of the Surveillance Capitalist elite. I can only hope that a more accessible version of this book will be published to accomplish that goal.Zuboff claims that surveillance capitalism is as big a change for our society as industrial capitalism was more than two centuries ago.It all started with Google, followed closely by Facebook, Microsoft and eventually by all digital industries.Google started collecting our private data (from our search terms on Google search, to our emails on Gmail, to our location data on Google Maps, our data stored on our Android devises etc..) without our knowledge or consent and turning them into predictions about our future behavior, which they sold for profit to marketers.Zuboff calls Google ""privacy kleptomaniacs"". She compares Google to the Spanish conquistadores invading the natives on the American continent and declaring the continent theirs by a monarchical edict declaring it so. So did Google invade our private data by declaring it theirs through obscure unilaterally imposed terms of service.She calls this data, the new raw material of capitalism ""Behavioral Surplus"".She traces the architecture of this new form of capitalism from its supply routes to its ""behavioral futures markets"".The production of digital data has far outpaced the human capacity to process/make sense of that data.Therefore, behavioral psychologists and data scientists have created algorithms to predict an individual's future behavior based on the billions of raw data of his/her every move and every thought.They use the 5 factor personality model, the 6 emotion model, affective computing, emotional analytics and sentiment analysis to predict our personalities and our future behavior.Surveillance Capitalists are prediction factories, based on raw materials from us.Google and co don't sell the raw data, they sell behavioral predictions based on that data.That information is not only useful to marketers, but to anyone with an interest in that knowledge and an interest in influencing that future behavior.Some examples of benefits of knowing a person's future behavior with very great accuracy include: predicting disease, financial risk, criminal risk, consumer preferences and political views. This knowledge about the future allows corporations to eliminate all risks in their business dealings.Zuboff calls this predictive data the ""shadow text"".This shadow text is only available to surveillance capitalists through their data extractions and algorithms.It is about us but not for us.Us being unaware of the surveillance is the precondition for surveillance capitalism to function properly- we are to remain unaware of the shadow text. Even if raw data are shared with us, the shadow data crafted for prediction purposes is not accessible to us.Remote digital observation and tele-stimulation ( the ""god view"") allows for distancing of the observed as ""the other"".Zuboff calls the Surveillance Capitalists the ""Big Other"".""The market reduces us to our behavior, transformed into another fictional commodity and packaged for others' consumption"" We are to be monitored and tele stimulated.Zuboff demonstrates how surveillance capitalism has expanded beyond cyberspace into our everyday life.Even the human body is treated as a computer, containing data in order to provide corporations certainty of profit.Take wearables for example: they form an unobtrusive integration to everyday life- internet connected fabrics, fitness trackers, diabetes apps etc.Zuboff quotes a study that shows that apps downloaded on a smart phone extract location data, contact lists, photos & videos etc without express consent of the user and that they sell this data to third parties.According to Zuboff, these companies' privacy policies should be called ""surveillance policies"".She predicts we will all end up with chips in our bodies for better surveillance, like animals. Telemetry is already used on animals to study their behavior. Humans will be next.We are already tracked in our cars, in our homes, in our kidneys (dialysis devices).By 2020, there will be 20 billion intelligent devices with the capability of tracking and monitoring us.Zuboff calls whatever data that is not yet tracked ""dark data"". Surveillance Capitalists are intent on tracking all behavior that is not (yet) informatized.They want to monetize every aspect of our lives, the entire human experience. They want to turn our entire life into profit for themselves.Power was once identified with the ownership of the means of production.Now power rests in the ownership of the means of behavioral prediction and behavioral modification of the other. Now our lives are turned into data without our knowledge or consent in order to benefit others.Zuboff explains how the system of Surveillance Capitalism is grounded in behavioral psychology.The goal of behaviorism is the prediction and control of behavior- the human being is nothing but an organism, an ""it"". According to behaviorists a human is in essence no different than a mushroom, only a bit more complex.Behaviorists (eg Skinner and Pentland) believe humans have no freedom of will, no autonomy, no agency. Freedom of will is an illusion. It is the environment that controls behavior. Individual behavior is caused by variables lying outside the individual himself.Hence the belief by behaviorists that behavioral control can lead to predicting future behavior with scientific accuracy. Behavior must be studied w/o limits and w/o knowledge of the ""organism"".Privacy is an illusion just like freedom- they must be forfeited in favor of the good life.BUT this view was meant to benefit all of humanity; the knowledge gained through behavioral tracking was to be used to improve human behavior towards a better future for humanity: fighting disease, crime, poverty etc..Instead, behaviorism has been hijacked by surveillance capitalism to benefit only the small class of surveillance capitalists and their customers. The lost freedom only affects us but the acquired knowledge and profit is all theirs.What are the dangers of Surveillance Capitalism?The more one knows about a person, the easier it is to control him.Besides being used for targeted marketing, knowledge of personal data can also be used to blackmail, defame, harass and discriminate against us.The dangers lie not only in corporate surveillance itself and the accompanying loss of privacy, but even more worrisome, in corporate mind manipulation and corporate behavioral modification, such as the creation of conformity and obedience but also the creation of desires that benefit commerce and emotions that benefit politicians. Surveillance capitalists wants ALL of you- your behavior, your thoughts, your emotions, your personality- so they can manipulate your behavior. Will you have any autonomy, any free will left? Surveillance Capitalism is not only a danger to privacy, but a danger to democracy which depends on autonomous moral judgment and individual determination and free will. Zuboff believes in free will as the basis for individuality, self determination, and the right to decide our future (She calls it ""The right to the future tense"").The right to be one's author of one's future should be cast as a human right-necessary because it is imperiled by ""the panvasive digital architecture of behavioral modification owned and operated by surveillance capital, necessitated by its economic imperatives and driven by its laws of motion, all for the sake of its guaranteed outcomes""Will Google, FB and co. lead to digital totalitarianism? According to Zuboff the answer is no, because the past offers no adequate compass for this new phenomenon.Zuboff calls the future of Surveillance Capitalism ""Instrumentarianism"".Totalitarianism, as impersonated by Hitler and Stalin was only understood after the facts. It entails the destruction of all human ties except total loyalty to the movement (fascism or communism). It operates through the means of violence, terror and fear- all who do not conform, the enemies of the ""people"", are executed.Instrumentarianism behaves through the means of behavioral modification.And, unlike in a totalitarian regime, there is no need to use force . All you need is adequate human engineering.""Instrumentarianism"" is a behaviorally controlled society, in which knowledge replaces freedom. In such a society, social change can be generated by social pressure from social networks to ""go with the flow, stay with the herd, return to the hive and take flight with the flock"". Identity yields to synchrony.Such a society leads to the death of individuality. The collective intelligence knows best and individuality is only unnecessary friction towards that goal.Instrumentarian society with its architecture of behavioral control, social pressure and asymmetrical power is a Panopticon - there is no exit possible.Once it was believed that there is no exit from an all knowing and all powerful God.Under Instrumentarianism, there will be no exit from the others, big other and the surveillance capitalists. Big Other knows no boundaries.Zuboff pleads for the right to sanctuary.It is a universal need for a safe refuge, for shelter.This right is as ancient as human history; originally it manifested itself in the form of a city, or a temple. Later on this right extended to the home: a sanctuary from arbitrary intrusion. Psychologists agree that this is important for development of the self and for mental health. With Big Other, the Universe takes up residence within our walls, there is no refuge. (thinkof internet connected security cameras, light switches, thermostats, appliances, rumbas, wearables,smart phones, tooth brushes, beds, personal assistants, TVs, toys,etc etc).What solution does Zuboff propose to avert the coming Instrumentarian Society?To just stop using the internet and internet connected devices?Surveillance Capitalists offer solutions to social connection, access to information, time saving convenience and ""illusionary"" support and this got us all addicted. It is not reasonable to expect us to go off the grid.Privacy regulation and monopoly regulation is inefficient at combating those risks- it will not be solved by encryption, anonymization or discussion of data ownership. This is a new condition that outruns the law, that has not been tamed by law. Zuboff discusses very briefly the new regulatory regime operating in the EU since May 2018, the GDPR ( General Data Protection Regulation). The GDPR is a good step forward, but only time will tell if it will be efficient in vanquishing surveillance capitalism's instrumentarian power. The individual is powerless against the surveillance capitalist machine because of asymmetrical power and knowledge. Only collective action on the ground, such as class actions, will determine if GDPR will be effective.Regulators will be up against well funded corporate lawyers and lobbyists.Zuboff concludes that Surveillance Capitalism is profoundly anti democratic. It is a market coup from above on the people. It is a form of tyranny, of absolutism; it imposes its rules from above; everyone except the tyrant is just an organism, the ""other one"", to be exploited for the profit of the tyrant.Industrial revolution has led to near destruction of our planet and extinction of many species. Instrumentarianism will lead to extinction of our individuality.Zuboff points to the critical role of public opinion on changing the laws. She proclaims passionately:It is NOT ok to strip search us for profit.It is a human expectation to be the author of one's life.There is still time to redirect the action to a future that we can call home.It is our responsibility to right was has gone wrong.We have to be indignant because this is an attack on human dignity.Freedom from uncertainty is no freedom.She refuses to seed the future to illegitimate power.She demands a human future.She calls the world to action to declare the digital future to be a human future."
205,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42693079-ryan-o-neill,4,"This ambitious and expansive book aims to define and explain the rise of surveillance capitalists like Google, Facebook and Microsoft as they play ever larger roles in our lives. Shoshana Zuboff briefly maps out the history of some of these companies and delves into the way in which they gradually encroach on our lives in ever more frightening ways.She argues persuasively that while sometimes driven by old capitalist imperatives, these companies represent a break from past eras such as that of industrial capitalism as they secretly and aggressively gather increasing amounts of personal information from us, but not for our benefit; rather than the traditional business-customer reciprocities, surveillance capitalists plunder every element of our lives, both online and offline, for the benefit of advertisers, and ultimately serve their economic benefit.Under surveillance capitalism, we are no longer the customers (although practices are often disguised under the auspices of 'personalisation') but rather our searches, browsing history, friends, likes, reactions, emotions and feelings are raw materials to be scraped for the benefit of companies who are free to operate outside the boundaries of traditional democracy and regulation. Our rights are ruthlessly and carelessly cast aside and rendered obsolete in this relentless pursuit of behavioural surplus without which surveillance capitalists cannot grow.These companies encroach upon our personal space in ever more intrusive ways - from the original Google Street View controversy in the mid-2000s to Facebook's hidden methods of gleaning info on our preferences, to TVs that listen to you, wearable devices, Alexa house alarms and even toys that listen to you, to the fight for our car dashboards. The speed and aggression is such that after initial outrage, we are worn down, helpless and numbed, resigned to our fate.Surveillance capitalism, Zuboff argues, attempts to create certainty of outcome for its actual customers - its advertisers. This is done by parsing human behaviour, exploiting feelings, emotions and beliefs even when we don't permit it to, so that our individual freedom, our rights to define our own experience, and to act and think in private are eroded as we are continuously moulded and directed towards specific courses of action by these companies. The inherent uncertainty that exists within how we think, how we act and interact - our right to an effective life - is replaced by collective certainty at the hands of surveillance capitalism.Zuboff also mines the effects of social media on young people's development. As they journey from being defined by their relationships at a young age to becoming separate from but connected to others in adulthood, young people are adversely affected by social media and its imperatives to forcing people to see themselves 'from the outside in' and define themselves based on the experiences and lives of others. The pervasiveness of social media means people often struggle to disconnect, their mental health even suffering from brief separation from their accounts. This crucially and savagely inhibits their ability to look inward and make that journey from people defined by their relationships in youth, to autonomous individuals who have relationships in adulthood.Zuboff argues that while the advent of new laws such as GDPR in Europe have been helpful, surveillance capitalism's overall success in evading proper regulation and legal scrutiny means that decisive action will depend on a turning of public opinion. Lots of us are passive about our distrust of social media, but it will take a re-establishment of indignation, a renewal of outrage, if we are to have any chance of stemming the flow.The book is a heavy undertaking; more than 500 pages long and often written in rather academic prose, and it can occasionally be quite dense and abstract. Given the ubiquity of technology in all of our lives, it could undoubtedly be more reader-friendly, and perhaps focus on more real-life examples that we are all familiar with. Despite its wealth of information, Xuboff's proposed solutions are vague, and it is arguably unclear what exactly you as an individual can do personally to reduce the insidious influence of surveillance capitalism in your everyday life; what strategies can be used to repell Facebook from building a strong profile based on your preferences, for example? Is there a feasible path to effective life without being on Facebook?Furthermore, it would have been helpful to have some more analysis on the gathering of information not related to economics - the how and why of information kept either by governments or corporations on citizens for reasons not linked to monetary benefits.Nevertheless, this is a hugely informative, well researched and important book on a subject which, as the author herself notes, is a story still unfolding and which still has some way to run. It's likely that many updates and more reader-friendly analyses on surveillance capitalism will follow, but this is a fantastic launch-pad for one of the defining issues of our time."
206,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45700308-tanmay-srivastava,1,"Shoshana Zuboff's book was highly recommended, was part of multiple lists and had glowing reviews on Goodreads. I was quite excited to pick it up and start reading.  Without calling it out, Zuboff treats incremental technological progress as a zero sum game. A win for the tech companies is a loss to someone. Take, for example when Zuboff talks about connected cars . She says an insurance company can stall a car if the premiums are not paid. She beats up this argument and brings up a case of how an elderly couple had to choose between car payments and medicine, which came to light only when the collection officers turned up at the door. A crowdfunding campaign was launched to help them and it had a happy ending. Using software however would have meant that this would have never happened. She fails to recognize that her example is the exception and not the norm. She chooses to ignore the positive impact connected cars would have on say, cars getting stolen going down leading to lower premiums or reduced premiums for drivers using their cars less or rewarding good drivers by reducing their premiums. Maybe, with such technological advances premiums would fall to such an extent that the couple wouldn't have to worry about premium payments altogether? She fails to acknowledge that progress is not a zero sum game. Tech companies have been bashed quite a bit through the book. There is no nod of appreciation for the positive impact they have had on societies. Here, In India - products of these tech companies are helping small businesses make moves that wouldn't have been possible before. Expensive POS Machines have been skipped (the same way how landlines didn't make it to parts of India but mobile phones did) in favor of Google Pay (QR Codes for Bank to Bank transfers). Book keeping doesn't required expensive licenses and can be managed online. Whatsapp is used to sell/communicate/deliver orders. YouTube is a learning platform for many, and a medium for news outside of the traditional media. The jobs these tech companies have created in India, directly and indirectly, also cannot be overlooked. There's a section where Zuboff talks about fake news and its impact on Brexit and the 2016 US Election. While I do agree fake news is a very big issue, the issue of voter discretion cannot be overlooked. In Zadie Smith's essay on Brexit -  ""Fences""  she writes how someone voted one way in referendum to get rid of the health secretary. Would it have been different if it was not targeted to a particular group (via the likes of Cambridge Analytica)? Would the results of Brexit and the 2016 US Election have been the same if there was no Facebook? Are we giving these incidents more importance than they deserve? ""Who knows?"" - I don't. I don't think we can ever conclusively state yes or no. The biggest issue is that a lot of topics covered in the book are in the grey area. Is it okay to give someone hungry a burger from McDonald's? The burger will make sure that they don't go hungry, but it's not a healthy meal. Can they afford to have a healthy meal? Can they stay hungry? Is there a way to grow healthy food to feed everyone? Is there a way to make everyone want/enjoy the healthy food? This sort of reasoning should have been the core of the book. You cannot do without technology companies today. Google, Microsoft, Facebook are essential parts of our day to day lives. Is there a business model where these companies can make enough money to create products that add value without compromising on data to drive revenue? Is there a market for people to pay for their services without any data getting collected? Do people bother to dig deep in their account settings to switch off optional data collection? Do people care? I feel the book is not asking the right questions needed to drive policy discussions. Data privacy is an important topic. The book is well researched in parts but jumps into pages of wishful thinking. The conclusions drawn are biased. The facts are presented in a way to scare you, and similar to how likes are garnered on social media with scary/angry posts, this book has scared people into giving it 5 stars on Goodreads. I wish this book was not one sided as it was - Not recommended."
207,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27470888-cool-breeze,1,"The subject of this book is very important. Unfortunately, this book fails miserably at contributing anything useful to the discussion. It is mind-numbingly long at 691 pages and an ordeal to read. Zuboff takes a few observations on surveillance technology issues and uses pretentious academic jargon to fluff them into this execrable doorstop of a book. The book does not offer any practical solutions to the issues she raises. A good editor could have reduced this to a pamphlet or a web article without leaving much notable out.This is possibly the worst non-fiction book I have ever read. I dreaded resuming it every time I picked it up and finally abandoned it on page 158. If I should ever be stuck on a desert island with only this book for reading material, I will be thankful at least that I have an abundant supply of toilet paper.Zuboff is a sociologist and the language she employs is tortured and tedious in the extreme. She insists on coining lots of neologisms and wallowing in her jargon. Amusingly, her favorite term is Behavioral Surplus, or BS for short. The book could have saved countless pages if she reduced a lot of her BS to abbreviations. Perhaps such Heideggerian writing impresses her academic colleagues, but it is excruciating for the average reader. She beats her core points to death – within the first 100 pages she must have repeated some version of the following point dozens of times – ‘the user isn’t the customer, nor are they the product, they are the raw material that is used to create the product’. You could have cut many more pages by limiting this point to three repetitions. It is as if she thinks her readers are idiots, or else she has dementia and doesn’t remember what she wrote a page or two ago. Even worse, Zuboff is a Luddite and a hard-core leftist. She obviously thinks the Industrial Revolution was largely a disaster. On page 11, she writes “industrial civilization… threatens to cost us the earth”. By page 12, she is hyperventilating “The industrial legacy of climate chaos fills us with dismay, remorse and fear”. No, it doesn’t. The reason Trump is President and the US has repudiated stupid climate treaties is that so many American voters think this is a non-issue or a very low priority (#18 out of 19 in a recent survey). On page 22, she writes that she has been inspired by a rogues' gallery of leftists, including Karl Marx, Theodor Adorno, Jean-Paul Sartre and Thomas Piketty (Robert Reich and Rachel Carson, who is responsible for millions of deaths, are also mentioned favorably). On page 33, she likens her great-grandparents fleeing the oppression of 1908 Russia to the oppression of the nuclear family (you poor, fragile snowflake!). On page 38 she viciously criticizes Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, although she admits their policies pulled the country out of the stagflation and “malaise” of the Jimmy Carter years. Unbelievably, Zuboff apparently thinks airline deregulation was a bad thing. On page 42, she is writes approvingly of rioters in London (she really should read some Theodore Dalrymple on the real problems involved) and the dilettante, astroturf Occupy “movement”. On page 43, she comments disapprovingly on those who would “pare regulations, cut taxes… and shrink entitlements”. Heaven forbid that anyone should want to take an ax to the leviathan state! By page 109, she is bemoaning the Supreme Court’s rejection of restrictions on political speech, “hate speech” (meaning anything she and her politically correct brethren disagree with), pornography (yeah, she’s puritanical as well as a Luddite) and free association. What a pinch-faced scold!Only at this point does she admit that her arch-villain, Google, has been totally in bed with the left-wing Obama administration, using their surveillance technology to mastermind his two Presidential campaigns and running a revolving door operation with 258 employees moving between Google and the Obama regime. Whoops! How inconvenient! It’s almost like leftism and this creepy surveillance technology go hand in hand! Curiously, in a 691-page book, the word “Clinton” does not appear even once in the 26-page index! I wonder who was President from 1996 to 2001, Google’s first five years? Or who was Hillary’s biggest corporate campaign contributor? It is a complete mystery, according to this book. Zuboff doesn’t actually appear to be a Clinton fan, so maybe she just doesn’t want to wind up adding to the Arkancide body count like Jeffrey Epstein.Zuboff must have felt terrible about documenting the extent of Obama’s collusion with Google’s abuses, because within a few pages she is back to bashing mainstream conservative organizations such as the Federalist Society, Heritage Action, Americans for Tax Reform and the Cato Institute as “Far Right”. Anyone to the right of Marx, Lenin and Mao is apparently “Far Right” to Zuboff.Chapter 5 elaborates Googles expanding abuses from 2009-2016. The Europeans attempt some pushback, but the US is feckless or oblivious. Just who controlled the government that was supposed to be preventing such abuses during this time? Zuboff couldn’t possibly guess, even if you spotted her an O, B and M. During this period, Zuboff’s Harvard Business School colleagues ride to the defense of Yelp, perhaps the only tech company more loathsome than Google.Strangely, Zuboff admits there were a number of potentially effective policy fixes being seriously considered in the years before 9/11. Why not revive those ideas and build a political coalition of like-minded classical-liberals, libertarians, small-government conservatives and Trump supporters (the tech giants being no friends of Trump) to implement them? She points out that the national security agencies are obstacles. Well, after Brennan, Comey, Holder and Lynch, a lot of people on the right need no further persuasion that the FBI, CIA and the rest of the Deep State are utterly corrupt rogue agencies. Zuboff doesn’t appear to consider this a possibility. I guess working with those icky right wingers is completely out of the question. Even worse, such allies are never going to go along with replacing the tech elite with the “benevolent” socialist dictatorship of Zuboff and her Harvard faculty elite. As it turns out, Zuboff’s problem is not so much with the creepy technology, it is that the creepy technology is not under the control of “enlightened” leftists like her and her comrades in academia and government.That was as much as I could take. I skimmed the book for any sign of practical solutions in the pages to come and, finding none, I abandoned the book on page 158.I agree with Zuboff that the tech giants represent a grave threat. However, if her prescription of more government and more socialism is the only alternative, I guess I will just have to find ways to live with it. The only thing worse than surveillance capitalism is surveillance statism run by socialist do-gooder “elites” like Zuboff, who always think they know better and want to engage in social engineering. Do you think the Chinese people would prefer annoying Google ads or their oppressive and ubiquitous social credit scores? The only people I would less like to see in control of this technology than Page, Brin and Zuckerberg are Zuboff and her comrades.In the nearer term, there are still practical steps one can take to mitigate the problem. Don’t use Google products. Use DuckDuckGo for search. Don’t use Gmail or Chrome. Use a good ad blocker, like AdBlockPlus on all devices. Don’t buy creepy surveillance technology like Nest, Ring or Alexa. Delete your Facebook account. Don’t use Twitter, it’s a surveillance sewer. Don’t buy from Amazon or use their products or services, especially the Washington Post. Don’t buy from Apple or use their products or services. Use Linux if that is viable for you or lock down you Windows privacy settings, if not. Check your app setting and cut them back to only those necessary to function. Don’t use non-essential apps like games, many of which are bad offenders.Support the breakup of the tech giants using antitrust laws. Support their prosecution for anti-competitive and anti-privacy violations. Having Page, Brin, Zuckerberg and Bezos doing some serious hard time would have a very salutary effect “pour encourager les autres”. Institute real and legally-binding privacy protections such as Zuboff mentions and dismisses. Yes, we will have to do it without the support of Zuboff and her comrades, but Trump’s upcoming second term could be a real opportunity to get this done (I think Zuboff’s head may have just exploded)."
208,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65435043-alan-tennyson,5,"I pored over this book, stayed with the words. Read and reread them. Drank deeply from their wisdom.  It was not an easy read, but ultimately it gave far more than it took. The Age of Surveillance Capitalism is a seminal text for our age. Zuboff's account of surveillance capitalism is elegant, poised and persuasive. Yet for all her brilliance, Shonanna's central thesis suffers some fundamental flaws.  Where The Age is at it's strongest is in the articulation of surveillance capitalism. Consider this, 'Who owns your face?', 'Who owns your behaviour?' What you do, where you go, who you know, all this has value and extracting value from these data is the business model of the surveillance capitalist.  But this is only the description, where Zuboff's account takes a darker turn, is in control. Once Surveillance Capitalists have provided a description of you, the next logical step is to determine how much this description can be used to predict and control you. Zuboff's account of these processes is beautifully rendered in perfect proses.  Know thyself, unless you don't like what you find, then, deny thyself, and pretend you are other. Zuboff goes for the latter.  We are born of this place, this pale blue dot, we are natural phenomena. Yet despite these self-evident truths, many continue to advance the notion that we apes are exceptional.  We are somehow other than the mere organisms with whom we share our earth and almost our entire genetic structure. Zuboff takes issue with humans being described as 'mere organisms'.  She is caged by this ideology of human exceptionalism, and it weakens her thesis considerably.  There are sacred cows here, and sacred cows will invariably be slaughtered.  The first heifer into the meat factory is autonomy. Shoshana strips us of our relations, our context and connections. She exalts 'autonomy' but fails to grapple with the weakness of the presumptions it contains. This leads her to assert that humans are and ought to be autonomous.  But Zuboff fails to address that we are born free, but everywhere in chains. From the traffic light to the electric chair, we are already in a context that seeks to control our behaviour. What does she think education and justice are? If not systems of changing our behaviour? But it's more than this, it's a scientific reality, we are our contexts, our environment, they shape us as we shape them.  This is a reality that an insistence on 'Freedom' cannot wish away.   For me, the issue is not that we are organisms', we are.  It is not that we are miraculous rational deities, we are not.  We need to embrace our human frailty, stare it down since we are wiser for this knowledge.  Here again, Zuboff takes issues with what she calls the 'ideology of human frailty'.  Respectfully I would ask that we,  put down our pride and look hard in the mirror, human frailty is not an ideology, it is a fundamental truth. We are 'mere organisms' and to claim anything else is to cling to a pernicious ideology. An ideology that has prompted human dominion over earth and animals, and all the ecological genocide that follows."

In fact, in a time like this I wish there was a more complex rating system than 5 stars. I digress.This was, in many ways, the first of its kind. There have, in my view, yet to be too many intelligent take downs of the dangers of big data. There is,of course, a brief mentioning of the a similar subject in many other modern texts - but not to this degree.So, you ask, what the hell is surveillance capitalism. It is, a term coined by the author. She first presented the concept publicly in 2014, in an article, where she described it as such :""[surveillance capitalism is a] radically dissembled and extractive variant of information capitalism"" based on the commodification of ""reality"" and its transformation into behavioral data for analysis and sales""*---- IN this book she presents the story of how it is that we have gotten to such a point in history, where the sentence in her 2014 article could even be spoken. In this she gives a small run down of facebook and google, and explains the origins of these sights in relation to their users. User-ship on these web pages began without much craziness, but as we all know many pages which were once small e.g. facebook, google, and youtube have more or less all become huge power houses of influence. They have now followings in the billions. This is presently praised by these web pages as a good thing. Initially. well. The servers couldn't take it. There was too much damn data. And its all so useless.Or is it?It was, with this question, in the eyes of zuboff, that this form of capitalism** was born. The data not only need not be an annoyance, but it could be a pathway towards making money. 'Perhaps', these tech giants thought 'we could predict the users behaviors by paying attention to the patterns in data'. Alas. we are truly all creatures of habit. Long story short. A great deal of people in the industrial world are using certain pages on the internet in ways that are useful for targeting for sales. This of course can eventually be sold to governments blah blah blah. Ask yourself. are you ok with people predicting your behaviors to increase user experience? What about to protect you? What about to just watch you?These are questions the book will make you reflect on.Overall, I think this was one of the most apropos books I have read in awhile towards understanding some issues in modernity.86/100 stars.Recommended for:Those thinking about big data in its prediction of human behaviorthose who dont trust facebook and googlethose worried about internet privacythose thinking about the future path of society*Hey guess what.

Market and industrial capitalism are declining, long live surveillance capitalism say the social media giants, in whose tentacles it is we, rather than any thing useful for us as humans, who are grasped .It’s a bit long and at times repetitive, like Das Kapital, but it’s not really a criticism of the book, as the amount of research and work Zuboff must have done to produce this dizzying analysis of the current state of digital technology and its impact on us, is breathtaking. It’s the resistance to surveillance capitalism’s imperatives that she leaves as the challenge for society at the end of the book...

The argument is blind to how Big Tech's surveillance is merely the most recent and sophisticated manifestation of capitalism's inherent drive to extract value; advertising and media companies have for centuries made a business of surveillance and control. But acknowledging that continuity would deflate the book's sensationalism, and undermine its premise that, before Big Tech, the only threat to liberalism was state power, and not also that of capital."
219,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89255731-mark-walker,5,"This book will boil your blood. Supported by extensive empirical research, Professor Shoshana Zuboff exposes the effective digital implementation of the late B. F. Skinner's Beyond Freedom and Dignity. It centers around three related factors: The distribution of knowledge: “Who knows?” Authority: “Who decides who knows?” and Power: “Who decides who decides who knows?” (Hint: it's not you). Orders of magnitude beyond just tracking cookies and the creepy anticipation of your interests by entities such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook, the new instrumentarianism is used by surveillance capitalists to control not just what you buy but also what you think about and how you think it. This is not even the theoretical Capitalism of Friedman, Hayek, or Adam Smith, as there is no equality of individual choice in it. In other words there's no free market here, as surveillance capitalists deliberately orchestrate your life for their benefit irrespective of yours. Thus it's not a fair trade; there is no reciprocity in the conveniences you think you receive from even the simplest transactions. You are not their customers (or even the ""product"" as in the cliché); their customers are the people purchasing the information harvested about you, which is extracted without your awareness. In this digital realm, it is as if you are the third world country having your natural resources extracted for the exclusive profits of foreign capitalists. Another clear analogy is we are like chickens being farmed for our eggs: they feed us with incentives, not for our well-being but so that we will lay more eggs to go into omelets not for us. You and your personal information are only the objects, the ""Other,"" that are for sale for the benefit of people who are not you. The key feature of all of this is that willingness is irrelevant, as we are unknowing and thus unwitting participants. Their salient objective is the obscene profits garnered from not just your profiles and posts, but the shadow text that you don't see from the fusion of the backscatter data about you that is harvested into separate secret databases. They actively hide that they have this information on you, as their modus operandi requires that you not be aware of it for this process to be successful. Much of this activity is beyond the reach of laws and courts, as the surveillance capitalists would just go underground with their operations if regulations were imposed. It is accompanied by an acceleration of the deliberate assault on democracy through lobbying and revolving door employment between government and the commercial interests that control it. Thus just voting for politicians that promise to tame surveillance capitalism will be of insufficient effect. Zuboff offers hope and some thoughts on what to do about it. European history has shown that when the people have had enough of oppression, they join together to rebel, as when the Berlin Wall came down without resistance from the guards. A similar event must occur today to escape the glass walls of the hive surveillance capitalists have put us in for the purpose of harvesting and orchestrating even our most personal thoughts, all for their profit and not ours. We need walls of our own, not to keep us in their hive, but to keep them out of our personal sanctuary. Public opinion is key to taming this monster. In the end if enough of the public rose up against surveillance capitalism, possibly by throwing its shadow text in disarray and diminishing its value, the money and influence behind it would then be of little effect. There is hope if humans would willingly help each other to the extent that surveillance capitalists take without asking. Then the world would be a much friendlier and more prosperous place for everyone. and not just the few."
220,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6192529-frieda-vizel,3,"The writing was a big problem for me. Sometimes, instead of relying on strong arguments, it relied on absurdly hyperbolic language. For instance, I didn’t feel like she explained clearly enough why monetizing our data is bad - say, because how it’s been destroying “the forth estate” that needs to constantly run after the clicks, or how our data is used to manipulate us to consume-consume-consume, to the detriment of the planet. Instead she went on for a while about our right to the “will to will” and a lot about how bad BF Skinner was. Maybe if I understood behaviorism better I’d have felt it as strongly as she seemed to, but I just didn’t feel like I totally got that whole part. Maybe that’s me.Speaking of Skinner, she seems to be of the school of public intellectualism that is very focused on individual actors instead of on the system. So she goes on a lot about the bad guys of our predicament, Skinner but also of course Zuck, the Google founders, the guy at Microsoft who didn’t seem to be extraordinarily villainous at all. Here’s where this type of focus in the individual derails us: it leads Zuboff to think that these people created the problems, and not the system. But actually, so long as the law allows for folks to make money by manipulating the masses, there will always be a sociopath to sink his teeth in. That’s why the problem is the system and that needs to be fixed. And Zuboff does argue for that - it’s just that she weakens her argument by being so focused on these insatiable idiot vampires. But all that is quibbling and frustration. The important take-away from the book is that it stakes the solution within the law. It does not fall for the “freedom of speech” idiocy, an argument mounted by economic interest as a way to stop the entire legal system from functioning as it should. Since when can’t we have laws? Since when is it tyranny for the government to create limits and parameters as a way of ensuring a healthy society? Since the tech companies have been telling us that we only deserve positive freedoms. Freedom to advertise, sure. Freedom from being manipulated by ads- it’s an Orwellian Communist murderous regime and soon we will be like North Korea!Zuboff talks about the slow speed of democracy. That’s what left me so despaired. Democracy is not getting faster, but the technological invasions are. And I don’t see how we’ll ever be able to catch up with them. Meanwhile, a screech on a decibel undetectable to the human ear is now screaming into your subconscious and telling you to buy another Alexa and a smart underwear plus to to vote for Kim Jung Il. True story."
221,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8040056-clancy,5,"[The] bare facts of surveillance capitalism necessarily arouse my indignation because they demean human dignity. The future of this narrative will depend upon the indignant citizens, journalists, and scholars drawn to this frontier project; indignant elected officials and policy makers who understand that their authority originates in the foundational values of democratic communities; and, especially, indignant young people who act in the knowledge that effectiveness without autonomy is not effective, dependency-induced compliance is no social contract, a hive with no exit can never be home, experience without sanctuary is but a shadow, a life that requires hiding is no life, touch without feel reveals no truth, and freedom from uncertainty is no freedom.This book is an incendiary work of immense scholarly and literary significance.With admiral restraint, Zuboff painstakingly dismantles, analyses, and lays bear the machinations of one of the greatest challenges that faces humanity in this century. We have be come not the product, as is so often said, but the raw material of an entirely novel industry. This industry's speed of ascent and adaptation and especially of innovation has left individuals and governments alike, completely unable to meaningfully understand, let alone reign-in, the advance of this all-pervading entity that increases its penetration into our lives and our communities with every passing minute.This book articulates the uncomfortable gut-feeling, the uneasy sense of cognitive dissonance, that I've felt about the level of access companies generally, but especially Alphabet and Facebook, have to my life and every piece of information living that life generates. I understand now why my no-choice participation in this new economy has generated these feelings, in all their expanded and terrifying entirety.While at times bombastic, and others poetic, and others still cool and clinical; the amount of research, time, and passion for humanity itself that went into the construction of this work has paid off. This work is a significant achievement, and an important moment that we can look back on to see whether we as a species can rise to overcome this new challenge, or whether this will be little but foreshadowing of the future we allow to follow.If you're alive right now, you owe it to yourself to read this."

The use and abuse of data and user trust is worth talking about, it's even worth shouting about.But not like this.Zuboff is alarmist, melodramatic, hyperbolic and tiring. Everything the tech companies do is not just wrong, it's a diabolic scheme to undermine the world as we know it. When something is wrong, it's never an unintended consequence, it's never human error, it's never just a silly gimmick not thought out far enough. It's always, always presented as a evil contrived mastermind plot to wreck your privacy and abuse you. And it's always presented like it's the rise of fascism in the 1930's with the most gut-wrenching tear-jerking vocabulary she could find. Get a few examples, simplify a theory somehow related to the issue, contrive a concept, give it a name like ""shadow text"" or ""behavioral surplus"" (preferably a bit ominous name), cherry pick more examples, portend doom. Rinse and repeat. And mention ""surveillance capitalism"" at least 15 times per page.It's kind of ironic that when she goes on for 700+ pages on how you should never trust these companies, that she takes their Silicon Valley hypetalk at face value. If a company claims they can do something, Zuboff gleefully integrates the claim into her narrative with zero criticism. Because it serves her point. But if a company apologises for something, it's of course disingenuous with them being the devil who wants to eat your children.By the time the book gets to behaviour manipulation, it turns from melodramatic to laughable. The obsession Zuboff has for B.F.Skinner and radical behaviorism (a 70-year-old psychology concept, the cognitive revolution would like to have a word...) is full on religious. The man wasn't wrong about anything and conditioning works on people with a hundred per cent efficiency!This is an important issue, but creating hyperbolic devils like this is not just bad writing and argumentation but counter-productive to the cause. It's just creates a shoddy boogeyman argument that is easy to shoot down.The very serious and dramatic reader Audible had for this didn't help btw. (she was very clear speaker though). "
223,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,3,"This is a really important topic and I wish I could give the book more than 3 stars. Everyone knows that the technology we are living with is unprecedented and changing the world. If we aren't careful, we will cause more harm than good. This book is about the dangers of this new information age. But there are a lot of problems with how the information is presented. First, the author uses over-the-top insulting language to describe these companies and leaders--all book long. It's so obviously biased that it undermines her points again and again, prompting lots of eyerolling--about once a page. That's minor, though. More serious is that this book is way too long. It wasn't satisfied making the point, it had to list 10 examples for every point--the full quotes, too. It read more like a college term paper that needed show every piece of research the author did. It's a very long book and it didn't need to be. Finally, the author falls prey to the worst sin in this kind of cultural criticism: she treats her worldview and personality type as the perfect ideal. There was no honest acknowledgement that her era had any flaws, only lament that the world doesn't live more like she used to, that generations will not experience what she did as a child. I very much believe that there are real dangers with only a few companies controlling the information access to the world. I've personally experienced challenges with this (Amazon just recently removed me as a listed seller of my own books, saying I need to sign up for the next level of account--at more cost--before I have the chance to be displayed as the owner of the product again). But it's a mixed bag and the author can't see past her indignation to the true complexity of the situation.So, read this for an imbalanced, overly wordy way of getting one side of the story. If it's not this book, make sure you get both sides of the story, not just the story told by Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, etc."

Today the same practices meet little resistance or even discussion as they are routinely and pervasively deployed on the march towards surveillance revenues.”Welcome to a new and daunting landscape awash with sinister terminology like “permissionless innovation”, “digital totalitarianism”, “reality mining” and “behavioural surplus”. This is the new apparatus that dictates how we move through much of our lives, and just like most architecture out there, after a while, you almost become oblivious to the secret workings and dimensions which are influencing your behaviour and actions. And this is how the boys and girls down in Silicon Valley like it best.“The image of technology as autonomous force with unavoidable actions and consequences has been employed across the centuries to erase the fingerprints of power and absolve it of responsibility. The monster did it, not Victor Frankenstein.”Zuboff touches on many aspects surrounding surveillance capitalism, and we see the intimate relationship between the NSA and CIA and the mutual benefits to that relationship. “The agencies craved the lawlessness that a firm such as Google enjoyed.” We learn the huge significance of Section 230 and how far behind the US is behind the EU in terms of clamping down, one example being the EU law in May 2014 enforcing the right to be forgotten. She cites many sources, but without doubt the two most prominent reference points are the work of B.F. Skinner and Hannah Arendt and in particular her “The Origins of Totalitarianism”. “Google is to surveillance capitalism what the Ford Motor Company and General Motors were to mass-production-based managerial capitalism.”At one point the author sets out the four main areas of fortifications that have allowed Google to be so over protected and free to flourish away from political interference for so long, particularly in the USA,1.	Google showing their capabilities of competitive advantage in electoral politics. 2.	The deliberate blurring of public and private interests through relationships and aggressive lobbying. 3.	A revolving door of personnel who migrated between Google and the Obama administration, who shared mutual interests during Google’s crucial growth years of 2009-2016. By April 2016, 197 individuals had migrated from government to the Googlesphere and 61 had moved in the other direction. 4.	Google’s campaign of influence over academic work and the larger cultural conversation, which was vital to policy formation, public opinion and political perception. “Ford’s inventions revolutionised production. Google’s inventions revolutionised extraction and established surveillance capitalism’s first economic imperative: the extraction imperative.”This book is awash with horror stories befitting of sci-fi paperbacks. Like the one concerning Genesis Toys, who brought out, My Friend Cayla, a terrifying concept in which the child’s doll which relies on voice recognition, also harvests all sorts of data from the customer’s house. It is such a blatant violation that in 2017 Germany, (a country which knows a thing or two about surveillance), banned it as an illegal surveillance device, urging parents to destroy any such dolls in their possession.Due to the nature of this book it does have its harder going moments, but it still remains engaging, and overall Zuboff has completed a chilling, sagacious and damning book on the sinister and sophisticated ploys increasingly used in surveillance capitalism. The text is relatively, devoid of any superfluous academic verbiage, which many of these kinds of books suffer from. These companies and the people tied up with them are the people who hate big, bad words like privacy, tax and transparency. You can employ all the lawyers, lobbyists and accountants and actuaries, but when you strip it all away, what it really is a small, group of dangerous people making the rules up as they go along who have been given a suspiciously free and easy reign over how policy works around the world.Facebook has already admitted to and was even boasting about its power to influence people’s behaviour in US elections, and this was years before the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke. The billionaire owner of that company, Robert Mercer, backed Donald Trump. As Facebook is a private company it did not have to adhere to the legal standards for experimentation required of academic and government researchers. It remains to be seen what Facebook and Google cannot get away with. Providing a vast platform for hate speech, fostering chronic bullying, screening live suicides, streaming acts of terrorism. Where will the line be drawn?...Like bold, bratty toddlers they constantly challenge their boundaries and throw tantrums when anyone dare speaks out, but they needn’t worry a succession of US governments has them well protected as long as that money keeps on coming.Every law, rule or regulation is only as strong as the loopholes allow it to be. If these loopholes are known and continue to exist then we must ask why that is?... Who has the power to close them and more importantly why have they chosen not to close them?...These companies have consistently and effectively been left to self-regulate with predictable consequences. The problems have been known about the Wild West mentality of the internet for many, many years now, but yet little meaningful change has occurred, especially in the US.“Facebook’s $4.6 million in donations during the 2016 election cycle complemented its lobbying budget of $11.5 million in 2017.” But this is nothing compared to Google, which repeatedly spends more on lobbying than any other corporation, shelling out more than $18 million in 2018. It is also the second wealthiest registered lobbyist in the EU. Why are Facebook and Google choosing to spend such astronomical amounts of money?...What must they be getting in return?...What do they want?...What do they get?...Why are we not being told?...Welcome to “American Democracy”. Be afraid, be very afraid…"
225,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50996552-jp-beaty,4,"A really important text for digging out the political import of the data economy. I think the writing is slightly clumsy and I think the book underestimates the connection between Silicon Valley firms and the intelligence services/ the state. I also find the substantive responses to the issue to be a little milquetoast in comparison to the problem she diagnoses (I suppose that’s how it ended up on Obama’s books of the year list). Those problems aside at its best it is a searing look at the logic and function of the data economy. For understanding the ways that big data firms are altering society and how to think about the use and abuse of technology, this is a great book. It’s really at its best at the most conspiratorial and will leave you suspicious of what exactly your phone is doing and what Facebook ultimately wants. I’m sure posting this review will trigger a whole cascade of advertising material to make sure the big social media giants don’t loose my constant stream of crumbs I feed them. Don’t worry amazon algorithm reading this, I am much too trapped in the Skinner box to act on the suspicions raised by this book."
226,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33041497-anna,4,"“Surveillance capitalism’s antidemocratic and antiegalitarian juggernaut is best described as a market-driven coup from above. It is not a coup d’etat in the classic sense but rather a coup de gens: an overthrow of the people concealed as the technological Trojan horse that is Big Other”.This book is a huge, impressive piece of work. It feels like a relief to (at least) get some sort of overview over the way in which surveillance capitalism dominates our lives and orders society, despite the lack of suggestions for solutions. Understanding is the first step towards any form of meaningful resistance, and this feels like a solid first step :-)I do wish it were more accessible (as I do with most political theory) as its message feels like something that needs to be heard by more people than those who are willing to read 500 pages worth of academic language.Also - Zuboff’s idealization of the Henry Ford-era of capitalism rubs me the wrong way."
227,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24266382-ashley,3,"It’s been called “visionary,” but I don’t know that there’s anything entirely new here. What this felt like, to me, was a call to attention. The reader is not surprised by anything Shoshana Zuboff outlines, but is rather forced to acknowledge the problem in its entirety, all at once, in a 500-page package. That does make it feel revolutionary; Zuboff has written what very few people are willing to discuss in mainstream media, but which everyone has an inkling of, one way or another. I did find that it was a little too long-winded. It could have been significantly compressed, especially when a lot of the material was repetitive in order to emphasize certain themes and vocabulary.... and her preoccupation with B.F. Skinner was unnecessary. Zuboff was never so brilliant than when she illustrated, specifically, how Facebook and Google and Samsung (among others) are driving our behavior for their own profit, frequently at the expense of the law. I think that this strength was often drowned in vocabulary lessons and meandering observations, coming across as a little self-indulgent somewhere around the 200-page mark. It was unnecessary to spend so much time explaining Zuboff’s coined terms, such as “the uncontract”, “unprecedented”, “radical indifference”, “behavioural surplus”, and even “surveillance capitalism” itself. Especially in Part III, Zuboff’s self-indulgence became a running tangent, entire sections devoted to philosophy (and biology) lessons on the concept of “free will” and “utopia.”  In spite of that, it has definitely changed the way I think. It has also further fueled my nostalgia for a simpler time, and my distrust of social media and big corporations. The fact that it’s near-impossible to escape the clutches of these corporations is what really keeps me up at night; it’s not so much a privacy issue (I couldn’t care less if Mark Zuckerberg gets access to my old Instagram photos of cappuccinos) but rather a question of ethics. If I don’t want to give my data to third-parties, why are they able to access it anyway? If I don’t want to contribute to the rise of Facebook or Google, why are they still able to profit off of me anyway? Consent doesn’t really enter the conversation when it comes to what these rich tech companies have in mind, and evasive, incomplete privacy policies are nothing but “placebo effects” to pacify users.  Yes, I’m aware of the irony of publishing this review to Amazon-owned Goodreads.  ""Surveillance Capitalism"" is the kind of book that makes you want to throw your laptop into Lake Ontario and live in a cabin in the woods. I don’t know that I have the gumption for that kind of drastic change, but I’ll definitely think twice whenever I consider downloading an app or signing up for e-newsletters; I will certainly avoid buying any new smart devices by whatever means necessary. I do think it’s time for us to start protesting the free-reign that these conglomerates have been given, especially in North America. Our own behavior is being observed and herded by the rich 1% for financial gain; everything from our spending habits to our complacency is being mediated and controlled. I think, eventually, we have to reclaim our sense of autonomy and identity, and our understanding of reality.  Also, I just want to state for the record that I’ve always found it odd how North America experienced a period of mass rebellion, political protesting, and unrest during the 1960’s and 1970’s – and that this unrest suddenly came to a complete stop, save for a few exceptions here and there. Well, Zuboff has justified my unease, dedicating a sub-chapter to the behavior-control research conducted by the US Senate in the 70’s – research which became urgent as political protests escalated. And yes, surveillance capitalism has everything to do with it.  At the end of this heavy volume, Zuboff was really only trying to say one thing, re-stated from multiple angles: we are being rigorously and continuously exploited by capitalists. We don’t own our behavior anymore. Data collection and behavior control for the purpose of financial profit has crossed all ethical boundaries, and we as a society are content to let it happen.  This book is definitely recommended, if you have the patience and endurance to get through it. I almost didn’t. In a similar vein, I also recommend watching ‘Smithereens’, one of the recent Black Mirror episodes. Despite its melodrama, I think it has a lot of important things to say on society’s need to be “plugged in” and how this addiction is driving our lives. Some of Zuboff’s quotes that will stick with me: -“Its products are about predicting us, without actually caring what we do or what is done to us.” -“As populations grow numb, it becomes more difficult for individuals and groups to complain.” -“[Cortana] wants to know everything about you, but it does not want you to know how much it knows [...]” -“ ‘The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.’ ” [-Mark Weiser] -“Contemporary reviewers of Kahn’s book invariably seized upon the dark ‘nightmare scenarios’ of the computerized surveillance theme, the science-fiction–like forms of control that, they assumed, ‘will be actively feared and resented by many.’ Despite the wide range of scenarios that Kahn presented in his book on the distant year 2000, Kahn’s voyage into the ‘unthinkable’ was viewed by the public as a way to prepare for ‘the worst possible outcome’ in a terrifying ‘nightmare of social controls.’ Yet now, that same nightmare is rendered as an enthusiastic progress report on surveillance capitalism’s latest triumphs.” -“[…] Google wants us to accept that its rules simply reflect the requirements of autonomous processes, something that people cannot control. However, our grasp of the inner logic of surveillance capitalism suggests otherwise. Men and women made it, and they can control it. They merely choose not to do so.” -“Many people feel that if you are not on Facebook, you do not exist. People all over the world raced to participate in Pokémon Go. With so much energy, success, and capital flowing into the surveillance capitalist domain, standing outside of it, let alone against it, can feel like a lonely and risky prospect.”"

229,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85785571-laurence-lai,1,"The title “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism” evokes a weighty subject, and the book’s subtitle purports to something menacing to the future of humankind. It is to be seen if its contents are as substantial as the book’s 700-page length would suggest.The author, Shoshana Zuboff, is a professor emerita at Harvard Business School, not unimpressive an honor by any measure. A summary of assertions made in the book is as follows:1.	Big technological colossuses (Big Techs), epitomized by Google and Facebook, operate their business models by extracting data trails of online users, and in turn selling the extrapolated results (what Zuboff calls behavioral surplus) to their advertising customers.2.	Sophisticated algorithms are deployed and constantly refined to increase the predictive value of profiling data. At the same time, online users are passively served with moderated searches, federated news feeds, suggested connections, etc., all under the coercive power of the Big Techs. Such duress is as severe as not only to affect, shape, and compel, but with the aim to modify and manipulate user behaviors.3.	With the proliferation of sensors and Internet connectivity, Big Techs extend their reach far beyond the virtual realm to the real world. Regarding the surveillance operated by these techno-capitalists, in the author’s telling, its presence so pervasive and its impact so complete that any human free agency has receded entirely to the background and is ineffective.4.	While the above are not new to anyone who has casual understanding of current economics and culture, what Zuboff strives to accentuate is their connection to high-order issues such as self, liberty, democratic values, and human nature. She compares the dangers posed by “surveillance capitalism” to that of fascism, totalitarianism, behaviorist utopianism, and the like, that once presented real or potential detriments to humanity. For its thrilling effects, the agenda for the book is sweeping, even ambitious. Technological advancement, especially one that combines deep analytics, machine intelligence, and makes its ubiquitous presence in our intimate lives deserves a dispassionate evaluation as to its social impacts. Zuboff should be applauded for selecting this timely topic for her book.Yet one cannot help but feel frustrated by the lack of thematic organization of the whole book. Instead of explicating the economics involved in this different “capitalism”, Zuboff is more concerned with weaving her own narrative of abstruse euphemisms about how grave a danger the human future is facing. Materials are regurgitated, often word for word from the earlier part of the book and throughout. As to what actions Zuboff suggests to “fight for a human future…”? The author offers an ill-defined “synthetic declaration” (p. 345), and a skimpy, equally obscure advice of “friction, courage, and bearings” (p. 524). Specifics are sorely lacking in allusions to democratic institutions, public opinion, legislative and judicial recourse (p. 520). A whimper of a solution indeed to a loud bang of such a doorstopper.Zuboff obviously sets out to intend the book as a treatise that plumbs the depth of these to her as “unprecedented” developments in “surveillance capitalism”, and attempts to compare philosophically with past phenomena its manifold menaces to humanity. But it is exactly in such philosophizing that is the weakest of the book, for her arguments are at best tenuous and strained. On the other hand, the author wily limits her subject to mostly the socio-economic domain of the Western world, as is indicated in the book’s title. The picture would have been more complete if it had combined with surveillance authoritarianism. The “social credit” system practised unimpeded in China makes only passing reference in mere 6 pages (pgs. 388-394). Certainly, the threat to human liberty and dignity is far graver when the surveillance apparatus and capability are controlled by a police state, whereas in Western democracies competition among capitalists still exists. What is most infuriating is Zuboff’s penchant for fabricating catchphrases. Smug expressions such as “dispossession”, “behavioral futures”, “cultural misappropriation”, “economy of action”, “division of learning”, “shadow text”, “uncontract”, “hive”, “coup from above”, “Big Other”, “instrumentarian power”, “right to the future tense”, “third modernity*” …., litter throughout the book. The meanings of many of these are poorly articulated. Although she attempts to provide a brief rationale to her epithetic acrobatic (p. 66), such twisting of language is unnecessary and far from successful. It is an act of throwing spaghetti upon the wall; hoping that somehow one such phrase may stick with posterity with reference made to the author. As stated, the impression appears that the writer is more interested in weaving an esoteric narrative than presenting facts. Read a typical sentence on p. 488 of the book:“No exit” is the necessary condition for Big Other to flourish, and its flourishing is the necessary condition for all that is meant to follow: the tides of behavioral surplus and their transformation into revenue, the certainty that will meet every market player with guaranteed outcomes, the bypass of trust in favor of the uncontract’s radical indifference, the paradise of effortless connection that exploits the needs of harried second-modernity individuals and transforms their lives into the means to others’ ends, the plundering of the self, the extinction of autonomous moral judgment for the sake of frictionless control, the actuation and modification that quietly drains the will to will, the forfeit of your voice in the first person in favor of others’ plans, the destruction of the social relations and politics of the old and slow and still-unfulfilled ideals of self-determining citizens bound to the legitimate authority of democratic governance.” Long sentences can be beautiful in abler literary hands, but the above is downright egregious in form and meaning. Zuboff’s writing style can be aptly depicted as beating around the bush, with hyperboles and a plethora of inapt metaphors that ill befits so serious a subject she wants to convey. At times, she relishes so much staying with her metaphoric vehicles that the intended tenors are nowhere to be found. Long, winding sentences with chained substantives also further hamper readability.So, are readers more empowered at the end “with a more cogent and comprehensive understanding” (p. 18) of the menacing incursion exerted by the Big Techs? For the newly initiated, the writing style has done more to obfuscate than to illuminate. For the more inclined and those who look for some concrete societal antidotes, Zuboff has woefully under-delivered. More clear-eyed analyses are still awaited on the technologies proffered by the Big Techs, on the associated data-driven economy, and their consequent impacts to individuals and society at-large. * cf. Alan de Vulpian, 2003 (English , 2008)"

233,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4679583-myles,3,"This week my company officially got into the business of surveillance. People will pay us to surveil their home and business computers to protect them from rogue computer software, from losing data resulting from defective or aging components in their computers, and from misguided management of their computers themselves.Going forward this will be a growing and lucrative business segment because people rely on their computers to do so many important things for them, because they feel inadequate keeping up with changes in the computing environment, and because they justifiably fear cyber crime.It doesn’t mean they like it. I sure don’t.Being in retail business as I have for almost 25 years I have learned how to surveil myself, to protect my assets, and my employees. It is an ongoing challenge and it changes. I surveil for shoplifters, for currency and credit card counterfeiters, for daylight and after hours thieves. I surveil for dishonest employees, for honest mistakes, for poor buying decisions, and for the obsolescence of the products on my shelves. I surveil how the bank handles my money. I surveil my suppliers to prevent them from shipping me incomplete or broken goods. And I pay attention to my customers, to save them from making poor purchasing decisions.And when I am not surveilling, I am surveying. All the time. How were my customers’ experiences? What new products are on the horizon? How can I protect my liquidity, my profitability, and lastly, my sanity.I especially surveil myself, because I make mistakes, and because I too am growing old.These are some of the risks of operating a business.Then there are the people who surveil me. They include thieves looking for a weakness in my security. Government agencies to make sure I am paying the eight or ten different taxes I pay on an ongoing basis. Credit card companies surveil my transactions to make sure somebody hasn’t stolen my credit card, or that I am spending no more money than I can afford to pay back. My suppliers make sure I am paying them on time. Some manufacturers visit me in person or electronically to make sure I am representing their product lines fairly. They send me electronic training, and tests, and they regularly measure the efficiency and quality of our repair facilities. The utilities tell me when my operations (and home) are inefficient. And there are my landlords.Finally, we surveil at home. We surveil our daughter to make sure she is doing her homework and not falling in with the wrong crowd. My wife surveils me to make sure I’m not overeating, overspending, or being overly attentive to other women. I surveil my dog Seamus just in case he poops on the neighbour’s lawn so I can pick it up before someone notices. And Seamus surveils the front window and barks whenever a neighbouring dog saunters by. Last and not least are the gargantuan corporations who are watching what I do online. People like facebook, Google, amazon, and many, many more.So when somebody writes a book to tell me I live in an Age of Surveillance Capitalism...I GET IT! REALLY, I GET IT!But is it uniquely capitalist, or more generally an age of surveillance?And if it is more general to our society, where do we go from here?One thing for sure: it isn’t going away anytime soon.Shoshana Zuboff concentrates her guns on Google and facebook. She’s concerned that these companies are inherently different from the companies that came before it and they set a new standard for egregious capitalism. They are companies in the prediction business, predicting human behaviour and right now largely predicting purchasing behaviour by accumulating, as she called it, “surplus behaviour,” which kinda sounds like an oxymoron. She believes they abuse the freedoms of the marketplace to frustrate privacy, that they are built to enrich few and sidestep the traditional workplace which pays many employees fairly and creates consumers, and she argues that they are indifferent to social ills.She argues that Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” doesn’t operate in this marketplace because the new knowledge capitalists know everything happening in the market.A close reading of Andrew Carnegie’s life and legacy, perhaps John D. Rockefeller as well, could lead you to a similar conclusion, even though both men turned to philanthropy later in life. For sure, these men affected the course of capitalism.Is this a turn away from “good” capitalism toward an inherently evil capitalism?And if it is evil, can we create some rules for the big guys that us little guys can live with?Let’s take a step back and look at things in context: Google’s revenue is about $25 billion, Facebook’s $17 billion. The entire US economy is about $25 trillion and the world economy upwards of $107 trillion. Most of Google’s and Facebook’s revenue is advertising. The US advertising market is upwards of $80 billion so it is fair to say these two firms command quite strong positions in this industry. If you make the argument that America’s advertising industry is too concentrated then you’d have a pretty good argument to break up these firms which combined represent about 50% of all advertising dollars in the US. By comparison, Standard Oil at its peak commanded 88% of the market for processing crude. In its first year of operation, US Steel produced 67% of steel produced the the US.And they exhibit the classic behaviour of monopolists by dominating the markets for search and for social media on a global scale.In the US a case for breaking up the firms traditionally would have to be made that consumers are paying too much for their services or that competitors are being kept out of the market. Maybe breaking up these firms is a good idea, maybe it isn’t, but either way the technologies they employ for gathering, and analyzing, data isn’t going away.When I worked as an auditor, we used to gather lots of data, too, but what we eventually learned was that we could make assumptions about its meaning by sampling the information; that is, we cut down our work by only looking at some of the data. We tried to cut down on the wasted time. I sometimes wonder how much of what Google does is a total waste of time because the answers it seeks can be found in much faster time using much less data. And how much of “Big Data” is in fact a “Big Waste of Time.”Zuboff doesn’t consider that these firms may still be just in the early stages of figuring out what they are supposed to be doing. I think about it because so much time and resources are wasted paying attention to wholly irrelevant stuff.But we would do well to consider the affect of these companies on our freedoms and our government partially because they aren’t just national problems. They are transnational problems. What happens in China, and the extreme kind of surveillance practiced there on ethnic minorities like the Uigers, affects or will affect us here.They are transnational because the data collection is transnational and the very same data collected for the purpose of selling advertising is probably being used to develop artificial intelligence. The fastest developer of AI whether they be Chinese companies, transnational companies like Google or Facebook, or companies directly financed by government will have a big say in who has a job in the coming years and who doesn’t.No country on its own can hope to curb data collection and aggregation or perhaps more importantly, the control of what search results reveal on this scale any more than a country can curb money laundering, tax avoidance, or climate change without coordination between many if not all nations. Contemporary politics seems to be going in the opposite direction if Trump’s “America First,” Brexit, and Russian adventurism are any indication. If we are divided and our attention fractured we are susceptible to the influence or real or imagined “experts.” (To firms like Facebook I think we all have ADD, attention deficit disorder...they can never get enough of our attention!) That doesn’t mean we cannot continue to make decisions affecting our government, it more likely means that the decisions we make will more commonly resemble the imperatives of those desiring more of the same, read: the status quo.And that turns us to the question of how good is the status quo. If you believe that the universe ultimately bends toward the dilution of energy, total entropy, then the status quo is not too good. If you believe the status quo to be a teleological evolution toward a great singularity, perhaps a union with God, and a progression toward greater complexity in the universe, the status quo looks pretty good.Business executives, in my experience, tend to be of the more optimistic latter type of people. Like the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world and other people who have become incredibly wealthy in a short period of time.In the meantime, some of us have rather pedestrian concerns like the security of really private information. While convincingly arguing that there is insufficient transparency over who handles the big data and how they handle it, I think Zuboff fails to sufficiently weigh immense risk that the data will fall out of control of the aggregators and into the hands of rogue individuals.The hacking of credit card databases is one thing, and I think it a bigger risk than the hacking of a database which tells people how I like my hotdogs dressed. People made a big deal of the Cambridge Analytica scare. In the end, those people sold bogus claims to naive political organizations. The data predicted nothing and was of no use to anybody. And it didn’t get Donald Trump elected.Certainly big data aggregation has concrete effects on the economy. You get “free” Google searches. I get a cheaper smart TV because the data guys get first dibs on my TV watching preferences.This book is not the best guide for the good works these technologies enable (ie crowd sourcing, scientific research, epidemiology, etc). Self-driving cars benefit by machine learning. The acceleration and reductions in the friction in electronic commerce are generally good things.I don’t agree with Zuboff that the behavioural science behind the new data aggregation firms promotes a radical indifference to the lot of the common person. Nor do I agree that hyperscale doesn’t require competitive markets or for that matter democracy.This has yet to be proven.We all need participatory democracy, and more than ever on a global scale. Let’s make these damn machines work for us, not agin us."
234,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26854448-m-a,5,"This is a brilliant and important book about the future of mankind.It is unfortunately very difficult to read, due not only to the complexity of the subject matter, but also due to the constant use by the author of jargon and long complicated sentences. This is very ironic, considering that this book is intended as a warning and a call to action to the general public against the machinations of the Surveillance Capitalist elite. I can only hope that a more accessible version of this book will be published to accomplish that goal.Zuboff claims that surveillance capitalism is as big a change for our society as industrial capitalism was more than two centuries ago.It all started with Google, followed closely by Facebook, Microsoft and eventually by all digital industries.Google started collecting our private data (from our search terms on Google search, to our emails on Gmail, to our location data on Google Maps, our data stored on our Android devises etc..) without our knowledge or consent and turning them into predictions about our future behavior, which they sold for profit to marketers.Zuboff calls Google ""privacy kleptomaniacs"". She compares Google to the Spanish conquistadores invading the natives on the American continent and declaring the continent theirs by a monarchical edict declaring it so. So did Google invade our private data by declaring it theirs through obscure unilaterally imposed terms of service.She calls this data, the new raw material of capitalism ""Behavioral Surplus"".She traces the architecture of this new form of capitalism from its supply routes to its ""behavioral futures markets"".The production of digital data has far outpaced the human capacity to process/make sense of that data.Therefore, behavioral psychologists and data scientists have created algorithms to predict an individual's future behavior based on the billions of raw data of his/her every move and every thought.They use the 5 factor personality model, the 6 emotion model, affective computing, emotional analytics and sentiment analysis to predict our personalities and our future behavior.Surveillance Capitalists are prediction factories, based on raw materials from us.Google and co don't sell the raw data, they sell behavioral predictions based on that data.That information is not only useful to marketers, but to anyone with an interest in that knowledge and an interest in influencing that future behavior.Some examples of benefits of knowing a person's future behavior with very great accuracy include: predicting disease, financial risk, criminal risk, consumer preferences and political views. This knowledge about the future allows corporations to eliminate all risks in their business dealings.Zuboff calls this predictive data the ""shadow text"".This shadow text is only available to surveillance capitalists through their data extractions and algorithms.It is about us but not for us.Us being unaware of the surveillance is the precondition for surveillance capitalism to function properly- we are to remain unaware of the shadow text. Even if raw data are shared with us, the shadow data crafted for prediction purposes is not accessible to us.Remote digital observation and tele-stimulation ( the ""god view"") allows for distancing of the observed as ""the other"".Zuboff calls the Surveillance Capitalists the ""Big Other"".""The market reduces us to our behavior, transformed into another fictional commodity and packaged for others' consumption"" We are to be monitored and tele stimulated.Zuboff demonstrates how surveillance capitalism has expanded beyond cyberspace into our everyday life.Even the human body is treated as a computer, containing data in order to provide corporations certainty of profit.Take wearables for example: they form an unobtrusive integration to everyday life- internet connected fabrics, fitness trackers, diabetes apps etc.Zuboff quotes a study that shows that apps downloaded on a smart phone extract location data, contact lists, photos & videos etc without express consent of the user and that they sell this data to third parties.According to Zuboff, these companies' privacy policies should be called ""surveillance policies"".She predicts we will all end up with chips in our bodies for better surveillance, like animals. Telemetry is already used on animals to study their behavior. Humans will be next.We are already tracked in our cars, in our homes, in our kidneys (dialysis devices).By 2020, there will be 20 billion intelligent devices with the capability of tracking and monitoring us.Zuboff calls whatever data that is not yet tracked ""dark data"". Surveillance Capitalists are intent on tracking all behavior that is not (yet) informatized.They want to monetize every aspect of our lives, the entire human experience. They want to turn our entire life into profit for themselves.Power was once identified with the ownership of the means of production.Now power rests in the ownership of the means of behavioral prediction and behavioral modification of the other. Now our lives are turned into data without our knowledge or consent in order to benefit others.Zuboff explains how the system of Surveillance Capitalism is grounded in behavioral psychology.The goal of behaviorism is the prediction and control of behavior- the human being is nothing but an organism, an ""it"". According to behaviorists a human is in essence no different than a mushroom, only a bit more complex.Behaviorists (eg Skinner and Pentland) believe humans have no freedom of will, no autonomy, no agency. Freedom of will is an illusion. It is the environment that controls behavior. Individual behavior is caused by variables lying outside the individual himself.Hence the belief by behaviorists that behavioral control can lead to predicting future behavior with scientific accuracy. Behavior must be studied w/o limits and w/o knowledge of the ""organism"".Privacy is an illusion just like freedom- they must be forfeited in favor of the good life.BUT this view was meant to benefit all of humanity; the knowledge gained through behavioral tracking was to be used to improve human behavior towards a better future for humanity: fighting disease, crime, poverty etc..Instead, behaviorism has been hijacked by surveillance capitalism to benefit only the small class of surveillance capitalists and their customers. The lost freedom only affects us but the acquired knowledge and profit is all theirs.What are the dangers of Surveillance Capitalism?The more one knows about a person, the easier it is to control him.Besides being used for targeted marketing, knowledge of personal data can also be used to blackmail, defame, harass and discriminate against us.The dangers lie not only in corporate surveillance itself and the accompanying loss of privacy, but even more worrisome, in corporate mind manipulation and corporate behavioral modification, such as the creation of conformity and obedience but also the creation of desires that benefit commerce and emotions that benefit politicians. Surveillance capitalists wants ALL of you- your behavior, your thoughts, your emotions, your personality- so they can manipulate your behavior. Will you have any autonomy, any free will left? Surveillance Capitalism is not only a danger to privacy, but a danger to democracy which depends on autonomous moral judgment and individual determination and free will. Zuboff believes in free will as the basis for individuality, self determination, and the right to decide our future (She calls it ""The right to the future tense"").The right to be one's author of one's future should be cast as a human right-necessary because it is imperiled by ""the panvasive digital architecture of behavioral modification owned and operated by surveillance capital, necessitated by its economic imperatives and driven by its laws of motion, all for the sake of its guaranteed outcomes""Will Google, FB and co. lead to digital totalitarianism? According to Zuboff the answer is no, because the past offers no adequate compass for this new phenomenon.Zuboff calls the future of Surveillance Capitalism ""Instrumentarianism"".Totalitarianism, as impersonated by Hitler and Stalin was only understood after the facts. It entails the destruction of all human ties except total loyalty to the movement (fascism or communism). It operates through the means of violence, terror and fear- all who do not conform, the enemies of the ""people"", are executed.Instrumentarianism behaves through the means of behavioral modification.And, unlike in a totalitarian regime, there is no need to use force . All you need is adequate human engineering.""Instrumentarianism"" is a behaviorally controlled society, in which knowledge replaces freedom. In such a society, social change can be generated by social pressure from social networks to ""go with the flow, stay with the herd, return to the hive and take flight with the flock"". Identity yields to synchrony.Such a society leads to the death of individuality. The collective intelligence knows best and individuality is only unnecessary friction towards that goal.Instrumentarian society with its architecture of behavioral control, social pressure and asymmetrical power is a Panopticon - there is no exit possible.Once it was believed that there is no exit from an all knowing and all powerful God.Under Instrumentarianism, there will be no exit from the others, big other and the surveillance capitalists. Big Other knows no boundaries.Zuboff pleads for the right to sanctuary.It is a universal need for a safe refuge, for shelter.This right is as ancient as human history; originally it manifested itself in the form of a city, or a temple. Later on this right extended to the home: a sanctuary from arbitrary intrusion. Psychologists agree that this is important for development of the self and for mental health. With Big Other, the Universe takes up residence within our walls, there is no refuge. (thinkof internet connected security cameras, light switches, thermostats, appliances, rumbas, wearables,smart phones, tooth brushes, beds, personal assistants, TVs, toys,etc etc).What solution does Zuboff propose to avert the coming Instrumentarian Society?To just stop using the internet and internet connected devices?Surveillance Capitalists offer solutions to social connection, access to information, time saving convenience and ""illusionary"" support and this got us all addicted. It is not reasonable to expect us to go off the grid.Privacy regulation and monopoly regulation is inefficient at combating those risks- it will not be solved by encryption, anonymization or discussion of data ownership. This is a new condition that outruns the law, that has not been tamed by law. Zuboff discusses very briefly the new regulatory regime operating in the EU since May 2018, the GDPR ( General Data Protection Regulation). The GDPR is a good step forward, but only time will tell if it will be efficient in vanquishing surveillance capitalism's instrumentarian power. The individual is powerless against the surveillance capitalist machine because of asymmetrical power and knowledge. Only collective action on the ground, such as class actions, will determine if GDPR will be effective.Regulators will be up against well funded corporate lawyers and lobbyists.Zuboff concludes that Surveillance Capitalism is profoundly anti democratic. It is a market coup from above on the people. It is a form of tyranny, of absolutism; it imposes its rules from above; everyone except the tyrant is just an organism, the ""other one"", to be exploited for the profit of the tyrant.Industrial revolution has led to near destruction of our planet and extinction of many species. Instrumentarianism will lead to extinction of our individuality.Zuboff points to the critical role of public opinion on changing the laws. She proclaims passionately:It is NOT ok to strip search us for profit.It is a human expectation to be the author of one's life.There is still time to redirect the action to a future that we can call home.It is our responsibility to right was has gone wrong.We have to be indignant because this is an attack on human dignity.Freedom from uncertainty is no freedom.She refuses to seed the future to illegitimate power.She demands a human future.She calls the world to action to declare the digital future to be a human future."
235,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42693079-ryan-o-neill,4,"This ambitious and expansive book aims to define and explain the rise of surveillance capitalists like Google, Facebook and Microsoft as they play ever larger roles in our lives. Shoshana Zuboff briefly maps out the history of some of these companies and delves into the way in which they gradually encroach on our lives in ever more frightening ways.She argues persuasively that while sometimes driven by old capitalist imperatives, these companies represent a break from past eras such as that of industrial capitalism as they secretly and aggressively gather increasing amounts of personal information from us, but not for our benefit; rather than the traditional business-customer reciprocities, surveillance capitalists plunder every element of our lives, both online and offline, for the benefit of advertisers, and ultimately serve their economic benefit.Under surveillance capitalism, we are no longer the customers (although practices are often disguised under the auspices of 'personalisation') but rather our searches, browsing history, friends, likes, reactions, emotions and feelings are raw materials to be scraped for the benefit of companies who are free to operate outside the boundaries of traditional democracy and regulation. Our rights are ruthlessly and carelessly cast aside and rendered obsolete in this relentless pursuit of behavioural surplus without which surveillance capitalists cannot grow.These companies encroach upon our personal space in ever more intrusive ways - from the original Google Street View controversy in the mid-2000s to Facebook's hidden methods of gleaning info on our preferences, to TVs that listen to you, wearable devices, Alexa house alarms and even toys that listen to you, to the fight for our car dashboards. The speed and aggression is such that after initial outrage, we are worn down, helpless and numbed, resigned to our fate.Surveillance capitalism, Zuboff argues, attempts to create certainty of outcome for its actual customers - its advertisers. This is done by parsing human behaviour, exploiting feelings, emotions and beliefs even when we don't permit it to, so that our individual freedom, our rights to define our own experience, and to act and think in private are eroded as we are continuously moulded and directed towards specific courses of action by these companies. The inherent uncertainty that exists within how we think, how we act and interact - our right to an effective life - is replaced by collective certainty at the hands of surveillance capitalism.Zuboff also mines the effects of social media on young people's development. As they journey from being defined by their relationships at a young age to becoming separate from but connected to others in adulthood, young people are adversely affected by social media and its imperatives to forcing people to see themselves 'from the outside in' and define themselves based on the experiences and lives of others. The pervasiveness of social media means people often struggle to disconnect, their mental health even suffering from brief separation from their accounts. This crucially and savagely inhibits their ability to look inward and make that journey from people defined by their relationships in youth, to autonomous individuals who have relationships in adulthood.Zuboff argues that while the advent of new laws such as GDPR in Europe have been helpful, surveillance capitalism's overall success in evading proper regulation and legal scrutiny means that decisive action will depend on a turning of public opinion. Lots of us are passive about our distrust of social media, but it will take a re-establishment of indignation, a renewal of outrage, if we are to have any chance of stemming the flow.The book is a heavy undertaking; more than 500 pages long and often written in rather academic prose, and it can occasionally be quite dense and abstract. Given the ubiquity of technology in all of our lives, it could undoubtedly be more reader-friendly, and perhaps focus on more real-life examples that we are all familiar with. Despite its wealth of information, Xuboff's proposed solutions are vague, and it is arguably unclear what exactly you as an individual can do personally to reduce the insidious influence of surveillance capitalism in your everyday life; what strategies can be used to repell Facebook from building a strong profile based on your preferences, for example? Is there a feasible path to effective life without being on Facebook?Furthermore, it would have been helpful to have some more analysis on the gathering of information not related to economics - the how and why of information kept either by governments or corporations on citizens for reasons not linked to monetary benefits.Nevertheless, this is a hugely informative, well researched and important book on a subject which, as the author herself notes, is a story still unfolding and which still has some way to run. It's likely that many updates and more reader-friendly analyses on surveillance capitalism will follow, but this is a fantastic launch-pad for one of the defining issues of our time."
236,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45700308-tanmay-srivastava,1,"Shoshana Zuboff's book was highly recommended, was part of multiple lists and had glowing reviews on Goodreads. I was quite excited to pick it up and start reading.  Without calling it out, Zuboff treats incremental technological progress as a zero sum game. A win for the tech companies is a loss to someone. Take, for example when Zuboff talks about connected cars . She says an insurance company can stall a car if the premiums are not paid. She beats up this argument and brings up a case of how an elderly couple had to choose between car payments and medicine, which came to light only when the collection officers turned up at the door. A crowdfunding campaign was launched to help them and it had a happy ending. Using software however would have meant that this would have never happened. She fails to recognize that her example is the exception and not the norm. She chooses to ignore the positive impact connected cars would have on say, cars getting stolen going down leading to lower premiums or reduced premiums for drivers using their cars less or rewarding good drivers by reducing their premiums. Maybe, with such technological advances premiums would fall to such an extent that the couple wouldn't have to worry about premium payments altogether? She fails to acknowledge that progress is not a zero sum game. Tech companies have been bashed quite a bit through the book. There is no nod of appreciation for the positive impact they have had on societies. Here, In India - products of these tech companies are helping small businesses make moves that wouldn't have been possible before. Expensive POS Machines have been skipped (the same way how landlines didn't make it to parts of India but mobile phones did) in favor of Google Pay (QR Codes for Bank to Bank transfers). Book keeping doesn't required expensive licenses and can be managed online. Whatsapp is used to sell/communicate/deliver orders. YouTube is a learning platform for many, and a medium for news outside of the traditional media. The jobs these tech companies have created in India, directly and indirectly, also cannot be overlooked. There's a section where Zuboff talks about fake news and its impact on Brexit and the 2016 US Election. While I do agree fake news is a very big issue, the issue of voter discretion cannot be overlooked. In Zadie Smith's essay on Brexit -  ""Fences""  she writes how someone voted one way in referendum to get rid of the health secretary. Would it have been different if it was not targeted to a particular group (via the likes of Cambridge Analytica)? Would the results of Brexit and the 2016 US Election have been the same if there was no Facebook? Are we giving these incidents more importance than they deserve? ""Who knows?"" - I don't. I don't think we can ever conclusively state yes or no. The biggest issue is that a lot of topics covered in the book are in the grey area. Is it okay to give someone hungry a burger from McDonald's? The burger will make sure that they don't go hungry, but it's not a healthy meal. Can they afford to have a healthy meal? Can they stay hungry? Is there a way to grow healthy food to feed everyone? Is there a way to make everyone want/enjoy the healthy food? This sort of reasoning should have been the core of the book. You cannot do without technology companies today. Google, Microsoft, Facebook are essential parts of our day to day lives. Is there a business model where these companies can make enough money to create products that add value without compromising on data to drive revenue? Is there a market for people to pay for their services without any data getting collected? Do people bother to dig deep in their account settings to switch off optional data collection? Do people care? I feel the book is not asking the right questions needed to drive policy discussions. Data privacy is an important topic. The book is well researched in parts but jumps into pages of wishful thinking. The conclusions drawn are biased. The facts are presented in a way to scare you, and similar to how likes are garnered on social media with scary/angry posts, this book has scared people into giving it 5 stars on Goodreads. I wish this book was not one sided as it was - Not recommended."
237,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27470888-cool-breeze,1,"The subject of this book is very important. Unfortunately, this book fails miserably at contributing anything useful to the discussion. It is mind-numbingly long at 691 pages and an ordeal to read. Zuboff takes a few observations on surveillance technology issues and uses pretentious academic jargon to fluff them into this execrable doorstop of a book. The book does not offer any practical solutions to the issues she raises. A good editor could have reduced this to a pamphlet or a web article without leaving much notable out.This is possibly the worst non-fiction book I have ever read. I dreaded resuming it every time I picked it up and finally abandoned it on page 158. If I should ever be stuck on a desert island with only this book for reading material, I will be thankful at least that I have an abundant supply of toilet paper.Zuboff is a sociologist and the language she employs is tortured and tedious in the extreme. She insists on coining lots of neologisms and wallowing in her jargon. Amusingly, her favorite term is Behavioral Surplus, or BS for short. The book could have saved countless pages if she reduced a lot of her BS to abbreviations. Perhaps such Heideggerian writing impresses her academic colleagues, but it is excruciating for the average reader. She beats her core points to death – within the first 100 pages she must have repeated some version of the following point dozens of times – ‘the user isn’t the customer, nor are they the product, they are the raw material that is used to create the product’. You could have cut many more pages by limiting this point to three repetitions. It is as if she thinks her readers are idiots, or else she has dementia and doesn’t remember what she wrote a page or two ago. Even worse, Zuboff is a Luddite and a hard-core leftist. She obviously thinks the Industrial Revolution was largely a disaster. On page 11, she writes “industrial civilization… threatens to cost us the earth”. By page 12, she is hyperventilating “The industrial legacy of climate chaos fills us with dismay, remorse and fear”. No, it doesn’t. The reason Trump is President and the US has repudiated stupid climate treaties is that so many American voters think this is a non-issue or a very low priority (#18 out of 19 in a recent survey). On page 22, she writes that she has been inspired by a rogues' gallery of leftists, including Karl Marx, Theodor Adorno, Jean-Paul Sartre and Thomas Piketty (Robert Reich and Rachel Carson, who is responsible for millions of deaths, are also mentioned favorably). On page 33, she likens her great-grandparents fleeing the oppression of 1908 Russia to the oppression of the nuclear family (you poor, fragile snowflake!). On page 38 she viciously criticizes Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, although she admits their policies pulled the country out of the stagflation and “malaise” of the Jimmy Carter years. Unbelievably, Zuboff apparently thinks airline deregulation was a bad thing. On page 42, she is writes approvingly of rioters in London (she really should read some Theodore Dalrymple on the real problems involved) and the dilettante, astroturf Occupy “movement”. On page 43, she comments disapprovingly on those who would “pare regulations, cut taxes… and shrink entitlements”. Heaven forbid that anyone should want to take an ax to the leviathan state! By page 109, she is bemoaning the Supreme Court’s rejection of restrictions on political speech, “hate speech” (meaning anything she and her politically correct brethren disagree with), pornography (yeah, she’s puritanical as well as a Luddite) and free association. What a pinch-faced scold!Only at this point does she admit that her arch-villain, Google, has been totally in bed with the left-wing Obama administration, using their surveillance technology to mastermind his two Presidential campaigns and running a revolving door operation with 258 employees moving between Google and the Obama regime. Whoops! How inconvenient! It’s almost like leftism and this creepy surveillance technology go hand in hand! Curiously, in a 691-page book, the word “Clinton” does not appear even once in the 26-page index! I wonder who was President from 1996 to 2001, Google’s first five years? Or who was Hillary’s biggest corporate campaign contributor? It is a complete mystery, according to this book. Zuboff doesn’t actually appear to be a Clinton fan, so maybe she just doesn’t want to wind up adding to the Arkancide body count like Jeffrey Epstein.Zuboff must have felt terrible about documenting the extent of Obama’s collusion with Google’s abuses, because within a few pages she is back to bashing mainstream conservative organizations such as the Federalist Society, Heritage Action, Americans for Tax Reform and the Cato Institute as “Far Right”. Anyone to the right of Marx, Lenin and Mao is apparently “Far Right” to Zuboff.Chapter 5 elaborates Googles expanding abuses from 2009-2016. The Europeans attempt some pushback, but the US is feckless or oblivious. Just who controlled the government that was supposed to be preventing such abuses during this time? Zuboff couldn’t possibly guess, even if you spotted her an O, B and M. During this period, Zuboff’s Harvard Business School colleagues ride to the defense of Yelp, perhaps the only tech company more loathsome than Google.Strangely, Zuboff admits there were a number of potentially effective policy fixes being seriously considered in the years before 9/11. Why not revive those ideas and build a political coalition of like-minded classical-liberals, libertarians, small-government conservatives and Trump supporters (the tech giants being no friends of Trump) to implement them? She points out that the national security agencies are obstacles. Well, after Brennan, Comey, Holder and Lynch, a lot of people on the right need no further persuasion that the FBI, CIA and the rest of the Deep State are utterly corrupt rogue agencies. Zuboff doesn’t appear to consider this a possibility. I guess working with those icky right wingers is completely out of the question. Even worse, such allies are never going to go along with replacing the tech elite with the “benevolent” socialist dictatorship of Zuboff and her Harvard faculty elite. As it turns out, Zuboff’s problem is not so much with the creepy technology, it is that the creepy technology is not under the control of “enlightened” leftists like her and her comrades in academia and government.That was as much as I could take. I skimmed the book for any sign of practical solutions in the pages to come and, finding none, I abandoned the book on page 158.I agree with Zuboff that the tech giants represent a grave threat. However, if her prescription of more government and more socialism is the only alternative, I guess I will just have to find ways to live with it. The only thing worse than surveillance capitalism is surveillance statism run by socialist do-gooder “elites” like Zuboff, who always think they know better and want to engage in social engineering. Do you think the Chinese people would prefer annoying Google ads or their oppressive and ubiquitous social credit scores? The only people I would less like to see in control of this technology than Page, Brin and Zuckerberg are Zuboff and her comrades.In the nearer term, there are still practical steps one can take to mitigate the problem. Don’t use Google products. Use DuckDuckGo for search. Don’t use Gmail or Chrome. Use a good ad blocker, like AdBlockPlus on all devices. Don’t buy creepy surveillance technology like Nest, Ring or Alexa. Delete your Facebook account. Don’t use Twitter, it’s a surveillance sewer. Don’t buy from Amazon or use their products or services, especially the Washington Post. Don’t buy from Apple or use their products or services. Use Linux if that is viable for you or lock down you Windows privacy settings, if not. Check your app setting and cut them back to only those necessary to function. Don’t use non-essential apps like games, many of which are bad offenders.Support the breakup of the tech giants using antitrust laws. Support their prosecution for anti-competitive and anti-privacy violations. Having Page, Brin, Zuckerberg and Bezos doing some serious hard time would have a very salutary effect “pour encourager les autres”. Institute real and legally-binding privacy protections such as Zuboff mentions and dismisses. Yes, we will have to do it without the support of Zuboff and her comrades, but Trump’s upcoming second term could be a real opportunity to get this done (I think Zuboff’s head may have just exploded)."
238,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65435043-alan-tennyson,5,"I pored over this book, stayed with the words. Read and reread them. Drank deeply from their wisdom.  It was not an easy read, but ultimately it gave far more than it took. The Age of Surveillance Capitalism is a seminal text for our age. Zuboff's account of surveillance capitalism is elegant, poised and persuasive. Yet for all her brilliance, Shonanna's central thesis suffers some fundamental flaws.  Where The Age is at it's strongest is in the articulation of surveillance capitalism. Consider this, 'Who owns your face?', 'Who owns your behaviour?' What you do, where you go, who you know, all this has value and extracting value from these data is the business model of the surveillance capitalist.  But this is only the description, where Zuboff's account takes a darker turn, is in control. Once Surveillance Capitalists have provided a description of you, the next logical step is to determine how much this description can be used to predict and control you. Zuboff's account of these processes is beautifully rendered in perfect proses.  Know thyself, unless you don't like what you find, then, deny thyself, and pretend you are other. Zuboff goes for the latter.  We are born of this place, this pale blue dot, we are natural phenomena. Yet despite these self-evident truths, many continue to advance the notion that we apes are exceptional.  We are somehow other than the mere organisms with whom we share our earth and almost our entire genetic structure. Zuboff takes issue with humans being described as 'mere organisms'.  She is caged by this ideology of human exceptionalism, and it weakens her thesis considerably.  There are sacred cows here, and sacred cows will invariably be slaughtered.  The first heifer into the meat factory is autonomy. Shoshana strips us of our relations, our context and connections. She exalts 'autonomy' but fails to grapple with the weakness of the presumptions it contains. This leads her to assert that humans are and ought to be autonomous.  But Zuboff fails to address that we are born free, but everywhere in chains. From the traffic light to the electric chair, we are already in a context that seeks to control our behaviour. What does she think education and justice are? If not systems of changing our behaviour? But it's more than this, it's a scientific reality, we are our contexts, our environment, they shape us as we shape them.  This is a reality that an insistence on 'Freedom' cannot wish away.   For me, the issue is not that we are organisms', we are.  It is not that we are miraculous rational deities, we are not.  We need to embrace our human frailty, stare it down since we are wiser for this knowledge.  Here again, Zuboff takes issues with what she calls the 'ideology of human frailty'.  Respectfully I would ask that we,  put down our pride and look hard in the mirror, human frailty is not an ideology, it is a fundamental truth. We are 'mere organisms' and to claim anything else is to cling to a pernicious ideology. An ideology that has prompted human dominion over earth and animals, and all the ecological genocide that follows."
239,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13717595-jake,5,"While I give this 5 stars, I in no manner think that this book was by any means perfect. In fact, in a time like this I wish there was a more complex rating system than 5 stars. I digress.This was, in many ways, the first of its kind. There have, in my view, yet to be too many intelligent take downs of the dangers of big data. There is,of course, a brief mentioning of the a similar subject in many other modern texts - but not to this degree.So, you ask, what the hell is surveillance capitalism. It is, a term coined by the author. She first presented the concept publicly in 2014, in an article, where she described it as such :""[surveillance capitalism is a] radically dissembled and extractive variant of information capitalism"" based on the commodification of ""reality"" and its transformation into behavioral data for analysis and sales""*---- IN this book she presents the story of how it is that we have gotten to such a point in history, where the sentence in her 2014 article could even be spoken. In this she gives a small run down of facebook and google, and explains the origins of these sights in relation to their users. User-ship on these web pages began without much craziness, but as we all know many pages which were once small e.g. facebook, google, and youtube have more or less all become huge power houses of influence. They have now followings in the billions. This is presently praised by these web pages as a good thing. Initially. well. The servers couldn't take it. There was too much damn data. And its all so useless.Or is it?It was, with this question, in the eyes of zuboff, that this form of capitalism** was born. The data not only need not be an annoyance, but it could be a pathway towards making money. 'Perhaps', these tech giants thought 'we could predict the users behaviors by paying attention to the patterns in data'. Alas. we are truly all creatures of habit. Long story short. A great deal of people in the industrial world are using certain pages on the internet in ways that are useful for targeting for sales. This of course can eventually be sold to governments blah blah blah. Ask yourself. are you ok with people predicting your behaviors to increase user experience? What about to protect you? What about to just watch you?These are questions the book will make you reflect on.Overall, I think this was one of the most apropos books I have read in awhile towards understanding some issues in modernity.86/100 stars.Recommended for:Those thinking about big data in its prediction of human behaviorthose who dont trust facebook and googlethose worried about internet privacythose thinking about the future path of society*Hey guess what. IM gonna source wikipedia :https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveil...**Call me a peasant or an uneducated bafoon. I think the word capitalism is hardly ever used where it should be. Perhaps im wrong."

Market and industrial capitalism are declining, long live surveillance capitalism say the social media giants, in whose tentacles it is we, rather than any thing useful for us as humans, who are grasped .It’s a bit long and at times repetitive, like Das Kapital, but it’s not really a criticism of the book, as the amount of research and work Zuboff must have done to produce this dizzying analysis of the current state of digital technology and its impact on us, is breathtaking. It’s the resistance to surveillance capitalism’s imperatives that she leaves as the challenge for society at the end of the book... How is that done when we hunger so much for its crumbs and are so addicted to the precision targeting of its algorithms?"
248,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86841474-aaron-lewis,1,"Here, a capitalist argues that Facebook and Google's approach to capitalism is a ""rogue"" capitalism, and represents an unprecedented threat to liberalism. The argument is blind to how Big Tech's surveillance is merely the most recent and sophisticated manifestation of capitalism's inherent drive to extract value; advertising and media companies have for centuries made a business of surveillance and control. But acknowledging that continuity would deflate the book's sensationalism, and undermine its premise that, before Big Tech, the only threat to liberalism was state power, and not also that of capital."
249,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89255731-mark-walker,5,"This book will boil your blood. Supported by extensive empirical research, Professor Shoshana Zuboff exposes the effective digital implementation of the late B. F. Skinner's Beyond Freedom and Dignity. It centers around three related factors: The distribution of knowledge: “Who knows?” Authority: “Who decides who knows?” and Power: “Who decides who decides who knows?” (Hint: it's not you). Orders of magnitude beyond just tracking cookies and the creepy anticipation of your interests by entities such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook, the new instrumentarianism is used by surveillance capitalists to control not just what you buy but also what you think about and how you think it. This is not even the theoretical Capitalism of Friedman, Hayek, or Adam Smith, as there is no equality of individual choice in it. In other words there's no free market here, as surveillance capitalists deliberately orchestrate your life for their benefit irrespective of yours. Thus it's not a fair trade; there is no reciprocity in the conveniences you think you receive from even the simplest transactions. You are not their customers (or even the ""product"" as in the cliché); their customers are the people purchasing the information harvested about you, which is extracted without your awareness. In this digital realm, it is as if you are the third world country having your natural resources extracted for the exclusive profits of foreign capitalists. Another clear analogy is we are like chickens being farmed for our eggs: they feed us with incentives, not for our well-being but so that we will lay more eggs to go into omelets not for us. You and your personal information are only the objects, the ""Other,"" that are for sale for the benefit of people who are not you. The key feature of all of this is that willingness is irrelevant, as we are unknowing and thus unwitting participants. Their salient objective is the obscene profits garnered from not just your profiles and posts, but the shadow text that you don't see from the fusion of the backscatter data about you that is harvested into separate secret databases. They actively hide that they have this information on you, as their modus operandi requires that you not be aware of it for this process to be successful. Much of this activity is beyond the reach of laws and courts, as the surveillance capitalists would just go underground with their operations if regulations were imposed. It is accompanied by an acceleration of the deliberate assault on democracy through lobbying and revolving door employment between government and the commercial interests that control it. Thus just voting for politicians that promise to tame surveillance capitalism will be of insufficient effect. Zuboff offers hope and some thoughts on what to do about it. European history has shown that when the people have had enough of oppression, they join together to rebel, as when the Berlin Wall came down without resistance from the guards. A similar event must occur today to escape the glass walls of the hive surveillance capitalists have put us in for the purpose of harvesting and orchestrating even our most personal thoughts, all for their profit and not ours. We need walls of our own, not to keep us in their hive, but to keep them out of our personal sanctuary. Public opinion is key to taming this monster. In the end if enough of the public rose up against surveillance capitalism, possibly by throwing its shadow text in disarray and diminishing its value, the money and influence behind it would then be of little effect. There is hope if humans would willingly help each other to the extent that surveillance capitalists take without asking. Then the world would be a much friendlier and more prosperous place for everyone. and not just the few."
250,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6192529-frieda-vizel,3,"The writing was a big problem for me. Sometimes, instead of relying on strong arguments, it relied on absurdly hyperbolic language. For instance, I didn’t feel like she explained clearly enough why monetizing our data is bad - say, because how it’s been destroying “the forth estate” that needs to constantly run after the clicks, or how our data is used to manipulate us to consume-consume-consume, to the detriment of the planet. Instead she went on for a while about our right to the “will to will” and a lot about how bad BF Skinner was. Maybe if I understood behaviorism better I’d have felt it as strongly as she seemed to, but I just didn’t feel like I totally got that whole part. Maybe that’s me.Speaking of Skinner, she seems to be of the school of public intellectualism that is very focused on individual actors instead of on the system. So she goes on a lot about the bad guys of our predicament, Skinner but also of course Zuck, the Google founders, the guy at Microsoft who didn’t seem to be extraordinarily villainous at all. Here’s where this type of focus in the individual derails us: it leads Zuboff to think that these people created the problems, and not the system. But actually, so long as the law allows for folks to make money by manipulating the masses, there will always be a sociopath to sink his teeth in. That’s why the problem is the system and that needs to be fixed. And Zuboff does argue for that - it’s just that she weakens her argument by being so focused on these insatiable idiot vampires. But all that is quibbling and frustration. The important take-away from the book is that it stakes the solution within the law. It does not fall for the “freedom of speech” idiocy, an argument mounted by economic interest as a way to stop the entire legal system from functioning as it should. Since when can’t we have laws? Since when is it tyranny for the government to create limits and parameters as a way of ensuring a healthy society? Since the tech companies have been telling us that we only deserve positive freedoms. Freedom to advertise, sure. Freedom from being manipulated by ads- it’s an Orwellian Communist murderous regime and soon we will be like North Korea!Zuboff talks about the slow speed of democracy. That’s what left me so despaired. Democracy is not getting faster, but the technological invasions are. And I don’t see how we’ll ever be able to catch up with them. Meanwhile, a screech on a decibel undetectable to the human ear is now screaming into your subconscious and telling you to buy another Alexa and a smart underwear plus to to vote for Kim Jung Il. True story."
251,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8040056-clancy,5,"[The] bare facts of surveillance capitalism necessarily arouse my indignation because they demean human dignity. The future of this narrative will depend upon the indignant citizens, journalists, and scholars drawn to this frontier project; indignant elected officials and policy makers who understand that their authority originates in the foundational values of democratic communities; and, especially, indignant young people who act in the knowledge that effectiveness without autonomy is not effective, dependency-induced compliance is no social contract, a hive with no exit can never be home, experience without sanctuary is but a shadow, a life that requires hiding is no life, touch without feel reveals no truth, and freedom from uncertainty is no freedom.This book is an incendiary work of immense scholarly and literary significance.With admiral restraint, Zuboff painstakingly dismantles, analyses, and lays bear the machinations of one of the greatest challenges that faces humanity in this century. We have be come not the product, as is so often said, but the raw material of an entirely novel industry. This industry's speed of ascent and adaptation and especially of innovation has left individuals and governments alike, completely unable to meaningfully understand, let alone reign-in, the advance of this all-pervading entity that increases its penetration into our lives and our communities with every passing minute.This book articulates the uncomfortable gut-feeling, the uneasy sense of cognitive dissonance, that I've felt about the level of access companies generally, but especially Alphabet and Facebook, have to my life and every piece of information living that life generates. I understand now why my no-choice participation in this new economy has generated these feelings, in all their expanded and terrifying entirety.While at times bombastic, and others poetic, and others still cool and clinical; the amount of research, time, and passion for humanity itself that went into the construction of this work has paid off. This work is a significant achievement, and an important moment that we can look back on to see whether we as a species can rise to overcome this new challenge, or whether this will be little but foreshadowing of the future we allow to follow.If you're alive right now, you owe it to yourself to read this."
252,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5225660-jouni-koskinen,2,"The issues this book is about are important and complicated and hard. The use and abuse of data and user trust is worth talking about, it's even worth shouting about.But not like this.Zuboff is alarmist, melodramatic, hyperbolic and tiring. Everything the tech companies do is not just wrong, it's a diabolic scheme to undermine the world as we know it. When something is wrong, it's never an unintended consequence, it's never human error, it's never just a silly gimmick not thought out far enough. It's always, always presented as a evil contrived mastermind plot to wreck your privacy and abuse you. And it's always presented like it's the rise of fascism in the 1930's with the most gut-wrenching tear-jerking vocabulary she could find. Get a few examples, simplify a theory somehow related to the issue, contrive a concept, give it a name like ""shadow text"" or ""behavioral surplus"" (preferably a bit ominous name), cherry pick more examples, portend doom. Rinse and repeat. And mention ""surveillance capitalism"" at least 15 times per page.It's kind of ironic that when she goes on for 700+ pages on how you should never trust these companies, that she takes their Silicon Valley hypetalk at face value. If a company claims they can do something, Zuboff gleefully integrates the claim into her narrative with zero criticism. Because it serves her point. But if a company apologises for something, it's of course disingenuous with them being the devil who wants to eat your children.By the time the book gets to behaviour manipulation, it turns from melodramatic to laughable. The obsession Zuboff has for B.F.Skinner and radical behaviorism (a 70-year-old psychology concept, the cognitive revolution would like to have a word...) is full on religious. The man wasn't wrong about anything and conditioning works on people with a hundred per cent efficiency!This is an important issue, but creating hyperbolic devils like this is not just bad writing and argumentation but counter-productive to the cause. It's just creates a shoddy boogeyman argument that is easy to shoot down.The very serious and dramatic reader Audible had for this didn't help btw. (she was very clear speaker though). "
253,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,3,"This is a really important topic and I wish I could give the book more than 3 stars. Everyone knows that the technology we are living with is unprecedented and changing the world. If we aren't careful, we will cause more harm than good. This book is about the dangers of this new information age. But there are a lot of problems with how the information is presented. First, the author uses over-the-top insulting language to describe these companies and leaders--all book long. It's so obviously biased that it undermines her points again and again, prompting lots of eyerolling--about once a page. That's minor, though. More serious is that this book is way too long. It wasn't satisfied making the point, it had to list 10 examples for every point--the full quotes, too. It read more like a college term paper that needed show every piece of research the author did. It's a very long book and it didn't need to be. Finally, the author falls prey to the worst sin in this kind of cultural criticism: she treats her worldview and personality type as the perfect ideal. There was no honest acknowledgement that her era had any flaws, only lament that the world doesn't live more like she used to, that generations will not experience what she did as a child. I very much believe that there are real dangers with only a few companies controlling the information access to the world. I've personally experienced challenges with this (Amazon just recently removed me as a listed seller of my own books, saying I need to sign up for the next level of account--at more cost--before I have the chance to be displayed as the owner of the product again). But it's a mixed bag and the author can't see past her indignation to the true complexity of the situation.So, read this for an imbalanced, overly wordy way of getting one side of the story. If it's not this book, make sure you get both sides of the story, not just the story told by Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, etc."
254,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66635467-keen,3,"3.5 Stars!“Only a few decades ago US society denounced mass behaviour-modification techniques as unacceptable threats to individual autonomy and the democratic order. Today the same practices meet little resistance or even discussion as they are routinely and pervasively deployed on the march towards surveillance revenues.”Welcome to a new and daunting landscape awash with sinister terminology like “permissionless innovation”, “digital totalitarianism”, “reality mining” and “behavioural surplus”. This is the new apparatus that dictates how we move through much of our lives, and just like most architecture out there, after a while, you almost become oblivious to the secret workings and dimensions which are influencing your behaviour and actions. And this is how the boys and girls down in Silicon Valley like it best.“The image of technology as autonomous force with unavoidable actions and consequences has been employed across the centuries to erase the fingerprints of power and absolve it of responsibility. The monster did it, not Victor Frankenstein.”Zuboff touches on many aspects surrounding surveillance capitalism, and we see the intimate relationship between the NSA and CIA and the mutual benefits to that relationship. “The agencies craved the lawlessness that a firm such as Google enjoyed.” We learn the huge significance of Section 230 and how far behind the US is behind the EU in terms of clamping down, one example being the EU law in May 2014 enforcing the right to be forgotten. She cites many sources, but without doubt the two most prominent reference points are the work of B.F. Skinner and Hannah Arendt and in particular her “The Origins of Totalitarianism”. “Google is to surveillance capitalism what the Ford Motor Company and General Motors were to mass-production-based managerial capitalism.”At one point the author sets out the four main areas of fortifications that have allowed Google to be so over protected and free to flourish away from political interference for so long, particularly in the USA,1.	Google showing their capabilities of competitive advantage in electoral politics. 2.	The deliberate blurring of public and private interests through relationships and aggressive lobbying. 3.	A revolving door of personnel who migrated between Google and the Obama administration, who shared mutual interests during Google’s crucial growth years of 2009-2016. By April 2016, 197 individuals had migrated from government to the Googlesphere and 61 had moved in the other direction. 4.	Google’s campaign of influence over academic work and the larger cultural conversation, which was vital to policy formation, public opinion and political perception. “Ford’s inventions revolutionised production. Google’s inventions revolutionised extraction and established surveillance capitalism’s first economic imperative: the extraction imperative.”This book is awash with horror stories befitting of sci-fi paperbacks. Like the one concerning Genesis Toys, who brought out, My Friend Cayla, a terrifying concept in which the child’s doll which relies on voice recognition, also harvests all sorts of data from the customer’s house. It is such a blatant violation that in 2017 Germany, (a country which knows a thing or two about surveillance), banned it as an illegal surveillance device, urging parents to destroy any such dolls in their possession.Due to the nature of this book it does have its harder going moments, but it still remains engaging, and overall Zuboff has completed a chilling, sagacious and damning book on the sinister and sophisticated ploys increasingly used in surveillance capitalism. The text is relatively, devoid of any superfluous academic verbiage, which many of these kinds of books suffer from. These companies and the people tied up with them are the people who hate big, bad words like privacy, tax and transparency. You can employ all the lawyers, lobbyists and accountants and actuaries, but when you strip it all away, what it really is a small, group of dangerous people making the rules up as they go along who have been given a suspiciously free and easy reign over how policy works around the world.Facebook has already admitted to and was even boasting about its power to influence people’s behaviour in US elections, and this was years before the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke. The billionaire owner of that company, Robert Mercer, backed Donald Trump. As Facebook is a private company it did not have to adhere to the legal standards for experimentation required of academic and government researchers. It remains to be seen what Facebook and Google cannot get away with. Providing a vast platform for hate speech, fostering chronic bullying, screening live suicides, streaming acts of terrorism. Where will the line be drawn?...Like bold, bratty toddlers they constantly challenge their boundaries and throw tantrums when anyone dare speaks out, but they needn’t worry a succession of US governments has them well protected as long as that money keeps on coming.Every law, rule or regulation is only as strong as the loopholes allow it to be. If these loopholes are known and continue to exist then we must ask why that is?... Who has the power to close them and more importantly why have they chosen not to close them?...These companies have consistently and effectively been left to self-regulate with predictable consequences. The problems have been known about the Wild West mentality of the internet for many, many years now, but yet little meaningful change has occurred, especially in the US.“Facebook’s $4.6 million in donations during the 2016 election cycle complemented its lobbying budget of $11.5 million in 2017.” But this is nothing compared to Google, which repeatedly spends more on lobbying than any other corporation, shelling out more than $18 million in 2018. It is also the second wealthiest registered lobbyist in the EU. Why are Facebook and Google choosing to spend such astronomical amounts of money?...What must they be getting in return?...What do they want?...What do they get?...Why are we not being told?...Welcome to “American Democracy”. Be afraid, be very afraid…"
255,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50996552-jp-beaty,4,"A really important text for digging out the political import of the data economy. I think the writing is slightly clumsy and I think the book underestimates the connection between Silicon Valley firms and the intelligence services/ the state. I also find the substantive responses to the issue to be a little milquetoast in comparison to the problem she diagnoses (I suppose that’s how it ended up on Obama’s books of the year list). Those problems aside at its best it is a searing look at the logic and function of the data economy. For understanding the ways that big data firms are altering society and how to think about the use and abuse of technology, this is a great book. It’s really at its best at the most conspiratorial and will leave you suspicious of what exactly your phone is doing and what Facebook ultimately wants. I’m sure posting this review will trigger a whole cascade of advertising material to make sure the big social media giants don’t loose my constant stream of crumbs I feed them. Don’t worry amazon algorithm reading this, I am much too trapped in the Skinner box to act on the suspicions raised by this book."
256,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33041497-anna,4,"“Surveillance capitalism’s antidemocratic and antiegalitarian juggernaut is best described as a market-driven coup from above. It is not a coup d’etat in the classic sense but rather a coup de gens: an overthrow of the people concealed as the technological Trojan horse that is Big Other”.This book is a huge, impressive piece of work. It feels like a relief to (at least) get some sort of overview over the way in which surveillance capitalism dominates our lives and orders society, despite the lack of suggestions for solutions. Understanding is the first step towards any form of meaningful resistance, and this feels like a solid first step :-)I do wish it were more accessible (as I do with most political theory) as its message feels like something that needs to be heard by more people than those who are willing to read 500 pages worth of academic language.Also - Zuboff’s idealization of the Henry Ford-era of capitalism rubs me the wrong way."
257,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24266382-ashley,3,"It’s been called “visionary,” but I don’t know that there’s anything entirely new here. What this felt like, to me, was a call to attention. The reader is not surprised by anything Shoshana Zuboff outlines, but is rather forced to acknowledge the problem in its entirety, all at once, in a 500-page package. That does make it feel revolutionary; Zuboff has written what very few people are willing to discuss in mainstream media, but which everyone has an inkling of, one way or another. I did find that it was a little too long-winded. It could have been significantly compressed, especially when a lot of the material was repetitive in order to emphasize certain themes and vocabulary.... and her preoccupation with B.F. Skinner was unnecessary. Zuboff was never so brilliant than when she illustrated, specifically, how Facebook and Google and Samsung (among others) are driving our behavior for their own profit, frequently at the expense of the law. I think that this strength was often drowned in vocabulary lessons and meandering observations, coming across as a little self-indulgent somewhere around the 200-page mark. It was unnecessary to spend so much time explaining Zuboff’s coined terms, such as “the uncontract”, “unprecedented”, “radical indifference”, “behavioural surplus”, and even “surveillance capitalism” itself. Especially in Part III, Zuboff’s self-indulgence became a running tangent, entire sections devoted to philosophy (and biology) lessons on the concept of “free will” and “utopia.”  In spite of that, it has definitely changed the way I think. It has also further fueled my nostalgia for a simpler time, and my distrust of social media and big corporations. The fact that it’s near-impossible to escape the clutches of these corporations is what really keeps me up at night; it’s not so much a privacy issue (I couldn’t care less if Mark Zuckerberg gets access to my old Instagram photos of cappuccinos) but rather a question of ethics. If I don’t want to give my data to third-parties, why are they able to access it anyway? If I don’t want to contribute to the rise of Facebook or Google, why are they still able to profit off of me anyway? Consent doesn’t really enter the conversation when it comes to what these rich tech companies have in mind, and evasive, incomplete privacy policies are nothing but “placebo effects” to pacify users.  Yes, I’m aware of the irony of publishing this review to Amazon-owned Goodreads.  ""Surveillance Capitalism"" is the kind of book that makes you want to throw your laptop into Lake Ontario and live in a cabin in the woods. I don’t know that I have the gumption for that kind of drastic change, but I’ll definitely think twice whenever I consider downloading an app or signing up for e-newsletters; I will certainly avoid buying any new smart devices by whatever means necessary. I do think it’s time for us to start protesting the free-reign that these conglomerates have been given, especially in North America. Our own behavior is being observed and herded by the rich 1% for financial gain; everything from our spending habits to our complacency is being mediated and controlled. I think, eventually, we have to reclaim our sense of autonomy and identity, and our understanding of reality.  Also, I just want to state for the record that I’ve always found it odd how North America experienced a period of mass rebellion, political protesting, and unrest during the 1960’s and 1970’s – and that this unrest suddenly came to a complete stop, save for a few exceptions here and there. Well, Zuboff has justified my unease, dedicating a sub-chapter to the behavior-control research conducted by the US Senate in the 70’s – research which became urgent as political protests escalated. And yes, surveillance capitalism has everything to do with it.  At the end of this heavy volume, Zuboff was really only trying to say one thing, re-stated from multiple angles: we are being rigorously and continuously exploited by capitalists. We don’t own our behavior anymore. Data collection and behavior control for the purpose of financial profit has crossed all ethical boundaries, and we as a society are content to let it happen.  This book is definitely recommended, if you have the patience and endurance to get through it. I almost didn’t. In a similar vein, I also recommend watching ‘Smithereens’, one of the recent Black Mirror episodes. Despite its melodrama, I think it has a lot of important things to say on society’s need to be “plugged in” and how this addiction is driving our lives. Some of Zuboff’s quotes that will stick with me: -“Its products are about predicting us, without actually caring what we do or what is done to us.” -“As populations grow numb, it becomes more difficult for individuals and groups to complain.” -“[Cortana] wants to know everything about you, but it does not want you to know how much it knows [...]” -“ ‘The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.’ ” [-Mark Weiser] -“Contemporary reviewers of Kahn’s book invariably seized upon the dark ‘nightmare scenarios’ of the computerized surveillance theme, the science-fiction–like forms of control that, they assumed, ‘will be actively feared and resented by many.’ Despite the wide range of scenarios that Kahn presented in his book on the distant year 2000, Kahn’s voyage into the ‘unthinkable’ was viewed by the public as a way to prepare for ‘the worst possible outcome’ in a terrifying ‘nightmare of social controls.’ Yet now, that same nightmare is rendered as an enthusiastic progress report on surveillance capitalism’s latest triumphs.” -“[…] Google wants us to accept that its rules simply reflect the requirements of autonomous processes, something that people cannot control. However, our grasp of the inner logic of surveillance capitalism suggests otherwise. Men and women made it, and they can control it. They merely choose not to do so.” -“Many people feel that if you are not on Facebook, you do not exist. People all over the world raced to participate in Pokémon Go. With so much energy, success, and capital flowing into the surveillance capitalist domain, standing outside of it, let alone against it, can feel like a lonely and risky prospect.”"

259,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85785571-laurence-lai,1,"The title “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism” evokes a weighty subject, and the book’s subtitle purports to something menacing to the future of humankind. It is to be seen if its contents are as substantial as the book’s 700-page length would suggest.The author, Shoshana Zuboff, is a professor emerita at Harvard Business School, not unimpressive an honor by any measure. A summary of assertions made in the book is as follows:1.	Big technological colossuses (Big Techs), epitomized by Google and Facebook, operate their business models by extracting data trails of online users, and in turn selling the extrapolated results (what Zuboff calls behavioral surplus) to their advertising customers.2.	Sophisticated algorithms are deployed and constantly refined to increase the predictive value of profiling data. At the same time, online users are passively served with moderated searches, federated news feeds, suggested connections, etc., all under the coercive power of the Big Techs. Such duress is as severe as not only to affect, shape, and compel, but with the aim to modify and manipulate user behaviors.3.	With the proliferation of sensors and Internet connectivity, Big Techs extend their reach far beyond the virtual realm to the real world. Regarding the surveillance operated by these techno-capitalists, in the author’s telling, its presence so pervasive and its impact so complete that any human free agency has receded entirely to the background and is ineffective.4.	While the above are not new to anyone who has casual understanding of current economics and culture, what Zuboff strives to accentuate is their connection to high-order issues such as self, liberty, democratic values, and human nature. She compares the dangers posed by “surveillance capitalism” to that of fascism, totalitarianism, behaviorist utopianism, and the like, that once presented real or potential detriments to humanity. For its thrilling effects, the agenda for the book is sweeping, even ambitious. Technological advancement, especially one that combines deep analytics, machine intelligence, and makes its ubiquitous presence in our intimate lives deserves a dispassionate evaluation as to its social impacts. Zuboff should be applauded for selecting this timely topic for her book.Yet one cannot help but feel frustrated by the lack of thematic organization of the whole book. Instead of explicating the economics involved in this different “capitalism”, Zuboff is more concerned with weaving her own narrative of abstruse euphemisms about how grave a danger the human future is facing. Materials are regurgitated, often word for word from the earlier part of the book and throughout. As to what actions Zuboff suggests to “fight for a human future…”? The author offers an ill-defined “synthetic declaration” (p. 345), and a skimpy, equally obscure advice of “friction, courage, and bearings” (p. 524). Specifics are sorely lacking in allusions to democratic institutions, public opinion, legislative and judicial recourse (p. 520). A whimper of a solution indeed to a loud bang of such a doorstopper.Zuboff obviously sets out to intend the book as a treatise that plumbs the depth of these to her as “unprecedented” developments in “surveillance capitalism”, and attempts to compare philosophically with past phenomena its manifold menaces to humanity. But it is exactly in such philosophizing that is the weakest of the book, for her arguments are at best tenuous and strained. On the other hand, the author wily limits her subject to mostly the socio-economic domain of the Western world, as is indicated in the book’s title. The picture would have been more complete if it had combined with surveillance authoritarianism. The “social credit” system practised unimpeded in China makes only passing reference in mere 6 pages (pgs. 388-394). Certainly, the threat to human liberty and dignity is far graver when the surveillance apparatus and capability are controlled by a police state, whereas in Western democracies competition among capitalists still exists. What is most infuriating is Zuboff’s penchant for fabricating catchphrases. Smug expressions such as “dispossession”, “behavioral futures”, “cultural misappropriation”, “economy of action”, “division of learning”, “shadow text”, “uncontract”, “hive”, “coup from above”, “Big Other”, “instrumentarian power”, “right to the future tense”, “third modernity*” …., litter throughout the book. The meanings of many of these are poorly articulated. Although she attempts to provide a brief rationale to her epithetic acrobatic (p. 66), such twisting of language is unnecessary and far from successful. It is an act of throwing spaghetti upon the wall; hoping that somehow one such phrase may stick with posterity with reference made to the author. As stated, the impression appears that the writer is more interested in weaving an esoteric narrative than presenting facts. Read a typical sentence on p. 488 of the book:“No exit” is the necessary condition for Big Other to flourish, and its flourishing is the necessary condition for all that is meant to follow: the tides of behavioral surplus and their transformation into revenue, the certainty that will meet every market player with guaranteed outcomes, the bypass of trust in favor of the uncontract’s radical indifference, the paradise of effortless connection that exploits the needs of harried second-modernity individuals and transforms their lives into the means to others’ ends, the plundering of the self, the extinction of autonomous moral judgment for the sake of frictionless control, the actuation and modification that quietly drains the will to will, the forfeit of your voice in the first person in favor of others’ plans, the destruction of the social relations and politics of the old and slow and still-unfulfilled ideals of self-determining citizens bound to the legitimate authority of democratic governance.” Long sentences can be beautiful in abler literary hands, but the above is downright egregious in form and meaning. Zuboff’s writing style can be aptly depicted as beating around the bush, with hyperboles and a plethora of inapt metaphors that ill befits so serious a subject she wants to convey. At times, she relishes so much staying with her metaphoric vehicles that the intended tenors are nowhere to be found. Long, winding sentences with chained substantives also further hamper readability.So, are readers more empowered at the end “with a more cogent and comprehensive understanding” (p. 18) of the menacing incursion exerted by the Big Techs? For the newly initiated, the writing style has done more to obfuscate than to illuminate. For the more inclined and those who look for some concrete societal antidotes, Zuboff has woefully under-delivered. More clear-eyed analyses are still awaited on the technologies proffered by the Big Techs, on the associated data-driven economy, and their consequent impacts to individuals and society at-large. * cf.

263,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4679583-myles,3,"This week my company officially got into the business of surveillance. People will pay us to surveil their home and business computers to protect them from rogue computer software, from losing data resulting from defective or aging components in their computers, and from misguided management of their computers themselves.Going forward this will be a growing and lucrative business segment because people rely on their computers to do so many important things for them, because they feel inadequate keeping up with changes in the computing environment, and because they justifiably fear cyber crime.It doesn’t mean they like it. I sure don’t.Being in retail business as I have for almost 25 years I have learned how to surveil myself, to protect my assets, and my employees. It is an ongoing challenge and it changes. I surveil for shoplifters, for currency and credit card counterfeiters, for daylight and after hours thieves. I surveil for dishonest employees, for honest mistakes, for poor buying decisions, and for the obsolescence of the products on my shelves. I surveil how the bank handles my money. I surveil my suppliers to prevent them from shipping me incomplete or broken goods. And I pay attention to my customers, to save them from making poor purchasing decisions.And when I am not surveilling, I am surveying. All the time. How were my customers’ experiences? What new products are on the horizon? How can I protect my liquidity, my profitability, and lastly, my sanity.I especially surveil myself, because I make mistakes, and because I too am growing old.These are some of the risks of operating a business.Then there are the people who surveil me. They include thieves looking for a weakness in my security. Government agencies to make sure I am paying the eight or ten different taxes I pay on an ongoing basis. Credit card companies surveil my transactions to make sure somebody hasn’t stolen my credit card, or that I am spending no more money than I can afford to pay back. My suppliers make sure I am paying them on time. Some manufacturers visit me in person or electronically to make sure I am representing their product lines fairly. They send me electronic training, and tests, and they regularly measure the efficiency and quality of our repair facilities. The utilities tell me when my operations (and home) are inefficient. And there are my landlords.Finally, we surveil at home. We surveil our daughter to make sure she is doing her homework and not falling in with the wrong crowd. My wife surveils me to make sure I’m not overeating, overspending, or being overly attentive to other women. I surveil my dog Seamus just in case he poops on the neighbour’s lawn so I can pick it up before someone notices. And Seamus surveils the front window and barks whenever a neighbouring dog saunters by. Last and not least are the gargantuan corporations who are watching what I do online. People like facebook, Google, amazon, and many, many more.So when somebody writes a book to tell me I live in an Age of Surveillance Capitalism...I GET IT! REALLY, I GET IT!But is it uniquely capitalist, or more generally an age of surveillance?And if it is more general to our society, where do we go from here?One thing for sure: it isn’t going away anytime soon.Shoshana Zuboff concentrates her guns on Google and facebook. She’s concerned that these companies are inherently different from the companies that came before it and they set a new standard for egregious capitalism. They are companies in the prediction business, predicting human behaviour and right now largely predicting purchasing behaviour by accumulating, as she called it, “surplus behaviour,” which kinda sounds like an oxymoron. She believes they abuse the freedoms of the marketplace to frustrate privacy, that they are built to enrich few and sidestep the traditional workplace which pays many employees fairly and creates consumers, and she argues that they are indifferent to social ills.She argues that Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” doesn’t operate in this marketplace because the new knowledge capitalists know everything happening in the market.A close reading of Andrew Carnegie’s life and legacy, perhaps John D. Rockefeller as well, could lead you to a similar conclusion, even though both men turned to philanthropy later in life. For sure, these men affected the course of capitalism.Is this a turn away from “good” capitalism toward an inherently evil capitalism?And if it is evil, can we create some rules for the big guys that us little guys can live with?Let’s take a step back and look at things in context: Google’s revenue is about $25 billion, Facebook’s $17 billion. The entire US economy is about $25 trillion and the world economy upwards of $107 trillion. Most of Google’s and Facebook’s revenue is advertising. The US advertising market is upwards of $80 billion so it is fair to say these two firms command quite strong positions in this industry. If you make the argument that America’s advertising industry is too concentrated then you’d have a pretty good argument to break up these firms which combined represent about 50% of all advertising dollars in the US. By comparison, Standard Oil at its peak commanded 88% of the market for processing crude. In its first year of operation, US Steel produced 67% of steel produced the the US.And they exhibit the classic behaviour of monopolists by dominating the markets for search and for social media on a global scale.In the US a case for breaking up the firms traditionally would have to be made that consumers are paying too much for their services or that competitors are being kept out of the market. Maybe breaking up these firms is a good idea, maybe it isn’t, but either way the technologies they employ for gathering, and analyzing, data isn’t going away.When I worked as an auditor, we used to gather lots of data, too, but what we eventually learned was that we could make assumptions about its meaning by sampling the information; that is, we cut down our work by only looking at some of the data. We tried to cut down on the wasted time. I sometimes wonder how much of what Google does is a total waste of time because the answers it seeks can be found in much faster time using much less data. And how much of “Big Data” is in fact a “Big Waste of Time.”Zuboff doesn’t consider that these firms may still be just in the early stages of figuring out what they are supposed to be doing. I think about it because so much time and resources are wasted paying attention to wholly irrelevant stuff.But we would do well to consider the affect of these companies on our freedoms and our government partially because they aren’t just national problems. They are transnational problems. What happens in China, and the extreme kind of surveillance practiced there on ethnic minorities like the Uigers, affects or will affect us here.They are transnational because the data collection is transnational and the very same data collected for the purpose of selling advertising is probably being used to develop artificial intelligence. The fastest developer of AI whether they be Chinese companies, transnational companies like Google or Facebook, or companies directly financed by government will have a big say in who has a job in the coming years and who doesn’t.No country on its own can hope to curb data collection and aggregation or perhaps more importantly, the control of what search results reveal on this scale any more than a country can curb money laundering, tax avoidance, or climate change without coordination between many if not all nations. Contemporary politics seems to be going in the opposite direction if Trump’s “America First,” Brexit, and Russian adventurism are any indication. If we are divided and our attention fractured we are susceptible to the influence or real or imagined “experts.” (To firms like Facebook I think we all have ADD, attention deficit disorder...they can never get enough of our attention!) That doesn’t mean we cannot continue to make decisions affecting our government, it more likely means that the decisions we make will more commonly resemble the imperatives of those desiring more of the same, read: the status quo.And that turns us to the question of how good is the status quo. If you believe that the universe ultimately bends toward the dilution of energy, total entropy, then the status quo is not too good. If you believe the status quo to be a teleological evolution toward a great singularity, perhaps a union with God, and a progression toward greater complexity in the universe, the status quo looks pretty good.Business executives, in my experience, tend to be of the more optimistic latter type of people. Like the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world and other people who have become incredibly wealthy in a short period of time.In the meantime, some of us have rather pedestrian concerns like the security of really private information. While convincingly arguing that there is insufficient transparency over who handles the big data and how they handle it, I think Zuboff fails to sufficiently weigh immense risk that the data will fall out of control of the aggregators and into the hands of rogue individuals.The hacking of credit card databases is one thing, and I think it a bigger risk than the hacking of a database which tells people how I like my hotdogs dressed. People made a big deal of the Cambridge Analytica scare. In the end, those people sold bogus claims to naive political organizations. The data predicted nothing and was of no use to anybody. And it didn’t get Donald Trump elected.Certainly big data aggregation has concrete effects on the economy. You get “free” Google searches. I get a cheaper smart TV because the data guys get first dibs on my TV watching preferences.This book is not the best guide for the good works these technologies enable (ie crowd sourcing, scientific research, epidemiology, etc). Self-driving cars benefit by machine learning. The acceleration and reductions in the friction in electronic commerce are generally good things.I don’t agree with Zuboff that the behavioural science behind the new data aggregation firms promotes a radical indifference to the lot of the common person. Nor do I agree that hyperscale doesn’t require competitive markets or for that matter democracy.This has yet to be proven.We all need participatory democracy, and more than ever on a global scale. Let’s make these damn machines work for us, not agin us."
264,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26854448-m-a,5,"This is a brilliant and important book about the future of mankind.It is unfortunately very difficult to read, due not only to the complexity of the subject matter, but also due to the constant use by the author of jargon and long complicated sentences. This is very ironic, considering that this book is intended as a warning and a call to action to the general public against the machinations of the Surveillance Capitalist elite. I can only hope that a more accessible version of this book will be published to accomplish that goal.Zuboff claims that surveillance capitalism is as big a change for our society as industrial capitalism was more than two centuries ago.It all started with Google, followed closely by Facebook, Microsoft and eventually by all digital industries.Google started collecting our private data (from our search terms on Google search, to our emails on Gmail, to our location data on Google Maps, our data stored on our Android devises etc..) without our knowledge or consent and turning them into predictions about our future behavior, which they sold for profit to marketers.Zuboff calls Google ""privacy kleptomaniacs"". She compares Google to the Spanish conquistadores invading the natives on the American continent and declaring the continent theirs by a monarchical edict declaring it so. So did Google invade our private data by declaring it theirs through obscure unilaterally imposed terms of service.She calls this data, the new raw material of capitalism ""Behavioral Surplus"".She traces the architecture of this new form of capitalism from its supply routes to its ""behavioral futures markets"".The production of digital data has far outpaced the human capacity to process/make sense of that data.Therefore, behavioral psychologists and data scientists have created algorithms to predict an individual's future behavior based on the billions of raw data of his/her every move and every thought.They use the 5 factor personality model, the 6 emotion model, affective computing, emotional analytics and sentiment analysis to predict our personalities and our future behavior.Surveillance Capitalists are prediction factories, based on raw materials from us.Google and co don't sell the raw data, they sell behavioral predictions based on that data.That information is not only useful to marketers, but to anyone with an interest in that knowledge and an interest in influencing that future behavior.Some examples of benefits of knowing a person's future behavior with very great accuracy include: predicting disease, financial risk, criminal risk, consumer preferences and political views. This knowledge about the future allows corporations to eliminate all risks in their business dealings.Zuboff calls this predictive data the ""shadow text"".This shadow text is only available to surveillance capitalists through their data extractions and algorithms.It is about us but not for us.Us being unaware of the surveillance is the precondition for surveillance capitalism to function properly- we are to remain unaware of the shadow text. Even if raw data are shared with us, the shadow data crafted for prediction purposes is not accessible to us.Remote digital observation and tele-stimulation ( the ""god view"") allows for distancing of the observed as ""the other"".Zuboff calls the Surveillance Capitalists the ""Big Other"".""The market reduces us to our behavior, transformed into another fictional commodity and packaged for others' consumption"" We are to be monitored and tele stimulated.Zuboff demonstrates how surveillance capitalism has expanded beyond cyberspace into our everyday life.Even the human body is treated as a computer, containing data in order to provide corporations certainty of profit.Take wearables for example: they form an unobtrusive integration to everyday life- internet connected fabrics, fitness trackers, diabetes apps etc.Zuboff quotes a study that shows that apps downloaded on a smart phone extract location data, contact lists, photos & videos etc without express consent of the user and that they sell this data to third parties.According to Zuboff, these companies' privacy policies should be called ""surveillance policies"".She predicts we will all end up with chips in our bodies for better surveillance, like animals. Telemetry is already used on animals to study their behavior. Humans will be next.We are already tracked in our cars, in our homes, in our kidneys (dialysis devices).By 2020, there will be 20 billion intelligent devices with the capability of tracking and monitoring us.Zuboff calls whatever data that is not yet tracked ""dark data"". Surveillance Capitalists are intent on tracking all behavior that is not (yet) informatized.They want to monetize every aspect of our lives, the entire human experience. They want to turn our entire life into profit for themselves.Power was once identified with the ownership of the means of production.Now power rests in the ownership of the means of behavioral prediction and behavioral modification of the other. Now our lives are turned into data without our knowledge or consent in order to benefit others.Zuboff explains how the system of Surveillance Capitalism is grounded in behavioral psychology.The goal of behaviorism is the prediction and control of behavior- the human being is nothing but an organism, an ""it"". According to behaviorists a human is in essence no different than a mushroom, only a bit more complex.Behaviorists (eg Skinner and Pentland) believe humans have no freedom of will, no autonomy, no agency. Freedom of will is an illusion. It is the environment that controls behavior. Individual behavior is caused by variables lying outside the individual himself.Hence the belief by behaviorists that behavioral control can lead to predicting future behavior with scientific accuracy. Behavior must be studied w/o limits and w/o knowledge of the ""organism"".Privacy is an illusion just like freedom- they must be forfeited in favor of the good life.BUT this view was meant to benefit all of humanity; the knowledge gained through behavioral tracking was to be used to improve human behavior towards a better future for humanity: fighting disease, crime, poverty etc..Instead, behaviorism has been hijacked by surveillance capitalism to benefit only the small class of surveillance capitalists and their customers. The lost freedom only affects us but the acquired knowledge and profit is all theirs.What are the dangers of Surveillance Capitalism?The more one knows about a person, the easier it is to control him.Besides being used for targeted marketing, knowledge of personal data can also be used to blackmail, defame, harass and discriminate against us.The dangers lie not only in corporate surveillance itself and the accompanying loss of privacy, but even more worrisome, in corporate mind manipulation and corporate behavioral modification, such as the creation of conformity and obedience but also the creation of desires that benefit commerce and emotions that benefit politicians. Surveillance capitalists wants ALL of you- your behavior, your thoughts, your emotions, your personality- so they can manipulate your behavior. Will you have any autonomy, any free will left? Surveillance Capitalism is not only a danger to privacy, but a danger to democracy which depends on autonomous moral judgment and individual determination and free will. Zuboff believes in free will as the basis for individuality, self determination, and the right to decide our future (She calls it ""The right to the future tense"").The right to be one's author of one's future should be cast as a human right-necessary because it is imperiled by ""the panvasive digital architecture of behavioral modification owned and operated by surveillance capital, necessitated by its economic imperatives and driven by its laws of motion, all for the sake of its guaranteed outcomes""Will Google, FB and co. lead to digital totalitarianism? According to Zuboff the answer is no, because the past offers no adequate compass for this new phenomenon.Zuboff calls the future of Surveillance Capitalism ""Instrumentarianism"".Totalitarianism, as impersonated by Hitler and Stalin was only understood after the facts. It entails the destruction of all human ties except total loyalty to the movement (fascism or communism). It operates through the means of violence, terror and fear- all who do not conform, the enemies of the ""people"", are executed.Instrumentarianism behaves through the means of behavioral modification.And, unlike in a totalitarian regime, there is no need to use force . All you need is adequate human engineering.""Instrumentarianism"" is a behaviorally controlled society, in which knowledge replaces freedom. In such a society, social change can be generated by social pressure from social networks to ""go with the flow, stay with the herd, return to the hive and take flight with the flock"". Identity yields to synchrony.Such a society leads to the death of individuality. The collective intelligence knows best and individuality is only unnecessary friction towards that goal.Instrumentarian society with its architecture of behavioral control, social pressure and asymmetrical power is a Panopticon - there is no exit possible.Once it was believed that there is no exit from an all knowing and all powerful God.Under Instrumentarianism, there will be no exit from the others, big other and the surveillance capitalists. Big Other knows no boundaries.Zuboff pleads for the right to sanctuary.It is a universal need for a safe refuge, for shelter.This right is as ancient as human history; originally it manifested itself in the form of a city, or a temple. Later on this right extended to the home: a sanctuary from arbitrary intrusion. Psychologists agree that this is important for development of the self and for mental health. With Big Other, the Universe takes up residence within our walls, there is no refuge. (thinkof internet connected security cameras, light switches, thermostats, appliances, rumbas, wearables,smart phones, tooth brushes, beds, personal assistants, TVs, toys,etc etc).What solution does Zuboff propose to avert the coming Instrumentarian Society?To just stop using the internet and internet connected devices?Surveillance Capitalists offer solutions to social connection, access to information, time saving convenience and ""illusionary"" support and this got us all addicted. It is not reasonable to expect us to go off the grid.Privacy regulation and monopoly regulation is inefficient at combating those risks- it will not be solved by encryption, anonymization or discussion of data ownership. This is a new condition that outruns the law, that has not been tamed by law. Zuboff discusses very briefly the new regulatory regime operating in the EU since May 2018, the GDPR ( General Data Protection Regulation). The GDPR is a good step forward, but only time will tell if it will be efficient in vanquishing surveillance capitalism's instrumentarian power. The individual is powerless against the surveillance capitalist machine because of asymmetrical power and knowledge. Only collective action on the ground, such as class actions, will determine if GDPR will be effective.Regulators will be up against well funded corporate lawyers and lobbyists.Zuboff concludes that Surveillance Capitalism is profoundly anti democratic. It is a market coup from above on the people. It is a form of tyranny, of absolutism; it imposes its rules from above; everyone except the tyrant is just an organism, the ""other one"", to be exploited for the profit of the tyrant.Industrial revolution has led to near destruction of our planet and extinction of many species. Instrumentarianism will lead to extinction of our individuality.Zuboff points to the critical role of public opinion on changing the laws. She proclaims passionately:It is NOT ok to strip search us for profit.It is a human expectation to be the author of one's life.There is still time to redirect the action to a future that we can call home.It is our responsibility to right was has gone wrong.We have to be indignant because this is an attack on human dignity.Freedom from uncertainty is no freedom.She refuses to seed the future to illegitimate power.She demands a human future.She calls the world to action to declare the digital future to be a human future."
265,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42693079-ryan-o-neill,4,"This ambitious and expansive book aims to define and explain the rise of surveillance capitalists like Google, Facebook and Microsoft as they play ever larger roles in our lives. Shoshana Zuboff briefly maps out the history of some of these companies and delves into the way in which they gradually encroach on our lives in ever more frightening ways.She argues persuasively that while sometimes driven by old capitalist imperatives, these companies represent a break from past eras such as that of industrial capitalism as they secretly and aggressively gather increasing amounts of personal information from us, but not for our benefit; rather than the traditional business-customer reciprocities, surveillance capitalists plunder every element of our lives, both online and offline, for the benefit of advertisers, and ultimately serve their economic benefit.Under surveillance capitalism, we are no longer the customers (although practices are often disguised under the auspices of 'personalisation') but rather our searches, browsing history, friends, likes, reactions, emotions and feelings are raw materials to be scraped for the benefit of companies who are free to operate outside the boundaries of traditional democracy and regulation. Our rights are ruthlessly and carelessly cast aside and rendered obsolete in this relentless pursuit of behavioural surplus without which surveillance capitalists cannot grow.These companies encroach upon our personal space in ever more intrusive ways - from the original Google Street View controversy in the mid-2000s to Facebook's hidden methods of gleaning info on our preferences, to TVs that listen to you, wearable devices, Alexa house alarms and even toys that listen to you, to the fight for our car dashboards. The speed and aggression is such that after initial outrage, we are worn down, helpless and numbed, resigned to our fate.Surveillance capitalism, Zuboff argues, attempts to create certainty of outcome for its actual customers - its advertisers. This is done by parsing human behaviour, exploiting feelings, emotions and beliefs even when we don't permit it to, so that our individual freedom, our rights to define our own experience, and to act and think in private are eroded as we are continuously moulded and directed towards specific courses of action by these companies. The inherent uncertainty that exists within how we think, how we act and interact - our right to an effective life - is replaced by collective certainty at the hands of surveillance capitalism.Zuboff also mines the effects of social media on young people's development. As they journey from being defined by their relationships at a young age to becoming separate from but connected to others in adulthood, young people are adversely affected by social media and its imperatives to forcing people to see themselves 'from the outside in' and define themselves based on the experiences and lives of others. The pervasiveness of social media means people often struggle to disconnect, their mental health even suffering from brief separation from their accounts. This crucially and savagely inhibits their ability to look inward and make that journey from people defined by their relationships in youth, to autonomous individuals who have relationships in adulthood.Zuboff argues that while the advent of new laws such as GDPR in Europe have been helpful, surveillance capitalism's overall success in evading proper regulation and legal scrutiny means that decisive action will depend on a turning of public opinion. Lots of us are passive about our distrust of social media, but it will take a re-establishment of indignation, a renewal of outrage, if we are to have any chance of stemming the flow.The book is a heavy undertaking; more than 500 pages long and often written in rather academic prose, and it can occasionally be quite dense and abstract. Given the ubiquity of technology in all of our lives, it could undoubtedly be more reader-friendly, and perhaps focus on more real-life examples that we are all familiar with. Despite its wealth of information, Xuboff's proposed solutions are vague, and it is arguably unclear what exactly you as an individual can do personally to reduce the insidious influence of surveillance capitalism in your everyday life; what strategies can be used to repell Facebook from building a strong profile based on your preferences, for example? Is there a feasible path to effective life without being on Facebook?Furthermore, it would have been helpful to have some more analysis on the gathering of information not related to economics - the how and why of information kept either by governments or corporations on citizens for reasons not linked to monetary benefits.Nevertheless, this is a hugely informative, well researched and important book on a subject which, as the author herself notes, is a story still unfolding and which still has some way to run. It's likely that many updates and more reader-friendly analyses on surveillance capitalism will follow, but this is a fantastic launch-pad for one of the defining issues of our time."
266,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45700308-tanmay-srivastava,1,"Shoshana Zuboff's book was highly recommended, was part of multiple lists and had glowing reviews on Goodreads. I was quite excited to pick it up and start reading.  Without calling it out, Zuboff treats incremental technological progress as a zero sum game. A win for the tech companies is a loss to someone. Take, for example when Zuboff talks about connected cars . She says an insurance company can stall a car if the premiums are not paid. She beats up this argument and brings up a case of how an elderly couple had to choose between car payments and medicine, which came to light only when the collection officers turned up at the door. A crowdfunding campaign was launched to help them and it had a happy ending. Using software however would have meant that this would have never happened. She fails to recognize that her example is the exception and not the norm. She chooses to ignore the positive impact connected cars would have on say, cars getting stolen going down leading to lower premiums or reduced premiums for drivers using their cars less or rewarding good drivers by reducing their premiums. Maybe, with such technological advances premiums would fall to such an extent that the couple wouldn't have to worry about premium payments altogether? She fails to acknowledge that progress is not a zero sum game. Tech companies have been bashed quite a bit through the book. There is no nod of appreciation for the positive impact they have had on societies. Here, In India - products of these tech companies are helping small businesses make moves that wouldn't have been possible before. Expensive POS Machines have been skipped (the same way how landlines didn't make it to parts of India but mobile phones did) in favor of Google Pay (QR Codes for Bank to Bank transfers). Book keeping doesn't required expensive licenses and can be managed online. Whatsapp is used to sell/communicate/deliver orders. YouTube is a learning platform for many, and a medium for news outside of the traditional media. The jobs these tech companies have created in India, directly and indirectly, also cannot be overlooked. There's a section where Zuboff talks about fake news and its impact on Brexit and the 2016 US Election. While I do agree fake news is a very big issue, the issue of voter discretion cannot be overlooked. In Zadie Smith's essay on Brexit -  ""Fences""  she writes how someone voted one way in referendum to get rid of the health secretary. Would it have been different if it was not targeted to a particular group (via the likes of Cambridge Analytica)? Would the results of Brexit and the 2016 US Election have been the same if there was no Facebook? Are we giving these incidents more importance than they deserve? ""Who knows?"" - I don't. I don't think we can ever conclusively state yes or no. The biggest issue is that a lot of topics covered in the book are in the grey area. Is it okay to give someone hungry a burger from McDonald's? The burger will make sure that they don't go hungry, but it's not a healthy meal. Can they afford to have a healthy meal? Can they stay hungry? Is there a way to grow healthy food to feed everyone? Is there a way to make everyone want/enjoy the healthy food? This sort of reasoning should have been the core of the book. You cannot do without technology companies today. Google, Microsoft, Facebook are essential parts of our day to day lives. Is there a business model where these companies can make enough money to create products that add value without compromising on data to drive revenue? Is there a market for people to pay for their services without any data getting collected? Do people bother to dig deep in their account settings to switch off optional data collection? Do people care? I feel the book is not asking the right questions needed to drive policy discussions. Data privacy is an important topic. The book is well researched in parts but jumps into pages of wishful thinking. The conclusions drawn are biased. The facts are presented in a way to scare you, and similar to how likes are garnered on social media with scary/angry posts, this book has scared people into giving it 5 stars on Goodreads. I wish this book was not one sided as it was - Not recommended."
267,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27470888-cool-breeze,1,"The subject of this book is very important. Unfortunately, this book fails miserably at contributing anything useful to the discussion. It is mind-numbingly long at 691 pages and an ordeal to read. Zuboff takes a few observations on surveillance technology issues and uses pretentious academic jargon to fluff them into this execrable doorstop of a book. The book does not offer any practical solutions to the issues she raises. A good editor could have reduced this to a pamphlet or a web article without leaving much notable out.This is possibly the worst non-fiction book I have ever read. I dreaded resuming it every time I picked it up and finally abandoned it on page 158. If I should ever be stuck on a desert island with only this book for reading material, I will be thankful at least that I have an abundant supply of toilet paper.Zuboff is a sociologist and the language she employs is tortured and tedious in the extreme. She insists on coining lots of neologisms and wallowing in her jargon. Amusingly, her favorite term is Behavioral Surplus, or BS for short. The book could have saved countless pages if she reduced a lot of her BS to abbreviations. Perhaps such Heideggerian writing impresses her academic colleagues, but it is excruciating for the average reader. She beats her core points to death – within the first 100 pages she must have repeated some version of the following point dozens of times – ‘the user isn’t the customer, nor are they the product, they are the raw material that is used to create the product’. You could have cut many more pages by limiting this point to three repetitions. It is as if she thinks her readers are idiots, or else she has dementia and doesn’t remember what she wrote a page or two ago. Even worse, Zuboff is a Luddite and a hard-core leftist. She obviously thinks the Industrial Revolution was largely a disaster. On page 11, she writes “industrial civilization… threatens to cost us the earth”. By page 12, she is hyperventilating “The industrial legacy of climate chaos fills us with dismay, remorse and fear”. No, it doesn’t. The reason Trump is President and the US has repudiated stupid climate treaties is that so many American voters think this is a non-issue or a very low priority (#18 out of 19 in a recent survey). On page 22, she writes that she has been inspired by a rogues' gallery of leftists, including Karl Marx, Theodor Adorno, Jean-Paul Sartre and Thomas Piketty (Robert Reich and Rachel Carson, who is responsible for millions of deaths, are also mentioned favorably). On page 33, she likens her great-grandparents fleeing the oppression of 1908 Russia to the oppression of the nuclear family (you poor, fragile snowflake!). On page 38 she viciously criticizes Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, although she admits their policies pulled the country out of the stagflation and “malaise” of the Jimmy Carter years. Unbelievably, Zuboff apparently thinks airline deregulation was a bad thing. On page 42, she is writes approvingly of rioters in London (she really should read some Theodore Dalrymple on the real problems involved) and the dilettante, astroturf Occupy “movement”. On page 43, she comments disapprovingly on those who would “pare regulations, cut taxes… and shrink entitlements”. Heaven forbid that anyone should want to take an ax to the leviathan state! By page 109, she is bemoaning the Supreme Court’s rejection of restrictions on political speech, “hate speech” (meaning anything she and her politically correct brethren disagree with), pornography (yeah, she’s puritanical as well as a Luddite) and free association. What a pinch-faced scold!Only at this point does she admit that her arch-villain, Google, has been totally in bed with the left-wing Obama administration, using their surveillance technology to mastermind his two Presidential campaigns and running a revolving door operation with 258 employees moving between Google and the Obama regime. Whoops! How inconvenient! It’s almost like leftism and this creepy surveillance technology go hand in hand! Curiously, in a 691-page book, the word “Clinton” does not appear even once in the 26-page index! I wonder who was President from 1996 to 2001, Google’s first five years? Or who was Hillary’s biggest corporate campaign contributor? It is a complete mystery, according to this book. Zuboff doesn’t actually appear to be a Clinton fan, so maybe she just doesn’t want to wind up adding to the Arkancide body count like Jeffrey Epstein.Zuboff must have felt terrible about documenting the extent of Obama’s collusion with Google’s abuses, because within a few pages she is back to bashing mainstream conservative organizations such as the Federalist Society, Heritage Action, Americans for Tax Reform and the Cato Institute as “Far Right”. Anyone to the right of Marx, Lenin and Mao is apparently “Far Right” to Zuboff.Chapter 5 elaborates Googles expanding abuses from 2009-2016. The Europeans attempt some pushback, but the US is feckless or oblivious. Just who controlled the government that was supposed to be preventing such abuses during this time? Zuboff couldn’t possibly guess, even if you spotted her an O, B and M. During this period, Zuboff’s Harvard Business School colleagues ride to the defense of Yelp, perhaps the only tech company more loathsome than Google.Strangely, Zuboff admits there were a number of potentially effective policy fixes being seriously considered in the years before 9/11. Why not revive those ideas and build a political coalition of like-minded classical-liberals, libertarians, small-government conservatives and Trump supporters (the tech giants being no friends of Trump) to implement them? She points out that the national security agencies are obstacles. Well, after Brennan, Comey, Holder and Lynch, a lot of people on the right need no further persuasion that the FBI, CIA and the rest of the Deep State are utterly corrupt rogue agencies. Zuboff doesn’t appear to consider this a possibility. I guess working with those icky right wingers is completely out of the question. Even worse, such allies are never going to go along with replacing the tech elite with the “benevolent” socialist dictatorship of Zuboff and her Harvard faculty elite. As it turns out, Zuboff’s problem is not so much with the creepy technology, it is that the creepy technology is not under the control of “enlightened” leftists like her and her comrades in academia and government.That was as much as I could take. I skimmed the book for any sign of practical solutions in the pages to come and, finding none, I abandoned the book on page 158.I agree with Zuboff that the tech giants represent a grave threat. However, if her prescription of more government and more socialism is the only alternative, I guess I will just have to find ways to live with it. The only thing worse than surveillance capitalism is surveillance statism run by socialist do-gooder “elites” like Zuboff, who always think they know better and want to engage in social engineering. Do you think the Chinese people would prefer annoying Google ads or their oppressive and ubiquitous social credit scores? The only people I would less like to see in control of this technology than Page, Brin and Zuckerberg are Zuboff and her comrades.In the nearer term, there are still practical steps one can take to mitigate the problem. Don’t use Google products. Use DuckDuckGo for search. Don’t use Gmail or Chrome. Use a good ad blocker, like AdBlockPlus on all devices. Don’t buy creepy surveillance technology like Nest, Ring or Alexa. Delete your Facebook account. Don’t use Twitter, it’s a surveillance sewer. Don’t buy from Amazon or use their products or services, especially the Washington Post. Don’t buy from Apple or use their products or services. Use Linux if that is viable for you or lock down you Windows privacy settings, if not. Check your app setting and cut them back to only those necessary to function. Don’t use non-essential apps like games, many of which are bad offenders.Support the breakup of the tech giants using antitrust laws. Support their prosecution for anti-competitive and anti-privacy violations. Having Page, Brin, Zuckerberg and Bezos doing some serious hard time would have a very salutary effect “pour encourager les autres”. Institute real and legally-binding privacy protections such as Zuboff mentions and dismisses. Yes, we will have to do it without the support of Zuboff and her comrades, but Trump’s upcoming second term could be a real opportunity to get this done (I think Zuboff’s head may have just exploded)."
268,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65435043-alan-tennyson,5,"I pored over this book, stayed with the words. Read and reread them. Drank deeply from their wisdom.  It was not an easy read, but ultimately it gave far more than it took. The Age of Surveillance Capitalism is a seminal text for our age. Zuboff's account of surveillance capitalism is elegant, poised and persuasive. Yet for all her brilliance, Shonanna's central thesis suffers some fundamental flaws.  Where The Age is at it's strongest is in the articulation of surveillance capitalism. Consider this, 'Who owns your face?', 'Who owns your behaviour?' What you do, where you go, who you know, all this has value and extracting value from these data is the business model of the surveillance capitalist.  But this is only the description, where Zuboff's account takes a darker turn, is in control. Once Surveillance Capitalists have provided a description of you, the next logical step is to determine how much this description can be used to predict and control you. Zuboff's account of these processes is beautifully rendered in perfect proses.  Know thyself, unless you don't like what you find, then, deny thyself, and pretend you are other. Zuboff goes for the latter.  We are born of this place, this pale blue dot, we are natural phenomena. Yet despite these self-evident truths, many continue to advance the notion that we apes are exceptional.  We are somehow other than the mere organisms with whom we share our earth and almost our entire genetic structure. Zuboff takes issue with humans being described as 'mere organisms'.  She is caged by this ideology of human exceptionalism, and it weakens her thesis considerably.  There are sacred cows here, and sacred cows will invariably be slaughtered.  The first heifer into the meat factory is autonomy. Shoshana strips us of our relations, our context and connections. She exalts 'autonomy' but fails to grapple with the weakness of the presumptions it contains. This leads her to assert that humans are and ought to be autonomous.  But Zuboff fails to address that we are born free, but everywhere in chains. From the traffic light to the electric chair, we are already in a context that seeks to control our behaviour. What does she think education and justice are? If not systems of changing our behaviour? But it's more than this, it's a scientific reality, we are our contexts, our environment, they shape us as we shape them.  This is a reality that an insistence on 'Freedom' cannot wish away.   For me, the issue is not that we are organisms', we are.  It is not that we are miraculous rational deities, we are not.  We need to embrace our human frailty, stare it down since we are wiser for this knowledge.  Here again, Zuboff takes issues with what she calls the 'ideology of human frailty'.  Respectfully I would ask that we,  put down our pride and look hard in the mirror, human frailty is not an ideology, it is a fundamental truth. We are 'mere organisms' and to claim anything else is to cling to a pernicious ideology. An ideology that has prompted human dominion over earth and animals, and all the ecological genocide that follows."

In fact, in a time like this I wish there was a more complex rating system than 5 stars. I digress.This was, in many ways, the first of its kind. There have, in my view, yet to be too many intelligent take downs of the dangers of big data. There is,of course, a brief mentioning of the a similar subject in many other modern texts - but not to this degree.So, you ask, what the hell is surveillance capitalism. It is, a term coined by the author. She first presented the concept publicly in 2014, in an article, where she described it as such :""[surveillance capitalism is a] radically dissembled and extractive variant of information capitalism"" based on the commodification of ""reality"" and its transformation into behavioral data for analysis and sales""*---- IN this book she presents the story of how it is that we have gotten to such a point in history, where the sentence in her 2014 article could even be spoken. In this she gives a small run down of facebook and google, and explains the origins of these sights in relation to their users. User-ship on these web pages began without much craziness, but as we all know many pages which were once small e.g. facebook, google, and youtube have more or less all become huge power houses of influence. They have now followings in the billions. This is presently praised by these web pages as a good thing. Initially. well. The servers couldn't take it. There was too much damn data. And its all so useless.Or is it?It was, with this question, in the eyes of zuboff, that this form of capitalism** was born. The data not only need not be an annoyance, but it could be a pathway towards making money. 'Perhaps', these tech giants thought 'we could predict the users behaviors by paying attention to the patterns in data'. Alas. we are truly all creatures of habit. Long story short. A great deal of people in the industrial world are using certain pages on the internet in ways that are useful for targeting for sales. This of course can eventually be sold to governments blah blah blah. Ask yourself. are you ok with people predicting your behaviors to increase user experience? What about to protect you? What about to just watch you?These are questions the book will make you reflect on.Overall, I think this was one of the most apropos books I have read in awhile towards understanding some issues in modernity.86/100 stars.Recommended for:Those thinking about big data in its prediction of human behaviorthose who dont trust facebook and googlethose worried about internet privacythose thinking about the future path of society*Hey guess what.

Market and industrial capitalism are declining, long live surveillance capitalism say the social media giants, in whose tentacles it is we, rather than any thing useful for us as humans, who are grasped .It’s a bit long and at times repetitive, like Das Kapital, but it’s not really a criticism of the book, as the amount of research and work Zuboff must have done to produce this dizzying analysis of the current state of digital technology and its impact on us, is breathtaking. It’s the resistance to surveillance capitalism’s imperatives that she leaves as the challenge for society at the end of the book... How is that done when we hunger so much for its crumbs and are so addicted to the precision targeting of its algorithms?"

The argument is blind to how Big Tech's surveillance is merely the most recent and sophisticated manifestation of capitalism's inherent drive to extract value; advertising and media companies have for centuries made a business of surveillance and control. But acknowledging that continuity would deflate the book's sensationalism, and undermine its premise that, before Big Tech, the only threat to liberalism was state power, and not also that of capital."
279,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89255731-mark-walker,5,"This book will boil your blood. Supported by extensive empirical research, Professor Shoshana Zuboff exposes the effective digital implementation of the late B. F. Skinner's Beyond Freedom and Dignity. It centers around three related factors: The distribution of knowledge: “Who knows?” Authority: “Who decides who knows?” and Power: “Who decides who decides who knows?” (Hint: it's not you). Orders of magnitude beyond just tracking cookies and the creepy anticipation of your interests by entities such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook, the new instrumentarianism is used by surveillance capitalists to control not just what you buy but also what you think about and how you think it. This is not even the theoretical Capitalism of Friedman, Hayek, or Adam Smith, as there is no equality of individual choice in it. In other words there's no free market here, as surveillance capitalists deliberately orchestrate your life for their benefit irrespective of yours. Thus it's not a fair trade; there is no reciprocity in the conveniences you think you receive from even the simplest transactions. You are not their customers (or even the ""product"" as in the cliché); their customers are the people purchasing the information harvested about you, which is extracted without your awareness. In this digital realm, it is as if you are the third world country having your natural resources extracted for the exclusive profits of foreign capitalists. Another clear analogy is we are like chickens being farmed for our eggs: they feed us with incentives, not for our well-being but so that we will lay more eggs to go into omelets not for us. You and your personal information are only the objects, the ""Other,"" that are for sale for the benefit of people who are not you. The key feature of all of this is that willingness is irrelevant, as we are unknowing and thus unwitting participants. Their salient objective is the obscene profits garnered from not just your profiles and posts, but the shadow text that you don't see from the fusion of the backscatter data about you that is harvested into separate secret databases. They actively hide that they have this information on you, as their modus operandi requires that you not be aware of it for this process to be successful. Much of this activity is beyond the reach of laws and courts, as the surveillance capitalists would just go underground with their operations if regulations were imposed. It is accompanied by an acceleration of the deliberate assault on democracy through lobbying and revolving door employment between government and the commercial interests that control it. Thus just voting for politicians that promise to tame surveillance capitalism will be of insufficient effect. Zuboff offers hope and some thoughts on what to do about it. European history has shown that when the people have had enough of oppression, they join together to rebel, as when the Berlin Wall came down without resistance from the guards. A similar event must occur today to escape the glass walls of the hive surveillance capitalists have put us in for the purpose of harvesting and orchestrating even our most personal thoughts, all for their profit and not ours. We need walls of our own, not to keep us in their hive, but to keep them out of our personal sanctuary. Public opinion is key to taming this monster. In the end if enough of the public rose up against surveillance capitalism, possibly by throwing its shadow text in disarray and diminishing its value, the money and influence behind it would then be of little effect. There is hope if humans would willingly help each other to the extent that surveillance capitalists take without asking. Then the world would be a much friendlier and more prosperous place for everyone. and not just the few."
280,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6192529-frieda-vizel,3,"The writing was a big problem for me. Sometimes, instead of relying on strong arguments, it relied on absurdly hyperbolic language. For instance, I didn’t feel like she explained clearly enough why monetizing our data is bad - say, because how it’s been destroying “the forth estate” that needs to constantly run after the clicks, or how our data is used to manipulate us to consume-consume-consume, to the detriment of the planet. Instead she went on for a while about our right to the “will to will” and a lot about how bad BF Skinner was. Maybe if I understood behaviorism better I’d have felt it as strongly as she seemed to, but I just didn’t feel like I totally got that whole part. Maybe that’s me.Speaking of Skinner, she seems to be of the school of public intellectualism that is very focused on individual actors instead of on the system. So she goes on a lot about the bad guys of our predicament, Skinner but also of course Zuck, the Google founders, the guy at Microsoft who didn’t seem to be extraordinarily villainous at all. Here’s where this type of focus in the individual derails us: it leads Zuboff to think that these people created the problems, and not the system. But actually, so long as the law allows for folks to make money by manipulating the masses, there will always be a sociopath to sink his teeth in. That’s why the problem is the system and that needs to be fixed. And Zuboff does argue for that - it’s just that she weakens her argument by being so focused on these insatiable idiot vampires. But all that is quibbling and frustration. The important take-away from the book is that it stakes the solution within the law. It does not fall for the “freedom of speech” idiocy, an argument mounted by economic interest as a way to stop the entire legal system from functioning as it should. Since when can’t we have laws? Since when is it tyranny for the government to create limits and parameters as a way of ensuring a healthy society? Since the tech companies have been telling us that we only deserve positive freedoms. Freedom to advertise, sure. Freedom from being manipulated by ads- it’s an Orwellian Communist murderous regime and soon we will be like North Korea!Zuboff talks about the slow speed of democracy. That’s what left me so despaired. Democracy is not getting faster, but the technological invasions are. And I don’t see how we’ll ever be able to catch up with them. Meanwhile, a screech on a decibel undetectable to the human ear is now screaming into your subconscious and telling you to buy another Alexa and a smart underwear plus to to vote for Kim Jung Il. True story."
281,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8040056-clancy,5,"[The] bare facts of surveillance capitalism necessarily arouse my indignation because they demean human dignity. The future of this narrative will depend upon the indignant citizens, journalists, and scholars drawn to this frontier project; indignant elected officials and policy makers who understand that their authority originates in the foundational values of democratic communities; and, especially, indignant young people who act in the knowledge that effectiveness without autonomy is not effective, dependency-induced compliance is no social contract, a hive with no exit can never be home, experience without sanctuary is but a shadow, a life that requires hiding is no life, touch without feel reveals no truth, and freedom from uncertainty is no freedom.This book is an incendiary work of immense scholarly and literary significance.With admiral restraint, Zuboff painstakingly dismantles, analyses, and lays bear the machinations of one of the greatest challenges that faces humanity in this century. We have be come not the product, as is so often said, but the raw material of an entirely novel industry. This industry's speed of ascent and adaptation and especially of innovation has left individuals and governments alike, completely unable to meaningfully understand, let alone reign-in, the advance of this all-pervading entity that increases its penetration into our lives and our communities with every passing minute.This book articulates the uncomfortable gut-feeling, the uneasy sense of cognitive dissonance, that I've felt about the level of access companies generally, but especially Alphabet and Facebook, have to my life and every piece of information living that life generates. I understand now why my no-choice participation in this new economy has generated these feelings, in all their expanded and terrifying entirety.While at times bombastic, and others poetic, and others still cool and clinical; the amount of research, time, and passion for humanity itself that went into the construction of this work has paid off. This work is a significant achievement, and an important moment that we can look back on to see whether we as a species can rise to overcome this new challenge, or whether this will be little but foreshadowing of the future we allow to follow.If you're alive right now, you owe it to yourself to read this."

The use and abuse of data and user trust is worth talking about, it's even worth shouting about.But not like this.Zuboff is alarmist, melodramatic, hyperbolic and tiring. Everything the tech companies do is not just wrong, it's a diabolic scheme to undermine the world as we know it. When something is wrong, it's never an unintended consequence, it's never human error, it's never just a silly gimmick not thought out far enough. It's always, always presented as a evil contrived mastermind plot to wreck your privacy and abuse you. And it's always presented like it's the rise of fascism in the 1930's with the most gut-wrenching tear-jerking vocabulary she could find. Get a few examples, simplify a theory somehow related to the issue, contrive a concept, give it a name like ""shadow text"" or ""behavioral surplus"" (preferably a bit ominous name), cherry pick more examples, portend doom. Rinse and repeat. And mention ""surveillance capitalism"" at least 15 times per page.It's kind of ironic that when she goes on for 700+ pages on how you should never trust these companies, that she takes their Silicon Valley hypetalk at face value. If a company claims they can do something, Zuboff gleefully integrates the claim into her narrative with zero criticism. Because it serves her point. But if a company apologises for something, it's of course disingenuous with them being the devil who wants to eat your children.By the time the book gets to behaviour manipulation, it turns from melodramatic to laughable. The obsession Zuboff has for B.F.Skinner and radical behaviorism (a 70-year-old psychology concept, the cognitive revolution would like to have a word...) is full on religious. The man wasn't wrong about anything and conditioning works on people with a hundred per cent efficiency!This is an important issue, but creating hyperbolic devils like this is not just bad writing and argumentation but counter-productive to the cause. It's just creates a shoddy boogeyman argument that is easy to shoot down.The very serious and dramatic reader Audible had for this didn't help btw. (she was very clear speaker though). "

Everyone knows that the technology we are living with is unprecedented and changing the world. If we aren't careful, we will cause more harm than good. This book is about the dangers of this new information age. But there are a lot of problems with how the information is presented. First, the author uses over-the-top insulting language to describe these companies and leaders--all book long. It's so obviously biased that it undermines her points again and again, prompting lots of eyerolling--about once a page. That's minor, though. More serious is that this book is way too long. It wasn't satisfied making the point, it had to list 10 examples for every point--the full quotes, too. It read more like a college term paper that needed show every piece of research the author did. It's a very long book and it didn't need to be. Finally, the author falls prey to the worst sin in this kind of cultural criticism: she treats her worldview and personality type as the perfect ideal. There was no honest acknowledgement that her era had any flaws, only lament that the world doesn't live more like she used to, that generations will not experience what she did as a child. I very much believe that there are real dangers with only a few companies controlling the information access to the world. I've personally experienced challenges with this (Amazon just recently removed me as a listed seller of my own books, saying I need to sign up for the next level of account--at more cost--before I have the chance to be displayed as the owner of the product again). But it's a mixed bag and the author can't see past her indignation to the true complexity of the situation.So, read this for an imbalanced, overly wordy way of getting one side of the story. If it's not this book, make sure you get both sides of the story, not just the story told by Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, etc."

The monster did it, not Victor Frankenstein.”Zuboff touches on many aspects surrounding surveillance capitalism, and we see the intimate relationship between the NSA and CIA and the mutual benefits to that relationship. “The agencies craved the lawlessness that a firm such as Google enjoyed.” We learn the huge significance of Section 230 and how far behind the US is behind the EU in terms of clamping down, one example being the EU law in May 2014 enforcing the right to be forgotten. She cites many sources, but without doubt the two most prominent reference points are the work of B.F. Skinner and Hannah Arendt and in particular her “The Origins of Totalitarianism”. “Google is to surveillance capitalism what the Ford Motor Company and General Motors were to mass-production-based managerial capitalism.”At one point the author sets out the four main areas of fortifications that have allowed Google to be so over protected and free to flourish away from political interference for so long, particularly in the USA,1.	Google showing their capabilities of competitive advantage in electoral politics. 2.	The deliberate blurring of public and private interests through relationships and aggressive lobbying. 3.	A revolving door of personnel who migrated between Google and the Obama administration, who shared mutual interests during Google’s crucial growth years of 2009-2016. By April 2016, 197 individuals had migrated from government to the Googlesphere and 61 had moved in the other direction. 4.	Google’s campaign of influence over academic work and the larger cultural conversation, which was vital to policy formation, public opinion and political perception. “Ford’s inventions revolutionised production. Google’s inventions revolutionised extraction and established surveillance capitalism’s first economic imperative: the extraction imperative.”This book is awash with horror stories befitting of sci-fi paperbacks. Like the one concerning Genesis Toys, who brought out, My Friend Cayla, a terrifying concept in which the child’s doll which relies on voice recognition, also harvests all sorts of data from the customer’s house. It is such a blatant violation that in 2017 Germany, (a country which knows a thing or two about surveillance), banned it as an illegal surveillance device, urging parents to destroy any such dolls in their possession.Due to the nature of this book it does have its harder going moments, but it still remains engaging, and overall Zuboff has completed a chilling, sagacious and damning book on the sinister and sophisticated ploys increasingly used in surveillance capitalism. The text is relatively, devoid of any superfluous academic verbiage, which many of these kinds of books suffer from. These companies and the people tied up with them are the people who hate big, bad words like privacy, tax and transparency. You can employ all the lawyers, lobbyists and accountants and actuaries, but when you strip it all away, what it really is a small, group of dangerous people making the rules up as they go along who have been given a suspiciously free and easy reign over how policy works around the world.Facebook has already admitted to and was even boasting about its power to influence people’s behaviour in US elections, and this was years before the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke. The billionaire owner of that company, Robert Mercer, backed Donald Trump. As Facebook is a private company it did not have to adhere to the legal standards for experimentation required of academic and government researchers. It remains to be seen what Facebook and Google cannot get away with. Providing a vast platform for hate speech, fostering chronic bullying, screening live suicides, streaming acts of terrorism. Where will the line be drawn?...Like bold, bratty toddlers they constantly challenge their boundaries and throw tantrums when anyone dare speaks out, but they needn’t worry a succession of US governments has them well protected as long as that money keeps on coming.Every law, rule or regulation is only as strong as the loopholes allow it to be. If these loopholes are known and continue to exist then we must ask why that is?... Who has the power to close them and more importantly why have they chosen not to close them?...These companies have consistently and effectively been left to self-regulate with predictable consequences. The problems have been known about the Wild West mentality of the internet for many, many years now, but yet little meaningful change has occurred, especially in the US.“Facebook’s $4.6 million in donations during the 2016 election cycle complemented its lobbying budget of $11.5 million in 2017.” But this is nothing compared to Google, which repeatedly spends more on lobbying than any other corporation, shelling out more than $18 million in 2018. It is also the second wealthiest registered lobbyist in the EU. Why are Facebook and Google choosing to spend such astronomical amounts of money?...What must they be getting in return?...What do they want?...What do they get?...Why are we not being told?...Welcome to “American Democracy”. Be afraid, be very afraid…"

I think the writing is slightly clumsy and I think the book underestimates the connection between Silicon Valley firms and the intelligence services/ the state. I also find the substantive responses to the issue to be a little milquetoast in comparison to the problem she diagnoses (I suppose that’s how it ended up on Obama’s books of the year list). Those problems aside at its best it is a searing look at the logic and function of the data economy. For understanding the ways that big data firms are altering society and how to think about the use and abuse of technology, this is a great book. It’s really at its best at the most conspiratorial and will leave you suspicious of what exactly your phone is doing and what Facebook ultimately wants. I’m sure posting this review will trigger a whole cascade of advertising material to make sure the big social media giants don’t loose my constant stream of crumbs I feed them. Don’t worry amazon algorithm reading this, I am much too trapped in the Skinner box to act on the suspicions raised by this book."
286,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33041497-anna,4,"“Surveillance capitalism’s antidemocratic and antiegalitarian juggernaut is best described as a market-driven coup from above. It is not a coup d’etat in the classic sense but rather a coup de gens: an overthrow of the people concealed as the technological Trojan horse that is Big Other”.This book is a huge, impressive piece of work. It feels like a relief to (at least) get some sort of overview over the way in which surveillance capitalism dominates our lives and orders society, despite the lack of suggestions for solutions. Understanding is the first step towards any form of meaningful resistance, and this feels like a solid first step :-)I do wish it were more accessible (as I do with most political theory) as its message feels like something that needs to be heard by more people than those who are willing to read 500 pages worth of academic language.Also - Zuboff’s idealization of the Henry Ford-era of capitalism rubs me the wrong way."
287,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24266382-ashley,3,"It’s been called “visionary,” but I don’t know that there’s anything entirely new here. What this felt like, to me, was a call to attention. The reader is not surprised by anything Shoshana Zuboff outlines, but is rather forced to acknowledge the problem in its entirety, all at once, in a 500-page package. That does make it feel revolutionary; Zuboff has written what very few people are willing to discuss in mainstream media, but which everyone has an inkling of, one way or another. I did find that it was a little too long-winded. It could have been significantly compressed, especially when a lot of the material was repetitive in order to emphasize certain themes and vocabulary.... and her preoccupation with B.F. Skinner was unnecessary. Zuboff was never so brilliant than when she illustrated, specifically, how Facebook and Google and Samsung (among others) are driving our behavior for their own profit, frequently at the expense of the law. I think that this strength was often drowned in vocabulary lessons and meandering observations, coming across as a little self-indulgent somewhere around the 200-page mark. It was unnecessary to spend so much time explaining Zuboff’s coined terms, such as “the uncontract”, “unprecedented”, “radical indifference”, “behavioural surplus”, and even “surveillance capitalism” itself. Especially in Part III, Zuboff’s self-indulgence became a running tangent, entire sections devoted to philosophy (and biology) lessons on the concept of “free will” and “utopia.”  In spite of that, it has definitely changed the way I think. It has also further fueled my nostalgia for a simpler time, and my distrust of social media and big corporations. The fact that it’s near-impossible to escape the clutches of these corporations is what really keeps me up at night; it’s not so much a privacy issue (I couldn’t care less if Mark Zuckerberg gets access to my old Instagram photos of cappuccinos) but rather a question of ethics. If I don’t want to give my data to third-parties, why are they able to access it anyway? If I don’t want to contribute to the rise of Facebook or Google, why are they still able to profit off of me anyway? Consent doesn’t really enter the conversation when it comes to what these rich tech companies have in mind, and evasive, incomplete privacy policies are nothing but “placebo effects” to pacify users.  Yes, I’m aware of the irony of publishing this review to Amazon-owned Goodreads.  ""Surveillance Capitalism"" is the kind of book that makes you want to throw your laptop into Lake Ontario and live in a cabin in the woods. I don’t know that I have the gumption for that kind of drastic change, but I’ll definitely think twice whenever I consider downloading an app or signing up for e-newsletters; I will certainly avoid buying any new smart devices by whatever means necessary. I do think it’s time for us to start protesting the free-reign that these conglomerates have been given, especially in North America. Our own behavior is being observed and herded by the rich 1% for financial gain; everything from our spending habits to our complacency is being mediated and controlled. I think, eventually, we have to reclaim our sense of autonomy and identity, and our understanding of reality.  Also, I just want to state for the record that I’ve always found it odd how North America experienced a period of mass rebellion, political protesting, and unrest during the 1960’s and 1970’s – and that this unrest suddenly came to a complete stop, save for a few exceptions here and there. Well, Zuboff has justified my unease, dedicating a sub-chapter to the behavior-control research conducted by the US Senate in the 70’s – research which became urgent as political protests escalated. And yes, surveillance capitalism has everything to do with it.  At the end of this heavy volume, Zuboff was really only trying to say one thing, re-stated from multiple angles: we are being rigorously and continuously exploited by capitalists. We don’t own our behavior anymore. Data collection and behavior control for the purpose of financial profit has crossed all ethical boundaries, and we as a society are content to let it happen.  This book is definitely recommended, if you have the patience and endurance to get through it. I almost didn’t. In a similar vein, I also recommend watching ‘Smithereens’, one of the recent Black Mirror episodes. Despite its melodrama, I think it has a lot of important things to say on society’s need to be “plugged in” and how this addiction is driving our lives. Some of Zuboff’s quotes that will stick with me: -“Its products are about predicting us, without actually caring what we do or what is done to us.” -“As populations grow numb, it becomes more difficult for individuals and groups to complain.” -“[Cortana] wants to know everything about you, but it does not want you to know how much it knows [...]” -“ ‘The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.’ ” [-Mark Weiser] -“Contemporary reviewers of Kahn’s book invariably seized upon the dark ‘nightmare scenarios’ of the computerized surveillance theme, the science-fiction–like forms of control that, they assumed, ‘will be actively feared and resented by many.’ Despite the wide range of scenarios that Kahn presented in his book on the distant year 2000, Kahn’s voyage into the ‘unthinkable’ was viewed by the public as a way to prepare for ‘the worst possible outcome’ in a terrifying ‘nightmare of social controls.’ Yet now, that same nightmare is rendered as an enthusiastic progress report on surveillance capitalism’s latest triumphs.” -“[…] Google wants us to accept that its rules simply reflect the requirements of autonomous processes, something that people cannot control. However, our grasp of the inner logic of surveillance capitalism suggests otherwise. Men and women made it, and they can control it. They merely choose not to do so.” -“Many people feel that if you are not on Facebook, you do not exist. People all over the world raced to participate in Pokémon Go. With so much energy, success, and capital flowing into the surveillance capitalist domain, standing outside of it, let alone against it, can feel like a lonely and risky prospect.”"

289,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85785571-laurence-lai,1,"The title “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism” evokes a weighty subject, and the book’s subtitle purports to something menacing to the future of humankind. It is to be seen if its contents are as substantial as the book’s 700-page length would suggest.The author, Shoshana Zuboff, is a professor emerita at Harvard Business School, not unimpressive an honor by any measure. A summary of assertions made in the book is as follows:1.	Big technological colossuses (Big Techs), epitomized by Google and Facebook, operate their business models by extracting data trails of online users, and in turn selling the extrapolated results (what Zuboff calls behavioral surplus) to their advertising customers.2.	Sophisticated algorithms are deployed and constantly refined to increase the predictive value of profiling data. At the same time, online users are passively served with moderated searches, federated news feeds, suggested connections, etc., all under the coercive power of the Big Techs. Such duress is as severe as not only to affect, shape, and compel, but with the aim to modify and manipulate user behaviors.3.	With the proliferation of sensors and Internet connectivity, Big Techs extend their reach far beyond the virtual realm to the real world. Regarding the surveillance operated by these techno-capitalists, in the author’s telling, its presence so pervasive and its impact so complete that any human free agency has receded entirely to the background and is ineffective.4.	While the above are not new to anyone who has casual understanding of current economics and culture, what Zuboff strives to accentuate is their connection to high-order issues such as self, liberty, democratic values, and human nature. She compares the dangers posed by “surveillance capitalism” to that of fascism, totalitarianism, behaviorist utopianism, and the like, that once presented real or potential detriments to humanity. For its thrilling effects, the agenda for the book is sweeping, even ambitious. Technological advancement, especially one that combines deep analytics, machine intelligence, and makes its ubiquitous presence in our intimate lives deserves a dispassionate evaluation as to its social impacts. Zuboff should be applauded for selecting this timely topic for her book.Yet one cannot help but feel frustrated by the lack of thematic organization of the whole book. Instead of explicating the economics involved in this different “capitalism”, Zuboff is more concerned with weaving her own narrative of abstruse euphemisms about how grave a danger the human future is facing. Materials are regurgitated, often word for word from the earlier part of the book and throughout. As to what actions Zuboff suggests to “fight for a human future…”? The author offers an ill-defined “synthetic declaration” (p. 345), and a skimpy, equally obscure advice of “friction, courage, and bearings” (p. 524). Specifics are sorely lacking in allusions to democratic institutions, public opinion, legislative and judicial recourse (p. 520). A whimper of a solution indeed to a loud bang of such a doorstopper.Zuboff obviously sets out to intend the book as a treatise that plumbs the depth of these to her as “unprecedented” developments in “surveillance capitalism”, and attempts to compare philosophically with past phenomena its manifold menaces to humanity. But it is exactly in such philosophizing that is the weakest of the book, for her arguments are at best tenuous and strained. On the other hand, the author wily limits her subject to mostly the socio-economic domain of the Western world, as is indicated in the book’s title. The picture would have been more complete if it had combined with surveillance authoritarianism. The “social credit” system practised unimpeded in China makes only passing reference in mere 6 pages (pgs. 388-394). Certainly, the threat to human liberty and dignity is far graver when the surveillance apparatus and capability are controlled by a police state, whereas in Western democracies competition among capitalists still exists. What is most infuriating is Zuboff’s penchant for fabricating catchphrases. Smug expressions such as “dispossession”, “behavioral futures”, “cultural misappropriation”, “economy of action”, “division of learning”, “shadow text”, “uncontract”, “hive”, “coup from above”, “Big Other”, “instrumentarian power”, “right to the future tense”, “third modernity*” …., litter throughout the book. The meanings of many of these are poorly articulated. Although she attempts to provide a brief rationale to her epithetic acrobatic (p. 66), such twisting of language is unnecessary and far from successful. It is an act of throwing spaghetti upon the wall; hoping that somehow one such phrase may stick with posterity with reference made to the author. As stated, the impression appears that the writer is more interested in weaving an esoteric narrative than presenting facts. Read a typical sentence on p. 488 of the book:“No exit” is the necessary condition for Big Other to flourish, and its flourishing is the necessary condition for all that is meant to follow: the tides of behavioral surplus and their transformation into revenue, the certainty that will meet every market player with guaranteed outcomes, the bypass of trust in favor of the uncontract’s radical indifference, the paradise of effortless connection that exploits the needs of harried second-modernity individuals and transforms their lives into the means to others’ ends, the plundering of the self, the extinction of autonomous moral judgment for the sake of frictionless control, the actuation and modification that quietly drains the will to will, the forfeit of your voice in the first person in favor of others’ plans, the destruction of the social relations and politics of the old and slow and still-unfulfilled ideals of self-determining citizens bound to the legitimate authority of democratic governance.” Long sentences can be beautiful in abler literary hands, but the above is downright egregious in form and meaning. Zuboff’s writing style can be aptly depicted as beating around the bush, with hyperboles and a plethora of inapt metaphors that ill befits so serious a subject she wants to convey. At times, she relishes so much staying with her metaphoric vehicles that the intended tenors are nowhere to be found. Long, winding sentences with chained substantives also further hamper readability.So, are readers more empowered at the end “with a more cogent and comprehensive understanding” (p. 18) of the menacing incursion exerted by the Big Techs? For the newly initiated, the writing style has done more to obfuscate than to illuminate. For the more inclined and those who look for some concrete societal antidotes, Zuboff has woefully under-delivered. More clear-eyed analyses are still awaited on the technologies proffered by the Big Techs, on the associated data-driven economy, and their consequent impacts to individuals and society at-large. * cf. Alan de Vulpian, 2003 (English , 2008)"

293,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4679583-myles,3,"This week my company officially got into the business of surveillance. People will pay us to surveil their home and business computers to protect them from rogue computer software, from losing data resulting from defective or aging components in their computers, and from misguided management of their computers themselves.Going forward this will be a growing and lucrative business segment because people rely on their computers to do so many important things for them, because they feel inadequate keeping up with changes in the computing environment, and because they justifiably fear cyber crime.It doesn’t mean they like it. I sure don’t.Being in retail business as I have for almost 25 years I have learned how to surveil myself, to protect my assets, and my employees. It is an ongoing challenge and it changes. I surveil for shoplifters, for currency and credit card counterfeiters, for daylight and after hours thieves. I surveil for dishonest employees, for honest mistakes, for poor buying decisions, and for the obsolescence of the products on my shelves. I surveil how the bank handles my money. I surveil my suppliers to prevent them from shipping me incomplete or broken goods. And I pay attention to my customers, to save them from making poor purchasing decisions.And when I am not surveilling, I am surveying. All the time. How were my customers’ experiences? What new products are on the horizon? How can I protect my liquidity, my profitability, and lastly, my sanity.I especially surveil myself, because I make mistakes, and because I too am growing old.These are some of the risks of operating a business.Then there are the people who surveil me. They include thieves looking for a weakness in my security. Government agencies to make sure I am paying the eight or ten different taxes I pay on an ongoing basis. Credit card companies surveil my transactions to make sure somebody hasn’t stolen my credit card, or that I am spending no more money than I can afford to pay back. My suppliers make sure I am paying them on time. Some manufacturers visit me in person or electronically to make sure I am representing their product lines fairly. They send me electronic training, and tests, and they regularly measure the efficiency and quality of our repair facilities. The utilities tell me when my operations (and home) are inefficient. And there are my landlords.Finally, we surveil at home. We surveil our daughter to make sure she is doing her homework and not falling in with the wrong crowd. My wife surveils me to make sure I’m not overeating, overspending, or being overly attentive to other women. I surveil my dog Seamus just in case he poops on the neighbour’s lawn so I can pick it up before someone notices. And Seamus surveils the front window and barks whenever a neighbouring dog saunters by. Last and not least are the gargantuan corporations who are watching what I do online. People like facebook, Google, amazon, and many, many more.So when somebody writes a book to tell me I live in an Age of Surveillance Capitalism...I GET IT! REALLY, I GET IT!But is it uniquely capitalist, or more generally an age of surveillance?And if it is more general to our society, where do we go from here?One thing for sure: it isn’t going away anytime soon.Shoshana Zuboff concentrates her guns on Google and facebook. She’s concerned that these companies are inherently different from the companies that came before it and they set a new standard for egregious capitalism. They are companies in the prediction business, predicting human behaviour and right now largely predicting purchasing behaviour by accumulating, as she called it, “surplus behaviour,” which kinda sounds like an oxymoron. She believes they abuse the freedoms of the marketplace to frustrate privacy, that they are built to enrich few and sidestep the traditional workplace which pays many employees fairly and creates consumers, and she argues that they are indifferent to social ills.She argues that Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” doesn’t operate in this marketplace because the new knowledge capitalists know everything happening in the market.A close reading of Andrew Carnegie’s life and legacy, perhaps John D. Rockefeller as well, could lead you to a similar conclusion, even though both men turned to philanthropy later in life. For sure, these men affected the course of capitalism.Is this a turn away from “good” capitalism toward an inherently evil capitalism?And if it is evil, can we create some rules for the big guys that us little guys can live with?Let’s take a step back and look at things in context: Google’s revenue is about $25 billion, Facebook’s $17 billion. The entire US economy is about $25 trillion and the world economy upwards of $107 trillion. Most of Google’s and Facebook’s revenue is advertising. The US advertising market is upwards of $80 billion so it is fair to say these two firms command quite strong positions in this industry. If you make the argument that America’s advertising industry is too concentrated then you’d have a pretty good argument to break up these firms which combined represent about 50% of all advertising dollars in the US. By comparison, Standard Oil at its peak commanded 88% of the market for processing crude. In its first year of operation, US Steel produced 67% of steel produced the the US.And they exhibit the classic behaviour of monopolists by dominating the markets for search and for social media on a global scale.In the US a case for breaking up the firms traditionally would have to be made that consumers are paying too much for their services or that competitors are being kept out of the market. Maybe breaking up these firms is a good idea, maybe it isn’t, but either way the technologies they employ for gathering, and analyzing, data isn’t going away.When I worked as an auditor, we used to gather lots of data, too, but what we eventually learned was that we could make assumptions about its meaning by sampling the information; that is, we cut down our work by only looking at some of the data. We tried to cut down on the wasted time. I sometimes wonder how much of what Google does is a total waste of time because the answers it seeks can be found in much faster time using much less data. And how much of “Big Data” is in fact a “Big Waste of Time.”Zuboff doesn’t consider that these firms may still be just in the early stages of figuring out what they are supposed to be doing. I think about it because so much time and resources are wasted paying attention to wholly irrelevant stuff.But we would do well to consider the affect of these companies on our freedoms and our government partially because they aren’t just national problems. They are transnational problems. What happens in China, and the extreme kind of surveillance practiced there on ethnic minorities like the Uigers, affects or will affect us here.They are transnational because the data collection is transnational and the very same data collected for the purpose of selling advertising is probably being used to develop artificial intelligence. The fastest developer of AI whether they be Chinese companies, transnational companies like Google or Facebook, or companies directly financed by government will have a big say in who has a job in the coming years and who doesn’t.No country on its own can hope to curb data collection and aggregation or perhaps more importantly, the control of what search results reveal on this scale any more than a country can curb money laundering, tax avoidance, or climate change without coordination between many if not all nations. Contemporary politics seems to be going in the opposite direction if Trump’s “America First,” Brexit, and Russian adventurism are any indication. If we are divided and our attention fractured we are susceptible to the influence or real or imagined “experts.” (To firms like Facebook I think we all have ADD, attention deficit disorder...they can never get enough of our attention!) That doesn’t mean we cannot continue to make decisions affecting our government, it more likely means that the decisions we make will more commonly resemble the imperatives of those desiring more of the same, read: the status quo.And that turns us to the question of how good is the status quo. If you believe that the universe ultimately bends toward the dilution of energy, total entropy, then the status quo is not too good. If you believe the status quo to be a teleological evolution toward a great singularity, perhaps a union with God, and a progression toward greater complexity in the universe, the status quo looks pretty good.Business executives, in my experience, tend to be of the more optimistic latter type of people. Like the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world and other people who have become incredibly wealthy in a short period of time.In the meantime, some of us have rather pedestrian concerns like the security of really private information. While convincingly arguing that there is insufficient transparency over who handles the big data and how they handle it, I think Zuboff fails to sufficiently weigh immense risk that the data will fall out of control of the aggregators and into the hands of rogue individuals.The hacking of credit card databases is one thing, and I think it a bigger risk than the hacking of a database which tells people how I like my hotdogs dressed. People made a big deal of the Cambridge Analytica scare. In the end, those people sold bogus claims to naive political organizations. The data predicted nothing and was of no use to anybody. And it didn’t get Donald Trump elected.Certainly big data aggregation has concrete effects on the economy. You get “free” Google searches. I get a cheaper smart TV because the data guys get first dibs on my TV watching preferences.This book is not the best guide for the good works these technologies enable (ie crowd sourcing, scientific research, epidemiology, etc). Self-driving cars benefit by machine learning. The acceleration and reductions in the friction in electronic commerce are generally good things.I don’t agree with Zuboff that the behavioural science behind the new data aggregation firms promotes a radical indifference to the lot of the common person. Nor do I agree that hyperscale doesn’t require competitive markets or for that matter democracy.This has yet to be proven.We all need participatory democracy, and more than ever on a global scale. Let’s make these damn machines work for us, not agin us."
294,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26854448-m-a,5,"This is a brilliant and important book about the future of mankind.It is unfortunately very difficult to read, due not only to the complexity of the subject matter, but also due to the constant use by the author of jargon and long complicated sentences. This is very ironic, considering that this book is intended as a warning and a call to action to the general public against the machinations of the Surveillance Capitalist elite. I can only hope that a more accessible version of this book will be published to accomplish that goal.Zuboff claims that surveillance capitalism is as big a change for our society as industrial capitalism was more than two centuries ago.It all started with Google, followed closely by Facebook, Microsoft and eventually by all digital industries.Google started collecting our private data (from our search terms on Google search, to our emails on Gmail, to our location data on Google Maps, our data stored on our Android devises etc..) without our knowledge or consent and turning them into predictions about our future behavior, which they sold for profit to marketers.Zuboff calls Google ""privacy kleptomaniacs"". She compares Google to the Spanish conquistadores invading the natives on the American continent and declaring the continent theirs by a monarchical edict declaring it so. So did Google invade our private data by declaring it theirs through obscure unilaterally imposed terms of service.She calls this data, the new raw material of capitalism ""Behavioral Surplus"".She traces the architecture of this new form of capitalism from its supply routes to its ""behavioral futures markets"".The production of digital data has far outpaced the human capacity to process/make sense of that data.Therefore, behavioral psychologists and data scientists have created algorithms to predict an individual's future behavior based on the billions of raw data of his/her every move and every thought.They use the 5 factor personality model, the 6 emotion model, affective computing, emotional analytics and sentiment analysis to predict our personalities and our future behavior.Surveillance Capitalists are prediction factories, based on raw materials from us.Google and co don't sell the raw data, they sell behavioral predictions based on that data.That information is not only useful to marketers, but to anyone with an interest in that knowledge and an interest in influencing that future behavior.Some examples of benefits of knowing a person's future behavior with very great accuracy include: predicting disease, financial risk, criminal risk, consumer preferences and political views. This knowledge about the future allows corporations to eliminate all risks in their business dealings.Zuboff calls this predictive data the ""shadow text"".This shadow text is only available to surveillance capitalists through their data extractions and algorithms.It is about us but not for us.Us being unaware of the surveillance is the precondition for surveillance capitalism to function properly- we are to remain unaware of the shadow text. Even if raw data are shared with us, the shadow data crafted for prediction purposes is not accessible to us.Remote digital observation and tele-stimulation ( the ""god view"") allows for distancing of the observed as ""the other"".Zuboff calls the Surveillance Capitalists the ""Big Other"".""The market reduces us to our behavior, transformed into another fictional commodity and packaged for others' consumption"" We are to be monitored and tele stimulated.Zuboff demonstrates how surveillance capitalism has expanded beyond cyberspace into our everyday life.Even the human body is treated as a computer, containing data in order to provide corporations certainty of profit.Take wearables for example: they form an unobtrusive integration to everyday life- internet connected fabrics, fitness trackers, diabetes apps etc.Zuboff quotes a study that shows that apps downloaded on a smart phone extract location data, contact lists, photos & videos etc without express consent of the user and that they sell this data to third parties.According to Zuboff, these companies' privacy policies should be called ""surveillance policies"".She predicts we will all end up with chips in our bodies for better surveillance, like animals. Telemetry is already used on animals to study their behavior. Humans will be next.We are already tracked in our cars, in our homes, in our kidneys (dialysis devices).By 2020, there will be 20 billion intelligent devices with the capability of tracking and monitoring us.Zuboff calls whatever data that is not yet tracked ""dark data"". Surveillance Capitalists are intent on tracking all behavior that is not (yet) informatized.They want to monetize every aspect of our lives, the entire human experience. They want to turn our entire life into profit for themselves.Power was once identified with the ownership of the means of production.Now power rests in the ownership of the means of behavioral prediction and behavioral modification of the other. Now our lives are turned into data without our knowledge or consent in order to benefit others.Zuboff explains how the system of Surveillance Capitalism is grounded in behavioral psychology.The goal of behaviorism is the prediction and control of behavior- the human being is nothing but an organism, an ""it"". According to behaviorists a human is in essence no different than a mushroom, only a bit more complex.Behaviorists (eg Skinner and Pentland) believe humans have no freedom of will, no autonomy, no agency. Freedom of will is an illusion. It is the environment that controls behavior. Individual behavior is caused by variables lying outside the individual himself.Hence the belief by behaviorists that behavioral control can lead to predicting future behavior with scientific accuracy. Behavior must be studied w/o limits and w/o knowledge of the ""organism"".Privacy is an illusion just like freedom- they must be forfeited in favor of the good life.BUT this view was meant to benefit all of humanity; the knowledge gained through behavioral tracking was to be used to improve human behavior towards a better future for humanity: fighting disease, crime, poverty etc..Instead, behaviorism has been hijacked by surveillance capitalism to benefit only the small class of surveillance capitalists and their customers. The lost freedom only affects us but the acquired knowledge and profit is all theirs.What are the dangers of Surveillance Capitalism?The more one knows about a person, the easier it is to control him.Besides being used for targeted marketing, knowledge of personal data can also be used to blackmail, defame, harass and discriminate against us.The dangers lie not only in corporate surveillance itself and the accompanying loss of privacy, but even more worrisome, in corporate mind manipulation and corporate behavioral modification, such as the creation of conformity and obedience but also the creation of desires that benefit commerce and emotions that benefit politicians. Surveillance capitalists wants ALL of you- your behavior, your thoughts, your emotions, your personality- so they can manipulate your behavior. Will you have any autonomy, any free will left? Surveillance Capitalism is not only a danger to privacy, but a danger to democracy which depends on autonomous moral judgment and individual determination and free will. Zuboff believes in free will as the basis for individuality, self determination, and the right to decide our future (She calls it ""The right to the future tense"").The right to be one's author of one's future should be cast as a human right-necessary because it is imperiled by ""the panvasive digital architecture of behavioral modification owned and operated by surveillance capital, necessitated by its economic imperatives and driven by its laws of motion, all for the sake of its guaranteed outcomes""Will Google, FB and co. lead to digital totalitarianism? According to Zuboff the answer is no, because the past offers no adequate compass for this new phenomenon.Zuboff calls the future of Surveillance Capitalism ""Instrumentarianism"".Totalitarianism, as impersonated by Hitler and Stalin was only understood after the facts. It entails the destruction of all human ties except total loyalty to the movement (fascism or communism). It operates through the means of violence, terror and fear- all who do not conform, the enemies of the ""people"", are executed.Instrumentarianism behaves through the means of behavioral modification.And, unlike in a totalitarian regime, there is no need to use force . All you need is adequate human engineering.""Instrumentarianism"" is a behaviorally controlled society, in which knowledge replaces freedom. In such a society, social change can be generated by social pressure from social networks to ""go with the flow, stay with the herd, return to the hive and take flight with the flock"". Identity yields to synchrony.Such a society leads to the death of individuality. The collective intelligence knows best and individuality is only unnecessary friction towards that goal.Instrumentarian society with its architecture of behavioral control, social pressure and asymmetrical power is a Panopticon - there is no exit possible.Once it was believed that there is no exit from an all knowing and all powerful God.Under Instrumentarianism, there will be no exit from the others, big other and the surveillance capitalists. Big Other knows no boundaries.Zuboff pleads for the right to sanctuary.It is a universal need for a safe refuge, for shelter.This right is as ancient as human history; originally it manifested itself in the form of a city, or a temple. Later on this right extended to the home: a sanctuary from arbitrary intrusion. Psychologists agree that this is important for development of the self and for mental health. With Big Other, the Universe takes up residence within our walls, there is no refuge. (thinkof internet connected security cameras, light switches, thermostats, appliances, rumbas, wearables,smart phones, tooth brushes, beds, personal assistants, TVs, toys,etc etc).What solution does Zuboff propose to avert the coming Instrumentarian Society?To just stop using the internet and internet connected devices?Surveillance Capitalists offer solutions to social connection, access to information, time saving convenience and ""illusionary"" support and this got us all addicted. It is not reasonable to expect us to go off the grid.Privacy regulation and monopoly regulation is inefficient at combating those risks- it will not be solved by encryption, anonymization or discussion of data ownership. This is a new condition that outruns the law, that has not been tamed by law. Zuboff discusses very briefly the new regulatory regime operating in the EU since May 2018, the GDPR ( General Data Protection Regulation). The GDPR is a good step forward, but only time will tell if it will be efficient in vanquishing surveillance capitalism's instrumentarian power. The individual is powerless against the surveillance capitalist machine because of asymmetrical power and knowledge. Only collective action on the ground, such as class actions, will determine if GDPR will be effective.Regulators will be up against well funded corporate lawyers and lobbyists.Zuboff concludes that Surveillance Capitalism is profoundly anti democratic. It is a market coup from above on the people. It is a form of tyranny, of absolutism; it imposes its rules from above; everyone except the tyrant is just an organism, the ""other one"", to be exploited for the profit of the tyrant.Industrial revolution has led to near destruction of our planet and extinction of many species. Instrumentarianism will lead to extinction of our individuality.Zuboff points to the critical role of public opinion on changing the laws. She proclaims passionately:It is NOT ok to strip search us for profit.It is a human expectation to be the author of one's life.There is still time to redirect the action to a future that we can call home.It is our responsibility to right was has gone wrong.We have to be indignant because this is an attack on human dignity.Freedom from uncertainty is no freedom.She refuses to seed the future to illegitimate power.She demands a human future.She calls the world to action to declare the digital future to be a human future."
295,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42693079-ryan-o-neill,4,"This ambitious and expansive book aims to define and explain the rise of surveillance capitalists like Google, Facebook and Microsoft as they play ever larger roles in our lives. Shoshana Zuboff briefly maps out the history of some of these companies and delves into the way in which they gradually encroach on our lives in ever more frightening ways.She argues persuasively that while sometimes driven by old capitalist imperatives, these companies represent a break from past eras such as that of industrial capitalism as they secretly and aggressively gather increasing amounts of personal information from us, but not for our benefit; rather than the traditional business-customer reciprocities, surveillance capitalists plunder every element of our lives, both online and offline, for the benefit of advertisers, and ultimately serve their economic benefit.Under surveillance capitalism, we are no longer the customers (although practices are often disguised under the auspices of 'personalisation') but rather our searches, browsing history, friends, likes, reactions, emotions and feelings are raw materials to be scraped for the benefit of companies who are free to operate outside the boundaries of traditional democracy and regulation. Our rights are ruthlessly and carelessly cast aside and rendered obsolete in this relentless pursuit of behavioural surplus without which surveillance capitalists cannot grow.These companies encroach upon our personal space in ever more intrusive ways - from the original Google Street View controversy in the mid-2000s to Facebook's hidden methods of gleaning info on our preferences, to TVs that listen to you, wearable devices, Alexa house alarms and even toys that listen to you, to the fight for our car dashboards. The speed and aggression is such that after initial outrage, we are worn down, helpless and numbed, resigned to our fate.Surveillance capitalism, Zuboff argues, attempts to create certainty of outcome for its actual customers - its advertisers. This is done by parsing human behaviour, exploiting feelings, emotions and beliefs even when we don't permit it to, so that our individual freedom, our rights to define our own experience, and to act and think in private are eroded as we are continuously moulded and directed towards specific courses of action by these companies. The inherent uncertainty that exists within how we think, how we act and interact - our right to an effective life - is replaced by collective certainty at the hands of surveillance capitalism.Zuboff also mines the effects of social media on young people's development. As they journey from being defined by their relationships at a young age to becoming separate from but connected to others in adulthood, young people are adversely affected by social media and its imperatives to forcing people to see themselves 'from the outside in' and define themselves based on the experiences and lives of others. The pervasiveness of social media means people often struggle to disconnect, their mental health even suffering from brief separation from their accounts. This crucially and savagely inhibits their ability to look inward and make that journey from people defined by their relationships in youth, to autonomous individuals who have relationships in adulthood.Zuboff argues that while the advent of new laws such as GDPR in Europe have been helpful, surveillance capitalism's overall success in evading proper regulation and legal scrutiny means that decisive action will depend on a turning of public opinion. Lots of us are passive about our distrust of social media, but it will take a re-establishment of indignation, a renewal of outrage, if we are to have any chance of stemming the flow.The book is a heavy undertaking; more than 500 pages long and often written in rather academic prose, and it can occasionally be quite dense and abstract. Given the ubiquity of technology in all of our lives, it could undoubtedly be more reader-friendly, and perhaps focus on more real-life examples that we are all familiar with. Despite its wealth of information, Xuboff's proposed solutions are vague, and it is arguably unclear what exactly you as an individual can do personally to reduce the insidious influence of surveillance capitalism in your everyday life; what strategies can be used to repell Facebook from building a strong profile based on your preferences, for example? Is there a feasible path to effective life without being on Facebook?Furthermore, it would have been helpful to have some more analysis on the gathering of information not related to economics - the how and why of information kept either by governments or corporations on citizens for reasons not linked to monetary benefits.Nevertheless, this is a hugely informative, well researched and important book on a subject which, as the author herself notes, is a story still unfolding and which still has some way to run. It's likely that many updates and more reader-friendly analyses on surveillance capitalism will follow, but this is a fantastic launch-pad for one of the defining issues of our time."
296,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45700308-tanmay-srivastava,1,"Shoshana Zuboff's book was highly recommended, was part of multiple lists and had glowing reviews on Goodreads. I was quite excited to pick it up and start reading.  Without calling it out, Zuboff treats incremental technological progress as a zero sum game. A win for the tech companies is a loss to someone. Take, for example when Zuboff talks about connected cars . She says an insurance company can stall a car if the premiums are not paid. She beats up this argument and brings up a case of how an elderly couple had to choose between car payments and medicine, which came to light only when the collection officers turned up at the door. A crowdfunding campaign was launched to help them and it had a happy ending. Using software however would have meant that this would have never happened. She fails to recognize that her example is the exception and not the norm. She chooses to ignore the positive impact connected cars would have on say, cars getting stolen going down leading to lower premiums or reduced premiums for drivers using their cars less or rewarding good drivers by reducing their premiums. Maybe, with such technological advances premiums would fall to such an extent that the couple wouldn't have to worry about premium payments altogether? She fails to acknowledge that progress is not a zero sum game. Tech companies have been bashed quite a bit through the book. There is no nod of appreciation for the positive impact they have had on societies. Here, In India - products of these tech companies are helping small businesses make moves that wouldn't have been possible before. Expensive POS Machines have been skipped (the same way how landlines didn't make it to parts of India but mobile phones did) in favor of Google Pay (QR Codes for Bank to Bank transfers). Book keeping doesn't required expensive licenses and can be managed online. Whatsapp is used to sell/communicate/deliver orders. YouTube is a learning platform for many, and a medium for news outside of the traditional media. The jobs these tech companies have created in India, directly and indirectly, also cannot be overlooked. There's a section where Zuboff talks about fake news and its impact on Brexit and the 2016 US Election. While I do agree fake news is a very big issue, the issue of voter discretion cannot be overlooked. In Zadie Smith's essay on Brexit -  ""Fences""  she writes how someone voted one way in referendum to get rid of the health secretary. Would it have been different if it was not targeted to a particular group (via the likes of Cambridge Analytica)? Would the results of Brexit and the 2016 US Election have been the same if there was no Facebook? Are we giving these incidents more importance than they deserve? ""Who knows?"" - I don't. I don't think we can ever conclusively state yes or no. The biggest issue is that a lot of topics covered in the book are in the grey area. Is it okay to give someone hungry a burger from McDonald's? The burger will make sure that they don't go hungry, but it's not a healthy meal. Can they afford to have a healthy meal? Can they stay hungry? Is there a way to grow healthy food to feed everyone? Is there a way to make everyone want/enjoy the healthy food? This sort of reasoning should have been the core of the book. You cannot do without technology companies today. Google, Microsoft, Facebook are essential parts of our day to day lives. Is there a business model where these companies can make enough money to create products that add value without compromising on data to drive revenue? Is there a market for people to pay for their services without any data getting collected? Do people bother to dig deep in their account settings to switch off optional data collection? Do people care? I feel the book is not asking the right questions needed to drive policy discussions. Data privacy is an important topic. The book is well researched in parts but jumps into pages of wishful thinking. The conclusions drawn are biased. The facts are presented in a way to scare you, and similar to how likes are garnered on social media with scary/angry posts, this book has scared people into giving it 5 stars on Goodreads. I wish this book was not one sided as it was - Not recommended."
297,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27470888-cool-breeze,1,"The subject of this book is very important. Unfortunately, this book fails miserably at contributing anything useful to the discussion. It is mind-numbingly long at 691 pages and an ordeal to read. Zuboff takes a few observations on surveillance technology issues and uses pretentious academic jargon to fluff them into this execrable doorstop of a book. The book does not offer any practical solutions to the issues she raises. A good editor could have reduced this to a pamphlet or a web article without leaving much notable out.This is possibly the worst non-fiction book I have ever read. I dreaded resuming it every time I picked it up and finally abandoned it on page 158. If I should ever be stuck on a desert island with only this book for reading material, I will be thankful at least that I have an abundant supply of toilet paper.Zuboff is a sociologist and the language she employs is tortured and tedious in the extreme. She insists on coining lots of neologisms and wallowing in her jargon. Amusingly, her favorite term is Behavioral Surplus, or BS for short. The book could have saved countless pages if she reduced a lot of her BS to abbreviations. Perhaps such Heideggerian writing impresses her academic colleagues, but it is excruciating for the average reader. She beats her core points to death – within the first 100 pages she must have repeated some version of the following point dozens of times – ‘the user isn’t the customer, nor are they the product, they are the raw material that is used to create the product’. You could have cut many more pages by limiting this point to three repetitions. It is as if she thinks her readers are idiots, or else she has dementia and doesn’t remember what she wrote a page or two ago. Even worse, Zuboff is a Luddite and a hard-core leftist. She obviously thinks the Industrial Revolution was largely a disaster. On page 11, she writes “industrial civilization… threatens to cost us the earth”. By page 12, she is hyperventilating “The industrial legacy of climate chaos fills us with dismay, remorse and fear”. No, it doesn’t. The reason Trump is President and the US has repudiated stupid climate treaties is that so many American voters think this is a non-issue or a very low priority (#18 out of 19 in a recent survey). On page 22, she writes that she has been inspired by a rogues' gallery of leftists, including Karl Marx, Theodor Adorno, Jean-Paul Sartre and Thomas Piketty (Robert Reich and Rachel Carson, who is responsible for millions of deaths, are also mentioned favorably). On page 33, she likens her great-grandparents fleeing the oppression of 1908 Russia to the oppression of the nuclear family (you poor, fragile snowflake!). On page 38 she viciously criticizes Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, although she admits their policies pulled the country out of the stagflation and “malaise” of the Jimmy Carter years. Unbelievably, Zuboff apparently thinks airline deregulation was a bad thing. On page 42, she is writes approvingly of rioters in London (she really should read some Theodore Dalrymple on the real problems involved) and the dilettante, astroturf Occupy “movement”. On page 43, she comments disapprovingly on those who would “pare regulations, cut taxes… and shrink entitlements”. Heaven forbid that anyone should want to take an ax to the leviathan state! By page 109, she is bemoaning the Supreme Court’s rejection of restrictions on political speech, “hate speech” (meaning anything she and her politically correct brethren disagree with), pornography (yeah, she’s puritanical as well as a Luddite) and free association. What a pinch-faced scold!Only at this point does she admit that her arch-villain, Google, has been totally in bed with the left-wing Obama administration, using their surveillance technology to mastermind his two Presidential campaigns and running a revolving door operation with 258 employees moving between Google and the Obama regime. Whoops! How inconvenient! It’s almost like leftism and this creepy surveillance technology go hand in hand! Curiously, in a 691-page book, the word “Clinton” does not appear even once in the 26-page index! I wonder who was President from 1996 to 2001, Google’s first five years? Or who was Hillary’s biggest corporate campaign contributor? It is a complete mystery, according to this book. Zuboff doesn’t actually appear to be a Clinton fan, so maybe she just doesn’t want to wind up adding to the Arkancide body count like Jeffrey Epstein.Zuboff must have felt terrible about documenting the extent of Obama’s collusion with Google’s abuses, because within a few pages she is back to bashing mainstream conservative organizations such as the Federalist Society, Heritage Action, Americans for Tax Reform and the Cato Institute as “Far Right”. Anyone to the right of Marx, Lenin and Mao is apparently “Far Right” to Zuboff.Chapter 5 elaborates Googles expanding abuses from 2009-2016. The Europeans attempt some pushback, but the US is feckless or oblivious. Just who controlled the government that was supposed to be preventing such abuses during this time? Zuboff couldn’t possibly guess, even if you spotted her an O, B and M. During this period, Zuboff’s Harvard Business School colleagues ride to the defense of Yelp, perhaps the only tech company more loathsome than Google.Strangely, Zuboff admits there were a number of potentially effective policy fixes being seriously considered in the years before 9/11. Why not revive those ideas and build a political coalition of like-minded classical-liberals, libertarians, small-government conservatives and Trump supporters (the tech giants being no friends of Trump) to implement them? She points out that the national security agencies are obstacles. Well, after Brennan, Comey, Holder and Lynch, a lot of people on the right need no further persuasion that the FBI, CIA and the rest of the Deep State are utterly corrupt rogue agencies. Zuboff doesn’t appear to consider this a possibility. I guess working with those icky right wingers is completely out of the question. Even worse, such allies are never going to go along with replacing the tech elite with the “benevolent” socialist dictatorship of Zuboff and her Harvard faculty elite. As it turns out, Zuboff’s problem is not so much with the creepy technology, it is that the creepy technology is not under the control of “enlightened” leftists like her and her comrades in academia and government.That was as much as I could take. I skimmed the book for any sign of practical solutions in the pages to come and, finding none, I abandoned the book on page 158.I agree with Zuboff that the tech giants represent a grave threat. However, if her prescription of more government and more socialism is the only alternative, I guess I will just have to find ways to live with it. The only thing worse than surveillance capitalism is surveillance statism run by socialist do-gooder “elites” like Zuboff, who always think they know better and want to engage in social engineering. Do you think the Chinese people would prefer annoying Google ads or their oppressive and ubiquitous social credit scores? The only people I would less like to see in control of this technology than Page, Brin and Zuckerberg are Zuboff and her comrades.In the nearer term, there are still practical steps one can take to mitigate the problem. Don’t use Google products. Use DuckDuckGo for search. Don’t use Gmail or Chrome. Use a good ad blocker, like AdBlockPlus on all devices. Don’t buy creepy surveillance technology like Nest, Ring or Alexa. Delete your Facebook account. Don’t use Twitter, it’s a surveillance sewer. Don’t buy from Amazon or use their products or services, especially the Washington Post. Don’t buy from Apple or use their products or services. Use Linux if that is viable for you or lock down you Windows privacy settings, if not. Check your app setting and cut them back to only those necessary to function. Don’t use non-essential apps like games, many of which are bad offenders.Support the breakup of the tech giants using antitrust laws. Support their prosecution for anti-competitive and anti-privacy violations. Having Page, Brin, Zuckerberg and Bezos doing some serious hard time would have a very salutary effect “pour encourager les autres”. Institute real and legally-binding privacy protections such as Zuboff mentions and dismisses. Yes, we will have to do it without the support of Zuboff and her comrades, but Trump’s upcoming second term could be a real opportunity to get this done (I think Zuboff’s head may have just exploded)."
298,1610395697,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65435043-alan-tennyson,5,"I pored over this book, stayed with the words. Read and reread them. Drank deeply from their wisdom.  It was not an easy read, but ultimately it gave far more than it took. The Age of Surveillance Capitalism is a seminal text for our age. Zuboff's account of surveillance capitalism is elegant, poised and persuasive. Yet for all her brilliance, Shonanna's central thesis suffers some fundamental flaws.  Where The Age is at it's strongest is in the articulation of surveillance capitalism. Consider this, 'Who owns your face?', 'Who owns your behaviour?' What you do, where you go, who you know, all this has value and extracting value from these data is the business model of the surveillance capitalist.  But this is only the description, where Zuboff's account takes a darker turn, is in control. Once Surveillance Capitalists have provided a description of you, the next logical step is to determine how much this description can be used to predict and control you. Zuboff's account of these processes is beautifully rendered in perfect proses.  Know thyself, unless you don't like what you find, then, deny thyself, and pretend you are other. Zuboff goes for the latter.  We are born of this place, this pale blue dot, we are natural phenomena. Yet despite these self-evident truths, many continue to advance the notion that we apes are exceptional.  We are somehow other than the mere organisms with whom we share our earth and almost our entire genetic structure. Zuboff takes issue with humans being described as 'mere organisms'.  She is caged by this ideology of human exceptionalism, and it weakens her thesis considerably.  There are sacred cows here, and sacred cows will invariably be slaughtered.  The first heifer into the meat factory is autonomy. Shoshana strips us of our relations, our context and connections. She exalts 'autonomy' but fails to grapple with the weakness of the presumptions it contains. This leads her to assert that humans are and ought to be autonomous.  But Zuboff fails to address that we are born free, but everywhere in chains. From the traffic light to the electric chair, we are already in a context that seeks to control our behaviour. What does she think education and justice are? If not systems of changing our behaviour? But it's more than this, it's a scientific reality, we are our contexts, our environment, they shape us as we shape them.  This is a reality that an insistence on 'Freedom' cannot wish away.   For me, the issue is not that we are organisms', we are.  It is not that we are miraculous rational deities, we are not.  We need to embrace our human frailty, stare it down since we are wiser for this knowledge.  Here again, Zuboff takes issues with what she calls the 'ideology of human frailty'.  Respectfully I would ask that we,  put down our pride and look hard in the mirror, human frailty is not an ideology, it is a fundamental truth. We are 'mere organisms' and to claim anything else is to cling to a pernicious ideology. An ideology that has prompted human dominion over earth and animals, and all the ecological genocide that follows."

In fact, in a time like this I wish there was a more complex rating system than 5 stars. I digress.This was, in many ways, the first of its kind. There have, in my view, yet to be too many intelligent take downs of the dangers of big data. There is,of course, a brief mentioning of the a similar subject in many other modern texts - but not to this degree.So, you ask, what the hell is surveillance capitalism. It is, a term coined by the author. She first presented the concept publicly in 2014, in an article, where she described it as such :""[surveillance capitalism is a] radically dissembled and extractive variant of information capitalism"" based on the commodification of ""reality"" and its transformation into behavioral data for analysis and sales""*---- IN this book she presents the story of how it is that we have gotten to such a point in history, where the sentence in her 2014 article could even be spoken. In this she gives a small run down of facebook and google, and explains the origins of these sights in relation to their users. User-ship on these web pages began without much craziness, but as we all know many pages which were once small e.g. facebook, google, and youtube have more or less all become huge power houses of influence. They have now followings in the billions. This is presently praised by these web pages as a good thing. Initially. well. The servers couldn't take it. There was too much damn data. And its all so useless.Or is it?It was, with this question, in the eyes of zuboff, that this form of capitalism** was born. The data not only need not be an annoyance, but it could be a pathway towards making money. 'Perhaps', these tech giants thought 'we could predict the users behaviors by paying attention to the patterns in data'. Alas. we are truly all creatures of habit. Long story short. A great deal of people in the industrial world are using certain pages on the internet in ways that are useful for targeting for sales. This of course can eventually be sold to governments blah blah blah. Ask yourself. are you ok with people predicting your behaviors to increase user experience? What about to protect you? What about to just watch you?These are questions the book will make you reflect on.Overall, I think this was one of the most apropos books I have read in awhile towards understanding some issues in modernity.86/100 stars.Recommended for:Those thinking about big data in its prediction of human behaviorthose who dont trust facebook and googlethose worried about internet privacythose thinking about the future path of society*Hey guess what. IM gonna source wikipedia :https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveil...**Call me a peasant or an uneducated bafoon. I think the word capitalism is hardly ever used where it should be. Perhaps im wrong."
