0,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/951046-john,4,"I don't remember now why I came to read something by Freeman Dyson. But something compelled me to consider his writings, so the next time I was in the library at BYU I checked out two of his books, this one and Infinite in All Directions. So far I have not been disappointed.Disturbing the Universe is largely autobiographical, describing much of Dyson's beliefs and discoveries in the context of his life's journey. I was impressed by his fantastic views of the future. For instance he has proposed that ""One should expect that, within a few thousand years of its entering the stage of industrial development, any intelligent species should be found occupying an artificial biosphere which completely surrounds its parent star."" This vision of the future (for us) and the possible present (in distant galaxies) has been called a Dyson Sphere. He also imagines, ""...a solar energy system based upon green technology, after we have learned to read and write the language of DNA so that we can reprogram the growth and metabolism of a tree. All that is visible above ground is a valley filled with redwood trees, as quiet and shady as the Muir Woods below Mount Tamalpais in California. These trees do not grow as fast as natural redwoods. Instead of mainly synthesizing cellulose, their cells make pure alcohol or octane or whatever other chemical we find convenient. While their sap rises through one set of vessels, the fuel that they synthesize flows downward through another set of vessels into their roots. Underground, the roots form a living network of pipelines transporting fuel down the valley. The living pipelines connect at widely separated points to a nonliving pipeline that takes the fuel out of the valley to wherever it is needed. When we have mastered the technology of reprogramming trees, we shall be able to grow such plantations wherever there is land that can support natural forests. ... Once the plantations are grown, they may be permanent and self-repairing, needing only the normal attentions of a forester to keep them healthy."" This future foliage is not surprisingly called a Dyson tree. Dyson's view of the future is refreshingly optimistic.I found Dyson's prose to be very readable. He is a scientist and presumably writes scientific papers in dense scientific language, but for this book he writes like a novelist. He is very even-handed in his treatment of the social, political, and scientific issues he discusses. I found the whole book to be interesting and entertaining.One of the last things I expected from this book was a spiritual uplift, yet there it was in the latter chapters. In particular I was moved by his last few paragraphs. He had mentioned the biblical Elijah's experience with the Lord not being in the wind or in the earthquake or in the fire, but then hearing a still small voice (1 Kings 19:11-13). Dyson wrote that he had not heard the still small voice, but later he writes, ""The still small voice comes to me, as it came to Elijah, unexpectedly...""I am sitting in the kitchen at home in America, having lunch with my wife and children. I am grumbling as usual about the bureaucracy. For years we have been complaining to lower-level officials and there has never been any response. 'Why don't you go straight to the top?' says my wife. 'If I were you I would just telephone the head office.' I pick up the phone and dial the number. This comes as a big surprise to the children. They know how much I hate telephoning, and they like to tease me about it. Usually I will make all kinds of excuses to avoid making a call, especially when it is to somebody I don't know personally. But this time I take the plunge without hesitation. The children sit silent, robbed of their chance to make fun of my telephone phobia. To my amazement, the secretary answers at once in a friendly voice and asks what I want. I say I would like an appointment. She says, 'Good,. I have put you down for today at five.' I say, 'May I bring the children?' She says, 'Of course.' As I put down the phone I realize with a shock that we have ony an hour to get ourselves ready.""I ask the children if they want to come. I tell them we are going to talk to God and they had better behave themselves. Only the two younger girls are interested. I am glad not to have the whole crowd on my hands. So we say goodbye to the others quickly, before they have time to change their minds. It is just the three of us. We slip out of the house quietly and walk into town to the office.""The office is a large building. The inside of it looks like a church, but there is no ceiling. When we look up, we see that the building disappears into the distance like an elevator shaft. We hold hands and jump off the ground and go up the shaft. I look at my watch and see that we have only a few minutes left before five o'clock. Luckily, we are going up fast, and it looks as if we shall be in time for our appointment. Just as the watch says five, we arrive at the top of the shaft and walk out into an enormous throne room. The room has whitewashed walls and heavy black oak beams. Facing us at the end of the room is a flight of steps with the throne at the top. The throne is a huge wooden affair with wicker back and sides. I walk slowly toward it, with the two girls following behind. They are a little nervous, and so am I. It seems there is nobody here. I look at my watch again. Probably God did not expect us to be so punctual. We stand at the foot of the steps, waiting for something to happen.""Nothing happens. After a few minutes I decide to climb the steps and have a closer look at the throne. The girls are shy and stay at the bottom. I walk up until my eyes are level with the seat. I see then that the throne is not empty after all. There is a three-month-old baby lying on the seat and smiling at me. I pick him up and show him to the girls. They run up the steps and take turns carrying him. After they give him back to me, I stay with him for a few minutes longer, holding him in my arms without saying a word. In the silence I gradually become aware that the questions I had intended to raise with him have been answered. I put him gently back on his throne and say goodbye. The girls hold my hands and we walk down the steps together.""This is the end of the book. I don't know whether what he related was a dream or just from his imagination, but it moved me greatly. If you like any of the extensive quotes I've given, you should read this book. You won't regret it."
1,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113906-jee-koh,4,"On hearing that I am working on a book of essays, WL lent me Freeman Dyson's Disturbing the Universe. He was a professor of physics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. ""Born in England,"" the biographical note continues, "" he came over to Cornell University in 1947 as a Commonwealth Fellow and settled permanently in the U.S. in 1951."" A summary of his career, the next paragraph also indicates the topics of his essays: ""Professor Dyson is not only a theoretical physicist; his career has spanned a large variety of practical concerns. His is a unique career inspired by direct involvement with the most pressing concerns of human life, minimizing loss of life in war, to disarmament, to thought experiments on the expansion of our frontiers into the galaxies."" From his essays, it is clear that Dyson is that rare thing, a man deeply passionate about both science and literature. His essays make reference to Goethe's Faust, Auden and Isherwood's The Ascent of F6, H. G. Wells's The Island of Doctor Moreau, John Milton's great defense of press freedom Areopagitica. The title of the book comes from T. S. Eliot's poem ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock."" The first essay ""The Magic City,"" my favorite of the book, is a meditation on the frightening pertinence of Edith Nesbit's children's story of the same name to the abuse of science in our contemporary world. Dyson himself is a very good writer, lucid and graceful. The force of the writing comes not only from style, however, but also from the moral discrimination that Dyson wields in confronting his life and the world's problems. He blamed himself for not taking any action though he knew as a civilian statistician at the Research Division that the Allies' strategic bombing of German cities in the last years of WWII was not only unconscionable but also ineffective and lethal only to the lives of RAF pilots. He made the interesting argument that it was the Americans' success at firebombing Tokyo that paved the way to the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima. Having built up a Strategic Bombing Command at great cost, the Allies were almost bound to use it. In another fine essay, ""The Blood of a Poet,"" Dyson paid a heartfelt tribute to his Winchester schoolfriend Frank Thompson whose intelligence and liveliness marked him out as a leader of men. He was a poet too. He joined the Communist Party and enlisted in the war from the start in 1939. While playing the dangerous role of the Allies' liaison with Bulgarian partisans, he was captured and executed by the Fascists, but not before giving his audience their common sign of liberty, a salute with a clenched fist, and thus inspiring the men captured with him to do the same and march to their deaths with heads held high.The other portraits in this book are of his fellow physicists at Cornell and Princeton. Dick Feynman and his intuitions. His opposite, Julian Schwinger and his mathematical equations. The mercurial arrogance of Robert Oppenheimer. The humanity of Hans Bethe. Dyson contrasts the egotism of the physicists with the cooperative spirit of the engineers. He also astutely observes how all the Los Alamos alumni spoke nostalgically of the A-bomb project as a time of thrilling camaraderie. He is clear about the constant temptation facing scientists of treating all questions, even those with vast moral consequences, as merely technical questions. He humanizes the public perception of Edward Teller, who spoke against Oppenheimer at the latter's security hearings. The scientists, all intellectual giants, are shown to be human and fallible. The portraits, however, are not malicious. They are suffused with affection and admiration. Dyson is not therefore blind to faults. The last section of the book, which takes up the subjects of space exploration and extra-terrestrials, is less interesting to me than the two earlier sections, ""England"" and ""America."" Someone of a more speculative cast of mind will enjoy these essays. When Dyson shades into mysticism in the last essay, finding a Mind behind the mind at work in making quantum observations, and the mind beyond brain cells and synapses, he loses me. "
2,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974210-erik-graff,4,"I first encountered the author by references to ""Dyson Spheres""--an idea which he credits to Olaf Stapledon's Star Maker--in various books and by his having provided a foreword to a science fiction novel I'd read. Then, more recently, going through about twenty years of back issues of the New York Review of Books, I found that many of the best science reviews were by him. This led me to pick up his pseudo-autobiography when encountering it at the Evanston Library booksale room a couple of days ago.I call this a pseudo-autobiography because it was published as a volume in a series of books designed to familiarize laypersons with modern physical sciences. The authors, all prominent scientists, could pretty much do what they wanted and Dyson chose--as he does in many of his NY Review articles--to mix personal anecdotes and a rough chronology of his life with snippets about the very diverse kinds of scientific work he has engaged in. This work has ranged from mathematics, to theoretical physics, to astrophysics, to nuclear technology, to cybernetics etc. Then, canibalizing from other publications, he ends the whole with some scientific prognostications. If it weren't for the fact that some of the patchwork assemblage towards the book's end doesn't fit seamlessly I'd give this book five stars. The first half of it, the most autobiographical portion, is of a piece and very well written, even quite moving, particularly when he mixes anecdote and poetry to make an ethical point."
3,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/655723-nick-black,5,"Amazon 2008-06-10. Having recently realized the multilayered magnificence of Dyson's  The Scientist as Rebel, I'm determined to read the man's extent.Dear lord, Freeman Dyson is becoming a massive hero. The man simply doesn't write a lacking page, and knows....so much. In my reading, I've found my incidental similars in Robert Oppenheimer and John von Neumann; if I were to pattern myself after anyone, it would be Mr. Dyson. I don't know anything so uplifting and wonderful.This book is so, so awesome thus far. I've cried numerous times, laughed, raised my clenched fist in salute, and smoked many cigarettes pacing my front yard's circumference with  Disturbing the Universe. I've had it only since getting home from work, but it's already become a critical part of me -- I hope."
4,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105482-ari,5,"Dyson is a brilliant scientist and a born contrarian. He also writes with depth and beauty. This book is one part memoir, one part reflection on science and society, one part speculation about nature. Despite being some decades old. the book feels fresh, and most of it is still exactly as relevant as when it was written.Here is one passage that I especially liked. It describes a part of my feeling about science that I had never seen described before: ""Much of the joy of science is is the joy of solid work done by skilled workers. Many of us are happy to spend our lives in collaborative efforts where to be reliable is more important than to be original. There is great satisfaction in building good tools for other people to use. We do not all have the talent or ambition to become prima donnas. The essential factor which keeps the scientific enterprise healthy is a shared respect for quality. Everybody can take pride in the quality of his own work, and we expect rough treatment from our colleagues whenever we produce something shoddy. The knowledge that quality counts makes even routine tasks rewarding.""One of the main social divisions in postwar American science is how people felt about Oppenheimer and the hydrogen bomb, and this shows up in just about every memoir or biography from the period. Teller, Alvarez, von Neumann and Lawrence were in favor of the super, and distrustful of Oppenheimer. Most of the rest of the community was loyal to Oppenheimer, skeptical of the super, and furious at Teller. Dyson, being a contrarian, somehow managed to stay friends with Teller while also respectful to Oppenheimer and skeptical of the bomb. "
5,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11725563-john-folk-williams,4,"Contains many of Dyson's classic essays from the 1970s about humanity's search for extraterrestrials and visions of a future greening of the galaxy. There are also essays about his life, his work as a physicist, but the brilliance of the essays lies in weaving all his varied experience together in highly readable prose.More about this book at SciFi Mind."
6,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7751872-gaurav,4,"Several years ago, I read Feynman's Pleasure of finding things out, with a foreword from Freeman Dyson. In merely a page and half, he seemed to have captured the essence of Feynman, and with such beauty. Ever since I wanted to read more from Dyson.About the book: The central theme of ""Disturbing the Universe"" is the ethical responsibility that is often associated with the development of science and technology, whether it be related to nuclear power and weapons, space exploration, power generation, or gene editing. To quote the author, ""It makes no sense to separate science from technology, technology from ethics, or ethics from religion"".What I like: The book is written as a mixture of memoirs, autobiographical accounts, and the author's vision for the future of technology and space exploration. It is written in a very simple and direct manner. What I love, above all, is that throughout the book Freeman Dyson references history, arts, and literature (stories, poems) to compare and complement the subject matter, giving the book a subtle poetic tone."

8,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5685608-john-jr,5,"Some thoughts in lieu of a genuine, full-fledged review; I read the book too long ago to have a complete recollection.If, within the field of science, the terms ""great thinker"" or ""genius"" evoke for you no one other than Albert Einstein and perhaps Stephen Hawking, reading this book will reveal another to you. Unlike some great thinkers, Dyson is also not merely a capable writer but an admirable stylist, who is equally at ease in recounting personal history and in discussing science, arguing military and political strategy where weapons are concerned, or speculating about a future in space.Three randomly chosen elements of this book that made a mark on me:1) Dyson discusses what should've been a simple design issue with the Lancaster bomber--if a hatch were widened, the emergency exit of aircrew during WWII bombing raids would've been easier, probably saving lives. (As I recall, the hatch was big enough for a man but not a man already wearing a parachute.) But the peculiar British inflexibility in military thinking blocked this as well as another potential improvement.2) Dyson recounts his thinking on the 1986 disarmament talks between Reagan and Gorbachev in Reykjavik, Iceland, in which the possibility of total bilateral nuclear disarmament stalled over a quibble about Reagan's SDI (the so-called ""Star Wars"" missile-defense system). Reasonable minds have differed on this outcome, but Dyson's arguments left me in no doubt that the agreement that didn't happen would've been preferable and that Reagan more than Gorbachev was responsible for the failure.3) As part of a broader treatment of the possibilities for human life in space, Dyson engages in some estimates of the costs of two privately funded colonization efforts from the past--the Mayflower pilgrims and the Mormon pioneers who settled Utah--and supposes that homesteading the asteroids might be feasible on the same privately funded basis, and even at roughly the same cost in man-years of income per family as the Mayflower expedition.In light of number three, I can't help wondering whether the cost calculations today would be different, and also whether any of the buccaneer capitalists who are developing ways for the wealthy to take short thrill rides into space are also thinking farther ahead. If they aren't, someone should be. As Stephen Hawking has argued, our current planet may become less habitable over time (just as Hawking's body has done); it'd be smart for us to consider other places to live."
9,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/130068-scott,5,"My wife received this book in the mail from a Hungarian Anthropologist working in Australia. She respects him for his knowledge and success. He sent it to her because he said it was an insightful read. We have had it sitting around for a few years and she has been too busy to read it. I have lugged it around from the US, England, Hungary and now Grenada. I tried to start it once but it was awkward to hold and with two pages being on one and being bound on the short side of the paper. Now I said I was going to get into it and finish it, and that's precisely what I did. It is a book that covers most of the man's fascinating lifetime and highlighting the most prominent and interesting thoughts, projects and people that Freeman Dyson came across. He epitomized my thirst for knowledge and understanding of the world. By teaching himself differential equations as a youth in Winchester to trying to understand England's obsession with history. I was also introduced to the work ""The Magic City"" and the visions of its author for future dilemmas. He also delved into Faust. His ""matter of factness"" when discussing these amazing topics and ideas made them not seem to unattainable, and made me want to delve into these overwhelming thinkers and their understanding of the world. He goes on to talk about his amazing work as a physicist at Cornell, Princeton and many other universities. His work with the Los Alamos group is particularly intriguing. I don't want to give away the whole book, but I will highlight some interesting topics: World Defense, Nuclear Disarmament, The Island of Doctor Moreau, cloning, Thought experiments, UFO's, Space Exploration/Colonization and of course God and the Argument for Design. Inspirational and thought provoking. If I were a teacher I would make this required reading regardless of the course."
10,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10481632-joseph,5,"I'll admit I knew little of Freeman Dyson until hearing him interviewed on one of my favorite podcasts. Based on that interview, I made it a point to read this book. A physicist, astronomer, and mathematician, Dyson shows himself to be more of a deep thinker and man of letters than one might normally (and therefore narrow-mindedly, I might add) expect from a scientist with ties to Robert Oppenheimer, Edward Teller, and Los Alamos. With all that is happening today at the Fukushima nuclear power facility, Dyson's message regarding the human impact of technology - written in 1979 - is chillingly prescient."
11,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20454189-al-maki,5,"Freeman Dyson is always worth reading. Extremely intelligent (a nuclear physicist), articulate, critical of his own thinking and others, unpretentious and humane. He started his career during WWII and wrote an interesting book review published this week (60 years later on 2/20/14) in the NYRB. He also turned me on to E. Nesbit, another excellent mind. You should read this and anything else you can find by him."
12,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1597857-robert,4,"I enjoyed Freeman Dyson’s personal recollections in Disturbing the Universe (1979). He recounts one of those early encounters, this one between Szilard and Bethe:“The physicist Leo Szilard once announced to his friend Hans Bethe that he was thinking of keeping a diary: ‘I don’t intend to publish it; I am merely going to record the facts for the information of God.’ ‘Don’t you think God knows the facts?’ Bethe asked. ‘Yes,’ said Szilard. ‘He knows the facts, but He does not know this version of the facts.’”I quickly related to the technological aspects of his experiences, although, from the perspective of a community of engineers [1]. Dyson writes, “In our world, thousands of scientists play with millions of toys, but only a few of their toys grow big. The majority of technological ventures remain toys, of interest only to specialists and historians.” He adds, “A small number succeed spectacularly and become part of the fabric of our lives. Even with the advantage of hindsight it is difficult to understand why one technology is overwhelmingly successful and another is stillborn.” Most of us recognize the success of the toy we call the iPhone, while other toys, such as Microsoft’s Zune, a media player, never gained traction in the marketplace. In my experience I witnessed the success of SONET in optical transport [2] while its competing technology, Syntran (Synchronous Transmission), never caught fire. In another technological example, VHS tapes became popular while the competing BETA tape technology fizzled. In another recollection, Dyson offers a self-analysis, “I was, and have always remained, a problem solver rather than a creator of ideas. I cannot, as Bohr and Feynman did, sit for years with my whole mind concentrated upon one deep question.” Dyson explains, “I am interested in too many different things . . . I followed my destiny into pure mathematics, into nuclear engineering, into space technology and astronomy, solving problems that [Oppenheimer] rightly considered remote from the mainstream of physics.”Many of us are like Dyson. We chose to toil on many different projects in our work careers, and often, these assignments may stray from our field of education and training. Like Dyson, we enjoy solving problems and completing an assortment of projects. Check out his book. You’ll enjoying completing it.[1] See A World Perspective through 21st Century Eyes for more on the engineering perspective of the world. http://www.trafford.com/bookstore/boo...[2] For more on the power of SONET see The Upstart Startup: How Cement Transformed Cisco.https://www.createspace.com/5141130"
13,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28447822-kennyo,4,"More an anthology than memoir, Disturbing the Universe has been most a enjoyable read. Despite what the book description above states, this is most certainly not an autobiography, though there are biographical portions. Some chapters, essays, were written specifically for this book and some had been published previously in  The New Yorker. Dyson is a polymath; he is not an intellectual of a single, narrow focus. His work spans the astounding progress in physics through much of the twentieth century, working (often one-on-one) with many of the greater lights in the field. Although mathematics and science are his work and passion, literature, culture and the arts are touchstones, never far afield from his thoughts. His very human side, along with that of his luminary associates, is woven throughout. He offered a mea culpa for some of the work he did and for his defense of it. The man has a conscience. A theme of the book is that human actions have consequences. Dyson explores the actions and interprets probable consequences, moral, technical, cultural and political. His thoughts on clades and clones WRT language I’ve seen explored by others who came to similar conclusions. His is a particularly clear essay. Elsewhere he explores what I call “big ideas” that many people classify as science fiction. The notion of what we called the Dyson Sphere he credits to philosopher and science fiction author Olaf Stapledon; Dyson has considered the idea deeply enough and publicly enough that it acquired his name, though he wished it had not. This was written for a general audience and it need not be read as you would read a novel or a textbook. After the first few chapters’ laying of groundwork you could set it aside then come back later to read another chapter or two. You won’t be force fed mathematics or the sciences and knowledge of them is not needed to understand what Dyson says here. The goal is to help non-scientists gain some sense of what goes on in science work and learn a little about how they view the world and their work. He writes clearly and gracefully, at times conversationally. The final two chapters are the ones I most savor. They are Dyson in contemplation and they bring to my mind Bertrand Russell’s observation that, “The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts.” I don’t know why I took me so long to pick this up but I assure you that I’ll pick it up again. The book was first published through the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Public Understanding Program whose goal is stated by them as:“To support authors in the research and writing of a wide range of books aimed at public understanding of science and technology.”"
14,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44658719-james-giammona,5,"This is one of the most unique physicist autobiographies I've read and surprisingly related to my own life. Most importantly, I think Dyson is deeply honest and vulnerable about his true ideas and feelings about futility of war, the extent of consciousness, the threat of nuclear weapons, what a good long term future would look like and the way he weaved these observations and thoughts with poetry, music and theater worked very well. Dyson's first hand portraits of Feynman, Bethe, Teller, Oppenheimer, von Neumann and others are truly unique. Bethe was Dyson's advisor at Cornell. Dyson took a cross-country road trip with Feynman where he worked out how to mathematically formalize Feynman's path integral ideas. Oppenheimer was Dyson's boss at the Institute of Advanced Study. Dyson and Teller became lifelong friends. Dyson mentions von Neumann's work on self-replication and the idea of universal constructors which I hadn't fully understood before.Dyson was part of General Atomics in La Jolla and walked with Niels Bohr on the beaches of La Jolla Shores and launched scale models of nuclear bomb powered rockets off Point Loma! These revelations imbue my own hometown with so much more history and excitement in my eyes. His insights on the stifling effects of bureaucracy, the importance of play and excitement in research, his willingness to change his mind all really resonated with me. And of course, his clear thought experiments on the effectively unlimited value and power of self-replicating machines matched closely with my own views and were even better articulated.The end on the world soul and Cosmic Unity was a little hokey, but as a whole, this was just what I was looking for at just the right time."
15,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14075929-lucy,1,"This is a book I tried because it was lying around the house, not because I picked it out myself, so this review may be a little unfair.He lost me in the first two chapters. Really the first chapter, but I gave it another shot.I do like science a lot, but I think I'd much rather read a book on science, or listen to a lecture on science by Dyson than read this. This book is a physicist trying to do something an entertainer or writer usually does, and, while he does a good job of it, it's just not engaging enough.Especially the first chapter... he explains that his aim is partly biography, partly to show people how scientists look at the world, partly to recount stories of famous scientists, especially nuclear ones. In extreme long form. Peppered with sometimes fun, often tedious literary quotes.I'm just not a big enough fan of Dyson (may he rest in peace) or these other scientists to trudge through this book. Maybe if a lot of the chaff was removed and we got the barebones, best anecdotes, with nothing else.As for his other goal, I'm not really interested in some philosophical musings about science, scientists, nuclear technology etc. Kind of the opposite. Just give me the stories, I can make my own mind up thanks."
16,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30363107-mike-lisanke,3,"Interesting and discussion provoking... would be great for group discussion.OK, this book wasn't my cup of tea (as British say) ... I'm a Coffee drinker! :-pThis said, I think Dyson's autobiography goes a far way to enlighten us to his thinking. He tells many stories which provide insight into his interactions with the many science+tech luminary he routinely ran in to and worked with in many cases. Some of Dyson's stories I truly enjoyed reading (e.g. his trip to Canada with his son) But I found many to be like me reading a history book or historical novel... I never liked reading these (for unknown reason)... I do like to know and understand History and think it's very important for us all to do... so, I'm not certain why I always find it monotonous ... hmm.So, OK, while ""I"" didn't like Dyson's writing style for this book... I think many of You will and you'll get a bunch of useful insight in Dyson... who (also IMO) turns out to be quite a SJW fanatic too! Oh well, there's no accounting for aspirations of a strong central world government tell us how many children we can have if we still live on planet... is there? :-p"
17,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39391559-claus-brinker,4,"This is a memoir written in 1979 by a physicist/nuclear engineer/futurist consisting of three parts. The first is about his childhood and youth and England. The second and longest part is about his professional life in America. And the third is a series of connected essays that deal with the philosophy of science and the potential discoveries that we have in store for us. Much of the book deals with the Cold War and nuclear proliferation. Dyson does a lot of moralizing and he seems totally captive to a liberal democratic viewpoint that is somewhat tepid and at times seems contradictory to what he believes about science. Dyson's vision of the future was very ambitious and he imagined that we would be much further along than we are today. This slowness is in part due to the political system and ideals he advocates. I wonder if he still thinks the same way today, given the current state of the world. Still, this was a thought provoking read, in particular the last part."
18,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2161815-poetreehugger,4,"I have forgotten where I saw a recommendation to read something by Freeman Dyson; it may have been a suggestion to read his collected letters. But when I saw he had written a memoir, I decided to read this instead.I think fascinating is a good one word description of this book.You get a look at and a feel for the time and places he lived in, so it is very interesting in its historical story. He was a physicist, mathematician, and problem solver whose interests ranged across many varied fields of science, mathematics, philosophy, and the humanities.It’s a look back at the scientific and political world of the forties to the seventies, told in an interesting and mostly engaging style. The scientific explanations were clear and relatively easy to understand.I read a lot of fiction, but always keep one or two nonfiction books on the go. This was a very good choice for me; mind broadening."
19,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8776836-jocelyn,3,"I re-read this after a long interval (possibly 30 years or more) because I picked it off the shelf for a Facebook list. I forgot that it is a collection of essays forming a piece-wise memoir, with the gaps and repetitions that implies. The first couple are the best, with the memories of Dyson's formation as a mathematical physicist, and his experiences of Operations Research group in London in World War II. Later essays are weaker, because patchier, and displaying some of the arrogance of a top physicist in the 1950s. This book had a big influence on me, planting the idea of mathematical physics as an aspiration, showing how finely-tuned the universe is for life, as well as other ideas. Dyson was a nuclear enthusiast with dreams of space colonisation, which was fun then for a reader of Asimov and Heinlein, but looks naive and hubristic now."
20,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35348314-joe-stack,4,"I found this to be a captivating autobiography. Freeman's experience during WWII is one of the reasons he is writes, ""I am convinced that to avoid nuclear war it is not sufficient to be afraid of it. It is necessary to be afraid, but it is equally necessary to understand. And the first step in understanding is to recognize that the problem of nuclear war is basically not technical but human and historical. If we are to avoid destruction we must first of all understand the human and historical context out of which destruction arises."" He not only has a grasp of how violence breeds violence, but he also is optimistic and imaginative, such as when he writes about using stellar starlight to move vessels through space."
21,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/634557-sara-sams,4,"I enjoyed reading this memoir and liked the Dyson focused on the moments of his life in which the moral/philosophical questions he asked were zoomed-out. There were definitely some more intimate moments, but for the large part, we learn more about crisis scientists face when engaging with or fighting against war. I learned a lot about strategic bombing, for instance, and its overall failure as a military tactic. Never thought I'd be so interested in that, but the moral questions he brings up as a mathemetician working for an aerial squadron during WWII seem to keep coming up, even as he moves into theoretical terrain of colonizing a galaxy. I also appreciated his gift of reading and responding to poetry as he navigated the harder questions. Very fun. "
22,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/749227-dan,4,"I've had this book on my shelf for 10+ years, and with Dyson's death I finally decided to read it.The final section (3) of the book is the weakest with the final chapter being, unfortunately, the worst part of the book, but the first two sections are very good. The highlight is the chapter on taking a road trip to Albuquerque with Richard Feynman. "
23,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47145078-romano-cassar,5,"I read this book in the 1980s, soon after it was published. I don't remember any details, but I remember it a a brilliantly-written book, and I still have a warm feeling for it. So I'm giving it five stars. "

30,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6789258-paige-ellen-stone,5,"This is the second of the three books that Bruce Sterling says in his introduction to ""Schizmatrix Plus"" had a major influence on his writing of those short stories and the novel that followed. While it can be slow at times, Dyson's honesty and sense of wonder and awe at what he sees make up for that. I found it sad that this was written in '79, before the end of the ""Genome Project"". I would be fascinated as to what he would have to say in response to that incredible accomplishment and his own thinking about what biology has to offer those who would explore and colonize space.His ideas are, in some places, still fresh and exciting, and quite advanced and risky for the time in which he was writing. I plan to read his collection of essays, ""The Scientist as Rebel,"" as soon as I can, since it is so much more recent.I must add that he is so open that he disavows ever having come up with the idea now know in sci-fi and other circles as the ""Dyson Sphere."" He admits it came from a sci fi novel he was reading in 1945 and even gives the author's name, which evades me now.He is refreshingly honest and has the poet's soul as do many other speculative physicists. Without question it is the last third of the book that holds the reader's attention most strongly (at least this reader). He speaks of what he sees coming, of what his children mean to him, his own dreams, his belief in the place of theology and his hope for quantum physics in the world to come. It is not the easiest read but it worthwhile.I've just realized that I've written this review assuming that the reader knows who Freeman Dyson is. Well.... if you don't..... just type his name into google and get familiar with one of the most extraordinary humans of our lifetime."
31,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,4,"This was a great read. Dyson tells the story of his life as a physicist working at 'high levels' on quantum, nuclear and astronomy issues. However, he tells more of the social story, using literary illustrations, rather than the scientific detail (which is probably accessible elsewhere). Some of the chapters are perhaps more whimsical than practical, including a favorite topic of mine (exobiology and the search for other life). Many, however, are dealing with the very real interaction between science/technology and politics, public perception and the ethical challenges posed. It is valuable to hear these things discussed thoughtfully by someone who understands the science and the humanity of the scientists doing it."

He speaks of peace an disarmament. He moves to America to study physics and worked with many of the great minds that developed the bomb after the bomb had been dropped. He looks at the future, not just in the short range but a deeper look at the future of the human race as a diverging species, perhaps bound for the stars. He is a man of science, but widely read, quoting othe authors and poets."
33,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4," Freeman Dyson is a major scientist of the 20th century and founder of Quantum Electrodynamics along with Richard Feynman, Julian Schwinger.

He is the inventor of the idea of the Dyson sphere a sphere to be built by an advanced civilization around a star to utilize all the power output of a sun. He thought big and besides worrying about nuclear apocalypse like many in the physics community also dreamed of Greening the Galaxy. Dyson is one of those innovative thinkers at the zenith of the space program who popularized dreams of populating the sky. Definitely some one people should be more acquanted with. "
34,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1798996-valerie,0,"Dyson spends too much time justifying in retrospect behavior that (let's face it) can't be justified. If he'd stood up for his beliefs, he might not have to spend so much time on it now.I'd seen him on A Glorious Accident, and he was one of the people I knew about before the series. He speaks better than he writes, in my opinion. But the book was worth reading, if only for the physics. If you're not interested in the physics, you've probably wandered in by chance.

46,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1191652-bill,3,"This is not a typical autobiography. You'll learn very little about Dyson's family life in this book. But you will learn a lot about his personal life because it seems that this person had an intense life-long engagement with thinking about the biggest questions about life, death and the universe. Each chapter reads almost like a self-contained essay, though the same questions and approaches to solving problems create a strong connecting thread. His teenage fascination with Einstein's theories led him to mail order a book on differential equations, which he learned on his own. He debated morality and science with his father and mother – both immersed in music and literature. Written in 1979, he describes his struggles with moral positions toward war from his time in the British strategic bombing campaigns through his friendships with Oppenheimer and Teller regarding US policy and nuclear weaponry, his testimony in favor the nuclear test ban, and his recommendations to focus on banning offensive weapons and letting the Soviet Union develop its anti-ballistic defense. With his knowledge of mathematics, physics, and astronomy, he reflects on the differences between the big (universe) to the small (subatomic) and the grey technology (fossil fuels) and green ones (solar). And he goes off into what seem like the craziest science fiction fantasies – spheres built around stars, solar sailing, pioneers landing on asteroids – only to convince you that they are not only possible but actually reflect a continuity with the evolution of life and human beings on our planet.This is a good book for anyone who wants to get insights into how a unique, brilliant, and morally concerned natural scientist thought about problems and solutions for our world. It is also good for anyone who wants to stretch their brain to get a completely different approach to thinking about everything. Finally, it is a very human book. Who could imagine that Teller could play Bach's Etude in E flat minor, that Oppenheimer resented being treated as some kind of martyr, or that when a son rescues two people from a capsized boat near Puget Sound, it can bring a measure of solace to the father who feels survivor's guilt from an event thirty years before.

80,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1191652-bill,3,"This is not a typical autobiography. You'll learn very little about Dyson's family life in this book. But you will learn a lot about his personal life because it seems that this person had an intense life-long engagement with thinking about the biggest questions about life, death and the universe. Each chapter reads almost like a self-contained essay, though the same questions and approaches to solving problems create a strong connecting thread. His teenage fascination with Einstein's theories led him to mail order a book on differential equations, which he learned on his own. He debated morality and science with his father and mother – both immersed in music and literature. Written in 1979, he describes his struggles with moral positions toward war from his time in the British strategic bombing campaigns through his friendships with Oppenheimer and Teller regarding US policy and nuclear weaponry, his testimony in favor the nuclear test ban, and his recommendations to focus on banning offensive weapons and letting the Soviet Union develop its anti-ballistic defense. With his knowledge of mathematics, physics, and astronomy, he reflects on the differences between the big (universe) to the small (subatomic) and the grey technology (fossil fuels) and green ones (solar). And he goes off into what seem like the craziest science fiction fantasies – spheres built around stars, solar sailing, pioneers landing on asteroids – only to convince you that they are not only possible but actually reflect a continuity with the evolution of life and human beings on our planet.This is a good book for anyone who wants to get insights into how a unique, brilliant, and morally concerned natural scientist thought about problems and solutions for our world. It is also good for anyone who wants to stretch their brain to get a completely different approach to thinking about everything. Finally, it is a very human book. Who could imagine that Teller could play Bach's Etude in E flat minor, that Oppenheimer resented being treated as some kind of martyr, or that when a son rescues two people from a capsized boat near Puget Sound, it can bring a measure of solace to the father who feels survivor's guilt from an event thirty years before.

While it can be slow at times, Dyson's honesty and sense of wonder and awe at what he sees make up for that. I found it sad that this was written in '79, before the end of the ""Genome Project"". I would be fascinated as to what he would have to say in response to that incredible accomplishment and his own thinking about what biology has to offer those who would explore and colonize space.His ideas are, in some places, still fresh and exciting, and quite advanced and risky for the time in which he was writing. I plan to read his collection of essays, ""The Scientist as Rebel,"" as soon as I can, since it is so much more recent.I must add that he is so open that he disavows ever having come up with the idea now know in sci-fi and other circles as the ""Dyson Sphere."" He admits it came from a sci fi novel he was reading in 1945 and even gives the author's name, which evades me now.He is refreshingly honest and has the poet's soul as do many other speculative physicists. Without question it is the last third of the book that holds the reader's attention most strongly (at least this reader). He speaks of what he sees coming, of what his children mean to him, his own dreams, his belief in the place of theology and his hope for quantum physics in the world to come. It is not the easiest read but it worthwhile.I've just realized that I've written this review assuming that the reader knows who Freeman Dyson is.

Dyson tells the story of his life as a physicist working at 'high levels' on quantum, nuclear and astronomy issues. However, he tells more of the social story, using literary illustrations, rather than the scientific detail (which is probably accessible elsewhere). Some of the chapters are perhaps more whimsical than practical, including a favorite topic of mine (exobiology and the search for other life). Many, however, are dealing with the very real interaction between science/technology and politics, public perception and the ethical challenges posed. It is valuable to hear these things discussed thoughtfully by someone who understands the science and the humanity of the scientists doing it."

131,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1191652-bill,3,"This is not a typical autobiography. You'll learn very little about Dyson's family life in this book. But you will learn a lot about his personal life because it seems that this person had an intense life-long engagement with thinking about the biggest questions about life, death and the universe. Each chapter reads almost like a self-contained essay, though the same questions and approaches to solving problems create a strong connecting thread. His teenage fascination with Einstein's theories led him to mail order a book on differential equations, which he learned on his own. He debated morality and science with his father and mother – both immersed in music and literature. Written in 1979, he describes his struggles with moral positions toward war from his time in the British strategic bombing campaigns through his friendships with Oppenheimer and Teller regarding US policy and nuclear weaponry, his testimony in favor the nuclear test ban, and his recommendations to focus on banning offensive weapons and letting the Soviet Union develop its anti-ballistic defense. With his knowledge of mathematics, physics, and astronomy, he reflects on the differences between the big (universe) to the small (subatomic) and the grey technology (fossil fuels) and green ones (solar). And he goes off into what seem like the craziest science fiction fantasies – spheres built around stars, solar sailing, pioneers landing on asteroids – only to convince you that they are not only possible but actually reflect a continuity with the evolution of life and human beings on our planet.This is a good book for anyone who wants to get insights into how a unique, brilliant, and morally concerned natural scientist thought about problems and solutions for our world. It is also good for anyone who wants to stretch their brain to get a completely different approach to thinking about everything. Finally, it is a very human book. Who could imagine that Teller could play Bach's Etude in E flat minor, that Oppenheimer resented being treated as some kind of martyr, or that when a son rescues two people from a capsized boat near Puget Sound, it can bring a measure of solace to the father who feels survivor's guilt from an event thirty years before. "
132,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6789258-paige-ellen-stone,5,"This is the second of the three books that Bruce Sterling says in his introduction to ""Schizmatrix Plus"" had a major influence on his writing of those short stories and the novel that followed. While it can be slow at times, Dyson's honesty and sense of wonder and awe at what he sees make up for that. I found it sad that this was written in '79, before the end of the ""Genome Project"". I would be fascinated as to what he would have to say in response to that incredible accomplishment and his own thinking about what biology has to offer those who would explore and colonize space.His ideas are, in some places, still fresh and exciting, and quite advanced and risky for the time in which he was writing. I plan to read his collection of essays, ""The Scientist as Rebel,"" as soon as I can, since it is so much more recent.I must add that he is so open that he disavows ever having come up with the idea now know in sci-fi and other circles as the ""Dyson Sphere."" He admits it came from a sci fi novel he was reading in 1945 and even gives the author's name, which evades me now.He is refreshingly honest and has the poet's soul as do many other speculative physicists. Without question it is the last third of the book that holds the reader's attention most strongly (at least this reader). He speaks of what he sees coming, of what his children mean to him, his own dreams, his belief in the place of theology and his hope for quantum physics in the world to come. It is not the easiest read but it worthwhile.I've just realized that I've written this review assuming that the reader knows who Freeman Dyson is. Well.... if you don't..... just type his name into google and get familiar with one of the most extraordinary humans of our lifetime."
133,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,4,"This was a great read. Dyson tells the story of his life as a physicist working at 'high levels' on quantum, nuclear and astronomy issues. However, he tells more of the social story, using literary illustrations, rather than the scientific detail (which is probably accessible elsewhere). Some of the chapters are perhaps more whimsical than practical, including a favorite topic of mine (exobiology and the search for other life). Many, however, are dealing with the very real interaction between science/technology and politics, public perception and the ethical challenges posed. It is valuable to hear these things discussed thoughtfully by someone who understands the science and the humanity of the scientists doing it."
134,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3590232-martha-grace,4,"This is really a series of essays. It is dated--it was written in 1979, but fearlessly addresses many big questions.Growing ups in England, the opening essays are about England in WWII and stories of being involved in the bombing of Germany while living through the bombing of England. He speaks of peace an disarmament. He moves to America to study physics and worked with many of the great minds that developed the bomb after the bomb had been dropped. He looks at the future, not just in the short range but a deeper look at the future of the human race as a diverging species, perhaps bound for the stars. He is a man of science, but widely read, quoting othe authors and poets."
135,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4," Freeman Dyson is a major scientist of the 20th century and founder of Quantum Electrodynamics along with Richard Feynman, Julian Schwinger. He also has the blue sky imagination to rival any science fiction writer. He is the inventor of the idea of the Dyson sphere a sphere to be built by an advanced civilization around a star to utilize all the power output of a sun. He thought big and besides worrying about nuclear apocalypse like many in the physics community also dreamed of Greening the Galaxy. Dyson is one of those innovative thinkers at the zenith of the space program who popularized dreams of populating the sky. Definitely some one people should be more acquanted with. "
136,0465016774,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1798996-valerie,0,"Dyson spends too much time justifying in retrospect behavior that (let's face it) can't be justified. If he'd stood up for his beliefs, he might not have to spend so much time on it now.I'd seen him on A Glorious Accident, and he was one of the people I knew about before the series. He speaks better than he writes, in my opinion. But the book was worth reading, if only for the physics. If you're not interested in the physics, you've probably wandered in by chance. I can't say if you'd like the book--but other people seem to."

But you will learn a lot about his personal life because it seems that this person had an intense life-long engagement with thinking about the biggest questions about life, death and the universe. Each chapter reads almost like a self-contained essay, though the same questions and approaches to solving problems create a strong connecting thread. His teenage fascination with Einstein's theories led him to mail order a book on differential equations, which he learned on his own. He debated morality and science with his father and mother – both immersed in music and literature. Written in 1979, he describes his struggles with moral positions toward war from his time in the British strategic bombing campaigns through his friendships with Oppenheimer and Teller regarding US policy and nuclear weaponry, his testimony in favor the nuclear test ban, and his recommendations to focus on banning offensive weapons and letting the Soviet Union develop its anti-ballistic defense. With his knowledge of mathematics, physics, and astronomy, he reflects on the differences between the big (universe) to the small (subatomic) and the grey technology (fossil fuels) and green ones (solar). And he goes off into what seem like the craziest science fiction fantasies – spheres built around stars, solar sailing, pioneers landing on asteroids – only to convince you that they are not only possible but actually reflect a continuity with the evolution of life and human beings on our planet.This is a good book for anyone who wants to get insights into how a unique, brilliant, and morally concerned natural scientist thought about problems and solutions for our world. It is also good for anyone who wants to stretch their brain to get a completely different approach to thinking about everything. Finally, it is a very human book. Who could imagine that Teller could play Bach's Etude in E flat minor, that Oppenheimer resented being treated as some kind of martyr, or that when a son rescues two people from a capsized boat near Puget Sound, it can bring a measure of solace to the father who feels survivor's guilt from an event thirty years before.
