0,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3458028-ruth,4,"I have a confession to make - I work for a chemical company (not making dyes though), and used to be an engineer in a former existence, so I understood a fair amount of what this book says about chemistry. BUT, it's a great narrative of how one small moment in time, a mistake, an error, happened to completely revolutionize our lives today. The chemical industry gets a bad wrap these days, sometimes fairly (chemical companies have done some pretty stupid/heinous things) and sometimes unfairly (trust me, life would be COMPLETELY different and much, much more difficult and dangerous without the chemicals we all use today perfectly safely), but this book actually tells the story of how the chemical industry developed (but in a non-tedious way), and how it was driven and why, and about some of the incredibly smart men who created some pretty amazing stuff in a wide range of fields.Incidentally, this book gives some of the best insights into the Victorian age, and what motivated great Victorians. It really lets you feel how Victorians thought they could change the world (and actually did), and how that realization came to a crashing halt with increasing German aggression. It touches on nationalism (Germany believed in it, England believed it but almost too late to save itself). It touches on women's increasing independence and their spending power (their whims for a color drove the creation of a completely new industry), and the increasing spending power of the middle and working classes, and how they sought to use their money to improve the quality of their lives through increased color. It touches on the inception of environmental regulation (even then, you couldn't get away with killing your neighbors for long), and made me think with some cynicism of the ""new"" sustainability and ""eco"" movements. These are not new at all, but rather standing on the shoulders of those who have come before them in creating the synthetic versions of ""natural"" products. I think maybe the author missed that the modern chemical industry is not a matter of synthetic versus natural - there is much to be said for both, and chemical companies understand this, but this book was written a few years before the sustainability movement really took off.Best of all though, this is a story of a very bright, curious young man, who whilst seeking a synthetic source for the treatment of malaria, which would have saved millions of lives, stumbled upon something, which, whilst appearing nothing more than frippery, actually ending up providing the chemical stepping stones to some of the most valuable substances we use today, including medicines. He was a man of great humility, great persistence (against much snobbery from his purist chemistry pals, he scaled up his laboratory error into a factory) and ultimately just a man. He is not well-remembered, but maybe he'd prefer it that way?4 stars. Great read."
1,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/333860-marissa-morrison,2,"I am glad that Garfield wrote this book because I don't think I would otherwise have learned about the history and significance of synthetic dyes. However, this book seemed to be more a collection of facts than a narrative. I wouldn't be surprised if someone told me that Mauve contains the author's notes, which he planned to flesh out to create a coherent story, but then he ran out of time. In many instances, I wasn't sure what to make of the facts presented.Example One: Garfield says that Perkin married his first cousin. Period. Did that make him a weird guy, or was this the type of marriage the norm in nineteenth century England? I have no idea. I also don't know how the union came to be: Were the Perkins madly in love? Did their parents (and aunts and uncles) approve? etc.Example Two: ""In movies that word (mauve) has been used imaginatively. In Bruce Robinson's screenplay for Withnail and I, the lecherous Uncle Monty defines Withnail with the disparaging phrase, He's so mauve.'"" Since I've never seen this movie, I have no idea what kind of character Withnail is, and therefore don't know what mauve is meant to convey about Withnail. Does it have anything to do with Uncle Monty's lechery? Since Garfield has given no sense of how the word was used in this film, I'm forced to simply accept that it was used ""imaginatively."" Also, I'm left to wonder whether this paragraph added meaning to the book.The best part of this book was seeing so many unfamiliar, beautiful words that are the names of colors. Apparently there are 7,500 unique color names. I'm going to try to get a hold of the full list!"
2,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1253638-trena,2,"This is the kind of book that gives history a bad name. The format is very ""so and so was born on such and such date, and then on this date he did this."" No emotional content, no larger over-arching narrative, nothing compelling whatsoever (and it covered two world wars in which dye works played some non-trivial role!). It could possibly have been more boring, but I'm not sure how. For instance, it contained no fewer than five seemingly real-time accounts of nine hour celebratory banquets held in William Perkin's honor (a couple of them posthumous), with long passages quoting the extremely boring speeches given at these extremely boring dinners. Really not the way to interest your audience.I think the problem that faced the author was that Perkin made his discovery of mauve, the first chemical dye, at 18 and had left the business by his 30s. The author didn't know how to fill up the rest of the book and that's what most of it reads as--filler. There is a lot of disjointed/anecdotal discussion of the scientific advances that built on the invention of chemical dye, such cell staining leading to the discovery of bacteria, but these feel totally random instead of interesting and engaging.It is possible to write a fascinating book about dye, as evidenced by A Perfect Red: Empire, Espionage, and the Quest for the Color of Desire. The little chapter at the end of A Perfect Red that covers Perkin and subsequent dye developments is more interesting and informative than this entire book. I spent about 8 weeks reading it; I only finished because I felt it would be unfair to write a scathing review on its boringness if I didn't know for sure it was boring all the way through. It was."
3,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8349963-marsha,5,"Science, like art, is largely perspiration with a minute amount of inspiration thrown into it. Occasionally, however, the greatest discoveries can come about through sheer luck. However, William Perkin was more than merely a lucky amateur. Humble, soft spoken and yet gifted, talented, blessed with a curious, keen intellect and scientific know-how, Mr. Perkin set out to find a cure for malaria and stumbled across something just as wonderful—a brand new color that would end up revolutionizing the world.Mr. Perkin’s discovery was partially luck, but also partially a reflection of changing times. In an era when chemistry wasn’t highly regarded and anything approaching commercialism of pure science was regarded with ridicule and disdain, Mr. Perkin strove hard to find people who would take his new discovery seriously. He amassed a fortune and considerable fame during his lifetime only to fall into obscurity after it. His name graces a medal but his tombstone in the graveyard where he was buried is not to be found. How did this happen?Delving into old scientific treatises, articles, journals and verbal accounts, Mr. Garfield has spun an enchanting story around what could have been very dry matter indeed—scientific research and development. Mr. Perkin’s creation of mauve was more than a fashion fad; it paved the way for all sorts of fantastic, wonderful and useful inventions in the years and decades that followed. He influenced everything from clothing to explosives, medicines to food additives. A story of a true scientific genius, Mauve inspires, informs and entertains. I found this novel insightful and I was never bored. Mr. Garfield brings his subject alive and gives the modern reader a look into a vanished era and a very special man."
4,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8086485-rebecca,2,"While I loved the premise of this book, it was poorly written and needed a much better editor. The story goes back and forth in no chronological order and with no transitions. For instance, it starts out at the end of Perkins life with a long and detailed and boring description of some fancy dinner he was honored at in New York. At some point the author appears to decides ""Oh, maybe I should stick some info in here about the natural dye industry"" and starts going on about madder. This book really rambled and was frustratingly incohesive. As if you weren't confused enough it then introduces some irrelevant data about a person who works in the fashion design industry introducing each years ""it"" colors. WTF? Sticking with the story would be good and keeping it in order would have helped tremendously. I really wanted to read this and just could not do it. "
5,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,5,"This was a fascinating book, albeit on a very specific topic. Nicely done and full of interesting nuggets of information about life in Victorian England. "
6,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80750585-claudia,4,"As one newspaper stated at Sir William Perkins' death, his triumphs regarding coal-tar caused 'the deliverance from their chemical dungeon of the imprisoned spirits of the rainbow'.It was an accident. He was trying to find a synthetic version of quinine, the only effective treatment against malaria. This was the initial decades where science was just beginning to understand the different elements and how various compounds interacted and how molecules were created. The basics of organic chemistry were barely recognized. Yet, somehow, he took a hydrocarbon, subjected it to other chemicals, rinsed it with this, heated it for this long, rinsed until clear with that, heated again, stirred in this which precipitated out this other thing. . . and got . . . an intense violet. Mauve. It was only good fortune that he found someone in the textile industry who was willing to take a chance on this new color. And it was a hit. Especially when Queen Victoria came out of her black mourning into mauve.That was only the beginning of the synthetic colors distilled from bituminous coal. Chemists everywhere wanted to come up with the next popular dye. And many of the coal-tar/aniline colors would be unfamiliar to today's ear - Bleu de Paris; Nicholson's blue; Turkey red; Scheele's green; Britannia violet - and of course, fushsine, rosaniline, solferino and the more commonly known, magenta.The coal-tar synthetic color dyes not only changed the textile industry with new colors of clothes, upholstery, curtains but also stamps, foodstuffs, wallpaper, banknotes and even lead into photochemicals, artificial scents and flavoring (like saccharine) aspirin, malarial treatments, modern explosives, furniture stains, hair dyes, cosmetics, staining of cells/tissues/bacteria for medicine, botany, physiology, microbiology and far more. The book especially covers the years after Perkins great discovery. The mess in patents as well as the loopholes that Germany utilized extensively (Britain recognized German patents but Germany would not recognize British ones among other problems). The massive development of the German artificial dye and base liquid corporations that overwhelmed the other countries manufacturing. Which was very obvious with the First World War and dyes for uniforms and chemicals for explosives were mainly an export of the German enemy.The book started with the 50th anniversary celebration of Perkin's discovery in NYC, noted chemists and scientists with various excerpts of their speeches. Then it jumps into Perkin's life, his schooling, training with August Hofmann. About 30% into the book, the chapters end with several paragraphs regarding the modern fashion industry and who and how the 'popular colors' of the next year are chosen. It is very disconcerting and completely derails the train of thought previously constructed. And it happens repeatedly for several chapters.All from an 18-year-old who decided to see what he could do with some brightly colored leftovers from a failed experiment. 2016-136"

8,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5125298-carolyn-venne,3,"Very interesting, but not as riveting (obviously) as some of Simon Garfield's others"
9,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25211535-rachel,3,"A combination of the history of science, the history of fashion, and biography, and remarkably not a heavy read. Enjoyable, interesting and a good opportunity to fill in the details about a well known name of chemistry."
10,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90485043-elizabeth-w,3,"On it's face, this is a story about the discovery of mauve; more so, this book presents a picture of chemistry and the surrounding zeitgeist in Victorian England, the field of chemistry and it's growth from abstract science to industrial dye making and on to the creation of modern medicines and materials of biochemistry and material science. The author includes many tangents of information, which are interesting and informative. However, the story is very non-linear, choppy, and does not flow between chapters. While the story of Perkins' life is told, on the whole, linearly, the text jumps between time points often and in ways that do not further the narrative. For example, the author describes in detail a number of commemorative banquets and celebrations and meetings that feel very repetitive and don't add much to the story; he opens the book with one such celebration at the end of Perkins' life, which is not only disorienting, but in trying to introduce the central character of this biography, also spoils many of the implications of Perkins' research that make the story gripping. Overall, this is an interesting book on the history of science which tells an engaging story of scientific discovery and connects it well with the state of scientific discovery today. As a biography, you do not get a good feel for Perkins' personality and character, and the story of his life is told in a way that falls a bit flat. "
11,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/433768-colin,4,"Mauve as a color has always been a bit of a puzzle. It’s not exactly purple, or lilac, or magenta. It’s certainly not very popular today, and if you showed up at work wearing mauve you’d raise eyebrows. Somehow it conjures up images of grandmothers and musty old drawing rooms with fading wallpaper. It’s yesterday’s color — so what could it possibly have to do with innovation?A lot, as it turns out. As Simon Garfield explains, eighteen-year-old William Perkin was trying to make quinine in his home laboratory one day in 1856, using the waste product coal tar. Malaria was still a reality in England at the time, and coal tar was piling up in waste sites and streams as coal was converted to methane to light Victorian street lamps. By accident, he synthesized a strange black powder he couldn’t identify. Instead of throwing it away, he purified it and soon realized it was a dye, turning textiles like wool and cotton a pale purple color. He called the substance mauvine.Perkin was studying chemistry under the famous Professor August Wilhem von Hofmann at the time, but wasn’t eager to show off his discovery to his mentor. For one thing, he believed correctly that Hoffman would consider it a useless distraction from more refined academic pursuits. Perkin instead struck out on his own, contacting a Scottish dyer and sending him a sample of fabric dyed with his new substance. The response was enthusiastic, and he quickly realized there was a commercial future for his discovery.He managed to convince his father and brother of the same thing, and they spent the family savings building a factory at Greenford in northwest London. Within six months they were manufacturing and selling mauve and seeing real revenues. Word of the new dye spread quickly, and the color soon became very fashionable, especially when Empress Eugénie (wife of Napoleon III) began favoring mauve in 1857 because it matched her eyes, and Queen Victoria wore a mauve dress to her daughter’s wedding in 1858. Almost overnight, mauve was everywhere, and Perkin become astonishingly rich.This story isn’t just about fashion innovation. It matters because mauve was the first step in the creation of the global chemicals industry, proving that chemistry had valuable commercial applications and creating revenue streams to pay large numbers of chemists to work on further practical discoveries. For all its flaws, we literally couldn’t have modern life without commercial chemistry: pharmaceuticals, agriculture, plastics, textiles, fuel, and countless other products that we use every day are made by it. Had Perkin been a little less daring and entrepreneurial — or perhaps a little older and more jaded — he might have thrown the mauvine down the drain, and the world would have had to wait for the beneficial innovations that it sparked.So why don’t we all know this story? The answer is the same thing that complicates Garfield’s narrative and makes the book less than it should be: Perkin was basically boring. Despite the brilliant color that his discovery unleashed, he led a largely colorless life. He continued to work diligently but unremarkably through his later years, rarely traveled, had few hobbies and fewer vices, and lived a long, pious life of charity and modest research. Where’s the fun in that? Garfield has so much trouble rescuing Perkin from modest obscurity that he’s reduced to literally recounting the hurrahs received at the gala dinner in honor of the 50th anniversary of his discovery.In fact, the much more compelling personality in these pages is von Hoffman, who taught Perkin chemistry and launched countless brilliant careers in between hanging out with Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. His story is much glitzier: he had four wives and eleven children, made fundamental contributions across many fields in chemistry, and inspired gushing biographies. His statue in Berlin was destroyed by an RAF raid during World War II, which somehow seems appropriate given the fact that after he left England to return to Germany, the German chemicals industry grew to significantly out-compete the English one that Perkin launched. (It’s worth remembering that industrial chemistry played a huge role in World War I, enabling Germany to fight for years with very limited sources of fuel and ammunition.)Yet this is the truth of innovation: the real innovators aren’t always the ones in the limelight. Quiet, diligent, outwardly unremarkable people often are the true source of the key technical advances or the fundamental insights that are critical for innovation. That’s an important thing to remember in the age of charismatic, outspoken technology entrepreneurs like Musk and Zuckerberg. Perkin, great innovator that he was, probably wouldn’t have had any followers on Twitter.One of the other fascinating parts of this history is the impact of mauve and other synthetic dyes on society. In today’s world we see color everywhere we look — our clothes, cars, buildings, signs, and screens all pulse with a million different shades — and we can’t imagine life without it. But the early 19th century was a much more drab place. Because dyes were expensive, only the rich could afford things with deep, vibrant colors, and even those tended to fade quickly. Color was a luxury, and the world that people saw every day reflected that economic and technological fact.The invention of mauvine, and the other cheap synthetic dyes that followed it, dramatically changed this. Mauve itself replaced the color previously known as Tyrian Purple, which was made from hand-collected sea snails and so expensive that it became associated with royalty. But Perkin’s discovery meant that even the poorest of consumers could suddenly wear the color of kings and queens, and the world was transformed. People’s daily experience became increasingly saturated with color, with dyed clothing, wallpaper, and other objects everywhere. In a sense, mauve made the world that we see today.On a recent visit to London I took the Underground to Greenford and walked the short distance to the spot where the Perkins built their factory. It’s now a parking lot and office building, but a blue plaque marks this seminal site of modern chemistry, and the Black Horse pub still stands next door.As if to make up for Perkin’s lack of sex appeal, about five hundred yards away is the former location the Oldfield Hotel, where The Who had their first gig in 1964. Sadly, there’s no evidence that the rockers knew about their connection to the invention of modern color, except for one intriguing possibility. Keith Moon’s famous Rolls Royce (which he may or may not have driven into a swimming pool) was at one point painted the most appropriate color for his wild lifestyle: mauve. Maybe he realized that he owed a debt to the man who invented it."
12,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76129-wealhtheow,3,"A slim but broad-reaching tale of the beginning of artifiical dyes. At the time Perkin made his discovery that coal-tar could be transformed into mauve dye, chemistry was thought of like philosophy--a gentleman's pursuit with no worldly or industrial value. Perkin's discovery and subsequent ability to make money off of it changed that perception forever. By the time he died, chemistry was a roaring industry.The history of artificial dyes is a fascinating one. Before Perkin discovered mauve, all dyes came from natural sources like plants or sea creatures. The array of colors was small, particularly for the poor. But chemical processes created not only a wide variety of colors, but made them available to everyone. Soon, bright, vibrant colors were a sign of being low-class instead of rich. Trying to cut corners in the chemical process led to colors that bled (even upon people's skin as they wore their clothes), or colors that were actually poisonous. Bright green was particularly likely to be rife with arsenic (could this be part of why the poison cake in Peter Pan is colored bright green?). Meanwhile, analine dyes were being used to discover the microbial world and eventually, even treat diseases. The tale of how mauve came to be is a fascinating one, and fairly well encapsulated herein."
13,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,2,"The story of William Perkin, a British chemist who as a teenager accidentally stumbled upon coal-tar derivative dyes --- mauve being the first. Beyond its immediate impact of creating a new industry and economy (“mauve measles” was a huge fad), the dyes were later found to have applications in cell research, medicines, explosives and plastics.It is an intriguing story, but it’s better suited to a New Yorker article; the book itself is a bit much. Perkin wasn’t a very interesting man apart from his discovery: he was deeply religious, assiduous, and modest, like a lot of Victorians. So there’s not much entertainment to be had from that quarter. Also, Garfield stuffs his book with lengthy excerpts from testimonial dinners (all right! we get the idea! Perkin was important! enough!), statistics, and continues writing long after Perkin’s death about the aniline dyes’ importance in other areas, which had long been granted already. "
14,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/417009-brian,4,"It is hard not to be impressed by an author who can take such a seemingly mundane topic as the development of a dye for a particular purple hue and produce from it such a readable story . Of course, it helps that there is already a surprisingly interesting untold tale to be told, and it covers quite a bit of ground - from the staid and stiff academic institutions of Europe, through the establishment of the early applied synthetic chemistry laboratories, to the very founding of the pharmaceutical industry. And, of course, a Parisian fashion craze, when only the *true* Mauve would do."
15,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5637689-c,3,"Astonishing -- a story most of us never knew or have forgotten. Did you know that sticky, smell, humble coal tar has given us everything from fashion's bright colors to a variety of medicines? I had no idea. Unfortunately, the story is told in a strange order that makes it hard to follow, but the facts are interesting and the writer does his best to stick to what people really said and did."
16,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155411-michael,4,Quite interesting despite bogging down considerably in the middle. Mauve - it's a dye! it's a dessert topping! it helped fight tropical diseases!and more!

18,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/776599-steve,2,"It is always interesting to me when I pick up a book that is generally widely acclaimed in the media but which I end up disliking, as I found with this book. I suspect this says a lot about me and where I am as a researcher and writer - having just submitted my dissertation to my committee and defending soon. I have developed certain deep-seated and strong opinions about how things ought to be composed, based on the huge amount of reading that any doctoral student in social science must perform. I think the acclaim of this book is partially justified. There is substantial material here, much of it interesting and potentially valuable. However, for me it is entirely undone by the almost total lack of ""connective tissue"". History is not really ""one damned thing after another"" but it can be in certain accounts like this one. I really disliked how the book never really stepped back and provided overviews and ""scenic overlooks"" of the overall terrain (compare to other popular works like Maureen Ogle on beer or the many works of Mark Kurlansky). Without these moments of stepping back, the story seemed like just a whirl. And it is a shame because Garfield has his finger directly on the pulse of a key process and subject in 19th century industrialization - the development of the chemical industry - which is still under appreciated all these years later. As I have said before in another Goodreads book review, the author of any book is under the obligation - like a good dance partner - to ""cue"" the reader at key points. In other words, it is up to the author to make clear what sections are key and which are supporting. If this is not done, the narrative dissolves into a sequence of seemingly homogeneously important facts. The reader can of course intuit what is important and what is not, but this is not what the reader is always supposed to have to do. It is the author who should know this. And, after reading many tens of thousands of pages of text - often indifferently written - in the last seven years, I have little tolerance for any author who devolves all the interpretation to the reader. Not recommended except for the very interested in this subject. "
19,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115991-immen,0,"Anyway this is the kind of review I hope Simon Garfield never reads while googling himself.The premise of the book is pretty great: all of commercial organic chemistry, from plastics to chemotherapy, can be traced back to the very first commercialized color-by-artifice, the French mallow pastel, mauve. But the execution is so terrible; the book is simultaneously minutely researched and painfully contentless. It's not just that he includes a recipe for pudding when I want to hear about trade wars, but there are a ton of editing misses, like using the terms 'madder lake' and 'fugitive hue' without ever defining them. The terminology is beautiful, the inconstancy of red is poetic, the discussion within the book is nonexistent. The phrase 'coal-tar wizard' is pretty good, but the most beautiful phrase in the book is from a quote in a footnote, 'a little tin-god on wheels' -- a dye chemist talking about his sudden prominence when WWI forced England to move all its orders from the German dye industry to home ground.But he's a footnote, because it turns out 'Mauve' is not a gritty history of the chemical industry, profit and pollution and research culture, but allusions to that history around a skeleton of 50/100/150 year anniversary celebrations of his discovery. Perkin's story is not that long; he was 18, trying to synthesize quinine, which would have been hella cool, but stumbled on a dye instead. That's in 1856. He had the gumption to sound out interest from England's very strong textile industry, the skills to bring his product to market, and the wits to exit (very profitably) 17 years later in 1873 before Germany could eat his lunch. It's still 40 years from there to WWI. 'Gravity's Rainbow', which namechecks Perkin and mauve, and the German conglomerate IG Farben, also alludes to this gritty history while not being about that. The tease is very annoying."
20,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1615066-austin,3,"More wonderful science-nerd nonfiction. This book is more than the story behind a color, it's really about the invention of chemistry, commercialization of chemicals, etc. But it is also a great story of the discovery of brilliant color (mauve) from the colorless, thought-to-be-worthless (coal tar, yech), and a bit about the hubris of assuming new substances are harmless.Minus a bit on the rating because the writing wanders and because there is a huge missed opportunity in that Garfield never dives into the broader social role of color naming in society as much as he could. There is one wonderful bit where he lists the numbers of color names that come from different sources (animals, plants, chemicals, etc.) but I wanted more on how a society historically treats colors differently once it can dye something that color.-----52 books in 52 weeks update:book number: 27 / 52scorecard (see below):W: 14/26NW: 12/26NA: 13/20D: 2/5F: 13NF: 13-------Notes: I'm trying to read 52 books this year.

21,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8347006-andrew-ragland,4,"A reasonably good account of William Perkin, his life, and his achievements, which admittedly is a bit of a thin story. The book compensates by adding substantial context, describing the environment of academia and industry at the time of Perkin's original discovery, and tracing the development of both throughout his life and into the modern day. The story here is less about Perkin than about the changes that his work made in the world - the rise of the great German chemical industries, the harsh realities of dependence on foreign products in time of war, the medical benefits of investigation into colors and dyes (which are substantial - gram staining alone changed how we approach diseases) - and toward the end the rise of the DuPont dynasty in America. Perkin himself was unassuming, just a chemist who decided to commercialize a discovery, and did well enough for himself in a fiercely competitive and highly unethical environment. The hardcover edition ends on a harsh downbeat, with the church administrator unable to find Perkin's grave, and him being missing off the burial registry, but the paperback edition extends the story, as Perkin's great-great-granddaughter finds the grave, and leads the author to it, that one bit of research by an amateur with an interest in the field making all the difference.

Or a yellow sundress. Or an umbrella, alizarin crimson."" Garfield recalls for us a time when we wouldn't have had those giddy fashion choices because effective fabric dyes were not available in all colors of the rainbow. New colors actually had to be invented-- and it wasn't easy!If you are like Sir William Perkin (the inventor hero of this book) in that you appreciate equally science, business, and art-- then you will likely find something fascinating on every page. I found much that was fascinating in his story and much cultural history that was delightful, though I admit that my interest lagged somewhat during passages of pure science.Finally, Sir William Perkin is one of the most genial geniuses you will ever have the pleasure to read about.

23,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24639415-megan,5,"From reading the other reviews, I can only conclude that if you are like me and your nerdiness knows no bounds, and you are endlessly delighted by learning the minutiae of dyeing, fashion, chemistry, and their intersections, you will, like me, love this book. By the time I finished this thing, I had pages upon pages of notes of other books that I wanted to read because they had been referenced in the footnotes, and because I found something utterly fascinating (to me) on literally every other page.That said! It is clearly not to the book for everyone, and that is ok. If you are one of the people who is bored by this book, I think we can still be friends. I understand that it is a very particular type of thing.

Part of it is this book doesn’t know what it wants to be - it’s part history, part biography, and part journalism strung together haphazardly. At some points, it lists a bunch of scientists and awards they’ve won because they attended a conference loosely related to Perkins. I can’t recommend this for the casual reader, but if you’re obsessed with learning about color it does have some interesting parts. IMO the biographical aspects of the book were the most interesting and I wish it delved into Perkin’s life in more detail. "

His genius was applying chemisty to industry and promoting his discovery. Mauve was the beginng of the vast chemical industry we know today. The author or the editors were uncomfortable with this just being a 19th century story so they add 20th century codas to some of the chapters which seem out of place. The last few pages of the book deal with current science. These bits and pieces scattered randomly through the book would have been better placed here.

54,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1757736-heather,3,"Garfield's writing style is mostly matter-of-fact, with a few flashes of oddness or romance, which I wanted more of: I liked, for example, that he gave the recipe for Perkin's dye alongside a recipe for Nesselrode pudding (served at a jubilee dinner in New York celebrating Perkin's invention). I wanted more of that: my absolute favorite thing in the book was the long list of where color-names come from (chemicals flowers, places, fruits, common things, etc.). Which isn't to say that the central story of Perkin, who made his discovery by accident at the age of eighteen, wasn't interesting in itself. Perkin studied and worked in the lab of August Wilhelm von Hofmann at the Royal College of Chemistry, and one of Hofmann's interests was showing ""how well the study of chemistry could produce the artificial synthesis of natural substances"" (29). One of the substances he wanted to synthesize was quinine, which was in huge demand for the prevention and treatment of malaria; Perkin's discovery, which came about at home over the Easter holiday because of his curiosity about the results of a failed experiment, was not synthetic quinine, but rather a way of treating coal-tar to make a distinctive powerful and color-fast purple dye with aniline as its base. Mauve inspired many imitators: other aniline dyes in similar shades and other shades were developed, and were manufactured (especially in Germany) on a huge scale, bringing more and brighter colors to more consumer goods. And aniline dyes like Perkin's mauve weren't just used to dye textiles: they were used to stain cell and tissue samples, and were useful in staining and therefore identifying and studying specific bacteria associated with specific diseases. They even were the starting point for chemotherapy, as scientists realized that the dyes weren't just staining the cells but reacting with matter in them. I wasn't so into the parts of this book about industry (I especially could have done without all the bits about corporate buyouts and mergers) though I did like some of the more lively bits, particularly a section on the Victorian-era dye industry's publicity battle. As more and more people made aniline dyes in various colors, worries about health risks grew: some colors used arsenic, which could pollute local water supplies and might also cause skin irritations; some doctors and concerned citizens claimed that even arsenic-free colors were irritating because of the coal-tar itself - especially in cheaper dyes that were less color-fast than Perkin's mauve. There was a push to encourage a switch back to natural dyes, but that didn't really make financial/logistical sense, and besides, the manufacturers of artificial dyes pushed back. I love this: ""Williams Bros and Ekin, from Hounslow, Middlesex, mentioned that an analytical chemist from London called Antony Nesbitt fed his rabbits for many weeks on oats which had been steeped in strong solutions of magenta, violet, brown and orange. The rabbits seemed to like it, and stayed white"" (108). Mostly I liked the bits of this book about the history of dyes and dying: I knew that cochineal was made from insects, for example, but had no idea that it took ""about 17,000 dried insects for a single ounce of dye"" (40). And I'd heard of Tyrian purple, but I loved this passage about it: Pliny described how, during autumn and winter, the shellfish were crushed, salted for three days and then boiled for ten. The resultant colour resembled 'the sea, the air and a clear sky,' suggesting that Tyrian purple defined not one particular shade but a rich spectrum from blue to black. The dying process varied from port to port, and might have water or honey mixed in to achieve different hues. (39-40)That's what I wanted more of: color as product/process and color as evocative, bits of shell conjuring sea and air and sky. "
55,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5937558-lynn,5,"Today's post is on Mauve: How One Man Invented a Color that Changed the World by Simon Garfield. It is 222 pages including an index and it is published by W. W. Norton & Company. The cover is an oil painting of Sir William Perkins. The intended reader is someone who likes science, history, and surprising inventions. There is no language, no sex, and no violence in this book. The story is told in two ways; the past is from the third person perspective with letters and other first hand documents added in for development, and the present Garfield writes from first person as he interviews people. There Be Spoilers Ahead.From the dust jacket- Born of an experimental slip, this odd shade of purple revolutionized the worlds of fashion, industry, and chemical research.Mauve is the story of a man who accidentally invented a color, and in the process transformed the world around him. Before 1856, the color in our lives- the reds, blues, and blacks of clothing, paint, print- came from insects or mollusks, roots or leaves, and dyeing was painstaking and expensive. But in 1856 eighteen-year-old English chemist William Perkin accidentally discovered a way to mass-produce color in a factory.Working on a treatment for malaria in his London home laboratory, Perkin found mauve by chance. His experiments failed to result in artificial quinine as he had hoped, but produced instead a dark oily sludge that happened to turn silk a beautiful light purple. Mauve became the most desirable shade in the fashion houses of Paris and London, and quickly led to crimsons, violets, blues, and greens, earning its inventor a fortune. But its importance extends far beyond ballgowns.Before mauve, chemistry was largely a theoretical science. Perkin's discovery sparked new interest in industrial applications of chemistry research, which later bought about the development of explosives, perfume, photography, modern medicine, and today's plastics industry.Perkin is honored with the odd plaque and bust in colleges and chemistry clubs, but is otherwise forgotten man. With great wit, savvy, and historical scope, Simon Garfield delivers a fascinating tale of how this accidental genius set in motion and extraordinary scientific leap.Review- This is why I love Garfield so much. This book is interesting, funny, moving, and very well written. Garfield takes something that I knew next to nothing about and does all that with it. Garfield is a wonderful writer. He makes the very technical world of chemistry and makes it readable. In addition to uncovering Perkin and his discoveries, he interviews people in the different industries that were affected by his work. Going from birth to his death Garfield then goes beyond Perkin into the future that he helped create. The way that Garfield blends the past and the present to make one story is brilliant and just like him. I love the way that he makes the subjects of his books so normal by showing how it intercedes with our own lives. I give this book a Five out of Five stars. I get nothing for my review and I borrowed this book from my local library."
56,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2793898-deborah-biancotti,0,"An interesting story, plainly told, about a modest man (William Perkin) whose dedication to science over fame meant he never fully exploited the benefits of his discoveries. Also some passing references to the dangers of arsenic & aniline colouring techniques of the 1800s, and where the science of colour has been and come to. With some irritating quotes from the nineties, I suppose to ground the biography as contemporarily relevant.Although my little hardcover is physically beautiful and has some gorgeous mauve detailing, the author seems as dedicated as his subject is to avoiding any kind of drama. An example (read all of it, I double-dare you):""Perkin resumed his research into unsaturated acids until confined to bed on the morning of 11 July 1907. 'Although he complained of suffering pain he spoke hopefully of his condition,' Mendola noted, 'and anticipated being soon able to leave his room.' But it was a false note. Perkin had entered the arena of the unwell with double pneumonia and appendicitis, and these proved more serious than he or his family first realised. Near the end, Lady Perkin told her husband that they must soon be separated for a time. According to The Christian newsletter, his reply was: 'May you have much of the joy of the Lord.' An attendant told him, 'Sir William, you will soon hear the ""Well done, good and faithful servant"".' Perkin observed: 'The children are in Sunday School. Give them my love, and tell them always to trust Jesus.' He then let out the first verse of the hymn 'When I Survey the Wondrous Cross', and when he reached the last line, 'And pour contempt on all my pride', he said, 'Proud? Who could be proud?'Then he fell asleep. Then he woke up, and at about six o'clock in the evening on 14 July 1907, he died, aged sixty-nine. His friends agreed, in view of his activity, his death could not be regarded as premature.""Yes. Just be glad the author didn't take us through every single 'then he fell asleep, then he woke up' that probably really did happen over those 3 days in the 'arena of the unwell'. It's clear that a biography which includes such a modest man must be difficult to research, but other details - like, how it *feels* to suffer double pneumonia and appendicitis - could probably be found in medical books, and would have added to the realism and drama. And don't his friends sound awful?In the end I felt that the author and I were after two very different kinds of details. I still don't know how Perkin felt about his achievements or whether he would have agreed with his friends, I lack vivid or grounding details on the arsenic deaths of factory workers poisoned by their work with colour. And what colour *did* replace 'mauvine' in public fashion in the mid-1860s?It did open my eyes to a fascinating era in human technology, though. Definitely keen to find more books on 19th century science. (Suggestions, anyone?) :)"
57,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2019392-coby,5,"Mauve is an informative mix of science, history, and biography. Simon Garfield tells the story of William Henry Perkin who created the dye color mauve from coal tar extracts while searching for a synthetic form of quinine in 1856. What Perkin did at the age of eighteen was begin the modern synthesis of organic compounds from fossil fuels that have transformed the world from a mid-19th century world to the one of today. His accidental discovery of the first aniline dye through a trial and error experimentation started organic chemistry on the path of modernity by taking it out of the haphazard and theoretical world of academe and integrating it into the industrial world. The changes he produced by synthesizing one color, mauve, brought about a revolutionary change in which we saw colors, eventually resulting in the approximately 7500 colors available today. His synthesizing technique using the various hydrocarbons available from coal tar, a waste product of coal, combined with other substances made it possible to synthesize any natural organic compound. It initially revolutionized the textile industry. No longer were the dyers dependent on the natural supplies of madder, indigo, murex, cochineal for dyestuff. They could now use the synthetic aniline dyes produced from the ample supply of coal tar. The range of colors was also considerably larger. Perkin's work eventually led to the development of explosives, perfume, photography, modern medicine, and the plastics industry. Garfield points out for one man to have such an influence over future developments, Perkin is a little known figure today. Fifty years after the development of mauve, he was praised internationally by chemists and some industrialists. By the centenary of his birth, he was praised by parts of the chemical world. Today very few chemists remember him. I found this book to be both fascinating and compelling. As a fiber person, the history of dyeing and development of man-made fibers is wonderful. Garfield writes in a style, which made the book hard to put down. He prefaces many of the chapters with quotes from people of the 19th century and the late 20th century regarding the topic of the chapter. He also ends many chapters with contemporary stories relating to the topic. The technical discussion of organic chemistry and synthesizing techniques are complex enough to make the reader understand what Perkin accomplished without overwhelming the non-scientist."

Overall, I found this book to offer a fascinating look at the background of the chemical industrial revolution, when people started to believe that science could best nature.

Coal-tar derivatives had enabled the German bacteriologist Paul Ehrlich to pioneer immunology and chemotherapy.

He used it to prepare a special solution of rubber, applied it to two pieces of coat fabric, and called it a raincoat, but other people soon began calling it a macintosh."" (p. 24) (I always wondered about that.)[by Richard Owen]""Already, natural processes can be more economically replaced by artificial ones in the formation of a few organic compounds...It is impossible to foresee the extent to which chemistry may ultimately, in the production of things needful, supercede the present vital energies of nature.""

59,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7617066-jenny-gb,3,"This book details William Perkin's discovery of mauve. He comes across the color while he is working with coal tar and attempting to find some medicinal applications. He dyes a cloth that color, showed it to dyers that were enthusiastic about it, and then began to put together the means to produce the color (no easy task). The first half of the book details his life before and after the discovery as well as the changes that happened because of his work during his lifetime. The second half of the book concerns itself with his legacy and the continued influence of dyes in the next century.As a former chemistry minor in college, this was a wonderful read about a chemist who changed the profession forever. I like that the novel describes the science in an accessible way. Reading the description of the process to create Perkin's mauve I definitely felt I understood it with my rudimentary organic chemistry knowledge. I also like how humble Perkin's is despite his bold move to create his dye and bring it to the world. Yes, other scientists had seen colors before in their experiments, but they ignored any ideas of creative applications. Yes, many other scientists were working with coal tar and may have stumbled across the idea, too, but Perkins was the one with the drive to use his discovery and bold enough to enter the industry even though he would be scorned by his fellow scientists. I found the second half of the book harder to read than the first because it goes on a lot about the anniversary celebrations and the tributes given to Perkins. To me that just dragged out the book. I was interested again in the last chapter where Garfield started to detail some of the more recent applications of dyes in science, particularly medicine. I agree with Garfield's sad comment that most students these days know nothing of the history of their particular fields. This was a wonderful look at just some of the history of chemistry and recommended for anyone who enjoys sciences or fabrics/colors. It may be hard to get through if you don't have at least a basic understanding of some of the science behind it."

I wanted more of that: my absolute favorite thing in the book was the long list of where color-names come from (chemicals flowers, places, fruits, common things, etc.). Which isn't to say that the central story of Perkin, who made his discovery by accident at the age of eighteen, wasn't interesting in itself. Perkin studied and worked in the lab of August Wilhelm von Hofmann at the Royal College of Chemistry, and one of Hofmann's interests was showing ""how well the study of chemistry could produce the artificial synthesis of natural substances"" (29). One of the substances he wanted to synthesize was quinine, which was in huge demand for the prevention and treatment of malaria; Perkin's discovery, which came about at home over the Easter holiday because of his curiosity about the results of a failed experiment, was not synthetic quinine, but rather a way of treating coal-tar to make a distinctive powerful and color-fast purple dye with aniline as its base. Mauve inspired many imitators: other aniline dyes in similar shades and other shades were developed, and were manufactured (especially in Germany) on a huge scale, bringing more and brighter colors to more consumer goods. And aniline dyes like Perkin's mauve weren't just used to dye textiles: they were used to stain cell and tissue samples, and were useful in staining and therefore identifying and studying specific bacteria associated with specific diseases. They even were the starting point for chemotherapy, as scientists realized that the dyes weren't just staining the cells but reacting with matter in them. I wasn't so into the parts of this book about industry (I especially could have done without all the bits about corporate buyouts and mergers) though I did like some of the more lively bits, particularly a section on the Victorian-era dye industry's publicity battle. As more and more people made aniline dyes in various colors, worries about health risks grew: some colors used arsenic, which could pollute local water supplies and might also cause skin irritations; some doctors and concerned citizens claimed that even arsenic-free colors were irritating because of the coal-tar itself - especially in cheaper dyes that were less color-fast than Perkin's mauve. There was a push to encourage a switch back to natural dyes, but that didn't really make financial/logistical sense, and besides, the manufacturers of artificial dyes pushed back. I love this: ""Williams Bros and Ekin, from Hounslow, Middlesex, mentioned that an analytical chemist from London called Antony Nesbitt fed his rabbits for many weeks on oats which had been steeped in strong solutions of magenta, violet, brown and orange. The rabbits seemed to like it, and stayed white"" (108). Mostly I liked the bits of this book about the history of dyes and dying: I knew that cochineal was made from insects, for example, but had no idea that it took ""about 17,000 dried insects for a single ounce of dye"" (40). And I'd heard of Tyrian purple, but I loved this passage about it: Pliny described how, during autumn and winter, the shellfish were crushed, salted for three days and then boiled for ten. The resultant colour resembled 'the sea, the air and a clear sky,' suggesting that Tyrian purple defined not one particular shade but a rich spectrum from blue to black. The dying process varied from port to port, and might have water or honey mixed in to achieve different hues. (39-40)That's what I wanted more of: color as product/process and color as evocative, bits of shell conjuring sea and air and sky. "
85,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5937558-lynn,5,"Today's post is on Mauve: How One Man Invented a Color that Changed the World by Simon Garfield. It is 222 pages including an index and it is published by W. W. Norton & Company. The cover is an oil painting of Sir William Perkins. The intended reader is someone who likes science, history, and surprising inventions. There is no language, no sex, and no violence in this book. The story is told in two ways; the past is from the third person perspective with letters and other first hand documents added in for development, and the present Garfield writes from first person as he interviews people. There Be Spoilers Ahead.From the dust jacket- Born of an experimental slip, this odd shade of purple revolutionized the worlds of fashion, industry, and chemical research.Mauve is the story of a man who accidentally invented a color, and in the process transformed the world around him. Before 1856, the color in our lives- the reds, blues, and blacks of clothing, paint, print- came from insects or mollusks, roots or leaves, and dyeing was painstaking and expensive. But in 1856 eighteen-year-old English chemist William Perkin accidentally discovered a way to mass-produce color in a factory.Working on a treatment for malaria in his London home laboratory, Perkin found mauve by chance. His experiments failed to result in artificial quinine as he had hoped, but produced instead a dark oily sludge that happened to turn silk a beautiful light purple. Mauve became the most desirable shade in the fashion houses of Paris and London, and quickly led to crimsons, violets, blues, and greens, earning its inventor a fortune. But its importance extends far beyond ballgowns.Before mauve, chemistry was largely a theoretical science. Perkin's discovery sparked new interest in industrial applications of chemistry research, which later bought about the development of explosives, perfume, photography, modern medicine, and today's plastics industry.Perkin is honored with the odd plaque and bust in colleges and chemistry clubs, but is otherwise forgotten man. With great wit, savvy, and historical scope, Simon Garfield delivers a fascinating tale of how this accidental genius set in motion and extraordinary scientific leap.Review- This is why I love Garfield so much. This book is interesting, funny, moving, and very well written. Garfield takes something that I knew next to nothing about and does all that with it. Garfield is a wonderful writer. He makes the very technical world of chemistry and makes it readable. In addition to uncovering Perkin and his discoveries, he interviews people in the different industries that were affected by his work. Going from birth to his death Garfield then goes beyond Perkin into the future that he helped create. The way that Garfield blends the past and the present to make one story is brilliant and just like him. I love the way that he makes the subjects of his books so normal by showing how it intercedes with our own lives. I give this book a Five out of Five stars. I get nothing for my review and I borrowed this book from my local library."
86,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2793898-deborah-biancotti,0,"An interesting story, plainly told, about a modest man (William Perkin) whose dedication to science over fame meant he never fully exploited the benefits of his discoveries. Also some passing references to the dangers of arsenic & aniline colouring techniques of the 1800s, and where the science of colour has been and come to. With some irritating quotes from the nineties, I suppose to ground the biography as contemporarily relevant.Although my little hardcover is physically beautiful and has some gorgeous mauve detailing, the author seems as dedicated as his subject is to avoiding any kind of drama. An example (read all of it, I double-dare you):""Perkin resumed his research into unsaturated acids until confined to bed on the morning of 11 July 1907. 'Although he complained of suffering pain he spoke hopefully of his condition,' Mendola noted, 'and anticipated being soon able to leave his room.' But it was a false note. Perkin had entered the arena of the unwell with double pneumonia and appendicitis, and these proved more serious than he or his family first realised. Near the end, Lady Perkin told her husband that they must soon be separated for a time. According to The Christian newsletter, his reply was: 'May you have much of the joy of the Lord.' An attendant told him, 'Sir William, you will soon hear the ""Well done, good and faithful servant"".' Perkin observed: 'The children are in Sunday School. Give them my love, and tell them always to trust Jesus.' He then let out the first verse of the hymn 'When I Survey the Wondrous Cross', and when he reached the last line, 'And pour contempt on all my pride', he said, 'Proud? Who could be proud?'Then he fell asleep. Then he woke up, and at about six o'clock in the evening on 14 July 1907, he died, aged sixty-nine. His friends agreed, in view of his activity, his death could not be regarded as premature.""Yes. Just be glad the author didn't take us through every single 'then he fell asleep, then he woke up' that probably really did happen over those 3 days in the 'arena of the unwell'. It's clear that a biography which includes such a modest man must be difficult to research, but other details - like, how it *feels* to suffer double pneumonia and appendicitis - could probably be found in medical books, and would have added to the realism and drama. And don't his friends sound awful?In the end I felt that the author and I were after two very different kinds of details. I still don't know how Perkin felt about his achievements or whether he would have agreed with his friends, I lack vivid or grounding details on the arsenic deaths of factory workers poisoned by their work with colour. And what colour *did* replace 'mauvine' in public fashion in the mid-1860s?It did open my eyes to a fascinating era in human technology, though. Definitely keen to find more books on 19th century science. (Suggestions, anyone?) :)"
87,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2019392-coby,5,"Mauve is an informative mix of science, history, and biography. Simon Garfield tells the story of William Henry Perkin who created the dye color mauve from coal tar extracts while searching for a synthetic form of quinine in 1856. What Perkin did at the age of eighteen was begin the modern synthesis of organic compounds from fossil fuels that have transformed the world from a mid-19th century world to the one of today. His accidental discovery of the first aniline dye through a trial and error experimentation started organic chemistry on the path of modernity by taking it out of the haphazard and theoretical world of academe and integrating it into the industrial world. The changes he produced by synthesizing one color, mauve, brought about a revolutionary change in which we saw colors, eventually resulting in the approximately 7500 colors available today. His synthesizing technique using the various hydrocarbons available from coal tar, a waste product of coal, combined with other substances made it possible to synthesize any natural organic compound. It initially revolutionized the textile industry. No longer were the dyers dependent on the natural supplies of madder, indigo, murex, cochineal for dyestuff. They could now use the synthetic aniline dyes produced from the ample supply of coal tar. The range of colors was also considerably larger. Perkin's work eventually led to the development of explosives, perfume, photography, modern medicine, and the plastics industry. Garfield points out for one man to have such an influence over future developments, Perkin is a little known figure today. Fifty years after the development of mauve, he was praised internationally by chemists and some industrialists. By the centenary of his birth, he was praised by parts of the chemical world. Today very few chemists remember him. I found this book to be both fascinating and compelling. As a fiber person, the history of dyeing and development of man-made fibers is wonderful. Garfield writes in a style, which made the book hard to put down. He prefaces many of the chapters with quotes from people of the 19th century and the late 20th century regarding the topic of the chapter. He also ends many chapters with contemporary stories relating to the topic. The technical discussion of organic chemistry and synthesizing techniques are complex enough to make the reader understand what Perkin accomplished without overwhelming the non-scientist."
88,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019021-dolly,3,"Highly technical, this story offers the life story of William Perkin and the long-term results of his accidental discovery. It was the April 2013 selection for my local book club and if it weren't for that, I'm not sure if I'd have ever read this book.The narrative is informative and interesting, but I would caution that much of the chemistry discussed is probably best suited for those with strong chemistry backgrounds. Overall, I found this book to offer a fascinating look at the background of the chemical industrial revolution, when people started to believe that science could best nature. I find it completely humorous and appropriate that people in modern times are trying to find ways to become more natural. interesting quotes:""Perkin's discovery made sick people healthy. Coal-tar derivatives had enabled the German bacteriologist Paul Ehrlich to pioneer immunology and chemotherapy. The German scientist Robert Koch was grateful to Perkin for his discoveries of the tuberculosis and cholera bacilli. Dr. Schweitzer suggested that Perkin's work had led indirectly to groundbreaking advances in the relief of pain in those with cancer."" (p. 9)""In Glasgow in the 1820s, Charles Macintosh found a use for the coal tar, developing a method of waterproofing cloth. He used it to prepare a special solution of rubber, applied it to two pieces of coat fabric, and called it a raincoat, but other people soon began calling it a macintosh."" (p. 24) (I always wondered about that.)[by Richard Owen]""Already, natural processes can be more economically replaced by artificial ones in the formation of a few organic compounds...It is impossible to foresee the extent to which chemistry may ultimately, in the production of things needful, supercede the present vital energies of nature."" (p. 57)""The grim, resonant phrase 'Arbeit Macht Frei' [labor makes you free] appeared on posters in the Buna rubber factories of IG Farben before it appeared above the gates of the concentration camps, primarily as a disincentive from joining the trade union movement."" (p. 166)[by Professor David Phillips] ""I suppose you could draw a parallel with Perkin, who was looking for a medical application and found a dye, while we were working with dyes and found a medical application."" (p. 185)"
89,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7617066-jenny-gb,3,"This book details William Perkin's discovery of mauve. He comes across the color while he is working with coal tar and attempting to find some medicinal applications. He dyes a cloth that color, showed it to dyers that were enthusiastic about it, and then began to put together the means to produce the color (no easy task). The first half of the book details his life before and after the discovery as well as the changes that happened because of his work during his lifetime. The second half of the book concerns itself with his legacy and the continued influence of dyes in the next century.As a former chemistry minor in college, this was a wonderful read about a chemist who changed the profession forever. I like that the novel describes the science in an accessible way. Reading the description of the process to create Perkin's mauve I definitely felt I understood it with my rudimentary organic chemistry knowledge. I also like how humble Perkin's is despite his bold move to create his dye and bring it to the world. Yes, other scientists had seen colors before in their experiments, but they ignored any ideas of creative applications. Yes, many other scientists were working with coal tar and may have stumbled across the idea, too, but Perkins was the one with the drive to use his discovery and bold enough to enter the industry even though he would be scorned by his fellow scientists. I found the second half of the book harder to read than the first because it goes on a lot about the anniversary celebrations and the tributes given to Perkins. To me that just dragged out the book. I was interested again in the last chapter where Garfield started to detail some of the more recent applications of dyes in science, particularly medicine. I agree with Garfield's sad comment that most students these days know nothing of the history of their particular fields. This was a wonderful look at just some of the history of chemistry and recommended for anyone who enjoys sciences or fabrics/colors. It may be hard to get through if you don't have at least a basic understanding of some of the science behind it."

With some irritating quotes from the nineties, I suppose to ground the biography as contemporarily relevant.Although my little hardcover is physically beautiful and has some gorgeous mauve detailing, the author seems as dedicated as his subject is to avoiding any kind of drama. An example (read all of it, I double-dare you):""Perkin resumed his research into unsaturated acids until confined to bed on the morning of 11 July 1907. 'Although he complained of suffering pain he spoke hopefully of his condition,' Mendola noted, 'and anticipated being soon able to leave his room.' But it was a false note. Perkin had entered the arena of the unwell with double pneumonia and appendicitis, and these proved more serious than he or his family first realised. Near the end, Lady Perkin told her husband that they must soon be separated for a time. According to The Christian newsletter, his reply was: 'May you have much of the joy of the Lord.' An attendant told him, 'Sir William, you will soon hear the ""Well done, good and faithful servant"".' Perkin observed: 'The children are in Sunday School. Give them my love, and tell them always to trust Jesus.' He then let out the first verse of the hymn 'When I Survey the Wondrous Cross', and when he reached the last line, 'And pour contempt on all my pride', he said, 'Proud? Who could be proud?'Then he fell asleep. Then he woke up, and at about six o'clock in the evening on 14 July 1907, he died, aged sixty-nine. His friends agreed, in view of his activity, his death could not be regarded as premature.""Yes. Just be glad the author didn't take us through every single 'then he fell asleep, then he woke up' that probably really did happen over those 3 days in the 'arena of the unwell'. It's clear that a biography which includes such a modest man must be difficult to research, but other details - like, how it *feels* to suffer double pneumonia and appendicitis - could probably be found in medical books, and would have added to the realism and drama. And don't his friends sound awful?In the end I felt that the author and I were after two very different kinds of details.

Simon Garfield tells the story of William Henry Perkin who created the dye color mauve from coal tar extracts while searching for a synthetic form of quinine in 1856. What Perkin did at the age of eighteen was begin the modern synthesis of organic compounds from fossil fuels that have transformed the world from a mid-19th century world to the one of today. His accidental discovery of the first aniline dye through a trial and error experimentation started organic chemistry on the path of modernity by taking it out of the haphazard and theoretical world of academe and integrating it into the industrial world. The changes he produced by synthesizing one color, mauve, brought about a revolutionary change in which we saw colors, eventually resulting in the approximately 7500 colors available today. His synthesizing technique using the various hydrocarbons available from coal tar, a waste product of coal, combined with other substances made it possible to synthesize any natural organic compound. It initially revolutionized the textile industry. No longer were the dyers dependent on the natural supplies of madder, indigo, murex, cochineal for dyestuff. They could now use the synthetic aniline dyes produced from the ample supply of coal tar. The range of colors was also considerably larger. Perkin's work eventually led to the development of explosives, perfume, photography, modern medicine, and the plastics industry. Garfield points out for one man to have such an influence over future developments, Perkin is a little known figure today. Fifty years after the development of mauve, he was praised internationally by chemists and some industrialists. By the centenary of his birth, he was praised by parts of the chemical world. Today very few chemists remember him. I found this book to be both fascinating and compelling. As a fiber person, the history of dyeing and development of man-made fibers is wonderful. Garfield writes in a style, which made the book hard to put down. He prefaces many of the chapters with quotes from people of the 19th century and the late 20th century regarding the topic of the chapter. He also ends many chapters with contemporary stories relating to the topic. The technical discussion of organic chemistry and synthesizing techniques are complex enough to make the reader understand what Perkin accomplished without overwhelming the non-scientist."
118,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019021-dolly,3,"Highly technical, this story offers the life story of William Perkin and the long-term results of his accidental discovery. It was the April 2013 selection for my local book club and if it weren't for that, I'm not sure if I'd have ever read this book.The narrative is informative and interesting, but I would caution that much of the chemistry discussed is probably best suited for those with strong chemistry backgrounds. Overall, I found this book to offer a fascinating look at the background of the chemical industrial revolution, when people started to believe that science could best nature. I find it completely humorous and appropriate that people in modern times are trying to find ways to become more natural. interesting quotes:""Perkin's discovery made sick people healthy. Coal-tar derivatives had enabled the German bacteriologist Paul Ehrlich to pioneer immunology and chemotherapy. The German scientist Robert Koch was grateful to Perkin for his discoveries of the tuberculosis and cholera bacilli. Dr. Schweitzer suggested that Perkin's work had led indirectly to groundbreaking advances in the relief of pain in those with cancer."" (p. 9)""In Glasgow in the 1820s, Charles Macintosh found a use for the coal tar, developing a method of waterproofing cloth. He used it to prepare a special solution of rubber, applied it to two pieces of coat fabric, and called it a raincoat, but other people soon began calling it a macintosh."" (p. 24) (I always wondered about that.)[by Richard Owen]""Already, natural processes can be more economically replaced by artificial ones in the formation of a few organic compounds...It is impossible to foresee the extent to which chemistry may ultimately, in the production of things needful, supercede the present vital energies of nature."" (p. 57)""The grim, resonant phrase 'Arbeit Macht Frei' [labor makes you free] appeared on posters in the Buna rubber factories of IG Farben before it appeared above the gates of the concentration camps, primarily as a disincentive from joining the trade union movement."" (p. 166)[by Professor David Phillips] ""I suppose you could draw a parallel with Perkin, who was looking for a medical application and found a dye, while we were working with dyes and found a medical application."" (p. 185)"
119,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7617066-jenny-gb,3,"This book details William Perkin's discovery of mauve. He comes across the color while he is working with coal tar and attempting to find some medicinal applications. He dyes a cloth that color, showed it to dyers that were enthusiastic about it, and then began to put together the means to produce the color (no easy task). The first half of the book details his life before and after the discovery as well as the changes that happened because of his work during his lifetime. The second half of the book concerns itself with his legacy and the continued influence of dyes in the next century.As a former chemistry minor in college, this was a wonderful read about a chemist who changed the profession forever. I like that the novel describes the science in an accessible way. Reading the description of the process to create Perkin's mauve I definitely felt I understood it with my rudimentary organic chemistry knowledge. I also like how humble Perkin's is despite his bold move to create his dye and bring it to the world. Yes, other scientists had seen colors before in their experiments, but they ignored any ideas of creative applications. Yes, many other scientists were working with coal tar and may have stumbled across the idea, too, but Perkins was the one with the drive to use his discovery and bold enough to enter the industry even though he would be scorned by his fellow scientists. I found the second half of the book harder to read than the first because it goes on a lot about the anniversary celebrations and the tributes given to Perkins. To me that just dragged out the book. I was interested again in the last chapter where Garfield started to detail some of the more recent applications of dyes in science, particularly medicine. I agree with Garfield's sad comment that most students these days know nothing of the history of their particular fields. This was a wonderful look at just some of the history of chemistry and recommended for anyone who enjoys sciences or fabrics/colors. It may be hard to get through if you don't have at least a basic understanding of some of the science behind it."

However, the book is more about the chemistry of the color and its applications.

144,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1757736-heather,3,"Garfield's writing style is mostly matter-of-fact, with a few flashes of oddness or romance, which I wanted more of: I liked, for example, that he gave the recipe for Perkin's dye alongside a recipe for Nesselrode pudding (served at a jubilee dinner in New York celebrating Perkin's invention). I wanted more of that: my absolute favorite thing in the book was the long list of where color-names come from (chemicals flowers, places, fruits, common things, etc.). Which isn't to say that the central story of Perkin, who made his discovery by accident at the age of eighteen, wasn't interesting in itself. Perkin studied and worked in the lab of August Wilhelm von Hofmann at the Royal College of Chemistry, and one of Hofmann's interests was showing ""how well the study of chemistry could produce the artificial synthesis of natural substances"" (29). One of the substances he wanted to synthesize was quinine, which was in huge demand for the prevention and treatment of malaria; Perkin's discovery, which came about at home over the Easter holiday because of his curiosity about the results of a failed experiment, was not synthetic quinine, but rather a way of treating coal-tar to make a distinctive powerful and color-fast purple dye with aniline as its base. Mauve inspired many imitators: other aniline dyes in similar shades and other shades were developed, and were manufactured (especially in Germany) on a huge scale, bringing more and brighter colors to more consumer goods. And aniline dyes like Perkin's mauve weren't just used to dye textiles: they were used to stain cell and tissue samples, and were useful in staining and therefore identifying and studying specific bacteria associated with specific diseases. They even were the starting point for chemotherapy, as scientists realized that the dyes weren't just staining the cells but reacting with matter in them. I wasn't so into the parts of this book about industry (I especially could have done without all the bits about corporate buyouts and mergers) though I did like some of the more lively bits, particularly a section on the Victorian-era dye industry's publicity battle. As more and more people made aniline dyes in various colors, worries about health risks grew: some colors used arsenic, which could pollute local water supplies and might also cause skin irritations; some doctors and concerned citizens claimed that even arsenic-free colors were irritating because of the coal-tar itself - especially in cheaper dyes that were less color-fast than Perkin's mauve. There was a push to encourage a switch back to natural dyes, but that didn't really make financial/logistical sense, and besides, the manufacturers of artificial dyes pushed back. I love this: ""Williams Bros and Ekin, from Hounslow, Middlesex, mentioned that an analytical chemist from London called Antony Nesbitt fed his rabbits for many weeks on oats which had been steeped in strong solutions of magenta, violet, brown and orange. The rabbits seemed to like it, and stayed white"" (108). Mostly I liked the bits of this book about the history of dyes and dying: I knew that cochineal was made from insects, for example, but had no idea that it took ""about 17,000 dried insects for a single ounce of dye"" (40). And I'd heard of Tyrian purple, but I loved this passage about it: Pliny described how, during autumn and winter, the shellfish were crushed, salted for three days and then boiled for ten. The resultant colour resembled 'the sea, the air and a clear sky,' suggesting that Tyrian purple defined not one particular shade but a rich spectrum from blue to black. The dying process varied from port to port, and might have water or honey mixed in to achieve different hues. (39-40)That's what I wanted more of: color as product/process and color as evocative, bits of shell conjuring sea and air and sky. "

174,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1757736-heather,3,"Garfield's writing style is mostly matter-of-fact, with a few flashes of oddness or romance, which I wanted more of: I liked, for example, that he gave the recipe for Perkin's dye alongside a recipe for Nesselrode pudding (served at a jubilee dinner in New York celebrating Perkin's invention). I wanted more of that: my absolute favorite thing in the book was the long list of where color-names come from (chemicals flowers, places, fruits, common things, etc.). Which isn't to say that the central story of Perkin, who made his discovery by accident at the age of eighteen, wasn't interesting in itself. Perkin studied and worked in the lab of August Wilhelm von Hofmann at the Royal College of Chemistry, and one of Hofmann's interests was showing ""how well the study of chemistry could produce the artificial synthesis of natural substances"" (29). One of the substances he wanted to synthesize was quinine, which was in huge demand for the prevention and treatment of malaria; Perkin's discovery, which came about at home over the Easter holiday because of his curiosity about the results of a failed experiment, was not synthetic quinine, but rather a way of treating coal-tar to make a distinctive powerful and color-fast purple dye with aniline as its base. Mauve inspired many imitators: other aniline dyes in similar shades and other shades were developed, and were manufactured (especially in Germany) on a huge scale, bringing more and brighter colors to more consumer goods. And aniline dyes like Perkin's mauve weren't just used to dye textiles: they were used to stain cell and tissue samples, and were useful in staining and therefore identifying and studying specific bacteria associated with specific diseases. They even were the starting point for chemotherapy, as scientists realized that the dyes weren't just staining the cells but reacting with matter in them. I wasn't so into the parts of this book about industry (I especially could have done without all the bits about corporate buyouts and mergers) though I did like some of the more lively bits, particularly a section on the Victorian-era dye industry's publicity battle. As more and more people made aniline dyes in various colors, worries about health risks grew: some colors used arsenic, which could pollute local water supplies and might also cause skin irritations; some doctors and concerned citizens claimed that even arsenic-free colors were irritating because of the coal-tar itself - especially in cheaper dyes that were less color-fast than Perkin's mauve. There was a push to encourage a switch back to natural dyes, but that didn't really make financial/logistical sense, and besides, the manufacturers of artificial dyes pushed back. I love this: ""Williams Bros and Ekin, from Hounslow, Middlesex, mentioned that an analytical chemist from London called Antony Nesbitt fed his rabbits for many weeks on oats which had been steeped in strong solutions of magenta, violet, brown and orange. The rabbits seemed to like it, and stayed white"" (108). Mostly I liked the bits of this book about the history of dyes and dying: I knew that cochineal was made from insects, for example, but had no idea that it took ""about 17,000 dried insects for a single ounce of dye"" (40). And I'd heard of Tyrian purple, but I loved this passage about it: Pliny described how, during autumn and winter, the shellfish were crushed, salted for three days and then boiled for ten. The resultant colour resembled 'the sea, the air and a clear sky,' suggesting that Tyrian purple defined not one particular shade but a rich spectrum from blue to black. The dying process varied from port to port, and might have water or honey mixed in to achieve different hues. (39-40)That's what I wanted more of: color as product/process and color as evocative, bits of shell conjuring sea and air and sky. "

It is 222 pages including an index and it is published by W. W. Norton & Company. The cover is an oil painting of Sir William Perkins. The intended reader is someone who likes science, history, and surprising inventions. There is no language, no sex, and no violence in this book. The story is told in two ways; the past is from the third person perspective with letters and other first hand documents added in for development, and the present Garfield writes from first person as he interviews people. There Be Spoilers Ahead.From the dust jacket- Born of an experimental slip, this odd shade of purple revolutionized the worlds of fashion, industry, and chemical research.Mauve is the story of a man who accidentally invented a color, and in the process transformed the world around him. Before 1856, the color in our lives- the reds, blues, and blacks of clothing, paint, print- came from insects or mollusks, roots or leaves, and dyeing was painstaking and expensive. But in 1856 eighteen-year-old English chemist William Perkin accidentally discovered a way to mass-produce color in a factory.Working on a treatment for malaria in his London home laboratory, Perkin found mauve by chance. His experiments failed to result in artificial quinine as he had hoped, but produced instead a dark oily sludge that happened to turn silk a beautiful light purple. Mauve became the most desirable shade in the fashion houses of Paris and London, and quickly led to crimsons, violets, blues, and greens, earning its inventor a fortune. But its importance extends far beyond ballgowns.Before mauve, chemistry was largely a theoretical science. Perkin's discovery sparked new interest in industrial applications of chemistry research, which later bought about the development of explosives, perfume, photography, modern medicine, and today's plastics industry.Perkin is honored with the odd plaque and bust in colleges and chemistry clubs, but is otherwise forgotten man. With great wit, savvy, and historical scope, Simon Garfield delivers a fascinating tale of how this accidental genius set in motion and extraordinary scientific leap.Review- This is why I love Garfield so much. This book is interesting, funny, moving, and very well written. Garfield takes something that I knew next to nothing about and does all that with it. Garfield is a wonderful writer. He makes the very technical world of chemistry and makes it readable. In addition to uncovering Perkin and his discoveries, he interviews people in the different industries that were affected by his work. Going from birth to his death Garfield then goes beyond Perkin into the future that he helped create. The way that Garfield blends the past and the present to make one story is brilliant and just like him. I love the way that he makes the subjects of his books so normal by showing how it intercedes with our own lives. I give this book a Five out of Five stars. I get nothing for my review and I borrowed this book from my local library."
176,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2793898-deborah-biancotti,0,"An interesting story, plainly told, about a modest man (William Perkin) whose dedication to science over fame meant he never fully exploited the benefits of his discoveries. Also some passing references to the dangers of arsenic & aniline colouring techniques of the 1800s, and where the science of colour has been and come to. With some irritating quotes from the nineties, I suppose to ground the biography as contemporarily relevant.Although my little hardcover is physically beautiful and has some gorgeous mauve detailing, the author seems as dedicated as his subject is to avoiding any kind of drama. An example (read all of it, I double-dare you):""Perkin resumed his research into unsaturated acids until confined to bed on the morning of 11 July 1907. 'Although he complained of suffering pain he spoke hopefully of his condition,' Mendola noted, 'and anticipated being soon able to leave his room.' But it was a false note. Perkin had entered the arena of the unwell with double pneumonia and appendicitis, and these proved more serious than he or his family first realised. Near the end, Lady Perkin told her husband that they must soon be separated for a time. According to The Christian newsletter, his reply was: 'May you have much of the joy of the Lord.' An attendant told him, 'Sir William, you will soon hear the ""Well done, good and faithful servant"".' Perkin observed: 'The children are in Sunday School. Give them my love, and tell them always to trust Jesus.' He then let out the first verse of the hymn 'When I Survey the Wondrous Cross', and when he reached the last line, 'And pour contempt on all my pride', he said, 'Proud? Who could be proud?'Then he fell asleep. Then he woke up, and at about six o'clock in the evening on 14 July 1907, he died, aged sixty-nine. His friends agreed, in view of his activity, his death could not be regarded as premature.""Yes. Just be glad the author didn't take us through every single 'then he fell asleep, then he woke up' that probably really did happen over those 3 days in the 'arena of the unwell'. It's clear that a biography which includes such a modest man must be difficult to research, but other details - like, how it *feels* to suffer double pneumonia and appendicitis - could probably be found in medical books, and would have added to the realism and drama. And don't his friends sound awful?In the end I felt that the author and I were after two very different kinds of details. I still don't know how Perkin felt about his achievements or whether he would have agreed with his friends, I lack vivid or grounding details on the arsenic deaths of factory workers poisoned by their work with colour. And what colour *did* replace 'mauvine' in public fashion in the mid-1860s?It did open my eyes to a fascinating era in human technology, though. Definitely keen to find more books on 19th century science. (Suggestions, anyone?) :)"
177,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2019392-coby,5,"Mauve is an informative mix of science, history, and biography. Simon Garfield tells the story of William Henry Perkin who created the dye color mauve from coal tar extracts while searching for a synthetic form of quinine in 1856. What Perkin did at the age of eighteen was begin the modern synthesis of organic compounds from fossil fuels that have transformed the world from a mid-19th century world to the one of today. His accidental discovery of the first aniline dye through a trial and error experimentation started organic chemistry on the path of modernity by taking it out of the haphazard and theoretical world of academe and integrating it into the industrial world. The changes he produced by synthesizing one color, mauve, brought about a revolutionary change in which we saw colors, eventually resulting in the approximately 7500 colors available today. His synthesizing technique using the various hydrocarbons available from coal tar, a waste product of coal, combined with other substances made it possible to synthesize any natural organic compound. It initially revolutionized the textile industry. No longer were the dyers dependent on the natural supplies of madder, indigo, murex, cochineal for dyestuff. They could now use the synthetic aniline dyes produced from the ample supply of coal tar. The range of colors was also considerably larger. Perkin's work eventually led to the development of explosives, perfume, photography, modern medicine, and the plastics industry. Garfield points out for one man to have such an influence over future developments, Perkin is a little known figure today. Fifty years after the development of mauve, he was praised internationally by chemists and some industrialists. By the centenary of his birth, he was praised by parts of the chemical world.

204,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1757736-heather,3,"Garfield's writing style is mostly matter-of-fact, with a few flashes of oddness or romance, which I wanted more of: I liked, for example, that he gave the recipe for Perkin's dye alongside a recipe for Nesselrode pudding (served at a jubilee dinner in New York celebrating Perkin's invention). I wanted more of that: my absolute favorite thing in the book was the long list of where color-names come from (chemicals flowers, places, fruits, common things, etc.). Which isn't to say that the central story of Perkin, who made his discovery by accident at the age of eighteen, wasn't interesting in itself. Perkin studied and worked in the lab of August Wilhelm von Hofmann at the Royal College of Chemistry, and one of Hofmann's interests was showing ""how well the study of chemistry could produce the artificial synthesis of natural substances"" (29). One of the substances he wanted to synthesize was quinine, which was in huge demand for the prevention and treatment of malaria; Perkin's discovery, which came about at home over the Easter holiday because of his curiosity about the results of a failed experiment, was not synthetic quinine, but rather a way of treating coal-tar to make a distinctive powerful and color-fast purple dye with aniline as its base. Mauve inspired many imitators: other aniline dyes in similar shades and other shades were developed, and were manufactured (especially in Germany) on a huge scale, bringing more and brighter colors to more consumer goods. And aniline dyes like Perkin's mauve weren't just used to dye textiles: they were used to stain cell and tissue samples, and were useful in staining and therefore identifying and studying specific bacteria associated with specific diseases. They even were the starting point for chemotherapy, as scientists realized that the dyes weren't just staining the cells but reacting with matter in them. I wasn't so into the parts of this book about industry (I especially could have done without all the bits about corporate buyouts and mergers) though I did like some of the more lively bits, particularly a section on the Victorian-era dye industry's publicity battle. As more and more people made aniline dyes in various colors, worries about health risks grew: some colors used arsenic, which could pollute local water supplies and might also cause skin irritations; some doctors and concerned citizens claimed that even arsenic-free colors were irritating because of the coal-tar itself - especially in cheaper dyes that were less color-fast than Perkin's mauve. There was a push to encourage a switch back to natural dyes, but that didn't really make financial/logistical sense, and besides, the manufacturers of artificial dyes pushed back. I love this: ""Williams Bros and Ekin, from Hounslow, Middlesex, mentioned that an analytical chemist from London called Antony Nesbitt fed his rabbits for many weeks on oats which had been steeped in strong solutions of magenta, violet, brown and orange. The rabbits seemed to like it, and stayed white"" (108). Mostly I liked the bits of this book about the history of dyes and dying: I knew that cochineal was made from insects, for example, but had no idea that it took ""about 17,000 dried insects for a single ounce of dye"" (40). And I'd heard of Tyrian purple, but I loved this passage about it: Pliny described how, during autumn and winter, the shellfish were crushed, salted for three days and then boiled for ten. The resultant colour resembled 'the sea, the air and a clear sky,' suggesting that Tyrian purple defined not one particular shade but a rich spectrum from blue to black. The dying process varied from port to port, and might have water or honey mixed in to achieve different hues. (39-40)That's what I wanted more of: color as product/process and color as evocative, bits of shell conjuring sea and air and sky. "
205,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5937558-lynn,5,"Today's post is on Mauve: How One Man Invented a Color that Changed the World by Simon Garfield. It is 222 pages including an index and it is published by W. W. Norton & Company. The cover is an oil painting of Sir William Perkins. The intended reader is someone who likes science, history, and surprising inventions. There is no language, no sex, and no violence in this book. The story is told in two ways; the past is from the third person perspective with letters and other first hand documents added in for development, and the present Garfield writes from first person as he interviews people. There Be Spoilers Ahead.From the dust jacket- Born of an experimental slip, this odd shade of purple revolutionized the worlds of fashion, industry, and chemical research.Mauve is the story of a man who accidentally invented a color, and in the process transformed the world around him. Before 1856, the color in our lives- the reds, blues, and blacks of clothing, paint, print- came from insects or mollusks, roots or leaves, and dyeing was painstaking and expensive. But in 1856 eighteen-year-old English chemist William Perkin accidentally discovered a way to mass-produce color in a factory.Working on a treatment for malaria in his London home laboratory, Perkin found mauve by chance. His experiments failed to result in artificial quinine as he had hoped, but produced instead a dark oily sludge that happened to turn silk a beautiful light purple. Mauve became the most desirable shade in the fashion houses of Paris and London, and quickly led to crimsons, violets, blues, and greens, earning its inventor a fortune. But its importance extends far beyond ballgowns.Before mauve, chemistry was largely a theoretical science. Perkin's discovery sparked new interest in industrial applications of chemistry research, which later bought about the development of explosives, perfume, photography, modern medicine, and today's plastics industry.Perkin is honored with the odd plaque and bust in colleges and chemistry clubs, but is otherwise forgotten man. With great wit, savvy, and historical scope, Simon Garfield delivers a fascinating tale of how this accidental genius set in motion and extraordinary scientific leap.Review- This is why I love Garfield so much. This book is interesting, funny, moving, and very well written. Garfield takes something that I knew next to nothing about and does all that with it. Garfield is a wonderful writer. He makes the very technical world of chemistry and makes it readable. In addition to uncovering Perkin and his discoveries, he interviews people in the different industries that were affected by his work. Going from birth to his death Garfield then goes beyond Perkin into the future that he helped create. The way that Garfield blends the past and the present to make one story is brilliant and just like him. I love the way that he makes the subjects of his books so normal by showing how it intercedes with our own lives. I give this book a Five out of Five stars. I get nothing for my review and I borrowed this book from my local library."
206,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2793898-deborah-biancotti,0,"An interesting story, plainly told, about a modest man (William Perkin) whose dedication to science over fame meant he never fully exploited the benefits of his discoveries. Also some passing references to the dangers of arsenic & aniline colouring techniques of the 1800s, and where the science of colour has been and come to. With some irritating quotes from the nineties, I suppose to ground the biography as contemporarily relevant.Although my little hardcover is physically beautiful and has some gorgeous mauve detailing, the author seems as dedicated as his subject is to avoiding any kind of drama. An example (read all of it, I double-dare you):""Perkin resumed his research into unsaturated acids until confined to bed on the morning of 11 July 1907. 'Although he complained of suffering pain he spoke hopefully of his condition,' Mendola noted, 'and anticipated being soon able to leave his room.' But it was a false note. Perkin had entered the arena of the unwell with double pneumonia and appendicitis, and these proved more serious than he or his family first realised. Near the end, Lady Perkin told her husband that they must soon be separated for a time. According to The Christian newsletter, his reply was: 'May you have much of the joy of the Lord.' An attendant told him, 'Sir William, you will soon hear the ""Well done, good and faithful servant"".' Perkin observed: 'The children are in Sunday School. Give them my love, and tell them always to trust Jesus.' He then let out the first verse of the hymn 'When I Survey the Wondrous Cross', and when he reached the last line, 'And pour contempt on all my pride', he said, 'Proud? Who could be proud?'Then he fell asleep. Then he woke up, and at about six o'clock in the evening on 14 July 1907, he died, aged sixty-nine. His friends agreed, in view of his activity, his death could not be regarded as premature.""Yes. Just be glad the author didn't take us through every single 'then he fell asleep, then he woke up' that probably really did happen over those 3 days in the 'arena of the unwell'. It's clear that a biography which includes such a modest man must be difficult to research, but other details - like, how it *feels* to suffer double pneumonia and appendicitis - could probably be found in medical books, and would have added to the realism and drama. And don't his friends sound awful?In the end I felt that the author and I were after two very different kinds of details. I still don't know how Perkin felt about his achievements or whether he would have agreed with his friends, I lack vivid or grounding details on the arsenic deaths of factory workers poisoned by their work with colour. And what colour *did* replace 'mauvine' in public fashion in the mid-1860s?It did open my eyes to a fascinating era in human technology, though. Definitely keen to find more books on 19th century science. (Suggestions, anyone?) :)"
207,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2019392-coby,5,"Mauve is an informative mix of science, history, and biography. Simon Garfield tells the story of William Henry Perkin who created the dye color mauve from coal tar extracts while searching for a synthetic form of quinine in 1856. What Perkin did at the age of eighteen was begin the modern synthesis of organic compounds from fossil fuels that have transformed the world from a mid-19th century world to the one of today. His accidental discovery of the first aniline dye through a trial and error experimentation started organic chemistry on the path of modernity by taking it out of the haphazard and theoretical world of academe and integrating it into the industrial world. The changes he produced by synthesizing one color, mauve, brought about a revolutionary change in which we saw colors, eventually resulting in the approximately 7500 colors available today. His synthesizing technique using the various hydrocarbons available from coal tar, a waste product of coal, combined with other substances made it possible to synthesize any natural organic compound. It initially revolutionized the textile industry. No longer were the dyers dependent on the natural supplies of madder, indigo, murex, cochineal for dyestuff. They could now use the synthetic aniline dyes produced from the ample supply of coal tar. The range of colors was also considerably larger. Perkin's work eventually led to the development of explosives, perfume, photography, modern medicine, and the plastics industry. Garfield points out for one man to have such an influence over future developments, Perkin is a little known figure today. Fifty years after the development of mauve, he was praised internationally by chemists and some industrialists. By the centenary of his birth, he was praised by parts of the chemical world. Today very few chemists remember him. I found this book to be both fascinating and compelling. As a fiber person, the history of dyeing and development of man-made fibers is wonderful. Garfield writes in a style, which made the book hard to put down. He prefaces many of the chapters with quotes from people of the 19th century and the late 20th century regarding the topic of the chapter. He also ends many chapters with contemporary stories relating to the topic. The technical discussion of organic chemistry and synthesizing techniques are complex enough to make the reader understand what Perkin accomplished without overwhelming the non-scientist."
208,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019021-dolly,3,"Highly technical, this story offers the life story of William Perkin and the long-term results of his accidental discovery. It was the April 2013 selection for my local book club and if it weren't for that, I'm not sure if I'd have ever read this book.The narrative is informative and interesting, but I would caution that much of the chemistry discussed is probably best suited for those with strong chemistry backgrounds. Overall, I found this book to offer a fascinating look at the background of the chemical industrial revolution, when people started to believe that science could best nature. I find it completely humorous and appropriate that people in modern times are trying to find ways to become more natural. interesting quotes:""Perkin's discovery made sick people healthy. Coal-tar derivatives had enabled the German bacteriologist Paul Ehrlich to pioneer immunology and chemotherapy. The German scientist Robert Koch was grateful to Perkin for his discoveries of the tuberculosis and cholera bacilli. Dr. Schweitzer suggested that Perkin's work had led indirectly to groundbreaking advances in the relief of pain in those with cancer."" (p. 9)""In Glasgow in the 1820s, Charles Macintosh found a use for the coal tar, developing a method of waterproofing cloth. He used it to prepare a special solution of rubber, applied it to two pieces of coat fabric, and called it a raincoat, but other people soon began calling it a macintosh."" (p. 24) (I always wondered about that.)[by Richard Owen]""Already, natural processes can be more economically replaced by artificial ones in the formation of a few organic compounds...It is impossible to foresee the extent to which chemistry may ultimately, in the production of things needful, supercede the present vital energies of nature."" (p. 57)""The grim, resonant phrase 'Arbeit Macht Frei' [labor makes you free] appeared on posters in the Buna rubber factories of IG Farben before it appeared above the gates of the concentration camps, primarily as a disincentive from joining the trade union movement."" (p. 166)[by Professor David Phillips] ""I suppose you could draw a parallel with Perkin, who was looking for a medical application and found a dye, while we were working with dyes and found a medical application.""

209,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7617066-jenny-gb,3,"This book details William Perkin's discovery of mauve. He comes across the color while he is working with coal tar and attempting to find some medicinal applications. He dyes a cloth that color, showed it to dyers that were enthusiastic about it, and then began to put together the means to produce the color (no easy task). The first half of the book details his life before and after the discovery as well as the changes that happened because of his work during his lifetime. The second half of the book concerns itself with his legacy and the continued influence of dyes in the next century.As a former chemistry minor in college, this was a wonderful read about a chemist who changed the profession forever. I like that the novel describes the science in an accessible way. Reading the description of the process to create Perkin's mauve I definitely felt I understood it with my rudimentary organic chemistry knowledge. I also like how humble Perkin's is despite his bold move to create his dye and bring it to the world. Yes, other scientists had seen colors before in their experiments, but they ignored any ideas of creative applications. Yes, many other scientists were working with coal tar and may have stumbled across the idea, too, but Perkins was the one with the drive to use his discovery and bold enough to enter the industry even though he would be scorned by his fellow scientists. I found the second half of the book harder to read than the first because it goes on a lot about the anniversary celebrations and the tributes given to Perkins. To me that just dragged out the book. I was interested again in the last chapter where Garfield started to detail some of the more recent applications of dyes in science, particularly medicine. I agree with Garfield's sad comment that most students these days know nothing of the history of their particular fields. This was a wonderful look at just some of the history of chemistry and recommended for anyone who enjoys sciences or fabrics/colors. It may be hard to get through if you don't have at least a basic understanding of some of the science behind it."

They even were the starting point for chemotherapy, as scientists realized that the dyes weren't just staining the cells but reacting with matter in them. I wasn't so into the parts of this book about industry (I especially could have done without all the bits about corporate buyouts and mergers) though I did like some of the more lively bits, particularly a section on the Victorian-era dye industry's publicity battle. As more and more people made aniline dyes in various colors, worries about health risks grew: some colors used arsenic, which could pollute local water supplies and might also cause skin irritations; some doctors and concerned citizens claimed that even arsenic-free colors were irritating because of the coal-tar itself - especially in cheaper dyes that were less color-fast than Perkin's mauve. There was a push to encourage a switch back to natural dyes, but that didn't really make financial/logistical sense, and besides, the manufacturers of artificial dyes pushed back. I love this: ""Williams Bros and Ekin, from Hounslow, Middlesex, mentioned that an analytical chemist from London called Antony Nesbitt fed his rabbits for many weeks on oats which had been steeped in strong solutions of magenta, violet, brown and orange. The rabbits seemed to like it, and stayed white"" (108). Mostly I liked the bits of this book about the history of dyes and dying: I knew that cochineal was made from insects, for example, but had no idea that it took ""about 17,000 dried insects for a single ounce of dye"" (40). And I'd heard of Tyrian purple, but I loved this passage about it: Pliny described how, during autumn and winter, the shellfish were crushed, salted for three days and then boiled for ten. The resultant colour resembled 'the sea, the air and a clear sky,' suggesting that Tyrian purple defined not one particular shade but a rich spectrum from blue to black. The dying process varied from port to port, and might have water or honey mixed in to achieve different hues. (39-40)That's what I wanted more of: color as product/process and color as evocative, bits of shell conjuring sea and air and sky. "

With some irritating quotes from the nineties, I suppose to ground the biography as contemporarily relevant.Although my little hardcover is physically beautiful and has some gorgeous mauve detailing, the author seems as dedicated as his subject is to avoiding any kind of drama. An example (read all of it, I double-dare you):""Perkin resumed his research into unsaturated acids until confined to bed on the morning of 11 July 1907. 'Although he complained of suffering pain he spoke hopefully of his condition,' Mendola noted, 'and anticipated being soon able to leave his room.' But it was a false note. Perkin had entered the arena of the unwell with double pneumonia and appendicitis, and these proved more serious than he or his family first realised. Near the end, Lady Perkin told her husband that they must soon be separated for a time. According to The Christian newsletter, his reply was: 'May you have much of the joy of the Lord.' An attendant told him, 'Sir William, you will soon hear the ""Well done, good and faithful servant"".' Perkin observed: 'The children are in Sunday School. Give them my love, and tell them always to trust Jesus.' He then let out the first verse of the hymn 'When I Survey the Wondrous Cross', and when he reached the last line, 'And pour contempt on all my pride', he said, 'Proud?

His friends agreed, in view of his activity, his death could not be regarded as premature.""Yes. Just be glad the author didn't take us through every single 'then he fell asleep, then he woke up' that probably really did happen over those 3 days in the 'arena of the unwell'. It's clear that a biography which includes such a modest man must be difficult to research, but other details - like, how it *feels* to suffer double pneumonia and appendicitis - could probably be found in medical books, and would have added to the realism and drama.

237,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2019392-coby,5,"Mauve is an informative mix of science, history, and biography. Simon Garfield tells the story of William Henry Perkin who created the dye color mauve from coal tar extracts while searching for a synthetic form of quinine in 1856. What Perkin did at the age of eighteen was begin the modern synthesis of organic compounds from fossil fuels that have transformed the world from a mid-19th century world to the one of today. His accidental discovery of the first aniline dye through a trial and error experimentation started organic chemistry on the path of modernity by taking it out of the haphazard and theoretical world of academe and integrating it into the industrial world. The changes he produced by synthesizing one color, mauve, brought about a revolutionary change in which we saw colors, eventually resulting in the approximately 7500 colors available today. His synthesizing technique using the various hydrocarbons available from coal tar, a waste product of coal, combined with other substances made it possible to synthesize any natural organic compound. It initially revolutionized the textile industry. No longer were the dyers dependent on the natural supplies of madder, indigo, murex, cochineal for dyestuff. They could now use the synthetic aniline dyes produced from the ample supply of coal tar. The range of colors was also considerably larger. Perkin's work eventually led to the development of explosives, perfume, photography, modern medicine, and the plastics industry. Garfield points out for one man to have such an influence over future developments, Perkin is a little known figure today. Fifty years after the development of mauve, he was praised internationally by chemists and some industrialists. By the centenary of his birth, he was praised by parts of the chemical world. Today very few chemists remember him. I found this book to be both fascinating and compelling. As a fiber person, the history of dyeing and development of man-made fibers is wonderful. Garfield writes in a style, which made the book hard to put down. He prefaces many of the chapters with quotes from people of the 19th century and the late 20th century regarding the topic of the chapter. He also ends many chapters with contemporary stories relating to the topic. The technical discussion of organic chemistry and synthesizing techniques are complex enough to make the reader understand what Perkin accomplished without overwhelming the non-scientist."
238,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019021-dolly,3,"Highly technical, this story offers the life story of William Perkin and the long-term results of his accidental discovery. It was the April 2013 selection for my local book club and if it weren't for that, I'm not sure if I'd have ever read this book.The narrative is informative and interesting, but I would caution that much of the chemistry discussed is probably best suited for those with strong chemistry backgrounds. Overall, I found this book to offer a fascinating look at the background of the chemical industrial revolution, when people started to believe that science could best nature. I find it completely humorous and appropriate that people in modern times are trying to find ways to become more natural. interesting quotes:""Perkin's discovery made sick people healthy. Coal-tar derivatives had enabled the German bacteriologist Paul Ehrlich to pioneer immunology and chemotherapy. The German scientist Robert Koch was grateful to Perkin for his discoveries of the tuberculosis and cholera bacilli. Dr. Schweitzer suggested that Perkin's work had led indirectly to groundbreaking advances in the relief of pain in those with cancer."" (p. 9)""In Glasgow in the 1820s, Charles Macintosh found a use for the coal tar, developing a method of waterproofing cloth. He used it to prepare a special solution of rubber, applied it to two pieces of coat fabric, and called it a raincoat, but other people soon began calling it a macintosh."" (p. 24) (I always wondered about that.)[by Richard Owen]""Already, natural processes can be more economically replaced by artificial ones in the formation of a few organic compounds...It is impossible to foresee the extent to which chemistry may ultimately, in the production of things needful, supercede the present vital energies of nature."" (p. 57)""The grim, resonant phrase 'Arbeit Macht Frei' [labor makes you free] appeared on posters in the Buna rubber factories of IG Farben before it appeared above the gates of the concentration camps, primarily as a disincentive from joining the trade union movement."" (p. 166)[by Professor David Phillips] ""I suppose you could draw a parallel with Perkin, who was looking for a medical application and found a dye, while we were working with dyes and found a medical application."" (p. 185)"
239,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7617066-jenny-gb,3,"This book details William Perkin's discovery of mauve. He comes across the color while he is working with coal tar and attempting to find some medicinal applications. He dyes a cloth that color, showed it to dyers that were enthusiastic about it, and then began to put together the means to produce the color (no easy task). The first half of the book details his life before and after the discovery as well as the changes that happened because of his work during his lifetime. The second half of the book concerns itself with his legacy and the continued influence of dyes in the next century.As a former chemistry minor in college, this was a wonderful read about a chemist who changed the profession forever. I like that the novel describes the science in an accessible way. Reading the description of the process to create Perkin's mauve I definitely felt I understood it with my rudimentary organic chemistry knowledge. I also like how humble Perkin's is despite his bold move to create his dye and bring it to the world. Yes, other scientists had seen colors before in their experiments, but they ignored any ideas of creative applications. Yes, many other scientists were working with coal tar and may have stumbled across the idea, too, but Perkins was the one with the drive to use his discovery and bold enough to enter the industry even though he would be scorned by his fellow scientists. I found the second half of the book harder to read than the first because it goes on a lot about the anniversary celebrations and the tributes given to Perkins. To me that just dragged out the book. I was interested again in the last chapter where Garfield started to detail some of the more recent applications of dyes in science, particularly medicine. I agree with Garfield's sad comment that most students these days know nothing of the history of their particular fields. This was a wonderful look at just some of the history of chemistry and recommended for anyone who enjoys sciences or fabrics/colors. It may be hard to get through if you don't have at least a basic understanding of some of the science behind it."

However, the book is more about the chemistry of the color and its applications. My interest did not far exceed my scientific understanding, but I learned that the dye and its descendants allowed for new medical treatment. Healthy tissue takes dye differently than cancerous or otherwise faulty tissue, which led to the earliest chemotherapy and phototherapy. "

I wanted more of that: my absolute favorite thing in the book was the long list of where color-names come from (chemicals flowers, places, fruits, common things, etc.). Which isn't to say that the central story of Perkin, who made his discovery by accident at the age of eighteen, wasn't interesting in itself. Perkin studied and worked in the lab of August Wilhelm von Hofmann at the Royal College of Chemistry, and one of Hofmann's interests was showing ""how well the study of chemistry could produce the artificial synthesis of natural substances"" (29). One of the substances he wanted to synthesize was quinine, which was in huge demand for the prevention and treatment of malaria; Perkin's discovery, which came about at home over the Easter holiday because of his curiosity about the results of a failed experiment, was not synthetic quinine, but rather a way of treating coal-tar to make a distinctive powerful and color-fast purple dye with aniline as its base. Mauve inspired many imitators: other aniline dyes in similar shades and other shades were developed, and were manufactured (especially in Germany) on a huge scale, bringing more and brighter colors to more consumer goods. And aniline dyes like Perkin's mauve weren't just used to dye textiles: they were used to stain cell and tissue samples, and were useful in staining and therefore identifying and studying specific bacteria associated with specific diseases. They even were the starting point for chemotherapy, as scientists realized that the dyes weren't just staining the cells but reacting with matter in them.

Simon Garfield tells the story of William Henry Perkin who created the dye color mauve from coal tar extracts while searching for a synthetic form of quinine in 1856. What Perkin did at the age of eighteen was begin the modern synthesis of organic compounds from fossil fuels that have transformed the world from a mid-19th century world to the one of today. His accidental discovery of the first aniline dye through a trial and error experimentation started organic chemistry on the path of modernity by taking it out of the haphazard and theoretical world of academe and integrating it into the industrial world. The changes he produced by synthesizing one color, mauve, brought about a revolutionary change in which we saw colors, eventually resulting in the approximately 7500 colors available today. His synthesizing technique using the various hydrocarbons available from coal tar, a waste product of coal, combined with other substances made it possible to synthesize any natural organic compound. It initially revolutionized the textile industry. No longer were the dyers dependent on the natural supplies of madder, indigo, murex, cochineal for dyestuff. They could now use the synthetic aniline dyes produced from the ample supply of coal tar. The range of colors was also considerably larger. Perkin's work eventually led to the development of explosives, perfume, photography, modern medicine, and the plastics industry. Garfield points out for one man to have such an influence over future developments, Perkin is a little known figure today. Fifty years after the development of mauve, he was praised internationally by chemists and some industrialists. By the centenary of his birth, he was praised by parts of the chemical world. Today very few chemists remember him. I found this book to be both fascinating and compelling. As a fiber person, the history of dyeing and development of man-made fibers is wonderful. Garfield writes in a style, which made the book hard to put down. He prefaces many of the chapters with quotes from people of the 19th century and the late 20th century regarding the topic of the chapter. He also ends many chapters with contemporary stories relating to the topic. The technical discussion of organic chemistry and synthesizing techniques are complex enough to make the reader understand what Perkin accomplished without overwhelming the non-scientist."

294,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1757736-heather,3,"Garfield's writing style is mostly matter-of-fact, with a few flashes of oddness or romance, which I wanted more of: I liked, for example, that he gave the recipe for Perkin's dye alongside a recipe for Nesselrode pudding (served at a jubilee dinner in New York celebrating Perkin's invention). I wanted more of that: my absolute favorite thing in the book was the long list of where color-names come from (chemicals flowers, places, fruits, common things, etc.). Which isn't to say that the central story of Perkin, who made his discovery by accident at the age of eighteen, wasn't interesting in itself. Perkin studied and worked in the lab of August Wilhelm von Hofmann at the Royal College of Chemistry, and one of Hofmann's interests was showing ""how well the study of chemistry could produce the artificial synthesis of natural substances"" (29). One of the substances he wanted to synthesize was quinine, which was in huge demand for the prevention and treatment of malaria; Perkin's discovery, which came about at home over the Easter holiday because of his curiosity about the results of a failed experiment, was not synthetic quinine, but rather a way of treating coal-tar to make a distinctive powerful and color-fast purple dye with aniline as its base. Mauve inspired many imitators: other aniline dyes in similar shades and other shades were developed, and were manufactured (especially in Germany) on a huge scale, bringing more and brighter colors to more consumer goods. And aniline dyes like Perkin's mauve weren't just used to dye textiles: they were used to stain cell and tissue samples, and were useful in staining and therefore identifying and studying specific bacteria associated with specific diseases. They even were the starting point for chemotherapy, as scientists realized that the dyes weren't just staining the cells but reacting with matter in them. I wasn't so into the parts of this book about industry (I especially could have done without all the bits about corporate buyouts and mergers) though I did like some of the more lively bits, particularly a section on the Victorian-era dye industry's publicity battle. As more and more people made aniline dyes in various colors, worries about health risks grew: some colors used arsenic, which could pollute local water supplies and might also cause skin irritations; some doctors and concerned citizens claimed that even arsenic-free colors were irritating because of the coal-tar itself - especially in cheaper dyes that were less color-fast than Perkin's mauve. There was a push to encourage a switch back to natural dyes, but that didn't really make financial/logistical sense, and besides, the manufacturers of artificial dyes pushed back. I love this: ""Williams Bros and Ekin, from Hounslow, Middlesex, mentioned that an analytical chemist from London called Antony Nesbitt fed his rabbits for many weeks on oats which had been steeped in strong solutions of magenta, violet, brown and orange. The rabbits seemed to like it, and stayed white"" (108). Mostly I liked the bits of this book about the history of dyes and dying: I knew that cochineal was made from insects, for example, but had no idea that it took ""about 17,000 dried insects for a single ounce of dye"" (40). And I'd heard of Tyrian purple, but I loved this passage about it: Pliny described how, during autumn and winter, the shellfish were crushed, salted for three days and then boiled for ten. The resultant colour resembled 'the sea, the air and a clear sky,' suggesting that Tyrian purple defined not one particular shade but a rich spectrum from blue to black. The dying process varied from port to port, and might have water or honey mixed in to achieve different hues. (39-40)That's what I wanted more of: color as product/process and color as evocative, bits of shell conjuring sea and air and sky. "
295,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5937558-lynn,5,"Today's post is on Mauve: How One Man Invented a Color that Changed the World by Simon Garfield. It is 222 pages including an index and it is published by W. W. Norton & Company. The cover is an oil painting of Sir William Perkins. The intended reader is someone who likes science, history, and surprising inventions. There is no language, no sex, and no violence in this book. The story is told in two ways; the past is from the third person perspective with letters and other first hand documents added in for development, and the present Garfield writes from first person as he interviews people. There Be Spoilers Ahead.From the dust jacket- Born of an experimental slip, this odd shade of purple revolutionized the worlds of fashion, industry, and chemical research.Mauve is the story of a man who accidentally invented a color, and in the process transformed the world around him. Before 1856, the color in our lives- the reds, blues, and blacks of clothing, paint, print- came from insects or mollusks, roots or leaves, and dyeing was painstaking and expensive. But in 1856 eighteen-year-old English chemist William Perkin accidentally discovered a way to mass-produce color in a factory.Working on a treatment for malaria in his London home laboratory, Perkin found mauve by chance. His experiments failed to result in artificial quinine as he had hoped, but produced instead a dark oily sludge that happened to turn silk a beautiful light purple. Mauve became the most desirable shade in the fashion houses of Paris and London, and quickly led to crimsons, violets, blues, and greens, earning its inventor a fortune. But its importance extends far beyond ballgowns.Before mauve, chemistry was largely a theoretical science. Perkin's discovery sparked new interest in industrial applications of chemistry research, which later bought about the development of explosives, perfume, photography, modern medicine, and today's plastics industry.Perkin is honored with the odd plaque and bust in colleges and chemistry clubs, but is otherwise forgotten man. With great wit, savvy, and historical scope, Simon Garfield delivers a fascinating tale of how this accidental genius set in motion and extraordinary scientific leap.Review- This is why I love Garfield so much. This book is interesting, funny, moving, and very well written. Garfield takes something that I knew next to nothing about and does all that with it. Garfield is a wonderful writer. He makes the very technical world of chemistry and makes it readable. In addition to uncovering Perkin and his discoveries, he interviews people in the different industries that were affected by his work. Going from birth to his death Garfield then goes beyond Perkin into the future that he helped create. The way that Garfield blends the past and the present to make one story is brilliant and just like him. I love the way that he makes the subjects of his books so normal by showing how it intercedes with our own lives. I give this book a Five out of Five stars. I get nothing for my review and I borrowed this book from my local library."
296,0393323137,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2793898-deborah-biancotti,0,"An interesting story, plainly told, about a modest man (William Perkin) whose dedication to science over fame meant he never fully exploited the benefits of his discoveries. Also some passing references to the dangers of arsenic & aniline colouring techniques of the 1800s, and where the science of colour has been and come to. With some irritating quotes from the nineties, I suppose to ground the biography as contemporarily relevant.Although my little hardcover is physically beautiful and has some gorgeous mauve detailing, the author seems as dedicated as his subject is to avoiding any kind of drama. An example (read all of it, I double-dare you):""Perkin resumed his research into unsaturated acids until confined to bed on the morning of 11 July 1907. 'Although he complained of suffering pain he spoke hopefully of his condition,' Mendola noted, 'and anticipated being soon able to leave his room.' But it was a false note. Perkin had entered the arena of the unwell with double pneumonia and appendicitis, and these proved more serious than he or his family first realised. Near the end, Lady Perkin told her husband that they must soon be separated for a time. According to The Christian newsletter, his reply was: 'May you have much of the joy of the Lord.' An attendant told him, 'Sir William, you will soon hear the ""Well done, good and faithful servant"".' Perkin observed: 'The children are in Sunday School. Give them my love, and tell them always to trust Jesus.' He then let out the first verse of the hymn 'When I Survey the Wondrous Cross', and when he reached the last line, 'And pour contempt on all my pride', he said, 'Proud? Who could be proud?'Then he fell asleep. Then he woke up, and at about six o'clock in the evening on 14 July 1907, he died, aged sixty-nine. His friends agreed, in view of his activity, his death could not be regarded as premature.""Yes. Just be glad the author didn't take us through every single 'then he fell asleep, then he woke up' that probably really did happen over those 3 days in the 'arena of the unwell'. It's clear that a biography which includes such a modest man must be difficult to research, but other details - like, how it *feels* to suffer double pneumonia and appendicitis - could probably be found in medical books, and would have added to the realism and drama. And don't his friends sound awful?In the end I felt that the author and I were after two very different kinds of details. I still don't know how Perkin felt about his achievements or whether he would have agreed with his friends, I lack vivid or grounding details on the arsenic deaths of factory workers poisoned by their work with colour. And what colour *did* replace 'mauvine' in public fashion in the mid-1860s?It did open my eyes to a fascinating era in human technology, though. Definitely keen to find more books on 19th century science. (Suggestions, anyone?) :)"
