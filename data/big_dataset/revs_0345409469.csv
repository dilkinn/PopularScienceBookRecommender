0,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/836641-dan,5,"I sit before my computer, typing out a review of what is my favorite book. I’m daunted by the magnitude of this task, having just finished the book for the fourth or maybe fifth time. I wish I could remember when I bought this book, likely close to a decade ago, but I’m sure that I must have been awestruck to discover a book written by a man who has influenced my life and my interests to such a great extent.One of the great memories of my early life was that of waiting to plop down in front of the TV set for a few Sunday nights in 1980, as our PBS station aired a thirteen-part series called Cosmos. Accompanied at the TV by my mom and grandmother, Cosmos captured my imagination in ways that will last my whole life. It was a series not merely discussing outer space, but in fact, it addressed the history of humanity’s understanding of our place in the world, the universe, and in life. Why is the memory of a TV show so incredibly dear to me? I could say that the show opened my mind to concepts and philosophies and possibilities that I never imagined, and that’d be a fair and true statement. What really makes the series so pivotal in my life, though, is that I shared such a formative experience with my mom and my grandmother; two people to whom I owe my life, my intelligence, and, hopefully without too much hyperbole, my essential spirit. At the age of nine, it’s not very likely to imagine that I would have planted myself in front of a television tuned to PBS on a Sunday evening, but the patient guidance and love of my mom and grandmother gave me the gift of knowledge and wonder.Needless to say, I’ve always been partial to the works of Dr. Carl Sagan. Demon Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark is the first work of Dr. Sagan’s that I’ve read as an adult and in the many years I’ve owned this book, I’ve read it at least four times. Why re-read a book so often? The answer is found in my reverence of the book’s message, its point, and its passion. Not only have I read it often, but I have made an irregularly observed tradition to start each new year with a fresh reading. At least three times, I’ve picked the book up within hours of watching the ball drop in Times Square, heralding in the new year.Many who know me, already know this is my favorite book, but I’m deeply challenged when I’m asked what the book is about, and several paragraphs into my review, I’m probably overdue in attempting to answer this exact question. In this book, Dr. Carl Sagan tackles one of the key problems facing our time, as well as repeated throughout the history of our civilization, and that is the propensity for humanity to delve into our darkest superstitions and most bleak behaviors when our knowledge or ego is challenged. It seems that throughout the history of our species, we’ve turned our backs on critical thought and skepticism at times when those with claims to power and zealotry and wealth have found it advantageous and profitable to subvert the masses. Why discuss witch burnings and crop circles and claims of government coverups of alien abductions from 50 years ago? The answer lies in the here and now. At a time when every facet of our daily lives revolves around technology; when each and every human being lives under the threat of annihilation by nuclear weapons; when communications are global but subject to being monitored in violation of the founding documents of our nation (granted this is a problem that would occur years after Sagan’s death, yet it’s exactly the type of behavior Sagan speaks of), we find that critical thought wanes in the population of our own nation, not to mention that of the entire world. Credulity and old habits creep into our consciousness. Our world, our freedoms, and our lives come under attack.Go to the movies and watch ghosts haunt a house or watch the undead torment campers in the woods. Turn on the TV, and you’re likely to find tales of alien spacecraft being hidden by the government. You’re equally likely to channel surf past a shopping network selling new age crystals. But where on broadcast television are you likely to find a substantive debate on issues of education or technology? Where do you see educational programming talking about the technology that engulfs our very lives? As Sagan points out, imagine the irony that kids can watch a cartoon about a prehistoric family with a dinosaur for a pet (I actually protest... I enjoyed the Flintstones!), but may never have the opportunity to watch a show about the invention or technology of television, itself!At what cost to our freedoms, will we accept great claims without great proof? What decisions do we as a world culture need to make to grow and prosper and what can we learn from our history, replete with credulity and domination and fear-mongering?Should we shrink from the challenges of education and critical thinking, what price will we pay? Will it be our personal or national economic stability? Will we see our freedoms curtailed (as if we haven’t witnessed that already)? Or will we pay with the extinction of our species? The thesis of this book, as I understand it, is that we, as a culture and society, may be repeating a common mistake of our history: accepting a diminution of our critical thinking skills at our own distinct peril. Because of the threats we face though, this time we stand at these crossroads at possibly the least opportune of times. Throughout history, those in power or those who seek it, have abused our fears and used them to control the masses to their own advantage or profit. This book begs to serve as a wake-up call to anyone willing to accept the challenge not only to read it, but to deeply ponder each of its points and positions. It offers the methods of critical thought as the grand lighthouse by which we can safely steer our course through the treacherous times and malevolent forces we face. Dr. Sagan, true to the book’s title, offers the methods of science as a candle in the darkness in men’s souls.This book occupies a special place in my life, as I’ve stated. I believe that this is a book of such enormous importance, that it should be required reading in every senior-level high school class in the country. It may not be comfortable reading, and Dr. Sagan wrote on such an astronomically high reading level (forgive the pun, as Dr. Sagan was, of course, a world-renown astronomer) that it may take weeks or months to fully drink in the material, but the discussion that Dr. Sagan presented is vital. The arguments he presents are vital to our intellect, our freedom, and our humanity.For making me think and contemplate, reading after reading, this book scores five stars."

Honestly, this should probably be required high school reading for everyone. It illustrates clearly the many and varied personal and societal benefits gained from applying the methods of science to every corner of our thinking. The methods are the important part, the findings are just icing on the cake. It covers the dangers of unchecked ideologies and the requirement for both objectivity and wonder. Almost no topic is left unexamined. I really can't recommend this book enough."
2,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris,4,"I miss Carl Sagan.Ever since I was a kid, Carl Sagan has been the face of science for me. I would watch Cosmos and feel a sense of amazement that the universe was as wonderful as it was. He'd be there in his turtleneck and his blazer, smiling as though he'd just heard the coolest secret and he wanted to share it with you. And he did, except that it wasn't his secret. Hell, it wasn't a secret at all - it was the combined results of thousands of years of thoughts, deductions, mistakes, missteps, experiments, accidents and achievements. Whether he was talking about the orbits of the planets or the genetics of peas, you could feel an almost palpable sense of wonder coming from him. You'd listen to him and think, ""Y'know, maybe we humans aren't too bad after all....""Then the smile would fade, his eyes would get serious, and he would explain how, for all our achievements as a species, humans were still terribly fallible creatures. Our knowledge has, perhaps, outpaced our morals, and we are only a few simple steps away from losing everything that we've gained. Our mastery of nuclear technology could wipe out civilization in a day. Our carelessness with industry could do the same in a century. His earnestness was clear, as was his disappointment.It was in this latter mood, perhaps, that he wrote this book. Simply by looking at the title, one can glean his attitude not only towards science, but towards the world around it. When he looks at the world, he sees a place filled with demons - not literally, of course - the demons of irrationality, superstition and an unfortunate willingness on the part of people to believe in things that just aren't so.This book is about the advocacy of skepticism and critical thinking. In a world where people are obsessed with celebrity, where people trust their feelings over their observations, where rulers make decisions based on the predictions of astrologers, Sagan feels rather threatened.I can certainly understand why.It still angers me that now, in the 21st century, we are still arguing about evolution over creationism. It amazes me that newspapers even print horoscopes, to say nothing of the fact that there are people who take them seriously. It horrifies me that evil men are still able to use fear and superstition to convince people that they should kill in the name of God. And it saddens me that so many people have given control of their lives over to a deity rather than taking responsibility for it themselves.Sagan's premise in this book is simple: knowledge is better than ignorance. Full stop. Whether it's witches, ""intelligent design,"" UFO abduction or anything else, it is always better to find the truth rather than to rest comfortably in a lie. The truth is hard, yes, and it may feel better to stay wrapped up in our illusions, but no matter how comfortable they are, they're still illusions. Still lies.He spends a lot of time on UFOs and abductees, actually, and uses that as a bridge into other areas of skeptical inquiry. This is because UFO abductees (and the legions of enablers who encourage them - psychologists, writers, newspapers, and conspiracy nuts) exhibit the same behavior that allows unreason to flourish: an unwillingness or inability to consider other options. Yes, the UFO explanation would be a romantic and weird one, but wanting something doesn't make it so. There is probably a reason why you saw things out your window, and that explanation is probably perfectly terrestrial.Whether you're talking about UFOs, reiki, power crystals, witchcraft, tarot cards, channeling, telepathy, past lives, Indigo Children, psychic surgery, miracles, visitations by angels, demonic possession, the hollow Earth theory... The evidence just isn't there. As interesting and entertaining as a world containing such things would be, they're just not so.Wouldn't it be better, Sagan asks, if we could all dismiss such things? If everyone could think critically about them, dismiss them, and turn their vast amount of energy and resources towards actually making the world better? If, instead of putting together high budget shows about ghosts and Bigfoot, networks made programs about scientific inquiry and achievement? Or perhaps a show about mysteries that science has solved? Instead of portraying scientists as either nerds or maniacs, why not show the scientists who are looking for ways to make safer materials, better medicines and more efficient cars? I suppose that the Discovery Channel has done a very nice job of trying to realize this dream, with shows like Mythbusters, and Penn & Teller strongly advocate critical thinking in their Showtime program Bullshit! But I reckon Sagan would want more.This is where he does come across as something of a curmudgeon in this book. You get the feeling that if Old Man Sagan had his way, there'd be no X-Files or Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Flintstones. Science fiction would all be something like Contact - nothing that isn't reasonably explainable by our current understanding of science. No evil robots or planet-busting Death Stars would survive such skeptical scrutiny. Indeed, you get the feeling that he would not only disapprove of those shows, he would definitely look down on those of us who do.This is an attitude I've noticed a lot of in modern skeptics - a certain annoyance with fantasy and a rather condescending attitude towards those who haven't signed on to the skeptical view of the world. I am a regular listener of the Skeptic's Guide to the Universe podcast, and I enjoy it - except when they turn on the arrogance when talking about people who believe in things like religious revelation, UFOs and the like. I can understand the attitude towards scammers - they deserve nothing but contempt - but there are people who take real comfort in their world view, regardless of how irrational it might be. Sagan addresses this as well in his book:""All of us cherish our beliefs. They are, to a degree, self-defining. When someone comes along who challenges our belief system as insufficiently well-based - or who, like Socrates, merely asks embarrassing questions that we haven't thought of, or demonstrates that we've swept key underlying assumptions under the rug - it becomes much more than a search for knowledge. It feels like a personal assault.""He goes on later to say: ""In the way that skepticism is sometimes applied to issues of public concern, there is a tendency to belittle, to condescend, to ignore the fact that, deluded or not, supporters of superstition and pseudoscience are human beings with real feelings, who, like the skeptics, are trying to figure out how the world works and what our role in it might be. Their motives are in many ways consonant with science. If their culture has not given them all the tools they need to pursue this great quest, let us temper our criticism with kindness. None of us comes fully equipped.""So in other words, even if you know a lot, don't be a know-it-all.Sagan had a lifelong love of science and the wonders that scientists have performed. The world today, every part and parcel of it from that computer that you're reading this on to the fact that you didn't die before you were five years old, is attributable to the work of dedicated scientists trying to better understand the world. And that is the key message of this book: knowledge makes the world better. Science has performed wonders that aliens, witches and apparitions of the Virgin Mary have never been able to do.A well-educated, rational populace is the greatest protection we have against tyranny, and it behooves every citizen to acquaint him or herself with the methods and principles that science uses. It is the greatest tool available to us if we want a better world. Yes, there will be missteps along the way, but the errors of science can - if we act out of clarity and reason - be repaired. Teach your children, encourage them to think critically about the world and no one will ever gain mastery over them. For an educated person is a free one. And if you can spread this kind of freedom, then perhaps Sagan can rest well."
3,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a marvelous book about the consequences of a population being scientifically illiterate. There are numerous consequences, all of them bad. Most notably, the growth of superstitious beliefs can lead to terrifying witch hunts that grow and grow, leaving a broad trail of torture, execution, mass hysteria and paranoia. Interestingly, Carl Sagan holds up science and democracy as mutually supporting concepts. He cites Frederick Douglass, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson as examples of literacy, and science literacy in particular, for supporting democracy. This concept is developed further by Timothy Ferris' excellent book, The Science of Liberty: Democracy, Reason, and the Laws of Nature.Sagan spends a lot of time explaining the reported sightings of UFO's and aliens. I particularly enjoyed this passage: ""Occasionally, I get a letter from someone who is in 'contact' with extraterrestrials. I am invited to 'ask them anytheng.' And so over the years I've prepared a little list of questions. The extraterrestrials are very advanced, remember. So I ask things like, 'Please provide a short proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.' ... I never get an answer. On the other hand, if I ask something like 'Should we be good?' I almost always get an answer.""Sagan also quotes many of the letters that he received, some hilarious, and others quite sad. For example, a tenth-grader wrote, ""Our society is doing just fine with what discoveries we are making. It's going slowly, but the cure for cancer is coming right along."" A parent wrote, ""The problem in science education is that God isn't sufficently honored."" Concerning UFO's, ""I'm going to lobby my Representative to try to cancel funds for this program of listening for alien signals from space, because it would be a waste of money. They're already among us.""Sagan has some interesting approaches for making science more interesting. He claims that since many kids are interested in sports, there is a wealth of science concepts to teach related to sports. Probability, winning streaks, ballistics, angular momentum, and center of mass are all useful concepts. Even though this book was published eighteen years ago, it is just as relevant today, as when it was written. In fact, the growth of pseudo-science is still rampant, and scary (thinking about anti-vaccine campaigns, climate-change deniers, exorcism, astrology, ESP, and anti-environmentalism.) Sagan is famous for ""popularizing"" science, but he writes that it isn't an easy task. For example, a deep understanding of quantum mechanics really does require about 15 years of study of mathematics and physics, and quantum theory is ""so resolutely counterintuitive."" But an esoteric religion may require a similar degree of study before acquiring a deep understanding. So, how are religions any different from quantum mechanics, when they are both equally mysterious? The first difference, Sagan explains, is that quantum theory works; it makes extremely accurate predictions that can be observed and measured. The second difference, is that religions are ""infallible"" and rely on faith, while science advances and relies on experience--it never stands still."
4,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69589444-jen,5,"Helluva book, comrades. The book which did more grunt work than any other to transform me from a soft headed, uncritical thinker, into a savage, evidence seeking, joy murdering empiricist. So I’m going to avoid sullying it with the vulgarity which has come to define my common rhetorical flourishes. There will be no meandering. Understand? No digressions. I will not stoop so low as to flank grammarian inquisitors with rapid fire similes in order to escape their censure. I will definitely not flee from them while they’re entangled in melee. Gleefully cackling: “Not a finger, you bastards! Not a finger!”Are you desperately seeking a guide to shoring up your intellectual defenses in the face of specious polemics, political/religious/corporate/butter pecan flavors of pseudo-science, flat-earthers, no-spacers, QAnon'ers, crystal healers, porkchop mystics, wererats, painfully uninteresting bilaterally symmetrical alien life forms with cumbersome over sized heads, radium in your tooth paste, alternative facts, chem trails, cryptozoologists in Thundercats cosplay, horse sized ducks, Ms. Cleo, spoon fetishists, complex geometrical approximations based on macaroni casting, Tom Cruise, 8 minute abs, the Bermuda Triangle, Area 51, astrology, ESP, duck sized horses, and the regression of human civilization back into the dark ages? Well hold on to your tits, because this is the one. Have you ever, while attempting to navigate the world with no pharmaceutical intervention whatsoever, found yourself engaged in debate with someone harboring a dogmatic belief in the moon being made out of coagulated KY Jelly? Did you first interpret this as a good-natured ploy to wind you up, only to later undercover searing conviction? Did the ablative coating on your synaptic marbles flake away as the contorted death mask of your shrieking incredulity painted a line of fire across the sky, plowing mug first through a frictional sea of stupidity, only to explode over Tunguska in inarticulate rage? This sound very much like an anger management problem.This book is about the power of scientific reasoning and the need for skepticism. This book is about not being a sucker. Not being a mark. Not being a damned fool. And, trust me, (if not me, trust your boy Sagan), you are the easiest person to fool. It requires systematic training and constant vigilance to overcome the cognitive bias that resides deep in your source code. All of us are prone to rely on heuristics of thought. Cognitive short hands. Intuitions informed by the limited scope of the ancestral African savanna. Useful in their respective contexts. But often disastrous when applied to the complex societal problems of a technologically advanced civilization. If there’s any flaw in the system deserving of our individual and collective attention, it is devising better pedagogical correctives for these shortcomings.Ways to expand our empathy beyond its archaic, parochial boundaries. Ways to defuse ancient sectarian violence. Ways to evaluate policies to better navigate imminent environmental catastrophes. Ways to ameliorate suffering in all its varied forms. Ways to distribute ourselves across the galaxy, so that our species may survive the inevitable extinction events battering down our door like Jack Nicholson riding a gamma ray burst. Science, and the technological offspring it has produced, can only be stewarded by a population that understands, at least in broad strokes, the ramifications of its ideas, and the system of thought responsible for producing, critiquing, and improving them.Yet, as Sagan lamented in this book, the institutions have failed to promote and make palatable these concepts of vital importance. They failed in Sagan’s time, and fail in a more spectacular fashion in our own time.“How can we affect national policy - or even make intelligent decisions in our own lives - if we don’t grasp the underlying issues? As I write, Congress is dissolving its own Office of Technology Assessment - the only organization specifically tasked to provide advice to the House and Senate on science and technology. Its competence and integrity over the years have been exemplary. Of the 535 members of the US Congress, rarely in the twentieth century have as many as one per cent had any significant background in science. The last scientifically literate President may have been Thomas Jefferson.”This book was written in 1995. It’s sobering to think of how that passage might differ today. How much more desperate it would seem if addressing the bombastic buffoonery of public discourse in America. Our denigration of truth in favor of vacuous memes. Our hunger for scandalous political pit fights and our spurning of long form, nuanced conversation. The paradoxical Silo'ing of thought in a world that’s more connected than ever before. The constant appearance of echo chambers in an age of democratized information. There’s a lot in this book to help one take up arms against a sea of irrationality, but it’s hard to imagine it having any appeal to someone who isn’t already interested in issues of this kind. And that’s the rub. Our best minds should be hellbent on making these issues more palatable and comprehensible.Carl Sagan was an astrophysicist, a humanist, and a tireless champion for better education. He ignited curiosity in me, and many others, with the series Cosmos. My stars and garters, I sure do miss him. Let’s go out with an ominous bit from the book, and hope that it’s prophetic force does not fully manifest before we get our shit together.“Avoidable human misery is more often caused not so much by stupidity as by ignorance, particularly our ignorance about ourselves. I worry that, especially as the millennium edges nearer, pseudoscience and superstition will seem year by year more tempting, the siren song of unreason more sonorous and attractive. Where have we heard it before? Whenever our ethnic or national prejudices are aroused, in times of scarcity, during challenges to national self-esteem or nerve, when we agonize about our diminished cosmic place and purpose, or when fanaticism is bubbling up around us - then, habits of thought familiar from ages past reach for the controls. The candle flame gutters. Its little pool of light trembles. Darkness gathers. The demons begin to stir.”"
5,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1836077-lightreads,2,"Hey, so, guess what? People who read the Weekly World News are stupid, but scientists are awesome! Did you know that?I just put this book down, 175 pages in. It's not that I disagree with the thesis, because I actually don't at all. Sagan uses the widespread belief in alien abductions to talk about the need for more critical thinking in this world. And I'm totally there -- yes, for the love of God, teach people to distinguish between fact and what they want to be fact. But Sagan goes on -- and on and on -- about the evils of unexamined credulity, and how so much of what we believe is contextually determined and not logically deduced, and then he turns around and says 'therefore empiricism is the only truth.' And then completely fails to deal with the indeterminacy problem -- all the ways empiricism is also an ordinal choice, not some universal baseline against which to measure all intellectual thought. I mean, I'm as much a fan of the scientific method as the next well-educated dabbler, but I'm rendered irretrievably cranky by a guy touting the holy purity of his truth mechanisms when his argument basically boils down to, ""the scientific method works! I've tested it! With the scientific method!"" And never stops to wonder about his contextual determinants.Actually, that would be more okay if I could discern a point. Sagan waxes on and on and on about why people come to believe they were abducted, why other people believe them, where such mass dilusions historically might come from. And it's written in this snotty, ""now you see the error of your ways,"" tone when, you know, I sort of suspect the Weekly World News readership is not also snapping up this book. That, and Sagan was a much better astrochemist than a psychologist or historian.Meh."
6,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"Sagan has been a hero of mine since I saw Cosmos years and years ago. Now that was one of the truly great science documentaries and one that, on the subject of physics, has rarely been bettered.This is a supurb book. Many people say things like, ""I've no idea how people without a belief in the supernatural can bare to live in this world"". Well, Sagan gives a powerful answer here. Sagan understood the infinite joy that comes from understanding something about the world - something that is real. He feared for our future, particularly in a modern world brimming with nuclear weapons when so many people know nothing at all about science. In this sense Sagan turns the standard argument on its head, rather than faith based beliefs offering comfort, they actually present a series of demons and therefore make your life a much more frightening place than it would have been if you had just confronted reality in the first place.In a world overflowing with pseudo-science and new age madness Sagan offers a candle in the dark - and one that doesn't require you to dance around naked while chanting to the moon goddess. Well, unless you really want to."
7,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57090347-maria,5,"This is a wonderful, important and scary book that has not aged much at all. I was made aware of its existence in a rather unconventional way: through a video game called The Witness. In The Witness, you explore an unreal and mysterious island, solving maze puzzles that gets more and more complex as you go along. Scattered around the island you'll find audio logs containing quotes on science and religions from around the world and across time, and these sometimes gives you abstract hints on how to solve the puzzles. If you dig deep enough into this game you might discover an area containing audio logs were the creators of the island talk about the purpose of the island and discuss the choice of content for the other, easier to find, audio logs. And this is where I first heard about Demon-Haunted World and Sagan:  So next I want to present this problem. Which is that I don't think we have enough smart representation of materialist atheists, physicalists, anything in that neighborhood of ideas. And I've been trying to do something about that, but it's hard. The problem is that most coherent atheist screeds are focused on defeating some specific idea of God or are angry about the historical activities of organized religions - rather than say, from first principles making a good case for the impossibility of any concept of God, which would be more like what we are after.  [...]there is a large contingent for present day real scientists who believe in some form of atheist materialism and whose beliefs have been carefully considered. So we need to ensure that we respect that viewpoint. [...]Carl Sagan has a good piece in, umm, Demon-Haunted World?, where he talks about science as a profound source of spirituality. But he doesn't mean mystical spirituality, he means ... this pure dedication to truth, and the development of a wise perspective on our place in the world. It's nice. And it's a picture of atheism that isn't hostile or contemptuous.The quotes above describes Sagan's project very well. He tries very hard not to just make fun of weird things people believe in, but to discuss them properly. That includes looking into how the human mind works, and he underlines the importance of understanding that our perception of the world around us is highly subjective, that evolution has shaped us to be afraid of the dark and of the unknown, and how our brains are hardwired to see faces and meaningful patters everywhere - whether they are there or not. Astrology is just one example: No stuffy dismissal by a gaggle of scientists makes contact with the social needs that astrology - no matter how invalid it is - addresses, and science does not. It's completely understandable that most of us wants our lives and our place in the world to be important somehow - that our existence is not mere chance, that is has meaning. In addition to that, religion promises an afterlife - which obliterates the consequences of death. We want to believe in something, not only because many of us are raised religious, but also because facing the world as an atheist is difficult. Many of us passionately prefer to be the personal handicraft of God than to arise by blind physical and chemical forces over aeons from slime. But we can't believe in something just because it makes us feel good, safe, comfortable or entitled.  In this context, science is a system that can help us navigate the world, and understand when we are (probably) right and when we are (probably) wrong:As I've tried to stress, at the heart of science is an essential balance between two seemingly contradictory attitudes - an openness to new ideas, no matter how bizarre or counterintuitive, and the most ruthless skeptical scrutiny of all ideas, old and new. This is how deep truths are winnowed from deep nonsense.  One of the reasons for its success is that science has built-in, error correcting machinery at its very heart. With this mindset, Sagan approaches and dissects some of the myths of our time, with a main focus on alien abduction stories, crop circles, and astrology, and he does it very convincingly. By drawing lines back to the Inquisition witch hunts, and other stories from the past that turns out to have a lot in common with alien abduction stories, he shows us the fallacies of both (the book also contains a baloney-detection kit, by the way). Sagan also scrutinizes several examples of how therapists and the legal system sometimes fail because they don't apply a scientific mindset or understand the research available to them. I really enjoyed all the psychology and anthropology in Demon-Haunted World, these are fields of study I find utterly fascinating. Sagan shows us how, and under what circumstances, science and technology can be developed - and what has historically prevented or hindered this from happening (not all societies are equally suited). And in doing so, he also enters into the political sphere. This, more than anything else, ensures that this book is still relevant today.  Sagan investigates moral issues within science, how it can be both dangerous and arrogant, as well as the shortcomings of the U.S. educational system and the dangers this pose. This constitutes the scary part of the book. A well educated public and a free press that wants more than just to make money on entertainment, is paramount to preventing a democracy from degenerating into totalitarianism. If power corrupts - and it does - we need other forces to keep our leaders in check. The poorer quality of education people have, the less they can contribute to maintaining free democracies. Demon-Haunted World left me with the feeling that science is a very fragile field, at the mercy of much bigger forces in society that might topple or corrupt it. The book is extremely informative, but most of all it works as a warning. We consider ourselves to be enlightened, civilized people, safe in our modern world. Sagan shows us that that's not necessarily true, and that the world moving forward is not something automatic or matter of course.What I loved the most about this book was the broad strokes. Sagan shown us the place of science and critical thinking in history, what shapes it, was hinders it - on a very large scale. This gives us a much deeper insight than if he had focused on a narrower field."
8,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1785766-david,1,"Full disclosure here, I did not finish this book; I made the decision to stop reading it after around 100 pages. I kept expecting the science to start at any page, but I got tired of reading accusations that the Weekly World News and Beavis and Butt-Head are sources of ignorance and misunderstanding. I won't argue that either of these are intellectual, but at best these are forms of entertainment and that is largely a product of taste, not intellect. I couldn't risk wasting my time reading another 100 pages of more of the same.The last time I thought that WWN might be reporting real news I was maybe 11 (although I did buy their Saddam and Bin Laden wedding spectacular issue, but only for the pictures). If an adult thinks that stories in the paper are real, their problems will not be solved by not having access to WWN. If he had instead criticized the Discovery Channel for their UFO coverage he'd have a point. They are at least giving a pretense of showing knowledge-based programming. As it stands it's like citing The Colbert Report as a source of vile right wing hate. It completely misses the point.As for Beavis and Butt-Head, sure it is stupid humor, but just because it is not Sagan's brand of humor doesn't mean that watching it causes stupidity (and merely accusing it of causing stupidity is a pretty unscientific method of demonstration). Not only does Sagan admit that he has never even watched the show, but he does so proudly. This strikes me as an arrogant attempt at justifying his own taste as a sign of mental superiority while cutting down other tastes. Mike Judge's subsequent works have even been quite clever. Sagan might have even enjoyed Idiocracy and considered it a poignant criticism of the very dumbing down of society that his book is supposed to be about.Sagan was a big marijuana advocate and as such marijuana is absent from his list of criticisms. I am not saying that it causes dumbing down, there certainly are smart people who use it responsibly, but there is also a common stereotype associated with it (I think most of us know more of the stereotype pothead than the intellectual type). I am surprised Sagan was not able to look at his own experiences with this past-time and how they differ from the stereotypes and apply that to other issues.If this book had dived right into scientific examinations of ghosts and UFOs I would have absolutely finished it. 100 pages may not have been the whole book, but it was far too many pages dedicated to something that was not ""Science as a candle in the demon haunted world"" for my taste."
9,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1022982-brad,4,"If Richard Dawkins' The God Delusion is a nuclear bomb in the atheist arsenal, Carl Sagan's The Demon-haunted World is an anti-personnel mine.Where Dawkins goes for maximum destruction, piling the misery and mockery on those he's battling, Sagan doesn't even acknowledge his enemy. The Demon-haunted World poses, instead (and very effectively), as a book in defense of skepticism, a book persuading the unskeptical to embrace reason in the form of open-mindedness, the pursuit of evidence, and a thirst for asking questions of everything.To this end, Sagan takes on some of his favourite topics -- witch burning, demonic possession, science illiteracy, repressed memories, psychology, parapsychology, superstitions, UFOs and alien encounters -- and pokes at them with his skeptical stick to show us how a good skeptic (or good scientist) gets to the heart of an issue. He offers lessons in detecting fallacy (or ""baloney,"" to use Sagan's technical term) and how to avoid it in our own arguments. He make a case for the importance of being skeptical of ourselves, our leaders, and our most cherished beliefs. And underneath it all is a carefully mounted attack on theism. Sagan avoids detonating his explosives himself. He piles the dirt and camouflage on his landmine, hiding it with the skill of an old campaigner. He offers supposedly clear paths through the field, hoping that more than one will unwittingly trip the explosives and blow their belief systems to pieces. I wonder, though, if Sagan's plan is too subtle to really make a difference. I wonder if Dawkins' preference for arguments of mass destruction is more effective. I felt like a sapper in Sagan's minefield. Aware or the landmines, appreciating their design, loving the patterns in which they were laid, but certain that most of Sagan's targeted personnel would simply wander through the field, unscathed, beneficiaries of their own dumb luck. Whether Sagan's weapons have taken any theist casualities or not, it is a wonderful book about skepticism. A wonderful reminder to be ever vigilant. A book I can't wait to pass on to my children. But it also made me just a little sad. I wish he'd been around when the Patriot Act was drafted. His voice would have been an important voice of dissent, and perhaps the USA wouldn't be as deep in the shit as they are. "
10,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112699911-orhan-pelinkovic,4,"The Demon-Haunted World is the 4th Carl Sagan (1934-1996) book that I've read. There is no doubt this astronomer can write. Sagan with this book has shifted from his usual topic of astronomy and astrophysics to lecturing the reader against pseudoscience, superstition, and some theological teachings.Sagan successfully debunks the pseudoscience beliefs, such as ufology, with well presented arguments (sometimes over-elaborated) as these observers or believers never demonstrate clear evidence for their extraterrestrial visitors or abductors. Sagan advises that skepticism that is usually not taught in schools should be applied when hearing such stories.Some people that suffer from hallucinations or are prone to deceit convince themselves they saw human like faces, temples, and religious symbols in the sky, on the moon, or on other planets. In fact they are consciously or subconsciously searching for physical evidence and ""signs"" to support their beliefs or are gullible enough to believe (or this is a result of their illness) in the existence of a supernatural event. At times like these our rationality should takeover to distinguish truth from falsity. We have to be aware of our human fallibility, therefore, when witnessing and hearing about such occurrences we should employ a constructive evaluation of that event.We are advised to think scientifically, following the scientific method, and to only believe in verified science data confirmed by experiments. Along with that we must not lose our capacity for critical thinking. Sagan recommends using his baloney detection kit to expose the falseness of such ideas and beliefs.The book does not clearly introduce what this scientific doctrine or manifesto would look like or should one exist at all? Also, science and occasionally some morally ambiguous scientist do not have the best reputation. For many of us it is not clear if some scientific achievements, such as the process and development of nuclear weapons, are more of a benefit or danger to our society and existence? On the other hand, for many of us it would be difficult to find consolation and purpose in this atheistic sounding universe.The last quarter of the book discusses, in a rather displeasing and concerning tone, the US education system and the lack of funding for science and research projects which gave a political connotation to these last couple of chapters. All in all, this book is written for the general reader and I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about pseudoscience.Sagan's love for science is clear and this book is more like his personal statement. I have to say I agree with his arguments. On the other hand, it's perhaps our ability of imagination and fantasizing, not critical and rational thinking, what intellectually separates us from other living beings? Which in return could be an essential capability behind human scientific achievements. Therefore, pseudoscience could be viewed as an expected side effect of science. Perhaps, you can't have one without the other."
11,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/259402-sebastien,5,"Wow. Just wow. This is one of the great paeans to science, logic, and critical thinking buttressed by philosophy and deep moral sensibility. This is the first book of Sagan's I've read, I was so impressed, wonderfully written, very accessible and easy to read. He is a scientist by training, a highly critical thinker, but he is clearly a very multidimensional multitalented man. He has grounding in many other areas outside of science, including philosophy, political science, questions of morality, etc... I found him to be extremely intelligent and well thought out in his thinking (I would've been surprised if it had been otherwise haha!), but he also manifests a deep and what I feel is a true humility which adds power to his positions. He is exquisitely rational, but he is also deeply compassionate and filled with wonder.This book should be required reading for all our children, and heck all the adult population. It provides a blueprint for the way I feel we should approach life and existence. Sagan through a variety of examples, shows the carnage that can take place when fake facts, uncritical blind emotional thinking takes over. We are more easily manipulated, more liable to fall under the sway of unscrupulous authoritarians that take advantage of a credulous populace. None of us is impervious to bias and dogma, but we can continually try to check these basic human impulses by working to hone our critical thinking, by learning how to think and analyze the strength of evidence, by striving to keep our minds open to new information... Inflexibility of mind and blindly rejecting (new) information because it doesn't fit our preconceived notions and narratives is pernicious, closed-system ideological thinking is a great danger to our society and culture. We should use the scalpels of rationalism and critical thinking as equally towards our own notions as the notions that disagree with us. It's not easy to practice and no one is perfect but this is something that every one of us should strive for imo. He spends a bit of time on an interesting duality within science and critical thinking. At its core is a meticulous rationalism based upon evidence and testable hypotheses, but it is balanced and fueled by our creative wonder, curiosity, and excitement in regards to the natural world. There is always a push pull between cold hard rationalism and wonder/curiosity, but these dynamics are absolutely integral to one another and play off one another. With humility and curiosity we acknowledge our ignorance which in turn pushes us to ask questions and pursue questions and then tests that can allow us to further peel back layers of our reality and when we are lucky gain more knowledge. Pure rationalism without wonder and creativity and curiosity is an empty shell. As I see it, curiosity is the engine behind intellect and innovation.Science, unlike most faith and religion, is willing to question itself, and be guided by evidence. It is open to a type of creative destruction, old rules and established thinking is destroyed when new contradictory evidence comes to light, and if the evidence is strong and broad enough it changes the paradigms and pushes things forward. Science is not static, it is not perfect either and not immune to dogma and dogmatic thinking, but by using the scientific method, given enough time and resources, it is self-correcting. Which is more than can be said for pretty much anything else imo. As I see it the scientific method has to be one of the greatest innovations of the human species.So another aspect I love about Sagan is his compassionate and respectful methods in trying to guide people towards a more rational critical thinking methodology. Sometimes I feel that skeptics are too obsessed with their (supposed) intellectual superiority and enjoy belittling and disrespecting others who do not practice scrupulous critical thinking. They spend a bit too much time indulging in making fun of people, taking gleeful joy in bashing them. It's rather sad and totally counterproductive imo, not to mention insulting. Plus the great irony is some of these skeptics/skeptic community engage in a sort of dogma, and get sucked into a huge sort of groupthink that congeals around frigid static consensus that doesn't tolerate contradictory evidence against the status quo. It's rather weird, not every skeptic indulges in that but a good number do. That is my impression at least. If any of you have thoughts on that I'd love to hear it, maybe I'm off base. Anyways, Sagan doesn't have this self-serving style, instead he focuses on guiding and helping people, he does not go out of his way to try and show intellectual superiority and dominance. He is respectful, humble, and kind, and I think that is a beautiful way to try and open peoples' minds and guide them towards the value of critical thinking, grounded skepticism, and honest dialogue. Awesome book. Awesome dude. Sagan inspires and challenges me to be better, to do better. And I think that is awesome."
12,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,5,"Carl Sagan takes on pseudoscience. This book extolls the value of skepticism, critical thinking, and the scientific method. It should be required reading in my opinion. Unfortunately, those that could benefit most from applying more rigor in deciding what to believe will likely never read it. Originally published in 1995, he has proven to be prescient, as pseudoscience is even more prevalent than ever in recent years. Witness the rise in the number of shows about ancient aliens and paranormal activity, not to mention fake news. Outrageous claims are made and spread from person to person, and people believe these claims without questioning or proof. Why does this happen and what can we do to prevent it? Sagan attempts to answer these important questions.This book is very readable. It does not require a deep understanding of science. Sagan writes in a way that is easily understood, while not becoming overly simplistic. He does not use jargon and, not surprisingly, presents evidence in a logical manner. He provides helpful analogies and treats his audience as bright and capable of understanding. He shows how scientific advances are fueled not only by hypothesizing, rigorous testing, and analysis of results, but also by curiosity and imagination. I was surprised by how many areas outside the specifics of scientific inquiry are covered in this book, including literature, history, politics, religion, communications, education, economics, ethics, social norms, culture, and more. Science touches on almost every aspect of our lives but is largely ignored by many. Sagan’s subject matter includes debunking of such issues as crop circles, alien abductions, ancient astronauts, ESP, UFO’s, astrology, New Age mysticism, and the like. He reminds us of the importance of not confusing cause and effect, questioning claims that cannot be tested, requiring evidence to support assertions, and remaining skeptical about authoritative statements, especially if monetary gain is involved.We are bombarded daily with outrageous claims (click bait, anyone?) urging us to simply believe without scrutiny, so healthy skepticism is becoming increasingly more important in our inter-connected world. Carl Sagan died in 1996, when the world wide web was in its infancy. One can only wish he were around today to help refute today’s absurdities, which are so obviously spurious in origin. I know I am “preaching to the choir,” since avid readers regularly engage in evaluative thinking. Even though some of the references are dated, this book contains an important and still relevant message on the value of critical thinking skills. I found it fascinating. Highly recommended."
13,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5293536-melki,4,"
. . . every question is a cry to understand the world.
In a nutshell, Sagan valiantly attempts to understand why people believe weird stuff, then explains why they shouldn't. I particularly enjoyed the several excellent chapters on the importance of literacy and education. There's also a probing (Sorry!) look into alien abductions.I think this quote, included in the book, sums everything up nicely:[I]gnorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge: it is those who know little, and not those who know much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science.CHARLES DARWIN,Introduction, The Descent of Man"
14,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2946068-mitch,1,"I was very disappointed in this book. I seriously don't understand why people consistantly rated this book so highly. I'm really out of synch on this one...and here's why:Carl obviously had an ongoing religious relationship with science and boy, is he ever tiresome about it. What a reckless evangelist! He condemns everything that does not stand up to science's demonstrable standards (whether such application is appropriate or not) and then....he violates the same standards time and again in his 'logical' arguments to promote his first-love.Example: early on he says that no religion or psychic has ever foretold the future accurately, but that science has. He can accurately tell you where Uranus will be in 3 weeks. (This is accurate, but it's not exactly tommorrow's Derby winner, now is it?) Later in the book he lists several predictions he made via 'scientific reasoning' that turned out to be false.My point: he condemns all paranormal experience and religion (Show me God. You can't? Then he doesn't exist. Neither do souls. That stuff is hooey.) He then turns around and expects blind faith in science...let's dump millions into research for research's sake and trust that it will be good for us somehow.He acknowledges that science has given us humans a greater capacity to harm one another than ever before...and calls for a corresponding greater morality to contain it. Question: where will said greater morality come from? Science??? Perhaps he shouldn't have been in such a hurry to throw out religion. Boom!"
15,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12555370-jason,5,"If Carl Sagan was alive today I think he would probably cry if he saw the state of the world. He wrote this book as a kind of wake up call to the people and the government, he pointed out how bad the education system is, he tries to get people to understand how important science is, he warns us not to watch so much crap on TV, go out and get some real-life experiences and he warns us about the government abusing the bill of rights.Well it looks like everybody has ignored him, in fact to me things feel worse, education is still really bad (always with the cutbacks) in the UK the classes can be huge and kids can get ignored. The rubbish that is on TV is so bad that I have read over 100 books this year, the first time this has ever happened to anybody since the TV was invented (True fact!) and as for the government, at least they are working hard protecting the rich. Carl has written an interesting book here, he has a brilliant sense of humour and having a chapter in the middle with some of the letters he got from his ""fans?"" was a touch of class, just lightens the mood a bit for the second half, I do find it amazing that some of these people were actually able to write.This is one of the most thought provoking books I've had the pleasure to read, Sagan (autocorrect changes it to Satan... Interesting) has taught me all about the baloney detector and that Jesus is conspiring with Aliens to eventually take over the world. (True Fact)Blog review: https://felcherman.wordpress.com/2020..."

Where every single point seems to have been made elsewhere?Well, that's where this book went with me. From witch trials to alien abductions to conspiracy theories and a lot more, Sagan extols us to bring rational thought back to our lives. The scientific method is ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL.I totally agree, and that's why I kept reading despite every single point being a re-hash... but that's me. Sometimes we like to be reminded why we keep going, why we believe certain things, and realize that we can apply the scientific method to everything in our lives. It doesn't stifle creativity or spiritualism. It broadens everything.And it also happens to help us throw out the trash. :) WOAH! RATIONALITY! :)"

“We’ve arranged a global civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology. We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster. We might get away with it for a while, but sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces.” (p. 26)
 The omen above was put to print in 1995 and echoed throughout Carl Sagan’s prolific career as both practitioner and communicator of science. Swathed in a world so joined at the hip to science and technology, Sagan saw denial and ignorance of science as the greatest risks to human well-being and continuity. Is the past here to stay?In the US at least, conditions are none too sunny. Nearly 7 in 10 believe that angels and demons are active in the world. 61% and 48% believe in ghosts and UFOs of extraterrestrial origin, respectively. More than half doubt the scientific consensus on climate change, while one third of the public still waffles on evolution. And over half believe that God influences the outcome of sporting events. Dr. Sagan passed away the year after releasing The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark, and in the decades that have come and gone since his oracular swan song, the American electorate seems as awash as ever in pseudoscience and superstition. As momentous, relevant and urgent though Sagan’s message was, its infiltration remains woefully incomplete.The venerated astronomer, astrophysicist and cosmologist regularly popularized his lifelong passion for replacing delusion with fact-sensitive grandeur. His 1980 docuseries Cosmos: A Personal Voyage was such a groundbreaking moment in broadcasting because it showcased the degree to which science, presented properly, could warm hearts and inspire minds. In The Demon-Haunted World, Sagan continued this saga, with his inimitable style intact, but with a dire focus on communicating how science undergirds the modern world, its co-dependency with democracy and, amid the tenured struggle for progress and survival, is so often overshadowed by uncritical thinking and politicized agenda.The MethodThe uninitiated often maintain a warped view of science, that of an arcane discipline requiring superheroic intellect out to devour devout beliefs. But as Sagan spent a lifetime making clear, science isn’t just for scientists. Every one of us can revel in its fruits, be won over by its infectious appetite for discovery. Most important, we can all benefit from applying the philosophical principles on which it rests to our everyday life. What are those principles? The twinship of skepticism and trained observation fueled by an overarching preference for the truth, however inconvenient, over the psychologically comfortable. Science is far more than cold collection of data and interpretation; it is a way of thinking, an approach to the world that values the questions as much as the answers and has built-in tools for prioritizing both. 
“Some may consider this an overbroad characterization, but to me every time we exercise self-criticism, every time we test our ideas against the outside world, we are doing science. When we are self-indulgent and uncritical, when we confuse hopes and facts, we slide into pseudoscience and superstition.” (p. 27)
 Donning this intellectual apparatus full-tilt may occasion us to revisit ideas we once accepted without any skeptical filter or require we discard some beliefs long held dear. And in taking the plunge, Sagan encourages, we often find that nature is far more clever, subtle and adept at inspiring wonder than our fallible pattern-seeking devices can imagine. “Better the hard truth than the comforting fantasy. And in the final tolling it often turns out that the facts are more comforting than the fantasy…There are wonders enough out there without our inventing any."" (pp. 59, 204) While this may be new cognitive territory for some of us, the benefits are too vast to pass up. A sharp mind keeps the charlatans at bay.Key to how science delivers the goods has been its unmasking of natural processes to arrive at natural explanation. We may recall how our ancestors ascribed various features and bugs of our existence to supernatural causality: witches inflicted sickness with their spells; rain was a divine reward, drought a divine punishment; earthquakes were just the local god(s) stomping around in fits of rage; the “rising” and “setting” of the sun was controlled by the whims of the neighborhood deity; short-period comets presaged the fall of state empires. The advent of science severed the agency-focused paradigm. We learned that the ebbs and flows of celestial bodies mind predictable, calculable patterns. We discovered that weather events are beholden to entirely terrestrial phenomena. We found that transmissible disease is carried by microbes and other agents in our environment. We learned that the right medicine can cure an illness. The implications were radical, because if an illness was caused by the spell of a witch there is no reason to think we should find a natural cause for it, nor is there any reason to think we should find a natural cure. But in fact, it turned out that the right remedy could always overcome the power of “magic spells.” Per a unidirectional phase shift, super- and non-natural explanations were rendered obsolete, buoyed by an acute awareness of our propensity to overinterpret reality. 
“For much of our history, we were so fearful of the outside world, with its unpredictable dangers, that we gladly embraced anything that promised to soften or explain away the terror. Science is an attempt largely successful, to understand the world, to get a grip on things, to get hold of ourselves, to steer a safe course. Microbiology and meteorology now explain what only a few centuries ago was considered sufficient cause to burn women to death."" (p. 26) 
IrrationaliaRespect for this approach has not been universal, as a handful of minutes with mainstream media will avouch. In a world overflowing with pseudoscientific madness, Sagan divides his time between conveying the method and blitzing specific manifestations of the irrational. He casts his gaze on a whole armamentarium of woo, including creationism, crop circles, faith healing, astrology, psychics, UFOs and alien encounters. Is there anything at all behind these claims that can connect them to reality? Not if skeptical inquiry has anything to say; such notions find a vacuum of support inside, as Sagan wittily remarks, “any universe burdened by rules of evidence."" (p. 58)We learn of how two enterprising hoaxsters from Southampton fooled millions of credulants into believing that patterns in cornfields were cryptic messages from off-world. We listen in on the exploits of James Randi, who once outfoxed Australian media with video documentation of a “channeler”. Our talent for deceiving ourselves is on full display as Sagan recounts the initial frisson of seeing “faces” on Mars and assesses the merits of UFO claims from perhaps every conceivable angle. (As a pioneer of exobiological research, it’s no surprise Sagan devoted such sizable chunks to debunking UFO conspiracy tales, but he could have toggled it down a notch or two.) In turn, astrology and biblical creationism sport the same empirical garb as alchemy and witchcraft. (Quickly! Someone get Answers in Genesis on the phone.) From séance mediumship to 'spirit photography', the counterfeit carousel requires similar ingredients to survive: “what they need is darkness and gullibility."" (p. 241)Democracy and the FutureWhy haven't the contrails of science seeped into the inner recesses of society and taken hold of our discourse and policy, Sagan asks? A look to the past tells us that commitment to these ideals has waxed and waned over time, surfacing first and most clearly in ancient Greece in the form of natural philosophy. Greek antiquity’s mental preoccupation with nature was distinguished by an express concern with natural cause and effect explanation, checked against their homegrown rules of logic and deduction. This marriage of reasoning and observation nourished some extraordinarily precocious activities. Sagan charts the achievements of early polymaths like Eratosthenes—who measured the circumference of the earth, its axial tilt, as well as its distance from both the sun and the moon all with peculiar accuracy in the 2nd century BCE, Aristarchus—who presented the first known model of a sun-centered cosmos, and Democritus—who was the first to offer an atomic theory of the universe and often considered the “father of modern science.""Later societies yielded intermittent deviation from the systematic acme of Athens as triumphs gave way to enshrined overindulgence of superstition and as nationalistic fervor billowed to abnormally toxic levels. Beyond our undersized prefrontal cortex and the diversiform predispositions underwritten by our evolutionary heritage, at the heart of these setbacks lay the institution and its doctrinaire approach to knowledge. Both religious and secular governance can boast of choking free inquiry, stamping out critical investigation of the cosmos, and cultivating an infrastructural incapacity for nurturing the open exchange of ideas. Whenever and wherever this happens, humanity falters, the mind capsized under the crushing weight of tyranny. And like a derailed traincar, we inevitably throw ourselves headlong into state-sanctioned superstition and unreason.Science cannot prosper under these conditions. It stultifies and stagnates. Democracy ensures the efficacy of science insofar as it ensures all voices are heard. Science and democracy reinforce one another in this way; science depends on democratic values to function, while democracy depends sensitively on science to maintain its selected way of life, in everything from informing policy to keeping infrastructure in motion.After spending ample time surveying the overwhelming science illiteracy and innumeracy in the States, again and again Sagan returns to the point that democracy is unworkable in this environment. Uninformed citizens cannot cast informed votes. The shrieks of the ignorant become the shrieks of the next generation, who often adhere to the ideological persuasions impressed by their sheltered upbringing. So before we rebuff the allegation that beliefs in pseudoscience are harmless, we must be open to recognizing how they are emblematic of a larger infirmity. We need open-minded, critically thinking, intellectually equipped individuals exercising their constitutional duty and voting on the policies that will give shape to the parameters under which future generations may thrive or fall. 
“A proclivity for science is embedded deeply within us, in all times, places and cultures. It has been the means for our survival. It is our birthright. When, through indifference, inattention, incompetence, or fear of skepticism, we discourage children from science, we are disenfranchising them, taking from them the tools needed to manage their future.” (p. 317) 
 Closing ThoughtsSagan’s penultimate work is packed with diverse subject matter. Much more than an impassioned defense of science, The Demon-Haunted World meanders through philosophy, history, politics, religion and grin-inducing exposés on claims to reality that just aren’t so. While acknowledging the imperfections of science that come with all human endeavors, Sagan urges that when it comes to understanding how the world works and why nature is the way that it is, science seizes the epistemological crown. It is also a siren call to the coming generations: that we stifle its advance and deflect its discoveries at our own peril. With mounting concerns over a warming planet, overpopulation and sustainability, and the most forward-focused way to preserve our pale blue dot, we cannot afford to treat with insouciance its revelations. Every human should read this book.On a more personal note, Sagan holds a special place in my own intellectual journey, reviving a pulse which continues to reverberate throughout my life. His books unshackled my imagination. His words spoke for me. He gave me a voice. A man of great passion and fierce intellect, he had the uncanny ability to ambush the heart with an equal measure of poetry and humble curiosity. His words can be understood by anyone who takes the time to read them. Carl synthesized my deepest thoughts and pointed me toward new horizons. He opened my eyes to a post-religious ethos and, more than any other, inspired me to abandon the intellectual celibacy of my youth and secure a personal relationship with reality and the cosmos. If Sagan communicated anything, it’s that science is a unification measure, something in which all of us can partake. Together with reason it is among the greatest tools in our survival kit. Let’s keep them burning brightly. 
“I worry that, especially as the Millennium edges nearer, pseudoscience and superstition will seem year by year more tempting, the siren song of unreason more sonorous and attractive. Where have we heard it before? Whenever our ethnic or national prejudices are aroused, in times of scarcity, during challenges to national self-esteem or nerve, when we agonize about our diminished cosmic place and purpose, or when fanaticism is bubbling up around us – then, habits of thought familiar from ages past reach for the controls.The candle flame gutters. Its little pool of light trembles. Darkness gathers. The demons begin to stir.”

18,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26552534-greg-brozeit,5,"I consider this book to be among the most important in my library. Carl Sagan wrote it when he knew he was dying of cancer. He had an unmatched gift of conveying and explaining science to make it understandable and relevant to non-scientists. For that reason alone, it is not far-fetched to list him among the great scientific minds of the 20th century.In this valedictory statement of scientific philosophy, Sagan elevates the idea and relevance of the scientific method in our daily and public lives. It is not something to “believe in,” it is a way of looking at the world with healthy skepticism and pragmatic attention to systematic, verified observation. “Science invites us to let the facts in, even when they don’t conform to our preconceptions.” (We don’t “believe in,” for example, climate change; we make decisions to accept the validity about the prevailing scientific research and interpretation of its findings.) Sagan uses examples in history including UFOs, superstitions, dragons and other mythical monsters, and a variety of other topics to explain how science has demonstrated these things do not exist and why we should not live in fear of them. He tackles those who promote anti-science such as fake approaches to treating and “curing” diseases, how to engage in the “The Fine Art of Baloney Detection,” and how public figures use these things to distort public dialogues about policy.But the one thing that makes this book so special to me is Sagan’s connection of science to the civic education and engagement that is required of citizens in the modern world, which are essential if we are to be free. I think it worth quoting the final paragraph of this, the last book he wrote in his life, something he wrote when he knew had, at best, a few short months to live. These are quite literally the last public words of the greatest scientific communicator who has ever lived:Education on the value of free speech and the other freedoms reserved by the Bill of Rights, about what happens when you don’t have them, and about how to exercise and protect them, should be an essential prerequisite for being an American citizen—or indeed a citizen of any nation, the more so to the degree that such rights remain unprotected. If we can’t think for ourselves, if we’re unwilling to question authority, then we’re just putty in the hands of those in power. But if the citizens are educated and form their own opinions, then those in power work for us. In every country, we should be teaching our children the scientific method and the reasons for a Bill of Rights. With it comes a certain decency, humility and community spirit. In the demon-haunted world that we inhabit by virtue of being human, this may be all that stands between us and the enveloping darkness. (emphasis added)"

But I had a family to support, and the money was good even if the hours really sucked. What the hell does that have to do with this review? Well, I was involved in an awful lot of hiring and firing decisions when I worked for Foley’s (later Macy’s), and I noticed something interesting. Most of the people that I was interviewing were not particularly well educated. Their math skills were lacking, their ability to write above a fourth-grade level was compromised, and they were woefully short of critical thinking skills. Not all of the employees that I dealt with were like that, of course, there were many who were perfectly well qualified for the jobs which they were hired for, but it did spark an internal conversation within me. Later on in my career I found myself correcting essays for an MBA candidate who worked for me, because the man just could not communicate effectively in a written format. Furthermore, I had found myself arguing for years with people who espoused what I thought were strange religious beliefs. I remembered the “Satanic Panic” in the mid-1980s. I could turn on the television and find a plethora of different 24-7-365 religious channels with self-styled “preachers” all clamoring for various amounts of adulation and cash, and I wondered how anyone could be suckered into believing things which were clearly not true in the objective sense. The more I thought about it the more it all began to connect inside my head. The internet as we know it didn’t exist yet so there wasn’t a big proliferation of Flat Earthers or moon landing deniers, but it was obvious that the seeds for such a thing had already been planted. Now I was brought up in a relatively progressive household. My mother was very curious, my older brother worked in biochemistry, and my father was very tolerant of my need to read and was always ready to answer questions for me even though he had no formal schooling to speak of, though he was extensively well-traveled and experienced in the ways of the world. And yeah, all of this sounds judgmental and kind of assholish of me when you get right down to it. And yet it’s now 2019 and this quote from “The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark” resonates more clearly than ever:“One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.”With this singular quote, Carl Sagan defines the cognitive dissonance that appears to affect a significant percentage of the U.S. population. Now you have to realize that Carl Sagan was often considered judgmental and kind of assholish too in his day. He was very intolerant of pseudoscience and was a huge proponent of reforming the educational system in the U.S. to be more geared towards the teaching of the sciences along with critical and rational thinking. “The Demon-Haunted” world boils down to Sagan debunking the world of ghosts and demons, cryptids and little grey men, and religious charlatans of all stripes. And the man can write about this stuff, through 450 plus pages of sometimes dense text. DISCLAIMER: I am assuming that you know perfectly well who Carl Sagan is. From a personal perspective, he was/is one of my heroes, along with James Randi. Sagan was one of those rare scientists who could popularize science for the masses without talking down to the lowest common denominator. If you are NOT familiar with Sagan, then you should spend some time with his Wiki page:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_SaganNow, I have to throw this out there to gum up the works a bit. I am and always will be a seeker of the higher truth. I’m convinced that the scientific method is the greatest reasoning tool ever invented in the history of mankind, and yet there are still phenomena that seem to fall outside of the realm of ready explanation. And Sagan himself seems to acknowledge this with this quote:“Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light‐years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual. So are our emotions in the presence of great art or music or literature, or acts of exemplary selfless courage such as those of Mohandas Gandhi or Martin Luther King, Jr. The notion that science and spirituality are somehow mutually exclusive does a disservice to both.” What I think Sagan is saying here is that there is a mental space where reason and the search for meaning meet, bringing together the “how” with the “why” of conscious existence. Carl Jung had a lot to say on this subject as well, and you can find similar ideas in the lucid and beautiful interpretations of Eastern mysticism that Alan Watts popularized back in the 1960s and 1970s. We may NEVER be equipped as a species to comprehend the true Tao, yet we are still cognizant of the fact that there IS a true Tao to be contemplated.But I’m getting off track here. “The Demon Haunted World” is as important a book today as it was back in 1995 when it was first released. Perhaps more so, as the internet has led to the viral spread of false information and a more profound split between those who respect the idea of reasoned thinking and those who choose to bunker themselves in to a world of “alternative facts” and “fake news.” This is especially important in terms of climate science. We are at a tipping point in human existence, in the beginning phases of the sixth great extinction event in the history of the planet. We can choose to act on the information that we have, or we can choose the path of ignorance and then stand by as the inevitable happens and the human race is either wiped out or severely reduced in size and scope. Here is the most famous and widely circulated quote from the book. If you have an internet connection and use any type of social media then you have probably seen it in some form or another:“I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time -- when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.The dumbing down of American is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30 second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance.” Let me tell you, gang, we as a society are there now. Sagan saw it, but he certainly wasn’t the only one to elucidate this thought. Orwell saw it, too. Margaret Atwood saw it. Aldous Huxley saw it. Sinclair Lewis saw it. Hell, even I saw it and I’m certainly no genius. If I could wish for one thing and one thing only, it would be that every person in America should be required to read this book. I think that it should be in every school, every library, every home. And I know that it won’t reach a lot of people. One can only look at the literacy rates in the U.S. to understand that we as a society no longer read books. Those of us on Goodreads and other book oriented websites are a distinct minority. But even if it just reached a FEW people it would be worth the effort. I’ll get off of my soapbox now. I have had my say. I’m angry and disappointed in the direction that the country and world have taken during my lifetime. And yet “The Demon-Haunted World” still gives me hope, and I pull it down from the shelf every so often to remind myself that there are still works like this out there that can open minds and stimulate ideas. There is still a chance for this race of territorial primates to make the great leap into cooperative action buoyed by reason and science, and I have to hang on to that. It’s the only thing that I can do. That and to tell you that if you haven’t already read the book, then you need to. Please."

I downloaded the audio because the narration duties are shared between Seth Macfarlane and Cary Elwes, with an introduction by Sagan's last wife in her own voice. (The audio production is much more recent, 2017.... I suspect the whole fake news thing may have inspired it!) Sagan takes on many issues of pseudoscience, at times directly debunking, at other times suggesting the logical questions to ask that might lead to better conclusions. Alien abductions, UFOs, crop circles, fairies, etc. This was a great pick for Science September!""We cannot have science in bits and pieces!""""If we have no idea of the answer, we can... take the child to the library... every question is a cry to understand the world."""
21,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74816651-fran,5,"This book is a favorite of mine. It’s non-fiction. It’s very full of science and scientific principles and explanations. It’s also full of respect for those who want to understand the world better. And that is Carl Sagan for you in a nutshell: A caring person, a scientist who throughout his life always took other people seriously, and endeavored to understand them and help them.Very few scientists, I think, have taken the time to consider other people’s fears, their anxieties and compulsions. Sagan did, and because of that, he understood the appeal of simple explanations and answers, and dedicated a big chunk of his time to present the reality of our universe in a way most people could understand. And that is The Demon-Haunted World in a nutshell: a wonderful presentation of our surroundings based on the principle that startling claims should be supported by evidence that can be tested and challenged.Interestingly, when this book first appeared, many Americans believed that they were at risk of alien abduction, aliens were reportedly creating crop circles in England, and committing improper acts on mysteriously unmarked adults throughout the world. Hence, timing explains Sagan's sustained attention along the pages of this book to fantasies of extraterrestrial interference with humans. Something that may feel a bit dated for those who read it for the first time today.At is core, the aim of Demon Haunted World is to debunk the paranormal and the unexplained in a study with a range of reference that is just phenomenal. For example, in just one essays Sagan enlightens the readers on (1) US constitutional history at the time of Thomas Jefferson, (2) the witchcraft trials of Wurzburg, Germany, in 1631, (3) the manipulation of historic memory in Russia under Stalin, (4) the monopoly of media ownership, (5) Linus Pauling and the test ban treaty of 1963, and (6) Edward Teller's enthusiasm for the hydrogen bomb, and he does it all with a prose that is both easy to follow and nice to read. But perhaps most impressive, though, is the book’s predictive qualities. It predicted, for instance, the dumbing down of the United States. “I have a foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness…”And that is why book like this, I think, should be part of general education and schools curricula, because knowing is not as important as learning how to learn."
22,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20015365-may,5,"As expected, this book was very interesting, insightful, and relevant to our world today. I felt Sagan's passion emanating from the pages, and it has given me even an even greater motivation to pursue the goal I've been chasing for the past 3 years, which is to be educated, willing to question authority whatever form it takes, and to engage my critical faculties and be able to form my own opinions. It was Carl Sagan that showed me the path in 2016 when I read his book Pale Blue Dot, which was the first science book I've ever read, and now, three years later, I know more about the world around me yet I am acutely aware of how ignorant I am and always will be. I wish that more people would read this book. Ethnocentrism, xenophobia and nationalism are these days rife in many parts of the world. Government repression of unpopular views is still widespread. False or misleading memories are inculcated. For the defenders of such attitudes, science is disturbing. It claims access to truths that are largely independent of ethnic or cultural biases. By its very nature, science transcends national boundaries. Put scientists working in the same field of study together in a room and even if they share no common spoken language, they will find a way to communicate. Science itself is a transnational language. Scientists are naturally cosmopolitan in attitude and are more likely to see through efforts to divide the human family into many small and warring factions. 'There is no national science,' said the Russian playwright Anton Chekhov, 'just as there is no national multiplication table.' The bits about Thomas Jefferson were new to me so I am going to make sure I read some of his work. ""Jefferson was a student of history - not just the compliant and safe history that praises our own time or country or ethnic group, but the real history of real humans, our weaknesses as well as our strengths. History taught him that the rich and powerful will steal and oppress if given half a chance. He described the governments of Europe, which he saw at first hand as the American ambassador to France. Under the pretence of government, he said, they had divided their nations into two classes: wolves and sheep.Jefferson taught that every government degenerates when it is left to the rulers alone, because rulers - by the very act of ruling - misuse the public trust. The people themselves, he said, are the only prudent repository of power.But he worried that the people - and the argument goes back to Thucydides and Aristotle - are easily misled. So he advocated safeguards, insurance policies. One was the constitutional separation of powers; accordingly, various groups, some pursuing their own selfish interests, balance one another, preventing any one of them from running away with the country: the Executive, Legislative and Judicial Branches; the House and the Senate; the States and the Federal Government. He also stressed, passionately and repeatedly, that it was essential for the people to understand the risks and benefits of government, to educate themselves, and to involve themselves in the political process. Without that, he said, the wolves will take over. Here's how he put it in Notes on Virginia, stressing how the powerful and unscrupulous find zones of vulnerability they can exploit:In every government on earth is some trace of human weakness, some germ of corruption and degeneracy, which cunning will discover and wickedness insensibly open, cultivate and improve. Every government degenerates when trusted to the rulers of the people alone. The people themselves therefore are its only safe depositories. And to render even them safe, their minds must be improved . . .""Recommended for everyone."
23,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1096417-tyler,5,"Sagan shows why learning to think in a contingent universe is ... well ... absolutely necessary. My reaction first reading the book was, ""I've known for a long time that something's wrong. Now I know what."" The discussions the author engages in in the book are eye-openers.I cannot recommend this book to those who are highly sensitive about their credos, but on other hand, I don't think more open-minded religious people will at all see this as the scathing attack many opinion-makers have attributed to it. If you really want to read scathing breakdowns of religious assertions, any philosophy book in the past 250 years will give it to you better that this comparatively sympathetic author, whose main interest lies in the psychology of our beliefs, rather than their truth-values.I note this in order to draw attention to the real nature of Sagan's book: It's a rare and public advocacy of the power of scientific thinking to change our lives for the better. How poorly understood that project is in our nominally scientific age is the actual thrust of the discussion. The content, then, is the unique contribution this book makes. I'd characterize it as an exaltation of scientific humanism. I gave it five stars for its approachability and novelty."
24,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/823739-john,5,"My first Sagan book was Cosmos, which led me to this one. While Cosmos was good, this was great. It really opened my eyes to how important science is, and the underlying principles of science, and simultaneously how organized religion is virtually 100% philosophically opposed to science.Religion: Don't think, don't reason, don't use logic. We'll (religious leaders) tell you what to think, what our god(s) wants you to think/do. Our holy book written centuries ago by primitive tribes with no knowledge of science is the last word on everything, even if there is overwhelming scientific evidence today at odds with it.Science: Think, reason, gather scientific evidence via repeatable experiments. Question, demand proof, but accept all the evidence, and the conclusions that follow, even if it overturns your most cherished prior beliefs.I will always be grateful to Carl Sagan for opening my eyes. The world is a lesser place without him."

26,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"I was surprised by how relevant this was even though it's almost 25 years old. Sagan wanders through a variety of topics (see ToC below) so chapters often feel like essays, although they flow together well & some are written with another. That means they vary somewhat in tone. All good, but some were better than others. The second chapter ""Science & Hope"" impressed me with the sheer number of sayings I wanted to remember. The next to the last chapter ""Science & Witchcraft"" was really eye-opening about the witch trials in 1600s Germany which Sagan uses to show why our criminal justice system is set up as it is. This is just one of several that makes a case for an informed, skeptical electorate. Highly recommended in any format. I found the audiobook great reading, but am glad I got a text copy as well since there's so much information that I wanted to look back over & make notes about. None of my libraries had the book in audio, so I bought it from Blackstone Audio's consumer site, downpour.com, where it was only $10.

27,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18653872-steve-wiggins,5,"After reading a credulous book about demons, I turned to a scientific one. Carl Sagan was one of the most gifted science writers of his day. This is an enjoyable collection of what might be better termed essays than a long disquisition. Sagan has offered here a strong case for not only science, but for education in general. He frequently makes the point that scientists are portrayed negatively in the media, although from the outside it often appears to be the opposite. Perhaps it depends on your point of view.Sagan was more open-minded than many others in his field. He at least admitted the possibility of many things mainstream scientists dismiss out of hand. Always urging skepticism, but with an open mind, this was a rare intellect indeed. One of the more disturbing aspects of the book—written well before the present political climate—is his prediction of how lack of science and devaluing of education would lead to totalitarianism. He saw that it could happen here. We have seen a secretary of education trying to dismantle that very subject and facts have come under fire from alternative facts. Skepticism is leveled toward science itself rather than toward such alternative facts. This was clearly a fear Sagan had and he has, unfortunately, proven prophetic in it.The book argues that science is the candle in the dark that is otherwise populated with demons, witches, and gods. He notes there is no scientific evidence against these things, but read correctly the evidence points away from them. Many scientists would simply shut them out. Sagan notes that they should be considered, but put into place against better hypotheses.An appropriate magnum opus for one of the great minds of the last century, this book stands as a testament to skeptical but not close-minded thinking. It is a rare thing.For those interested, I've said a little more about this book here: Sects and Violence in the Ancient World."
28,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,5,"I don't feel hyperbolic saying this is one of the best and most important books ever written. I can only kick myself for having left it on the shelf so many years. In his characteristic congenial, non-threatening, well-studied, literate and abundantly clear way, Carl Sagan explains the importance of critical thinking, science and education. Sagan is a master of succinct conveyance, ever-shifting the reader's perspective to a better vantage point from which to understand a concept. That he manages to do so with humility and wit is all the more impressive.So much ground is covered, looking in turn at every aspect of belief, psychology, biology, ethics, technology and social structure, with examples still relevant twenty years later. The Demon-Haunted World is dense with meaning, and is not the sort of fare one chews lightly. I spent a long time in this book, and each page presented at least one brilliantly-stated quotable (many of our favorite Sagan-isms originate here): something to stop and think about, or a topic I needed to look up in more detail. I made the initial mistake of taking a highlighter to this book, only to realize I'd end up highlighting half the words. It's that kind of book. One cannot help but occasionally hear Carl Sagan's friendly, sedated-Kermit-the-Frog voice reading various passages - especially the ones heavy with philosophical import or gazing with us in awe at the wonders of the cosmos.I can't think of anyone I would not recommend this to. Please read it."
29,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,"Carl saw our present times if his warnings were unheeded when he wrote in the 1990s and sure enough, they are upon us. Could the demon-haunted world he feared be Trump's America in 2019. Could magical thinking and tribalism and superstition that were so eloquently argued against by Sagan in the 1990s to be coming home to roost? He was an awesome science educator who knew the value of skepticism and science, as well as a humane vision, was necessary to keep us from falling into an ignorant and fanatical age. I recommend this book or almost any other by Sagan for a deep dive into scientific and humanist thinking. Now more than ever."
30,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,4,"I’m not sure what potential audience Sagan had in mind for this book, and I’m doubly unsure if I’m in it. I doubt you will be sure, either; and this tension is one that runs through the whole of the book. Perhaps this is unavoidable. For, when a popular scientist writes a book, his readership is more than likely to consist, in the main, of reasonable and skeptical people; thus, when he spends the entirety of the work attempting to inculcate the scientific attitude, he is in the position of a musician performing at a music school—most of the audience will consist of other musicians. So we may ask: are the ones likely to read The Demon-Haunted World the people who Sagan intends to reach? Perhaps I’m wrong; I hope so. I’d like to think that this book fell into the hands of several UFO enthusiasts and believers in the supernatural, and that Sagan was able to convince them. When he is debunking UFO sightings, Sagan is awfully convincing; considerable mental defenses would be necessary to block out the assault of reason and evidence Sagan presents. Yet here we face a particular irony: Sagan is attempting to inculcate a certain type of skepticism—the skepticism towards claims based on insufficient empirical evidence—but his message will likely be blocked out by a different type of skepticism: the skepticism towards those in authority. How easy it would be to dismiss his arguments with “he’s just pompous,” or “science is narrow-minded,” or “he worked for the government, so he’s just part of the cover-up.” The human mind is not, unfortunately, a truth-seeking machine; as Benjamin Franklin observed: “So convenient a thing it is to be a reasonable creature, since it enables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to do.” We see this very thing play out in Chapters 10 and 11 of this book. In Chapter 10, Sagan vigorously attacks the evidence presented in favor of flying saucers from other worlds. Then, in the next chapter—after having publishing the previous chapter in a magazine—Sagan includes response after response from readers. The result is no surprise. Those who were already skeptical about aliens tell Sagan he’s right on the money. Those who already believed in intelligent aliens (and several stranger things), on the other hand, tell Sagan he has no idea what he’s talking about, that they have seen the aliens with their own eyes, and that they are still in contact, communicating telepathically. Not a single solitary note says something to this effect: “Wow, Carl, you really convinced me! I believed in flying saucers before, but you made some excellent points!” This is an example of what one might call the Paradox of Belief: believers who are open-minded enough to be convinced are the least dangerous to society; believers so closed-minded as to never be convinced, on the other hand, are the real trouble. So what's the point of proselytizing? What rational argument would convince an extremist? What empirical evidence would dissuade a fanatic? What, in short, is the point of this enterprise, since the open-minded moderates aren’t a societal hazard, anyway? Alright, I know: I’m simplifying things. Sagan does include much sensible advice on wider issues—advice on topics ranging from education reform to new ideas for science programs. He isn’t putting all of his stock into his books. Sagan would have more science in the classroom, in the government, on television. If science was built into our education and our entertainment, if the scientific attitude pervaded society, it would have a better chance of reaching children early, when they're still open-minded; science would be too ubiquitous to ignore, too commonplace to avoid.In fact, Sagan treats the scientific attitude as a sort of panacea for all the world’s ills. For Sagan, science engenders both wisdom and knowledge, it inculcates both free-thinking and caution. Science, with its heavy emphasis on checking and re-checking, on independent and repeated verification, takes full stock of human nature. We are, sadly, an errant and erring species; progress, in both science and—as Sagan goes on to say—government, depends on checks and balances, on emphasizing evidence, on distrusting authority and trusting facts, on a community of independent thinkers rather than a unified hive-mind. And, I must admit, imagining a world where even 5% of people were more familiar with the scientific attitude—that strange mix of curiosity and skepticism—fills me with excitement. I can hardly imagine how credulous I might have been if science wasn’t a part of my education from an early age. Despite my sympathy for Sagan’s goals, I can’t help but think Sagan’s urgency comes as much from his wisdom as from his paranoia. Perhaps spending too much time thinking about massive meteors or talking to congressmen gives one a sense of impending doom. Whatever the reason, Sagan often gives the impression that he thinks the end is nigh, that humanity’s survival is standings on the edge of a knife, and that urgent action is necessary now, immediately, without further delay. Don’t get me wrong: I think Sagan was often right, even prescient. Even so, it’s hard for me to take his idea seriously that developing the technology to deflect an asteroid might inadvertently give some lunatic the power to destroy the world. For somebody who is so keen on being reasonable, this level of fear strikes me as at least a bit unrealistic. Of course, I might be the unrealistic one. So, to repeat myself, I’m not sure this book was meant for me. I needed no convincing from Sagan to disbelieve eyewitness reports of supernatural phenomena, nor did I need any reminding that the human species is prone to folly and superstition. I doubt I'm unique in this respect. Yet I still can’t help admiring a man who worked so hard to convince us that ignorance is as dangerous as evil, and that skepticism is as necessary as knowledge. Sagan wasn’t like me: he had no time to be a fatalist. He was too busy trying to save the world."
31,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40481325-bernardo,5,"The Demon-Haunted World was originally published in 1995. Twenty five years may have passed since, but this book remains as important today as it was back then.As a whole, this book represents the defense of scientific thinking and skepticism against pseudoscience and superstition. Carl Sagan explains why scientific thinking is essential and breaks down some of the most popular myths and pretensions of pseudoscience. According to Sagan, the temptation to irrationality is not only a cultural error but a dangerous leap into darkness, which endangers our most basic freedoms.Carl Sagan spent part of his life trying to teach science and its way of thinking to the general public. He had a gift for it, one that many top scientists don’t have. In The Demon-Haunted World we get to have a look at his capabilities. His prose, the intelligent way in which he makes his point and leaves the reader thinking about it, the clever anecdotes, and all the historical and cultural references (from before Ancient Greece to our times, as well as his personal life) are evidence.In a time during which political entities (and not only) would rather make use of ignorance than science, I would say the message Carl Sagan is trying to convene remains even more relevant today. Its our duty as citizens to remain conscious of that. We can apply scientific thinking to our everyday life.The Demon Haunted World should be read in schools. It addresses many topics that would otherwise never be spoken among students, teachers and even the general public.“As I close this eloquent and fascinating book, I recall the final chapter title from one of Carl Sagan’s earlier works, Cosmos. ‘Who Speaks for Earth?’ is a rhetorical question, but I presume to answer it. My candidate for planetary ambassador can be none other than Carl Sagan himself. He is wise, humane, witty, well read, and incapable of composing a dull sentence.… I wish I had written The Demon-Haunted World. Having failed to do so the least I can do is press it upon my friends. Please read this book.” - Richard Dawkins“Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking.” - Carl Sagan"
32,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5475565-erin,1,"I hesitated to mark this as ""Read"" because I couldn't actually get through the whole thing. I was SO excited to read this book: I was under the impression that Sagan systematically explained in reasonable and scientific terms some of the myths and phenomena present in Western culture, and I thought it would be interesting to see how these things came about.That's not what it is. From the first about 100 pages, I gather that a) Sagan is reeeaaallly in love with science, b) he's not unconvinced that there are aliens out there and c) he has a grudge against nonscientific discussion of space, astronomy, aliens, and other related things because he feels it ought to be investigated properly, and fears that wild claims of UFOs turn it all into some silly game. It would be fine if UFOs and aliens were one phenomenon he was going to debunk - or, if not debunk, at least caution against believing without further scientific proof - but that is the whole book. Sometimes he veers a little bit toward some other interesting phenomenon or belief...but it always veers back to aliens. In addition, his veneration of science and the scientific process are to be applauded and imitated, but it gets tiring to hear in every single chapter about how great science is. It's tiresome. Anyone reading that book already respects science; no paranormal who doesn't understand the concept of experimental proof is going to pick up a book about how experimental proof is the only way to know something. Sagan may be a great scientist, but he's a terrible writer."

What are you reading?Kielyr: Lolita?Ben: I didn't assign that book.Kielyr: I'm skipping ahead.Ben: And?Kielyr: It's interesting.Rellian (youngest son): Interesting!Bo (oldest son): Illegal word!Zaja (youngest daughter): Dad, Kielyr said interesting!Ben: Interesting is a non-word. You know you're supposed to avoid it ... Be specific.Kielyr: It's disturbing.Ben: More specific.Kielyr: Can I just read?Ben: After you give us your analysis thus far.Kielyr: There's this old man who loves this girl, and she's only 12 years old.Ben: That's the plot.Kielyr: Because it's written from his perspective, you sort of understand and sympathize with him. Which is kind of amazing because he's essentially a child molester. But his love for her is beautiful. But it's also sort of a trick because it's so wrong. You know, he's old, and he basically rapes her. So it makes me feel ... I hate him. And somehow I feel sorry for him at the same time.Ben: Well done.END SCENESorry, I just couldn't help quoting that entire thing. (I did copy it ... I obviously haven't got it memorized.) It would probably fit better in a review for Lolita but I read and reviewed that pre-""Captain Fantastic."" I've been meaning to go back and reread “Lolita” but who’s got the time when there are so many other supposedly great novels one hasn't read?Sub-tangent! Back to the larger one!""Interesting"" didn't always mean something that mildly amused us in a pleasant but entirely unspecific way, because we have that whole ""May you live in interesting times"" thing, allegedly a Chinese curse but in fact an English expression supposedly popularized by Robert Kennedy. Point is, to live in ""interesting times"" was not a good thing. Yes, everything between my very first line and the next one was actually part of the same tangent because I do not have an editor. (I hope you enjoyed it nevertheless!)But ""interesting times"" requires interesting, in the more modern sense of the word, people or, to use a non non-word, respected public intellectuals to help guide us through such times. I'm thinking of people like Christopher Hitchens, George Carlin, James Baldwin, Cicero, Homer ... And Carl Sagan. Because this guy is basically the definition of an intellectual. I mean, knock me over with a feather, but does he EVER know how to perform a good autopsy on the latest sexy public fad (like astrologers, psychics, UFO conspiracy theorists, and the list goes on).It's simply brilliant to see. If I do have a complaint, which is the reason I gave this one less star than it might have deserved, it's that he sometimes goes on ad nauseam about the fringiest of fringe conspiracies, or at least things that don't hold up as particularly worth devoting 50 pages to in the year 2020.But Sagan IS brilliant, there's no denying that, and he's a scientist to the core, which means he's also an equal opportunity offender when calling out all the nonsense behind various religious beliefs (and they are all, obviously, nonsense).Although respect to Tibetan Buddhism. I have to mention an anecdote Sagan relates here, which is that when he (at least I think it was him) confronts the Dalai Lama on that core Buddhist tenet, reincarnation, and asks the Lama what he'd say if scientists were to disprove the whole idea of reincarnation, the Lama replies that ""Buddhism would have to change."" I like that, I like that a lot. A religious leader who admits that science holds precedence over a belief, even one as core to the whole philosophy as that of reincarnation.Of course, as Sagan goes on to say, wily Lama that he is, the Dalai knows that science cannot disprove reincarnation, but, as Sagan likes to say, ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."" Every troubled era had their rational seers, their intellectuals, their artists who spoke wisdom to the tragedies of the day or waded through them to piece together something unforgettable. Shakespeare wrote ""King Lear"" and ""Macbeth"" while the bubonic plague ravaged Europe and knocked off a third of his fellow Londoners. Where is our Shakespeare, dammit? Our Baldwin? Our Cicero? If we can't have a Homer can we at least get a Hitchens? But no, it seems it is our fate to drift blindly through these dark waters on our own, without any preternatural guidance from the wise elders that our age sorely lacks.The best we can do is try and apply the wisdom of our forebears to today's ""interesting times,"" as we otherwise drift, drift, drift away ..."
35,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13421080-maricarmen-estrada-m,5,"This book is difficult to review. It was absolutely impressive and completely relevant in several topics that are part of daily discussions globally. Although this book was written in the 90’s, skepticism and critical thinking are nowadays more necessary and important than ever. This book is an advocate for skepticism. Carl Sagan talks about the differences between science and pseudoscience and analyzes both with several examples of events that have happened throughout history. There are several discussions about varied topics which were very interesting to read and think about such as education, religion, the Inquisition, crop circles, UFOs, the hydrogen bomb, and others. And also some remarkable characters; the two I enjoyed more learning about were Maxwell and Thomas Jefferson. Another Sagan book that left me awestruck and with so much to think about. "
36,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222319-jill-hutchinson,5,"All of us of a certain age remember Carl Sagan and his fascinating television program Cosmos. He explained science in words that the layman could understand and he approaches this book in the same manner. His basic premise here is “how can we make intelligent decisions about our increasingly technology driven lives if we don’t understand the difference between the myths of pseudoscience, New Age thinking, and fundamentalist zealotry and the testable hypothesis of science”.To support this premise, he provides case studies and examples of the various beliefs, myths and generally accepted ideas which many people accept as truth and proceeds to test them against the facts of science. It is guaranteed to disturb some readers or even make them angry as he doesn’t spare the sacred cows of alien presence, crop circles, ESP, and even religion. “Prove it”, he says, “show me the facts”, “give me something tangible”…….he does not give credence to eye witness reports and provides examples how these reports can change over time without the realization of the reporter. He never demeans those who say they were abducted by aliens or healed by faith healers; he merely show how these events have no basis in fact and unfortunately are sometimes scams which further muddies the waters. He questions, for example, if a faith healer is truly gifted by God to heal the “sick and the lame”, then why doesn’t an amputee grow a new limb. Or that even though the presence of crop circles was proven to be made by people having some fun, there are those who continue to believe that the circles were made by aliens. People believe what they want to believe and condemn science for attempting to question these beliefs.He spends a little too much time on alien abduction, only because he was involved with the study of that phenomenon but it does tend to slow things down a bit. This book will be controversial to some readers and a breath of fresh air to others. In either case, it is a fascinating read."
37,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"I loved Cosmos, and the topic here is important, but I am sorry I cannot give this book a great review, because it starts with just the type of error Sagan is preaching against.Sagan's pitch for why you should care about science is because medicine has made us all live so long, and his specific example is how, thanks to Germ Theory, if your baby gets cholera the doctor can give it so many milligrams a day of Tetracycline instead of just praying. I doubt that anyone in my town is alive because they got tetracycline for cholera. And yet it is true that childhood mortality from diarrhea has decreased enormously, with a resulting surge in life expectancy at birth. So why is that, if it's not because of antibiotics? It's mainly because our food isn't all poopy anymore. Why don't we (lucky residents of rich countries) consume poop all the time now? Mainly because of changes--begun BEFORE Germ Theory--like: sewers, clean milk, clean water, clean housing, better nutrition, etc. Germ Theory and antibiotics are wonderful, but it turns out that lab science and medicine played a relatively small role in the enormous historical rise in life expectancy. Understanding the determinants of health is crucial for any rational health policy, so this is not a trivial point. Sagan's error is understandable because faith in modern medicine is common in American society, and social health history is outside his area of expertise. But the whole point of his book is skepticism and reality-checking, so taking things on faith is precisely what not to do. I get it that reality-checking is hard, and no one can do it for everything. But again, that's the whole deal here. Knowing your topic implies keeping mum on things you don't know about. For a better, and more current similar book: 







"
38,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27488361-ahmed-samir,4,"So this is one of the books I've been wanting to read for a while. Sagan is exceptionally talented at writing popular science, so you will enjoy it. The subjects he discusses are very interesting and they've inspired almost three episodes on my YouTube channel. Some chapters, however, seemed to be repetitions. Other times I felt that the tone Sagan was adopting to describe theists was quite demeaning, and really not in place. However, I appreciate how he pointed out at the beginning of the book that religion and science are not the same and do not imply anything about each other. Finally, you won't learn much from this book in terms of raw experiments or tests, but it will absolutely change the way you see things. It'll force you to think differently (in a good way). "
39,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1264081-melydia,5,"Have you ever read something that filled you with such furvor that you wanted to write your own thoughts along those same lines, but whenever you tried you found you did nothing but repeat the original article?That's been me all over the place with The Demon-Haunted World. I want to ramble about the wonder of science, the importance of skepticism, the fact that school all but completely robbed me of any desire to learn, the dangers of pseudoscience, the intrinsic value of basic research even if it doesn't lead to a specific application right away...but Sagan says it all, and he says it better than I ever could. This is one of those amazing books that made me think long and hard about a lot of things. It made me want to know more about the universe, to revisit old assumptions and condescensions, to step back a moment and drink it all in.Sagan speaks as one with a giddy love for the scientific process, one whose healthy skepticism does not make him stodgy or closed to new ideas. Much of the first half of the book is spent more or less on aliens - not only explanations for much of what is attributed to extraterrestrial activity, but why people assume aliens at all. He does grump a little about the dumbing-down of American entertainment and its lack of accurate science, but coming from someone who prizes knowledge so highly, I can understand his disappointment at the popularity of shows like ""Beavis & Butthead"" and ""Dumb & Dumber."" Likewise his unhappiness with dwindling popular and government support of science research and education.This book is absolutely astounding. It's one of the few that I recommend to anyone, even (and perhaps especially) if it challenges some of your closely held viewpoints. It did mine. "
40,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13073186-v-b,5,"As an ordinary non-scientific person, it is common to perceive information through a two dimension. The Demon – Haunted World on the contrary, leads the non – scientific reader to filter information through a three dimensional viewpoint. To mistake false information as valid without questioning the sources or claims being made is quite prevalent, thanks to social media. For example why do people believe in memes that circulate on the web at face value? Or another example is why do people believe in pseudo science like - astrology, when there is no actual proof that it even exists. And this is coming from someone who studied Astrology extensively for years, and owned quite a vast collection of astrology books, along with Tarot cards, and I Ching. But to believe in that which is false is quite unfulfilling and irrational. Carl Sagan covers the reasoning behind why our culture values unscientific rationale quite extensively. It is shocking how low Americans fail in scientific knowledge. Sagan elaborates in a nutshell that our society has potential to improve scientific comprehension but because of political reasons such as our government spending trillions on the military and close to nothing on scientific research, the field loses priority. Sagan also explains that clear scientific thinking goes hand in hand with skepticism about religion and that science can only rise with more secular thinking. I recommend this book to anyone who wants answers to why ignorance still persists and is leaning more towards critical and skeptical thinking. And the baloney detection kit will come in handy if you ever get caught in a debate with someone who makes dubious claims…I love you Carl Sagan!"
41,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,5,"Lesson: be skeptical of everything, including yourself. Also, seek knowledge; be insatiably curious about the world.NOTE: 800th book shelved on GR."
42,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3803671-ivonne-rovira,4,"“All science asks is to employ the same levels of skepticism we use in buying a used car or in judging the quality of analgesics or beer from their television commercials.”Carl Sagan in The Demon-Haunted WorldThe Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark  will turn 20 years old next year, but it’s just as relevant as when Carl Sagan first wrote it. Actually, more relevant. While Sagan had to deal with cigarette manufacturers pooh-poohing the tobacco-cancer connection, the war on science had not yet been fully launched. For example, the Kyoto Treaty on global climate change still had bipartisan support. As recently as 2000, then presidential candidate George W. Bush could openly say that he believed in global climate change without imperiling his chances in a Republican primary. While occasional retrograde school boards in the hinterlands would attempt to inject creationism into their science classes, anti-evolutionary fervor had not yet become one of the planks of the Republican Party Platform. Nor had a quarter of the United States become so gullible that they would swallow without a murmur or any evidence the nonsense that a duly elected president of the United States had been born on another continent, that a different president had foreknowledge of the 9/11 terrorist attack (or perhaps even conspired in the plot), that biology takes a vacation in the case of “legitimate rape” — whatever that is — and that tens of thousands of scientists are lying about geology, biology, paleontology, physics, biomedicine, and other fields in order to obtain grants. (Who the shadowy figure who is bestowing said grants and what that person could possibly gain from this vast conspiracy somehow never gets elucidated. Go figure.)Sagan first explains the scientific method and then gets busy refuting the hokum of his day: evidence of intelligent life on Mars, alien visitation, precognition based on dreams or hallucinations, ghosts, “recovered” memories, Marian apparitions, levitation, the notion that critical thinking and science are some form of Western imperialism or atheistic assault. He also explores the horrifying conspiracy theories of the past, primarily the witchcraft and heresy trials in Europe. I did not realize that inquisitors charged the cost of the investigation, incarceration, trial and execution of witches to the victims and their families and then their worldly goods were divided between Church and State. No incentive to prosecute the innocent, is there? One quotation on the witch hysteria shows how little changes across the centuries: “Those responsible for prosecuting, torturing, judging, burning, and justifying [the witch burnings] were selfless. Just ask them.” Remember that the next time a smug anti-science politician bloviates on your television. You’ll also be appalled by Sagan’s selection of letters he received in response to a piece he penned for Parade magazine, the weekly full-color newspaper supplement. How so many supposedly literate people could (1) so misunderstand the obvious point of the article and (2) believe so many utterly crackpot ideas actually shocked me — even after my exposure to today’s science deniers. This is not a volume to check out of your library; you want your own copy to highlight and annotate. Yes, at times Sagan, for decades a renowned astrophysicist at Cornell University, can descend into scientific discussions too advanced — and tedious — for a lay audience (which explains the four, rather than five stars), discussions that stretch for pages and pages. Even so, The Demon-Haunted World serves as a ready reference book for any discussion about the necessity for scientific research and science education. It’s also chockfull of pithy quotations you’ll find yourself tapping again and again. For so many reasons, Sagan’s last great work is indispensable. "
43,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/914349-arthur,5,"I wish I could give 6 stars to this book (but I guess that just indicates that I give 5 stars too easily). Carl Sagan covers a lot of ground in this book. One of his most important themes is that the scientific method is the best tool we have for separating fact from fantasy. He laments that a general lack of skepticism leads many people to believe in superstitions that can be easily explained. He devotes several chapters to the widespread belief in UFOs and a government conspiracy to hide the ""truth"" that we are being visited by aliens in flying saucers. He explains the history of the crop circle hoax that began in the United Kingdom and was quickly copied by hoaxers in other parts of the world. He explains how Europeans in the middle ages frequently believed they were visited by demons (a succubus coming to seduce a man and an incubus coming to seduce a woman). Nowadays, however, the demons don't visit us anymore. Instead we are visited by aliens. He explains how both of these common beliefs can be explained in terms of complex psychological factors. He also talks about how memories can be altered, and how unreliable eyewitness accounts can be, in particular if they seek therapy with hypnotherapists who help them remember the alien abduction.Sagan devotes an excellent chapter in the middle of his book to the basic toolkit that one should use to analyze an argument for intellectual integrity, describing the most common fallacies that can sidestep the basic requirements of argument and cause an argument to seem much more convincing than it actually is.He discusses the modern trend to distrust science, and he discusses some of its causes. For example, he talks about how many people today view scientists as ""nerds"" and don't see why governments should support ""curiosity-based research"", thinking that they should focus on specific technological research rather than purely scientific matters. To argue against this idea, he discusses how a specific discovery by a physicist named Maxwell (the idea of electromagnetic radiation, i.e. light, and a few related ideas) allowed later scientists to discover radio waves, one of the single most important discoveries in history. But Maxwell had no idea where his discovery would lead. Rather, he was pursuing a purely scientific question.In addition to the UFO myth, he discusses the televangelist faith healers and other people who take advantage of a general lack of skepticism for their own gain.One of the parts of the book I appreciated most was Sagan's conclusion that since today's technology has so much potential for either disastrous or wonderful consequences, it is necessary for scientists today to have much higher ethical standards than ever before. He talks about some scientists who have been influential activists for social change, and other scientists who have been ruthlessly unethical, in particular the scientist whose pet project was the invention of the hydrogen bomb, which Sagan calls the single most odious invention in the history of the world.I highly recommend this book, especially to people who think that science is overrated or want to get a glimpse into the mind of a scientist."
44,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7407364-luffy,4," This book contains many examples of pain that could have been avoided, although that's not what one thinks when confronted with the Inquisition practices and confronted with the fate of the victims, all of whom are 100% sure to be innocent, without any trace of doubt. Both the near present and distant past were examined for examples of presence or any degree of absence of knowledge. A sizable chunk of the book deals with UFOs and conspiracy theories. I'm a bit disappointed that the Illuminati was never mentioned even once. Carl Sagan gives many explanations for the debunking of various UFO sightings, and tales of abduction. But he does not cite cases that are still a mystery. That's another thing that the writer never addressed. He didn't address the one in a million cases that is unexplained even now, or puzzles that have remained a mystery. Archaeological mysteries are not mentioned. I must clarify that I don't believe that aliens know of our world, should they exist at some place in the universe. Where the book excels and where I found delight were passages where people refused to believe in the benefits of science, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. I knew little of James Clerk Maxwell, and found it an anomaly that Charles Darwin wasn't knighted. Living in a young Republic means that in the history of my country no cruel atrocities were carried out, at least no murderous ones. I think that discouraging abstract projects in science will snuff out future useful inventions. It's the same for agriculture - making a species of plant extinct makes us miss useful traits that might surface in the future. I found this book to be the work of a talented educator and it was nice being educated in this way."
45,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126262-brooke,4,"For a while now, I've been saying that I need to start reading some non-fiction. For all the time I spend reading, some of that time should be spent learning about things that are new to me. But then I'd groan and say that I'm not yet far enough removed from being a student to be able to do that for fun.A GoodReads friend recommended this one during a discussion of sleep paralysis and aliens, and I decided that I should approach this like ripping off a band-aid - I grabbed it off the library shelf and started reading it before my brain could realize what I was doing to it.Luckily, Carl Sagan is wonderfully readable, and his excitement about science shines through every page. I love his balance of skepticism and wonder and his high regard for his field of study. He had me getting a bit sad when he discussed how American schools (mis)handle teaching math and science, and he made a comment that especially struck me: in history, in English, students are constantly exposed to the voices of the masters of the fields. But we're never given anything written by the people who love math and science. We learn numbers and formulas, but we don't learn to love them from the people who discovered those numbers and formulas. This rang especially true for me.My only complaint is that the first 3/4 of the book is structured so that each chapter transitions into the next one quite smoothly, but the last quarter of the book jumps around a lot and doesn't seem to have as much focus as the first three quarters. "
46,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4272284-kristina,5,"Carl Sagan’s The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark was published in 1996 (at least my edition was). It is still as current now as when he first wrote it. His emphasis on scientific/skeptical thinking and his warnings that uneducated, gullible citizens can erode democracy are even more urgent now, particularly when it seems America (if not other world governments) are rapidly going backward towards antiquated, mystical thinking, hatred and distrust of science and scientists, and fearing and blaming “the other” for assorted economic and societal woes. Everyone should read this book, even if you already consider yourself a skeptical thinker. Sagan presents a different perspective on many subjects and gives the reader much to consider.The whole of this book is aimed towards seeing science literally as a candle in the dark. He stresses the need to think intelligently, to be skeptical, to question authority. Each chapter presents a topic of pseudoscience or mystical thinking and Sagan breaks down how (and why) to address each skeptically (but always respectfully; he is not a fan of organized religion, but never describes himself as an atheist. He thinks science and spirituality are compatible).Rather than give a detailed review of this book, I’m going to cite some of the quotes I liked the most and then maybe provide my own commentary. Not all of the quotes are from Sagan. He quotes extensively from scientists, theologians, philosophers, writers, etc. “Men think epilepsy divine, merely because they do not understand it. But if they called everything divine which they do not understand, why, there would be no end of divine things” (Hippocrates). “Instead of acknowledging that in many areas we are ignorant, we have tended to say things like the Universe is permeated with the ineffable. A God of the Gaps is assigned responsibility for what we do not yet understand” (8). This strikes me as incredibly true. I see it all the time. Although the word used by credulous persons isn’t “ineffable.” It’s miracle. Everything we don’t understand is a miracle or somehow related to the divine. The idea that maybe we are ignorant of the (history, medicine, science, technology) behind this “miraculous” event or effect is not acknowledged. I don’t quite know how the internet works, but I sure as shit don’t think it’s a miracle. I also don’t know why it’s possible for a tornado to destroy one house but leave its neighbor standing unharmed, but I don’t think it can be attributed to the mysterious ways of God. The random destructiveness of a tornado’s path is probably due to the properties of the tornado. If I really wanted to know, I’d do research or interview a meteorologist. “It is morally as bad not to care whether a thing is true or not, so long as it makes you feel good, as it is not to care how you got your money as long as you have got it” (Edmund Way Teale, Circle of the Seasons, 12). Sagan is asking here, is it better to not know if/when your government is corrupt because it’s a disturbing reality? If you choose to remain ignorant, who profits? Knowledge, Sagan says, is the only way to better ourselves and our country. To choose ignorance is to be morally wrong; so to anyone who says they aren’t “interested in politics”: get interested. Being intellectually lazy is to be morally irresponsible—politics affect the lives of everyone, present and future generations. The last two chapters of the book, “Science and Witchcraft” and “Real Patriots Ask Questions” compare democracy and science—both use experiments to see what works, what doesn’t, and discard (hopefully) the ineffective system or theory: Freedom is a prerequisite for continuing the delicate experiment of science—which is one reason why the Soviet Union could not remain a totalitarian state and be technologically competitive. At the same time, science—or rather its delicate mix of openness and skepticism, and its encouragement of diversity and debate—is a prerequisite for continuing the delicate experiment of freedom in an industrial and highly technological society (431).Sagan discusses the Constitution and the Bill of Rights as documents that preserve our rights and protect us against our worse selves: Even a casual scrutiny of history reveals that we humans have a sad tendency to make the same mistakes again and again. We’re afraid of strangers or anybody who’s a little different from us. When we get scared, we start pushing people around. We have readily accessible buttons that release powerful emotions when pressed. We can be manipulated into utter senselessness by clever politicians. Give us the right kind of leader and, like the most suggestible subjects of the hypnotherapists, we’ll gladly do just about anything he wants—even things we know to be wrong. The framers of the Constitution were students of history. In recognition of the human condition, they sought to invent a means that would keep us free in spite of ourselves (424). This chapter was written with his wife, Ann Druyan; their message is: educate yourself about your rights! Use them or lose them! I know people who don’t vote, and their reason for not voting is usually pure apathy. They don’t think that any of the issues will affect them, so why should they care? I had a younger coworker who had just moved to the state from Florida. She was paying close attention the governor’s race and supported Andrew Gillum. However, when I asked her if she had gotten an absentee ballot, she said no: it was too much trouble. When women say they don’t vote for any reason, I want to take them back to the early 20th century when women risked their lives to fight for their right to vote—and African-Americans had to fight even harder to vote, and still are. Get educated, learn about the issues, and vote. Just because you don’t see a direct connection between the issues being voted on and your life, you will be affected. Not caring and not voting is shameful:If we can’t think for ourselves, if we’re unwilling to question authority, then we’re just putty in the hands of those in power. But if the citizens are educated and form their own opinions, then those in power work for us. In every country, we should be teaching our children the scientific method and the reasons for a Bill of Rights. With it comes a certain decency, humility and community spirit. In the demon-haunted world that we inhabit by virtue of being human, this may be all that stands between us and the enveloping darkness (434).Carl Sagan is an excellent writer. He explains scientific thinking and debunks myths and mysticism with humor and humility. He does not condescend to the reader, nor is he insulting. This is an amazing book that should be read by everyone."
47,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35705439-rupert-dreyfus,5,"I first read this book when I was about eighteen and have read it numerous times. It's probably my favourite non-fiction book - at least in my top ten. It's basically a layperson's guide to skeptical thinking and how to apply the scientific method. It's got an invaluable section called The Baloney Detection Kit which teaches you how to identify logical fallacies so you don't get too lost in our demon haunted world. Logic is a subject which doesn't really get taught anymore yet it's arguably one of the most important subjects of all. It's the only way to sniff out other people's bullshit.What I really like about Sagan, though, is his empathy towards others and his advocacy of free thought. His outlook was also sound on a lot of social and political issues including the environment and nuclear weapons. "
48,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1976637-jeff,5,"Sagan was excellent at explaining the wonders of science to the masses. Some parts of this book are now a bit dated since in some chapters he uses data from the 80s and 90s; after all, it was written in the mid-90s, but it is still my favorite read / listen. To listen to this was a joy, with Cary Elwes reading most of the story, and Seth MacFarlane reading a few chapters as well. Ann Druyan read the introduction. Great, great narration. Relating to the book's age, there were at least two instances where Carl addresses about two things that happened after he wrote the book. He talks about how General Relativity is dependent on and would unravel without gravitational waves, which have never been detected. In 2016, LIGO detected them! In another part of the book he maligns those who believe in the face and structures on Mars (as interpreted from Viking I images) and hoped that future Mars missions with high definition cameras would photograph these areas and set the record straight. This happened. NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter took high definition pictures that showed that these structures were optical illusions and not the product of an advance race on Mars. Carl tackles numerous subjects in this book. He is an eloquent writer. This book should be required reading in America, a country that still embraces pseudoscience and superstition. I can't rate this book high enough. "
49,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin,3,"The book fell a bit flat for me. I don't need a 200 page rant about the state of science education in schools. (Which, by the way, is a lot better than the state of humanities education - so I guess there could be a book-long essay denouncing the state of education in general, but that would be anachronistic and biased, because it would only qualify as a rant made by a very capable and educated person against an educational system which struggles to fit everybody)I don't care about alien abduction hypotheses, government conspiracies, crop circles, or extrasensory perception. But I do care about how people get to believe these things, what kind of personal experiences they have, and what types of messages influence their belief systems to such an extent that these events become part of their conception of the world. And I do care about the ""Baloney Detection Kit"", a short, concise and funny chapter which serves as a guide to critical thinking, with examples. 5 stars for this chapter. It's a real shame that the rest of the book has such long-winded examples."

If Carl Sagans were more common and not just someone who turned up once in a generation the ignorance and scientific illiteracy that forms the basis for this book may hardly exist at all.This one gets 4 stars and not the full 5. Not because Sagan's thoughts and writing isn't as great at ever but because Sagan is far too capable at slaying the beliefs and practices of pseudoscience. His powers may well be put to better use. I worry that the 95% of people who should read this book never would. And so Sagan is left preaching at the remaining 5% who really don't need to read it but want to. As much as I love hearing Sagan preach about anything, I think that the best way to create a scientifically literate population is to inform people of the wonders of science and instill a passion for science therein, not by debunking people's strongly held false beliefs.Despite this book not being as inspiring as some of his other works there is still plenty to love about it. Such is the power of the man that I was almost moved to tears by Sagan's telling of how he desperately wanted his parents to live on and to be able to talk to them if only for a few minutes a year. So much for this guy just having been a popular science writer! In this moving story, Sagan comes to the crux of the issue. That people want to believe. Forget the evidence and how brilliantly Sagan debunks the various ideas people adhere to, for most people the desire for people to believe these things no matter how sensational is more important. I personally try to follow, despite my own infallibility a more sceptical approach. Knowing full well everyone beliefs with some certainly their world view is the right one. I take pleasure in trying to trust in whatever the evidence I am presented with tells me while trying desperately to remove my own and others bias. I consider myself a scientist not because I work in a lab but because I am fascinated by the universe and the fact that if convincing evidence emerged tomorrow that turned my world view upside down, I would accept it. (If somewhat reluctantly)I don't feel quite comfortable arguing that this approach is better than any other. Even though Sagan does and well. But in a world that relies on so heavily on science. The fact that the vast majority of people are so scientifically illiterate and against the scientific method surely can't be a good thing.Since the early 1980s and the success of Cosmos, Sagan managed to be part of the mammoth task of reversing this illiteracy. There is a long way to go but I am inspired by Sagan to continue to strive for this. If for no other reason than my view that to be scientifically literate is to unlock the wonders of the universe."
52,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2266055-daniel-villines,5,"In today’s extremely strange political environment, the messages issued by our current President are not formed by nuisance of perspective or hyperbole of position. Rather, they are formed of blatant lies, misdirection, and idiocy. And if you happen to be a person of with an open mind and healthy dose of skepticism, this type of messaging becomes tiresome.Each and every one of his statements needs to be taken in, evaluated against evidence that needs to be uncovered, and more often than not, distrusted for what it is. The sheer volume of these messages makes participating in today's political process tiring and could lead to a dangerous type of fatigue. Messages may become so routine that they are simply let to pass unchallenged and the lies, misdirection, and idiocy simply become acceptable by a sort default passivity.The beautiful thing about the The Demon-Haunted World is that Sagan provides an island of solid ground upon which a person can stand while these messages are thrown out in rapid succession. And while this island is built on beliefs, Sagan defines the ingredients of his building materials that best approximate reality and thus, reflect actual truth. It's a good place to be while surrounded by daemons of any kind and/or of copious numbers.In building this island, Sagan makes a couple of points that serve to nourish the survival of its inhabitants. First, Sagan indicates that the effort of disproof is worthwhile; that it represents a process that has done more to advance the human race than any other process. While the task at hand in today’s environment may be arduous, the effort of evaluation and disproof takes us all in the right direction. Perhaps one day we may find that this effort remains as the only 'good fight' that ever was.And equally so, Sagan indicates that those who issue such messages, and those who accept them unconditionally or excusingly, are working against humanity. They would have us reverse course to earlier times and advocate that our simple trust in the messenger or the message is all that is needed for prosperity (regardless of the amount of suffering that is inflicted along the way). Sagan provides an argument that this type of behavior is unethical and immoral. It's detrimental to our survival and should be held in contempt if practiced with malice or depraved indifference.The island Segan builds within The Demon-Haunted World will one day comprise the world. It must if we as humans wish to live beyond our present existence."
53,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2758455-katy,5,"I've been reading this book for a few months now. It is broken up nicely that taking a break from the book from time to time does not distract from the reading experience; in my case it actually makes the experience more enjoyable. In the chapter on Antiscience, I readily agree with this paragraph. I taught high school mathematics for many years and saw too many students want to give up when they could not get the ""right answer"" immediately. ""It might be useful for scientists now and again to list some of their mistakes. It might play an instructive role in illuminating and demythologizing the process of science and in enlightening younger scientists. Even Johannes Kepler, Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Gregor Mendel, and Albert Einstein made serious mistakes. But the scientific enterprise arranges things so that teamwork prevails. What one of us, even the most brilliant among us, misses, another of us, even someone much less celebrated and capable, may detect and rectify.""Another great statement: Chapter 18, The Wind Makes Dust""I don't think science is hard to teach because humans aren't ready for it, or because it arose only through a fluke, or becasues, by a and large, we don't have the brainpower to grapple with it. Instead, the enormous zest for science that I see in first-graders and the lesson from the remnant hunter-gatherers both speak eloquently: A proclivity for science is embedded deeply within us, in all times, places and cultures. It has been the means for our survival. It is our birthright. When, through indifference, inattention, incompetence, or fear of skepticism, we discourage children from science, we are disenfranchising them, taking from them the tools needed to mange their future.""Chapter 21, The Path to Freedom""Books are patient where we are slow to understand ... Books are key to understanding the world and participating in a democratic society.""Chpt 23, ""...is it really true that we can't afford one attack helicopter's worth of seed corn to listen to the stars?""Finished this one up. I do not agree with all that Carl Sagan writes, but his book and ideas are worth the reading and mostly on the pondering and thinking that they cause the reader to engage in. "
54,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/350446-eleanor,2,"I read this book, looking for comfort in the face of living for four years under an administration which rejects all scientific arguments for human-made climate change and a centralized policy for protecting the earth's resources. However, The Demon-Haunted World was written in 1995-96 at the height of X-Files mania, when popular media was flooded with stories of alien abductions, visitations, and government conspiracies to hide ""the truth of Area 51."" As a result, too much of the book, Sagan's last before he died, is devoted to stories about alleged kidnappings and encounters with aliens, much of it gleaned from tabloids. It dates the book terribly, along with other chapters touching upon faith healers, ghosts, ESP experiments, and spelunking. Later in the book Sagan addresses pseudoscience and how its proponents try to undermine actual scientific and medical research; unfortunately, he gives only light examination to subjects like creationism (the long shadow which still hangs over many public schools and their science curriculum) and manipulation of data to suit a political ideology. I think Sagan tried to aim at too many different topics and ended up just giving each one a light swipe before moving on to the next. Midway I felt frustrated and wanting to drop it. There is a chapter on the awfulness of science literacy in the United States, but I've read this in other places, better put and with more current data. (My two bits: if teachers are being pressured to ensure their students pass state benchmark tests in basic math and reading, when are they going to have time to teach science? Especially with no money for labs, equipment, or field trips?)There are gems to be found in this work, as in all of Sagan's books. I strongly suggest reading the last three chapters, ""Maxwell and the Nerds,""""Science and Witchcraft,"" and ""Real Patriots Ask Questions,"" which could serve as standalone essays. Also, chapter two, ""Science and Hope,"" for its eerily prescient observation (p.25 in the US paperback edition):https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6324..."
55,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4573412-daniel,5,"This is a book that I think should become textbook in schools across the world. Sure it could use some editing and Sagan really used a lot of the book to discredit UFO's, and that's just fine, I just wish he would have done it in a manner more cohesive with the rest of the book. Other than that I really liked it. It helped shape the way I think and examine my own beliefs. Everyone should read this at least once."
56,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/301501-erin,1,"Just couldn't get through this one, and I really like Carl Sagan."
57,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1397575-daniella,3,"The Demon-Haunted World should be, in my opinion, required reading for any literate human being with a modicum of intelligence and the responsibility of being a contributing member of society, especially a society as awash in fantastic claims, pseudoscience, misinformation, and an overwhelming tendency toward credulity as ours.""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.""Thus spake Dr. Sagan. Accordingly, he applies this and other tools of critical thinking at the heart of the scientific process as he examines such phenomena as UFO sightings, alien abductions, crop circles, faith healing, and ""channelling"", among other various religious and so-called New Age notions. More important, however, than his arguments against the veracity of these claims--some of which may seem outdated to readers after more than a decade since the book's original publication--is that Sagan, drawing on many recognizable influences on the public consciousness, as well as personal experiences with colleagues and acquaintances, draws our attention to the startling variety of ways in which we allow ourselves to be ""bamboozled,"" as he liked to say, by pretty or flashy claims that prey on our hopes, our fears, our desires, and even our deep-seated neuroses.By demonstrating just how often and how easily so many of us--even those who should really know better--can be led astray from the path of reason, as well as reminding us of the very real dangers (as evidenced by our relatively recent history) of allowing ourselves to slip back into superstition and belief in baseless claims, Dr. Sagan illuminates the reader to the dire necessity for all of us to hone a healthy sense of skepticism. But the aim of The Demon-Haunted World is not only to inform the reader, but also to instruct; in what I believe to be the most important part of the book, the ""Baloney Detection Kit"", Sagan clearly and carefully delineates the methods of critical analysis, which equips us with the tools to judge the credibility of various claims and phenomena for ourselves.As someone who was already familiar with these methods, however, my favorite part of Demon-Haunted World was not the Baloney Detection Kit, but the correlations Dr. Sagan drew between the current alien abduction phenomenon and historical accounts of visitation by demons. I literally grew up hearing stories about UFO sightings and alien encounters; as a member of Gen-Y, they're as much a part of my consciousness (whether I like it or not) as McDonald's, AIDS, and the internet. Thus, I've spent rather more time than I would prefer contemplating the idea and drawing my own conclusions about whether or not a bunch of sexually deviant extraterrestrials are really beaming people up and poking around their no-no spots for some nefarious purpose. Yet somehow it never occurred to me that there might be a connection between reports of spacefaring rapists and the incubi/succubi of old, and I'm eager to explore these correlations further, as well as the possible psychological reasons hinted at by Dr. Sagan. I can only hope that he expounded on this idea further in one of his books I've yet to read.Despite these positive points, though, I must admit that I wasn't all that fond of Demon-Haunted World. At the time, I had recently finished The Varieties of Scientific Experience and Cosmos, both of which instantly achieved status as two of my favorites, so I ventured into reading yet another of the late, great Dr. Sagan's tomes with high expectations. Perhaps for that reason more than any other, I found myself rather disappointed. For me, this book lacked a lot of the awe and majesty of science present throughout Cosmos; instead of his characteristic and inimitable way of presenting science that makes it not only accessible, but also seem like a hell of a lot of fun actually, his tone in Demon-Haunted World conveyed to me a feeling of science being an absolute imperative. And while I agree that science is vitally important, and I share the wish that more people would take an active interest in it, not everyone wants to be a scientist. The world needs historians and writers and musicians and teachers and librarians (etc., etc., etc.) too, Carl. (But I still love you. RIP.)Furthermore, I was a bit disappointed with his overall tone regarding things like television shows, such as X-Files. First of all, I would like to think that most people are intelligent enough to realize these shows are 
fiction
--nobody is taking X-Files as gospel, okay? Secondly:""Imagination will often take us to worlds that never were, but without it we go nowhere.""For a man who has previously put so much importance on imagination, Dr. Sagan seems in Demon-Haunted World to have little patience for people actually using theirs. Perhaps, though, I'm overreacting; I do tend to get a little tetchy when people treat, or appear to be treating, fiction as if it has no value. (It does, especially sci-fi and fantasy, but I won't expound upon my arguments here.) So I'll give Sagan the benefit of the doubt and assume that he was not actually attacking fiction and, more specifically, fictional television, as such, but merely focusing heavily (and perhaps even exaggerating) on their more negative aspects in order to make a point about the quality and presentation of science on television at the time.All in all, though, the intrinsic value of The Demon-Haunted World far outweighs its negative points. I think it's a great book that teaches an important lesson, and I recommend it to anyone who's interested in refreshing or sharpening their critical thinking skills in defense against the outrageous phenomena, corporate consumer propaganda, deliberate dissemination of misinformation, pseudoscience, and general superstition rampant in our society. Actually, come to that, I also recommend it to all the gullible twits who buy that crap wholesale; they're the ones who really need to hone a healthy sense of skepticism."

""Science, as i maintain, is absolutely essential tool for any society with a hope of surviving well in to the next century with its fundamental values intact - not just science as engaged in by its practitioners. but science understood and embraced by the entire human community. And if not scientist will not bring this about, who will?-Carl Sagan (chapter 19: no such thing as a dumb question)this is a book to share, to ""preach"" science with, this a book of reason, humanity and the universe, one of the most beautiful gifts left by the amazing Carl Sagan."
59,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5609347-thomas-sheridan,3,"Well intentioned but ultimately half assed research from someone who was too 'rational' to bother understanding the amazing psychological and cultural impact of this field. The chapter on crop circles actually states that a pair of English drunken country bumpkins made them all. If this was a real scientific study he would of explored the world of underground crop circle artists who make these incredible artworks and not shrugged the whole thing off. What they are getting from it and why they really do it. But no, he was looking whip this predestrian tome off and get back to talking about The Big Bang, Black Holes, Multiverses and other scientific 'facts' which are no more real than leprecaurns and goblins and just as unproven.Sagan, like Dawkins appeals to narrow minded people who think they are scientific types because they watch Mythbusters. I like Carl Sagan, but at the end of the day he is typical of establishment ""consensus"" - which isn't science.He rightly brings up how superstition and religion has led to terrible persecutions - but typically forgets to add that the worst genocides in history: French Revolution, Nazis, USSR, Mao and Pol Pot which were all ""scientific"" revolution led by the ""men of reason"" who demand a society based on logic and not humanity. But you expect people like Sagan to ignore this kind of thing while elevating Reductionist Science to the level of a religion."
60,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35205135-alopexin,3,"I'm sorry I didn't like this book more. The author's passion was clear, and his point got through: It's important to teach, to implement and to practice critical, skeptical thinking, ie the scientific way of thinking. It will help to navigate the storm of misinformation that we're bombarded with nowadays, to give us the power of decisions and the power to resist any attempt at manipulation. Mass delusion is a thing, as demonstrated, and it can be made to seem realer than reality. Without the scientific way of thinking, we are lost without a candle in the dark.That being said, I wish this book was better composed. A good half of the book talked about alien abduction, where the author clearly vented out all his frustration at people's gullibility, accumulated over the year. For a good half of the book, then, I wasn't sure what the point was. The chapters are not that clearly designed either. And I have the misfortune of having an audiobook version where the reader doesn't read properly (no sign between the end of a chapter and a new one, for one), doesn't stress important points, and most importantly, doesn't make any clear distinction between the author's writing and quotes. Which made it mighty confusing. Maybe it's a matter of the age of the book, but on the topic of critical/scientific thinking, I think I liked Bad Science better."
61,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7070799-chad-kettner,5,"A friend recently asked me to recommend only ONE book that would provide a foundation for my views regarding religion. It's nearly impossible to limit it to one book, but nonetheless I chose this book even though Carl Sagan wasn't necessarily intending to address religion head-on.In ""The Demon-Haunted World"", Sagan explains the power of science and its role in skeptical, evidence-based reasoning. Topics include UFOs, alien abductions, witches, religion-both good and bad, Roswell, frauds, scientific genuises, skeptical thinking, wishful thinking, deceptive thinking, balanced thinking, belief, superstition, astrology, ESP, myth, and the like; and the role and place of science and scientific inquiry in all of this.And the best part is that it's not a difficult, in-your-face read regardless of your beliefs or approach to life. Sagan is respectful and understanding, while examining the power of science and explaining why it is truly a ""candle in the dark""."
62,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,5,"Sagan's final work is even more relevant today than it was when I first read it upon publication nearly twenty years ago. This is one of the best books ever written on science and its practice as well as offering deep reflections on the state of intellectualism and the future of liberal culture. There is no need for me to summarize Sagan's arguments: whose mind would I be changing? Everyone in America has already chose their sides — it yet remains to be seen which will win, and I'm not at all optimistic, much less so than twenty years ago. The corrosive power of religious fundamentalism is only increasing and the American political resistance to it is critically dependent on political party."
63,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,5,"A fine exposition on the importance of the scientific way of thought. Sagan urges us to be both skeptical and curious; he warns against pseudoscience, confronts the world of superstition, and altogether argues against unrestrained credulity. Hallucinations, alien abductions, and faith healing are among the many topics examined in an intelligent and (nearly) unbiased manner. I felt like Sagan could have spent a bit less time on aliens, and some of the later chapters start to feel a bit random, but these are but trifling complaints. This book is awesome."

Why do people believe in crazy things? Because we need stories and we prefer demons and UFOs to a bunch of old duded going out at night and making circles in corn. Or that your kid died because someone bewitched her instead of just disease or whatever. Sagan is a brilliant writer and this was a great read. I kept thinking of two other books: Darwin's Dangerous Idea and Fantasyland (Anderson). Both of those are excellent and somewhat along the same lines. "

66,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,5,"Carl Sagan's The Demon-haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark is a wonderful, important book. Sagan understands the joy of learning, the wonderful feeling of achievement when we finally have learned something previously thought to be mysterious. This book debunks alien abduction, UFO mania, supernatural beings (demons), the so-called “channelling”, and many pseudosciences (astrology for example). It includes analysis of hallucinations and the episode in American psychoanalysis history where therapists implanted false memories into patients’ mind. Pseudosciences and conspiracy theories have ""advanced"" since Sagan's death. If he lived to today, he probably would debunk Alex Jones?Most importantly, the book debates the importance of critical thinking and skepticism, explains the difference between facts and thoughts, and why the essence of science is scientific methods.Sagan criticises the lack of scientific awareness in American pop culture and the weakness of science in American education system. He points out the combination of the thirst for discoveries (wonders) and a healthy dose of skepticism is essential to the social and political development of America (and humankind in general).“How much science is there on the radio or television talk shows, or on those dreary Sunday morning programs in which middle-aged white people sit around agreeing with each other? When is the last time you heard an intelligent comment on science by a President of the United States? Why in all America is there no TV drama that has as its hero someone devoted to figuring out how the Universe works? ”Sagan would be happy to know that after his death, there have been several popular science programs on mainstream TV, such as The Mythbusters. At least in some part of America, science and mathematics education are improving and SETM education is stronger than ever, especially among women. However, he would be shocked out of his grave by the level of ignorance in current president of US.One chapter is a debate on why government should support fundamental science: “Cutting off fundamental, curiosity-driven science is like eating the seed corn.” On link between unchecked religion and witch mania: “If we’re absolutely sure that our beliefs are right, and those of others wrong; that we are motivated by good, and others by evil; that the King of the Universe speaks to us, and not to adherents of very different faiths; that it is wicked to challenge conventional doctrines or to ask searching questions; that our main job is to believe and obey—then the witch mania will recur in its infinite variations down to the time of the last man.”The chapter about the history of hydrogen bomb and Edward Teller is a scientist's rumination on his fellow scientists and the subject of science and evil. The last several chapters discuss American history, politics and democracy, co-written with Sagan’s wife Ann Druyan. 23 years after the publication, these discussions are still very relevant, actually more relevant than ever, and Sagan would be so appalled by how relevant some of his predictions are today:“Those who seek power at any price detect a societal weakness, a fear that they can ride into office.”“In 1798, the ruling Federalist Party knew that the button to push was ethnic and cultural prejudice.”   “Giving credit for French and Irish cultural triumphs, advocating equal rights for them, was in effect decried in conservative circles as sentimental—unrealistic political correctness.”“The pretexts change from year to year, but the result remains the same: concentrating more power in fewer hands and suppressing diversity of opinion—even though experience plainly shows the dangers of such a course of action.”...and history never change! What have we learned!Sagan argues that American Democracy (modern democracy) is the social extension of scientific thinking originated from European Enlightenment since Renaissance.“Scientific findings and attitudes were common in those who invented the United States.”The example is Thomas Jefferson: “Nevertheless, he believed that the habit of skepticism is an essential prerequisite for responsible citizenship. He argued that the cost of education is trivial compared to the cost of ignorance, of leaving the government to the wolves. He taught that the country is safe only when the people rule.”  “as science popularizer Watson Davis put it, “the scientific way is the democratic way.”On danger of authoritarian: “It is possible—given absolute control over the media and the police—to rewrite the memories of hundreds of millions of people, if you have a generation to accomplish it in.”“In our time, with total fabrication of realistic stills, motion pictures, and videotapes technologically within reach, with television in every home, and with critical thinking in decline, restructuring societal memories even without much attention from the secret police seems possible.”Today’s Tyrannies (China for example) use internet and big data to control and brainwash their people, and current administration of United States is trying very hard to catch up!On the Democracy fatigue when people taking for granted of the rights they already have: “Now it’s no good to have such rights if they’re not used—a right of free speech when no one contradicts the government, freedom of the press when no one is willing to ask the tough questions, a right of assembly when there are no protests, universal suffrage when less than half the electorate votes, separation of church and state when the wall of separation is not regularly repaired.”This is one of the reasons why US has Trump as their president. “However, through lowered educational standards, declining intellectual competence, diminished zest for substantive debate, and social sanctions against skepticism, our liberties can be slowly eroded and our rights subverted.” This is a pressing danger that United States and Europe is facing.However, Sagan does not dig into the topic of the limits of democracy, even if he does admit that democracy is not always efficient and that is its price to pay. “But the price is high: This competition is an impediment to religious bodies acting in concert to address the common good.”  This is a very interesting topic and I plan to read more.My impression is--compare to Richard Dawkins--Carl Sagan has better understanding of human weakness, and more sympathetic towards those who--mostly born into therefore never being offered with other choices or never being taught about scientific thinkings--rely on religion for comfort. A sympathetic speaker is a persuasive speaker.
“‘widespread public appreciation of the methods of science might work a final conquest of stupidity’—a worthy, but probably unrealizable, goal.”
 But we shall have hope."

This book should be required reading, because as ordinary people critical thinking and science is all we have to fight against oppression from the people in control, whether they use religion as a tool for control or technology. As Sagan says in this book, science is a birthright for every person no matter your station, all we have to do is show the willingness to learn."
68,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23157806-katerina,5,"This is an amazing but difficult book. It took me almost half a year to read it, but only because I thought I lost it during my travelling and didn't have it for several months and because I couldn't dedicate it all my reading time. It is not a book to read for fun. That's why I said it is difficult.For me it can be split in at least two or three parts. 1. In the first one he starts with the basic elements of science in total: experimentation, proof and skepticism that leads to reexamining and correcting errors. He also introduces the difference with pseudoscience. It is the introduction to his whole book.2. The second part is dedicated to pseudoscience. He assesses common misconceptions or believes that have no logical background, such as aliens, faces on the moon, crop circles, astrology, mediums, etc. It is a long part, where he states all data we have, such as the top secret military balloons, the people that admitted making the crop circles, or performing tricks to convince people that the communicate with ghosts and the geology and information we now know about the moon or Mars. He goes through the centuries trying to explain why people are prone to believe in pseudoscience and he compares the visions of aliens to the visions of God and angels and saints or demons and Satan. In one word, they are all hallucinations. This part is long and reaches around page 230. It can be tiring and especially if the reader does believe in some of the ideas that are assessed, Sagan can seem like mocking or attacking. I personally disagree that he is making fun of people. He is a scientist and he is trying to prove his statements with logic.3. The third part focuses back to real science and is the one I personally enjoyed most. There is no black and white. Science has been used for both good and bad reasons, but it is the fault of people and not of science itself. There have been scientists who supported weapons like the hydrogen bomb, and scientists that opposed the use and foresaw the disastrous results they can cause. But science is based on skepticism and criticism, and that is the absolute key to freedom. The most amazing chapter for me was the one entitles ""No such thing as a dumb question"". He highlights what we do to children to make them uninterested to science and not willing to ask questions. A bit of a long review, but it is a book full of ideas and logic. Carl Sagan is incredible in explaining with simple terms difficult scientific terms. His explanation of Maxwell's equations, or Pauling's theory is incredibly simple. Of course it requires basic understanding of mathematics. As a conclusion, I am kind of glad Sagan is dead already. If he could see at what level USA is today, if he could hear the comments that come out of important political mouths, I think he would commit suicide. He would see that the main efforts of his whole life didn't have influence yet. I really hope they will at a point, but I don't think we are on a good path...

70,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91180489-valerie-vlasenko,5,I simply love how Sagan thinks and writes. This book is very inspiring and helps us look back at our own priorities in life. 
71,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/304492-darrell,5,"The Demon-Haunted World by Carl Sagan is the perfect book to start with for anyone interested in skepticism. He explains the difference between science and psuedoscience and why science is a good thing. While some may point out that science brings unprecedented destruction in the form of ever more powerful weapons, Sagan reminds us that “advances in medicine and agriculture have saved vastly more lives than have been lost in all the wars in history.” (11)He brings up an interesting concept I’ve never heard of before called psuedo-religion. I never thought there could be a difference between religion and psuedo-religion, since the concept of religion is often so vague. However, there is as much reason for religion to be skeptical of extremism perpetrated in its name as there is for science to be skeptical of psuedoscience.People shouldn’t just blindly believe what scientists tell them anymore than they should believe what psuedoscientists tell them. Sagan tells us “The method of science, as stodgy and grumpy as it may seem, is far more important than the findings of science.” (22) It is more important to teach children to use the scientific method of experimentation, observation, and providing evidence, than it is to simply make them memorize facts. Knowing how to think critically and question everything helps them more in their day to day life than a list of facts.Unlike psuedoscience and psuedo-relgion, science encourages debate and opposing opinions. ”Science thrives on, indeed requires, the free exchange of ideas; its values are antithetical to secrecy.” (38) Like democracy, science requires an educated populace to work best. When science gets something wrong, the “question everything” attitude of science helps correct it.Sagan spends the first half of the book explaining why aliens aren’t coming to Earth. He points out that there are many more reasonable alternate explanations for strange lights in the sky and abduction reports. In a chapter on hallucinations, he says, “Another analogy might be that dreams, like the stars, are shining all the time. Though the stars are not often seen by day, since the sun shines too brightly, if, during the day, there is an eclipse [...:], then the stars, like dreams, though often forgotten, may always be seen.” (106)The second half of the book deals with science and skepticism in general. Skeptics will want to dog ear page 212, where Carl Sagan lists some common logical fallacies. Knowing the fallacies that many people fall prey to will help a good skeptic sniff out flaws in their arguments. To use Carl Sagan’s example, if someone claims that We must institute the death penalty to discourage violent crime, they are committing the logical fallacy of begging the question, also called assuming the answer. We can’t just assume the death penalty will lower crime rates without evidence to back up the claim.Another common fallacy is observational selection. This is when you only remember the times your idea was right and ignore the times it wasn’t. For example, emergency room nurses claim it is busier during a full moon because they don’t count the times it’s busy when there isn’t a full moon or the times there is a full moon and it isn’t busy.“A proclivity for science is embedded deeply within us, in all times, places and cultures. It has been the means for our survival.” (317) Knowing which plants are poisonous and knowing the migration patterns of animals helped our hunter-gatherer ancestors survive. Without this knowledge, gained through careful observation, and proved true time and time again, humans wouldn’t have survived.Everyone has some knowledge of how the world works, we are all scientists in some ways. If the television doesn’t turn on, we form a hypothesis about why this is so. Perhaps the batteries in the remote are dead. We test the hypothesis by putting in fresh batteries and trying again. It’s absurd for anyone to be anti-science when each of us instinctively uses science in our own lives everyday. Science isn’t just one of several different explanations for how the world works, it’s the only explanation backed up with evidence."

73,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83041768-jordan-hagedon,5,"When I mentioned this book, a relative told me it was going to be too hard to read (??) because it was a book about science. That is not the case. It's very clearly and simply written. It's also very good. I would absolutely recommend. "
74,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4153215-rusty,5,"*Oct 5, 2017*I read this again. Funny, I read this the first time somewhere around 2000, and I read it along with several other of Sagan's books, Cosmos, Broca's Brain, Pale Blue Dot, Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors... maybe a few others too, I can't recall, and it was during that blurry couple of weeks that I was borrowing heavily from the library instead of purchasing books, so I don't know what else of his I may have read. But what makes all that funny is that in my head all of those books were sort of jumbled up in my head as a single work. I remember specific passages that weren't in there when I read it this time. Dumb brain. However, I still found it moving. He spends a lot of time discussing alien abductions and crop circles, two types of very popular conspiracies in the 90's that aren't really talked about as much anymore. So all those chapters going over those points don't feel as timely now as they did 20 years ago when this book was released. If he were writing it today he might be dealing more with religious fundamentalism and anti-vaccination, or anti-GMO concerns that the larger public seems to be dealing with. But the beauty of this book is that he's trying to focus on how we think about new information, whether it sounds plausible or ridiculous. So while he does go over why he thinks alien made crop circles and alien abductions are problematic (we all know I'm talking about SPACE aliens, right? Not neighbors from a nearby country) and don't meet the criteria of good evidence, the larger lessons are applicable to any claim we hear about, regardless of what it is.So, it's dated a bit, but this book is more responsible for my outlook in life than any other I can possibly think of. I miss Carl Sagan and wish he were still around. *Sept 8, 2010*I can't recommend this highly enough. This book is a trusty old friend to me. I've purchased it many times as a gift for others and it has influenced me greatly over the course of my life. Of course it is really a view into the mind of Carl Sagan and he discusses religion, God, spirituality, and his skeptism, in great detail. The tone of the book isn't condescending or too highbrow. But the subject matter is a touchy one. You might disagree with his conclusions, but it's hard to argue with his reasoning. Very controversial - very enlightening."
75,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69348187-xavier,5,"Second reading done on 12.11.19 - Because of the current political climate, especially in America, this book is more important now than ever. The relevancy of some passages about the dangers of not thinking critically during political theatrics was striking. The fact that this was written in 1997 and some issues that Sagan brings to light are still current means that the darkness of ignorance is ever enveloping around us, and so we must do our best to keep the candles lit.It has been almost a year since I've read this wonderful book and whenever I hear false or misleading information being spread on television or online, I refer back to this gem. This was my first jump into the superb works of Carl Sagan and it was one I will never forget. This book opened my eyes to the amazing world of science and has helped me stop and think about how things work and why things are before believing something to be truthful. It has helped me analyze situations differently and has made me a more critical person.The main theme is the importance of critical thinking. Sagan explains that asking questions leads down the wonderful path of knowledge. Simply accepting a statement at face value can be dangerous and can lead down slippery slope. Science is about experimentation and making observations, recording the results of those tests, coming to a theory or hypothesis and then releasing the information of the research so that other scientists can analyze your work and come to their own conclusions.Nothing is ever definite in science and the results of one test can be overturned completely by another. The learning process is constant. That is what I find wonderful about the sciences; it is an expansive field that is constantly changing and flipping theories upside down or straight out the window!Sagan warns about the dangers of religion and pseudo-science and their inability to accept any type of scrutinizing or examination. That leads to blind acceptance. Society should be constantly on its collective toes and be wary of the information being spread. We should all be asking more questions. Question your government. Question your religious institutions.The chapter titled The Dragon in My Garage was one of my favorites. Definitely eye-opening.I highly recommend this great book to EVERYONE."
76,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/262542-mo,1," I was immediately put off by this book, but decided to give it a fair shot. So I read it once. I even considered reading it again just in case I missed some key point that would enable me to judge this work more favorably. That is not the case.  Sagan's Demon-Haunted World is nothing more than long-winded vitriol about the shortcomings of pseudoscience. I could agree with him in this aspect. But his argument goes on for entirely too long and could have taken less than a chapter to articulate: The Scientific Method is God. While I am a firm proponent of the scientific method and have been known to use it myself from time to time, I cannot exclude other avenues of gaining understanding about our world and the universe in which we live.  When I think of the scientific method, I am reminded of its reliance upon empirical data. A casual observation clearly shows that linguistically empirical is related to empire. Witnessing the current state of the world and legacy of colonists and empires, I highly doubt the infallibility of the scientific method; with its reliance on facts and figures and only those things which can be measured, dissected and reproduced under controlled conditions.  Saganites will undoubtedly love this work. Those looking for a more balanced treatment of the subject matter are urged to read something else. "
77,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1304308-worthless-bum,5,"I read this book around 9 years ago, so I'm pretty fuzzy on the details, but this book was perhaps the most important, life-changing read of my life. My interest in science and rationality is owed more to this book than any other. In short, this book is a classic in the promotion of science and rational scepticism. As I recall, Sagan takes a more diplomatic approach towards religion than the New Atheists, arguing that religion is fine insofar that it is amenable to scientific discovery. I'm going to have to reread this in the near future to see how well my fond rememberances stack up to a contemporized analysis. "
78,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/188511-krishan,5,"Magnificent. Carl Sagan takes us on a mind-expanding tour of the landscape of scientific knowledge and the oceans of human ignorance. This deeply skeptical look at our ideas is more than expose of superstition, but an exercise in constructive criticism.Sagan shows us that science and reason are our greatest tools for understanding and moral judgment. An excellent companion to the recent 'new atheism' books by Harris, Hitchens, Dawkins, Dennet etc..."
79,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38015700-abishek,1,"I couldn't do it. I got about 7 chapters in and found that I was forcing myself to read the book and making very little progress. The prose is fantastic, but the content is just so dry and boring that I couldn't bring myself to commit the time required to get through it. It reads like a rant about why science is right and everyone else is stupid. It's preaching to the choir. There are just too many good books that need to be read. This, unfortunately, isn't one of them."
80,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49311671-kauther-a,4,"As a member of the choir to whom Sagan is preaching, I have found this book wonderful. I am skeptical of its efficacy to persuade those who do not agree with the book a priori. Does it work to use reason to argue for reason, when the audience does not use reason? I have my doubts."
81,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1264605-elaine,5,This was an excellent book! It should be mandatory reading for high school students.
82,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509692-dave-schey,5,Probably my favorite of Carl Sagan's books.
83,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4975021-ali,2,"I don't know why I'd had such high expectations from this book. Perhaps because it was by the renowned Carl Sagan? Unfortunately, this work was very disappointing. I'd give it a star only, but since I didn't finish it, and for the benefit of doubt, here are two. This is a book of dogma, and I despise dogmas. This is the kind of books that might have rocked my world six or seven years ago when new atheism was the star of the game before I stumbled upon new titles and experiences; the kinds that illustrate the shallow, missionary structure of new atheism and how it happens to be, to a great extent, just another religion. New atheism falsely claims monopoly on science when it, in fact, only advocates naturalism; a philosophical stance that doesn't make an individual more appreciative of science and its applications than adherents of other schools of thought particularly theistic ones. It's great and satisfying to be a scientist. It's even greater and more satisfying to be a scientist well-equipped with the discipline of philosophy, and by philosophy I'm not referring to the colloquial definition of it as ""a matter of taste"" and the ""sort of explanation that suits your personality."" No, I'm referring to valid, sound argumentation based on the laws of logic. Therefore, to witness Sagan's dismissal of philosophy and him equating it to pseudoscience is rather saddening if not ignorant. This is affirmed by Sagan's belief that ""the difference between physics and metaphysics is that the metaphysicist has no laboratory."" This is not a defense of science, but of empiricism as the sole basis of truth; a school of philosophy that Sagan generally disregards. In addition, there are claims that Sagan, most likely, didn't get straight such as science originating in ancient Greece. I'm not an expert on the subject of the history of science, but I'm highly skeptical of this. He also, falsely in my opinion, equates science and democracy as having the same values. I don't know how he reached this conclusion; truths of science are determined by chains of experimentation while those of democracy are established by majority rule. Thus, I don't see the resemblance. Despite all of that, I have high regards for Carl Sagan for championing science and making it accessible to as many people as possible. RIP."
84,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112723654-jacen-spector,4,"To be absolutely fair, I am reading this book during a difficult time losing a loved one to COVID-19, and through a modern lens. I had this book recommended to me by a friend and reading some other online reviews about how it helped them cope with a passing loved one by parsing through what they want to believe, versus what we can know. I do think that loaded my expectations on what this book could be, rather than it actually was.In reality, this book is an exploration on various psudeo-sciences, and pleas to our emotional subjectivity throughout the ages, contrasted with the (then, 1980's) modern scientific approach, which has its own sets of positives and negatives. All the classic hits are here to unravel: UFO's, astrology, crop circles, the afterlife, spiritual muses, witchcraft. Sagan explores many of these hot topics, tells the opposing side, and sprinkles in his thoughts and experiences as being a leading voice in the scientific community through his various outlets. The repeating thesis is about due diligence before falling prey to appeal to our emotional desires of what we want to be true, and why this is part of the human condition, not just a symptom of modern life. These things have always happened throughout history, and he explores his way of approaching questioning with a toolkit he calls, the baloney detector. There is a strong chapter that I've seen quoted often about his experience losing his parents, whom he was very close to. It happens about 1/3rd or so through the book, and it pulled on my heartstrings, however that is a personal slice of what the book wants to offer. Which left me wanted more on that topic specifically.The only qualms I had, which are small, are that there is some dating issues with re-reading this 40 or so years later, even though the core concepts of using tactful skepticism, and not swinging to hard into pragmatic thinking that you become completely dismissive of others by false superiority is sound. The second trouble spot is that this is a book from the scientific community, for the same demographic, therefore some process on topics can feel very much so an echo chamber. Considering this is pre-social media, that problem may not have been as prevalant as it is today-- however, this book doesn't appeal to ""those who believe."""
85,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74059121-foncho,5,"The more Sagan books I read, the more I wish he could be alive and well. If only the world was riddled with people like him. A lot of what this book argues may come as cynical, arrogant, or even offending to some people. Yet, every argument is made with humbleness and a will to doubt if necessary. If you don't agree with what's written here, you should remember how much Sagan stressed that he might be wrong -- that in the face of evidence, he will change his mind. He doesn't state his beliefs as facts. In truth, he avoids having beliefs. I don't agree with everything he says, of course. His stand on the educational issues, I'd say, are misplaced. I agree with the origin of the problem, although not with the proposed resolution. However, every single line of this book is made with self-skepticism, with an ode to clear thought. This is the kind of book that should be taught in schools. Not to indoctrinate Carl's arguments, but to show the importance of critical thought and skepticism.I wasn't born yet when Sagan died. But now, more than ever, I understand why so many miss him. No human is perfect, I bet Carl had many flaws. But the testaments he left us is more than reason enough to try to make this world as good as he argues it could be."
86,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63997659-steve-lawless,3,"Had to abandon it. I agree with everything that I read and there is no doubt that the issues he deals with are a serious problem but I'm having to read an awful lot to learn very little personally. Cosmos blew me away with its brilliance but the arguments in this book are better put by others. It may be yet another example, from my personal perspective, of a book with more relevance to an American audience. I was hoping for more examining why people are generally superstitious and so ready to believe absolute tripe. What is the evolutionary reason for this in humans? Maybe he tackles this later on but I've read 7 chapters and am no wiser. "
87,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Engaging and wiseThe title is both a profound description of the human world before (and without) science, and an apt metaphor for what science really means to us. In particular, Sagan refers in Chapter 7 to the world of Europe during the time of Pope Innocent VIII (was ever a personage more ironically named?) in which ""perhaps hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions"" of people were tortured and burned at the stake and/or dismembered or otherwise killed for being witches or for consorting with demons and other imagined agents of Satan (p. 122). Sagan wants to remind us very lucky citizens of the twenty-first century just what it was like in the middle ages when the nature of truth was decided by the coercive power of authority and not by observation and evidence. Where would we be without science? is the question of the book, and Sagan's title is the startling answer. We would still be in the dark ages.But what is this magical ""science"" that makes all the difference in the world? It is common sense codified and repeatedly tested. Instead of accepting the existence of demons or aliens or Satanic conspiracies based on reports from people, the person of common sense asks to SEE the demons. She wants proof of their existence, and he wants that proof verified by others. Sagan has what he calls a ""baloney detection kit"" (pp. 210-211) in which he has science confront new ideas. This kit includes ""independent confirmation"" of the ""facts""; the idea that ""arguments from authority carry little weight""; the possibility of falsification; and the use of Occam's Razor. Virtually everybody reading this review knows what Sagan means by these terms. The astonishing fact, and one of the key points of his book, is that the overwhelming majority of people in this country and throughout the world do not. The even more astonishing fact is that even some people with college educations are not clear about the need for evidence and independent confirmation of evidence before one can say that something is true, and knowing even then that this truth is only a tentative conclusion, forever subject to being overthrown by new evidence, evidence that might arrive tomorrow.Many people are dissatisfied with this and want absolute certainty. But what Sagan is at pains to say is that such ""certainty"" is never forthcoming in this world. Such certainty is the province of religion. An integral part of the human condition is to realize and accept the fact that we cannot have absolute certainty, that the best we can have is a candle in the dark, and that candle is science. Without it we have an arbitrary truth, a truth of, by, and for authority. And that kind of ""truth"" can hurt you if you happen not to be on the side of authority, or happen to fall out of grace with the powers that be.The question arises, why is the method and the logic of science a mystery to so many people? Sagan's answer is, it isn't taught in school. This book is an attempt to right this wrong. He would like to see the scientific method as part of our grade school curriculum, and see it continued on into college. I would add that science is not intuitive. It is not politically correct. It is politically neutral and sometimes it is amazingly anti-intuitive. People who make their living primarily with their political and intuitive (i.e., social) skills tend to be the ones most threatened and most ignorant of science.Another question is, why do so many people still believe in demons and devils, aliens and astrology, Loch Ness monsters and “The Dragon in My Garage” (a title of one of Sagan's chapters) when the overwhelming weight of evidence is against them? Simple: we humans have a need to believe. This need can either be satisfied with religion, or fairy tales from, e.g., the National Enquirer, or by the wonders of science. Sagan would like to see the wonders of science get more play both on the tube and in our classrooms. He believes, as most progressive people do, that science and religion can co-exist. Of course this comes as no revelation to me, since I believe that properly understood, the stuff of religion must always be taken as symbolic and as a guide to how to live. The literal interpretation of religious ideas and the insistence on absolute truths always leads to trouble, contradictions and eventually to an untenable position which must be defended with brutal force. Sad to say.Sagan examines many of the delusions of our times, e.g., alien abductions, the face on Mars, UFOs, creationism, astrology, telepathy, channeling, psychic healing, New Age fuzziness, etc. In Chapter 9, entitled ""Therapy,"" Sagan deals with satanic ritual abuse charges, ""recovered"" memories of sexual abuse, the remembrance of previous lives, even memories of future lives (!) thought to be ""uncovered"" by some therapists.This book is a celebration of science and an examination of the world of pseudoscience, why it exists and what can be done about lessening its negative effect on our lives. Sagan celebrates the wonders of science and the discoveries of science while warning us against the dangers inherent in pseudoscience. As a man who is as comfortable writing for Parade Magazine as he is addressing the National Academy of Sciences, you can be sure he is both easy to read and worth reading. Too bad he is no longer with us. His gentle and tolerant nature combined with his wisdom and his childlike excitement for life is already sorely missed. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is"
88,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50018180-darrel-bishop,5,"I really appreciated much about this book. Carl Sagan's tone is level headed and insightful. One of the gems I pulled from it was that the response to an ignorant statement should not be censorship, but a better argument. I also enjoyed measuring his words written in the mid 90s against the rapid changes that have happened in the last 20 years. He concludes his book with one of the purest statements of real American patriotism I have ever read. It's a statement that transcends political boundaries and should move the heart of any person interested in human rights."
89,0345409469,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11686634,5,I felt like I was having a conversation with Carl Sagan. That says it all.
