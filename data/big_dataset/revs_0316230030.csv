0,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62787798-bill-gates,4,"Why do I love my wife, Melinda?The sociologist Nicholas Christakis would probably give way more practical answers than I would. He’d argue that our emotional connection gives us a greater incentive to work together to ensure the survival of our kids (and our bloodlines). If we’re ever attacked, our larger, combined family unit is more likely to successfully defend ourselves. We’re also more likely to share food and supplies with one another, upping our chances of living through a tough winter.(My own reasons for loving Melinda are a lot less practical.)In his terrific book Blueprint, Christakis explains that humans have evolved to work together and be social. Although this instinct originally developed because it made us more likely to live longer, our need to form groups has had a huge impact on human history.Early in the book, Christakis says, “The human ability to construct societies has become an instinct. It is not just something we can do—it is something we must do.” He believes that this instinct has led to eight common traits that—with very few exceptions—you can find in every society on earth. These eight traits form what he calls the “social suite”:1. Individual identity2. Love for partners and children3. Friendship4. Social networks5. Cooperation6. Preference for your own group7. Some form of hierarchy8. Social learning and teachingMost of the book is devoted to explaining how each of these traits is found in seemingly disparate peoples, from the Roman Empire to the Turkana people of Kenya. Our world has gone from being small groups of hunter-gatherers that were closely related to the modern world where you can live in a city with millions of other people. The fact that the social suite has remained constant despite those changes is amazing.But the social suite alone is only part of the story. If you want to explain human behavior, there’s a lot going on. You’ve got the genetics you were born with. You’ve got hormones running through the body. You’ve got your childhood and how that shaped you. And you’ve got learned behaviors—the understanding of what’s allowed and what’s not allowed that is passed to you through societal norms.Blueprint focuses mostly on the last part. If you want a more complete picture, I recommend the book Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst by Robert Sapolsky. My older daughter suggested I read it (Sapolsky was one of her favorite professors in college), because it’s a super in-depth look at why humans act the way they do. He’s giving you a framework down to the biological and hormonal level, while Christakis focuses more on person-to-person interactions.Behave is really long, though—nearly 700 pages!—and the incredible level of detail isn’t for everyone. It almost feels like a very well-written textbook. Blueprint is a lot more accessible for a general audience. I recommend starting with Christakis and then, if your interest in the subject is piqued, moving onto Sapolsky.One of the things that makes Blueprint so readable is all of the fascinating examples and stories that Christakis uses. The book begins by looking at a bunch of different shipwrecks that resulted in people getting stranded on deserted islands. Each group had to develop their own form of society, and some were more successful than others. The ones that performed the best (“best” meaning that a high percentage of its people survived to be rescued) embodied some or most elements of the social suite. The societies that didn’t have these elements fell apart quickly, with several even devolving into cannibalism.I was particularly fascinated by one section of the book where Christakis compares chimpanzees and bonobos. Chimps are super aggressive with each other and sometimes will kill members of their own group to assert dominance. Bonobos, on the other hand, are largely peaceful and playful creatures. They’re one of the only species other than humans who engage in sex for pleasure, not just for procreation purposes.Christakis offers a couple theories for why the two types of apes are so different, even though they look so similar. Chimpanzees were more likely to share territory with gorillas and had less access to food than the bonobos, so aggressive chimps might have had a better chance to survive. Or maybe bonobo females—like humans—evolved to value cooperation over aggression when choosing a mate.I was a little surprised to learn that the field of comparing the social behaviors of humans with other species isn’t more developed. Christakis appears to be at the frontier of this, and Blueprint only gives you a surface level understanding.I also wish he had gone deeper on the main conclusion of his book: that every human being on earth has more in common than not. It raises big questions, like how we can leverage that commonality to get things done. Can we really get 7 billion people to work together and solve big problems like climate change? Are our similarities powerful enough to overcome the few differences we do have?Christakis doesn’t answer these questions, but he does imply that the answer is yes by showing that we have an innate capability and need to cooperate. A lot of people are fascinated by the differences between us—but the differences are actually pretty minor compared to the similarities. In that regard, Blueprint is a fundamentally optimistic book.I didn’t expect to finish a book about behavior feeling more hopeful, but Christakis surprised me. It’s easy to feel down reading news headlines every day about how polarized we’re becoming. Blueprint is a refreshing reminder that, when people say we’re all in this together, it’s not just a platitude—it’s evolution."
1,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"I've had a lot of love and interest in the social sciences over the years. I thought I was really into psychology until I fell in love with sociology. This led me to be a huge lover of SF in general, but concurrently, I read all about utopias, planned communities, shipwrecked sailors building their own natural communities, and all the kinds of political, social, and even biological foundations that any of these could arise from.And then I read this book. Christakis, a man with titles galore, has done a very thorough and interesting job in breaking down the fundamental similarities between all societies, starting from the same place that I began my research and taking it further... like communities in online gaming. But he doesn't stop there. He goes into the inherently social nature of animals, focusing on the features that are similar across the board.Anyone who has ever had a cat or a dog will recognize the intelligence, altruism, cooperative natures of other social creatures. The same is true for dolphins and whales, elephants and the whole simian hoard. Just watch Animal Planet!It's easy to see we're all more alike than different. And that's the main point. We're all biologically, genetically set-up, to want certain things. Some of those things conflict with each other. Culture and social structures put a modifier on the worst aspects of those conflicts and reinforce cooperation... but cooperative structures can be gamed. Members within it can cheat and steal and reap the benefits of the cooperation without giving anything back. And then the reaction comes. Punishment, more self-modifiers, and a flip-flop between aggression and cooperation. Richard Dawkins explains this very well in the Selfish Gene, and in a lot more convincing detail, but Christakis is quite good for all that.We create societies based on our biological ""social suite"". These are features that cross all boundaries of culture because they're hard-wired in us. I'll steal the list from Bill Gate's review on this book:1. Individual identity2. Love for partners and children3. Friendship4. Social networks5. Cooperation6. Preference for your own group7. Some form of hierarchy8. Social learning and teachingThe final takeaway from this book DOES give us hope, oddly enough. These are all positive features of not just humanity but of a lot of the animal kingdom. But here's the trick: Any time a culture or a social structure tries to break this social suite by denying even a single aspect to it, things tend to fall apart. Social learning rather implies that. And some, like preference for your own group, can be conflated into a major us vs them that can lead to aggressive war parties our world wars. BUT... when social divisions are crossed, or given aspect in an umbrella from that captures commonalities across the divides, cooperation CAN be reestablished. People have seen this countless times. Giving aid to enemy soldiers on the battlefield, or the Red Cross. Charitable organizations. Doctors Without Borders. Or perhaps we ought to remember that countless unrelated people flocked to the twin towers to help those in need. We DO have a lot of evidence of altruism in our social lives, but this is mitigated against our perception that there are thieves among us.I personally see a failure of cooperation going on all around us. It seems more glaringly obvious to me every day. And for good reason. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. The grand majority in the middle are getting pushed down to the poorer side. Mistrust is everywhere because of the thieves. I suppose the big question is this: can we learn to cooperate once more to root out the real thieves and reestablish the fundamental social suite that we need to thrive?"
2,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24035606-ryan-boissonneault,5,"Social scientists can approach the study of human culture, broadly, by either focusing on differences or similarities. All too often, they choose to accentuate the differences, elaborating on what divides us and on our more aggressive and sinister behaviors. Since cultural differences are so obvious, the countless cross-cultural variations in human behavior would seem to dispel the possibility of cultural universals. In Blueprint, Nicholas Christakis makes the opposite case: that our genes code for universal traits—the social suite—that underlie all superficial variation in human behavior and provide the foundation by which we form social networks. Christakis uses the metaphor of viewing two mountains from a 10,000 foot plateau, noting that one mountain appears three times the size of the other, until you descend from the plateau. Then, you realize the two mountains are 10,300 and 10,900 feet tall, and are not so dissimilar from this enlarged perspective. This enlarged perspective is the focus of the book. It extends the concept of genetic influence beyond its physical manifestations (without the strict determinism, as we’ll see). To begin with, it is a noncontroversial fact that genes code for proteins, which aggregate into cells. The cells, in turn, form bodies, brains, and ultimately the emergence of mind and behavior. But it is not clear where this genetic influence should stop, and Christakis is suggesting that genes also have an influence on the formation of societies, just as they have an influence on bodies.The concept of the extended phenotype—popularized by Richard Dawkins—describes the effects of genes on the environment outside of the body. Whereas a phenotype is a physical manifestation of genetic information, as in the genes that code for blue eyes, an extended phenotype is an expression of the genotype that impacts the environment, such as a spider’s web, a bird’s nest, or a beaver’s dam. Experiments have been conducted that show, for example, that birds can build nests without the benefit of social learning, demonstrating that the behavior is innate. Considering that we know that genes code for physical manifestations and environmental behaviors, there is no logical reason to terminate the point of influence at arbitrary levels; genes, in addition to coding for body shape and size and the instinct to build nests, can also encode for social network formation as an extended phenotype for social animals, including humans. For a host of historical, philosophical, and religious reasons, we tend to view humans as somehow separate from and superior to nature and other animals, but the distinction breaks down after careful analysis. For example, years of research in animal behavior shows that chimpanzees, elephants, and whales form friendships, engage in pair-bonding, practice altruism, participate in social learning, mourn for the dead, develop a sense of self identity (dolphins, apes, and elephants can pass the mirror test), and develop culture. Since these animals share an evolutionary history with humans, it’s more than likely that these animal behaviors correlate with similar internal states and emotions found in humans, all coded by genetics. And, as Christakis explains, recognizing our similarities with animals makes it harder to deny our common humanity. If we share traits with other species, we must share certain universals among ourselves. As Christakis points out:“The thing about genes is this: we all have them. And at least 99 percent of the DNA in all humans is exactly the same. A scientific understanding of human beings actually fosters the cause of justice by identifying the deep sources of our common humanity. The underpinnings of society that we have come to understand—the social suite that is our blueprint—have to do with our genetic similarities, not our differences.”Our genes cannot account for differences; cultural variation accounts for that. What our genes can account for are all the similarities that are present underneath all of the cultural variation. Those similarities represent the social suite and the foundation for our societies. The social suite includes eight elements:1. The capacity to have and recognize individual identity 2. Love for partners and offspring3. Friendship4. Social networks5. Cooperation6. In-group bias7. Mild hierarchy (relative egalitarianism)8. Social learning and teaching These elements are found across cultures (including to some degree in apes, elephants, and whales), and within unintentional communities (shipwrecked communities), intentional communities (communes), and artificial communities (online communities). Further, successful communities embrace the elements of the social suite whereas failed communities try to repress certain elements (think communist suppression of individuality or totalitarian suppression of the importance of love and family). It’s important to note that Christakis is not a hard determinist, in the sense that genes determine all behavior or that everything is predetermined and cannot be otherwise. Our genes greatly influence our thoughts and emotions, and therefore influence our beliefs and behaviors. But they are not rigidly determined as in the beaver’s encoded behavior to build specific types of dams. Our genes code for minds that are adaptable, that create societies and solve problems in response to environmental variation, but that the specific products of that activity are variable. But again, at the foundation of that variation is the social suite that is found in all cultures. Despite cultural variation, you won’t find a culture of isolated humans fending for themselves, a culture devoid of love and friendship, a culture devoid of social learning and cooperation, or a culture composed of humans without individual identity. These are the universals upon which all else is built, and upon which we can continue to build. And this is good news, because the social suite mostly enhances cooperation—the only real advantage humans have over other animals. We form bonds, friendships, and networks for the purpose of cooperation and social learning that gives us an advantage over our environment—whatever that environment happens to be. Cultural variation is an adaptation to environmental variation that humans have been exposed to throughout our evolutionary history. A key point to remember is that these evolved traits of cooperation predate written history—and any religious texts—by hundreds of thousands of years. That means, if we didn’t have the innate capacity for cooperation and morality, we would have never survived for the hundreds of thousands of years before the invention of religion and moral philosophy. Our morality is a product of natural selection and is expressed in our best religious and philosophical texts, it is not caused by them. We weren't all killing and stealing from each other indiscriminately for 197,000 years before the Bible was written. The world’s religions and philosophies were written and embraced, and have ultimately survived in one form or another precisely because they harmonize with the social suite.So if the deepest aspects of our humanity are mostly positive, why is history replete with violence and oppression? The answer is that humans also have parallel aggressive and violent tendencies, which were also necessary for survival (a species too cooperative sets itself up for exploitation). Additionally, cultural variation can be significant and at times at odds with our well-being, and in-group bias can accentuate small differences and obstruct the recognition of our common humanity. But our best chance of transcending these differences and building a better society is not by surrendering to any single belief system, but by recognizing and promoting the cultural universals—the social suite—that optimize human cooperation, expanding the circle of who we consider to be part of the human in-group."
3,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1380226-kelly,3,"This is a competent, user-friendly breakdown of how evolutionary biology works with evolutionary psychology to modify society (and culture). Christakis constructs his argument by stringing together anecdotes from psychology experiments, interspersing ethnographic data, and tossing in a dash of personal observation. The book bangs around through time, hopscotches across scientific disciplines, dabbles in philosophy, refutes anticipated objections, runs through cultural comparisons, and generally goes wherever it pleases to give credence to its author’s thesis: that human progress is real and people are hardwired to be decent to one another.I remember my Psychology 101 professor in college saying that you could safely bet your life—your actual life—that if you asked a stranger to pass the salt at a diner, they would. Christakis has gone through a great deal of ink to say the same basic thing.I’ve recently read a few books that make the same point as well, but they do it by adhering to a given discipline—or at least hewing a little more to hard science to make their points. Principally, I’m thinking of The Age of Empathy: Nature's Lessons for a Kinder Society by Frans de Waal, but I’d also throw in Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst by Robert Sapolsky, The Evolution of Beauty by Richard Plum, and The Price of Altruism by Oren Harman, all of which are highly accessible to the general reader and make complex scientific arguments seem comprehensible and persuasive. By comparison, Blueprint is akin to a CliffNotes version of what these books offer.It’s a good book, and it’s well written, but it’s not bringing anything new to the table."
4,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"There is a long tradition of writers attempting to say how human society could or should be structured, going back at least as long as Plato's ""Republic"". No doubt, in most or all of them, the author believes themself to be learning from the past, from what has worked and not worked. Rarely, however, do they have access to enough data to be able to say how human societies prosper, or fail to. Even if they had real knowledge of their own society's history (as opposed to royal propaganda and mythology) they rarely had access to the history of very many others. It is only in the 20th, and especially the 21st century, that we have access to enough different case studies to be able to say something about what works, or fails to, when you put a bunch of humans together and try to get them to cooperate.Nicholas Christakis, is one of the first generation of researchers to have this much data available to him. In some cases, he had a hand in gathering it. Early on in this book, he devotes a chapter to a database which he and his graduate students compiled, of shipwrecks in which the survivors persisted for long periods of time without rescue (i.e. long enough that they had to make some manner of society). They are, in a sense, natural experiments, in which you throw a bunch of people together and see if they can cooperate well enough to survive. It's not a perfect experiment, of course, but it's not the only place Christakis goes looking for data. Utopian religious communities in the early U.S. (there were quite a few of them, btw), reports from researchers going to the remotest parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas to find other societies than ours, and even more recent temporary societies formed in laboratories, where subjects are given reasons to cooperate (and temptations not to). Christakis is casting his net wide, in what is recognizable to me as the early phase of any true science: stamp collecting.Because prior to the ""stamp collecting"" phase, you don't have a science, you have a bunch of opinions. Before you can really say anything about any topic (physics, astronomy, biology, etc.) first you need to collect a lot of data. There was a time when biologists' primary task was to find and describe previously unknown species (they still do this, but now they can do a lot of other things as well). There was a time when every astronomer with a telescope could point it in almost any direction and see something new (and name it, sometimes after a patron). There was a time (in its last phases now) when every linguist needed to decamp to a remote corner of the world to note down everything known about a language, from the last living speaker of it. Theories can rise to a level better than opinion, only when enough data has been collected, often by an entire profession for a generation or more.It is probably not to be expected, then, that Christakis should be able to state in plain terms what the ""Blueprint"", or as he normally calls it in this book, the ""social suite"", is for a functioning society. There are a few things that can be said, for example: humans want both to be able to have sex with whoever they want to, and to prevent their chosen mate from forming sexual attachments with others, and society needs to have a mechanism for dealing with the contradiction between these two. There are a number of different ways this can be done, but no society just lets everyone do whatever, because the result is a bloodbath. On the other hand, no matter what the rules are, even in the rare case of a society where long-term monogamous relations were taboo, some people break the rules (running off together to live in scandalous long-term monogamy).But, there are not a lot of details more than a few broad outlines like this. It is not as well developed as, for example, Elinor Ostrom's rules on how long-term cooperative enterprises (""commons"" such as fields for grazing, fisheries, or irrigation infrastructures) need to be structured, if they are to survive. But then, Christakis has not been trying to assemble the rules of successful societies, for as long as Ostrom did, and Ostrom's remit was narrower than his. What he does appear to have in common with Ostrom, however, is the ability to prioritize gathering real-world data over cherry-picking history to support his predetermined thesis. Looked at in this light, perhaps it is a positive thing, that Christakis gives no grand conclusions (yet?). The attempt to infuse sociology with biological facts (e.g. genes matter, evolution still impacts humans, etc.) has been controversial (even today the term ""sociobiology"" is radioactive to some). But, it is apparent to me, that we will not figure out how to do this (where ""this"" means something like ""get along together in large numbers"") without studying what works and what doesn't in a systematic way. It is good to know that people like Christakis are laying the groundwork."
5,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,5,"This book is among the better evolutionary theory books of late. It includes the author's own research, which is fascinating. I don't think the book is quite what it says it is--it's not a theory of why we are good--but it is a theory of society, friendship and marriage from an evolutionary perspective. "
6,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30604204-james-marriott,5,"Wow. He's already answered something that has always puzzled me: why do intelligent people believe obvious untruths? Because the very fact it is nonsense is a signal to the group of your loyalty. Anyone can believe something that is true, but to collude in believing a lie is costly and commits you to defending that lie against attack from outsiders binding you to the group."
7,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,5,"Christakis is no stranger to mobs and had suffered as an American boy in Greece shown to the mob by his own mother. He was attacked by student activists for supporting his wife who said that students, and not Yale administrators, should determine what Halloween costumes were acceptable. Still, he believes in the good of humanity, which is similar across many cultures. 1. People likes their own groups, from childhood, even if randomly assigned at the start. However there are also universal social traits across all cultures: such as need for social interaction, innate sense of justice and equality, facial expressions, music, friends, helpfulness, kindness, and love. He calls it the social suite. All human societies are very similar and occupy a tiny part of all possible social structures. 2. When people are put together either in experiment (Castaway 2000) or involuntarily (shipwrecks), the new communities formed resemble those where they come from. Utopian sects with very different rules generally collapse. Shipwrecked societies prospered only with the development of the social suite. Without it, people started to kill each other and chaos ensued. Successful communes depend on good leadership, a sense of common purpose and belief. Unsuccessful ones try to break down natural social structures such as the family unit. External factors such as natural disasters and availability of alcohol also make them likely to fail. 3. Max Weber’s 2 social connections: Gemeinshaft (personal interaction) and Gesellschaft (impersonal ones). 4. With the mechanical Turk community, sociologists can now run actual controlled studies. People are asked to donate real money to their connections who receive double the amount, and those in turn can then donate to them next round. In fixed communities, cheaters cause cooperation to stop. In fluid communities, people make friends with cooperaters. However, too much fluidity destroys cooperation again (no need to invest in these relationships). Cooperation’s benefit to cost ratio must be larger for larger groups. Inequality does not hinder cooperation; rather, displays of wealth does. 5. Monogamy is good for society as almost men can marry. Love is good as it guaranteed that the children belongs to the husband so he can care for the whole family. Egalitarian societies favour monogamy; unequal ones favour polygyny. In society practising polygyny, the wives don’t get along, and fear of murder of a child by another wife causes lots of anxiety.6. Animal evolution: most mammals are polygamous. Paternal care evolved after pair bonding (looking at which animal evolved from which). Pair-bonding animals evolved from solitary ones, when resources were unable to support many. So pair bonding became the optimal strategy. However, primates live in groups and humans evolved from them. Maybe weaker males offer females personal attention and treatment (courtship) from the alpha male, or they can mate while the alphas are challenged (sneaky fu**ker strategy). In unequal polygynous societies, males may have used violent behaviour (crazy bast*rd strategy, but more egalitarian ones will decrease this behaviour. 7. Friends are important and apes have friends. Leaders keep peace and their removal results in violence and less friendship in the tribe. Friends of friends are likely friends; friends of enemies and enemies of friends are likely enemies. However, enemies of enemies are actually more likely to be enemies too! Fortunately we have many more friends (2.6) than enemies (0.7). 8. Next comes the depressing part. People like their own groups and dislike others, even if groups are arbitrarily formed. Experiments showed that people who are put in charge of assigning rewards like to maximise the difference between the in-group and out-group, not to maximise the absolute gain of the in-group. This leads to better treatment by other members of the in-group. However, rival groups can become friends when there is a common enemy or problem. Altruism and xenophobia appeared to have evolved together. 9. Individual identity is thus clearly essential for us to identify kin, friends and others. Grief happens because we desperate us from our loved ones. 10. Punishment is the flip-side of altruism, even to the point of sacrificing one’s own welfare to make sure free riders get punished. Punishment helps cooperation. 11. Learning helps us survive. Even though birds have the genes for singing, they still need to learn from other birds. 12. Our genes can affect how other people react to us. Thus genes can affect culture, and thus the social suite. Deer mice’s genes encode their burrows. Parasites can control the host to further their own lifecycle; the behaviour of one host can in turn change the behaviour of other animals in the same tribe. Likewise, extroversion, friendliness, and all the other social suite phenotypes could have evolved because they conferred evolutionary advantage. 13. Culture is the accumulated knowledge, folklore and ways of doing things and interacting that gets passed down through generations. Our genes can thus co-evolve with it. 14. Christakis thinks that what is good is what is social, and since we had evolved to be social, we also evolve to be ‘good’. He thinks Maslow is misguided in his hierarchy of needs; the shipwrecked sailors who survived prioritised friendship, cooperation and learning first before their own survival. 15. He thinks the future will be affected by AI and genetic modification. AI is going to change our social suite, just like how driverless cars will change how we drive. What if humans are genetically modified to be less social?16. We see evil across the world. However, Christakis pointed out that we generally form loving and cooperative societies. And society bends towards goodness. "
8,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21764485-vadim-polikov,4,"I was hoping for more from this book. The thesis of the author is that we contain a ""social suite"" of four features: capacity for love, friendship, cooperation, and learning. He doesn't say it, but these for him are human nature. As evidence there is an interesting discussion of unintentional communities shipwrecks), intentional communities (communes, Antarctic scientists), and artificial communities (in lab settings). He maps the social networks with people as nodes as friendships as connections. One interesting insight is that slight hierarchy is useful if you want the community to survive, and leadership quality matters a lot. The network maps with the nodes are interesting, but ultimately all they do is provide evidence that there IS such a thing as human nature. Not earth shattering.For love, there is an interesting discussion if pair bonding in humans and how there are varieties in different cultures. Pair bonding is rare among animals and seems to have evolved when there is a large territory to forage and females spread out and then it makes sense for the Male to stick with one and then raise young together. Interesting discussion of pair bonding evolving after group living, and then monogamy evolved relatively recently. It actually went polygyny for hominids, then monogamy for foragers, then polygyny for unequal agricultural and nation state societies, then monogamy in the west, and then more recently everywhere else. Also really cool evidence presented that love mediated by oxytocin may have evolved originally from caring for young, and pleasure of breasts and vagina during sex comes originally from stimulation meant for baby.On friendship, it mostly talks about how dolphins, elephants, and apes also have friends, and this is convergent evolution because our common ancestors did not have friends. In human societies, surprising variation about what it means to be a friend.Some interesting facts about how our faces are truly unique to allow us to recognize each other and have friends. There is a little culture in animals, but only humans have cumulative culture.The last 2 chapters are finally him trying to make an argument with all these facts, but he has to tread so carefully in the role of genes on behavior that the argument is watered down to ""genes can play a role and accepting that doesn't automatically result in eugenics"". There were a lot of facts, some of them quite interesting, but it didn't lead anywhere. The only argument I found was that we do indeed HAVE a suite of social behaviors that are human nature and we cam see evidence of that because core features of societies across the world share them and some animals have them too."
9,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2690646-websterdavid3,5,"This book changed my view of the role of genes in our social life. Now I agree with Nicholas when he answers the question, ""is it nature or nurture?"" with an emphatic ""yes!""  Reading this at the same time as Mihalyi Csikszentmihalyi's ""The Evolving Self"" has tangled me in the web of knowing how much humans are ""good"" and able to survive this complex world and how much we are tying our own shoelaces together as we run forward. I lean more towards Csiks' view that our human needs, and xenophobia are likely to bollox up our species, perhaps in the near future. And share the optimism of the will that both authors have-- we want to do well and are prosocial, etc. And maybe even can see people from Brunei and Macedonia as ""our people"" and worthy of collaboration, instead of war. Christakas has great style and is reasonably readable; like Jerome Diamond he is 100-200 pages short of a tough editor. The book would be better shorter, even though I love reading at length about silver fox breeding and human social structure in the Antarctic.Highly recommended. And maybe it has prescriptions for how we can own our genetic heritage and not tumble down the wormhole of our genetic heritage; more likely not."

Classical models that assume all people are purely self-interested predict that lands will be overgrazed, seas overfished, and air polluted because individual incentives are contrary to what is best for the group."" (page 310)Isn't that exactly how we find our world today? Christakis lays out the problem clearly, but his answer that humans will innately turn away from that behavior doesn't seem to be supported by his evidence.I really wanted to be convinced by this book, but I just wasn't. Certainly individuals can be inclined to react with generosity and kindness and even huge groups of people can do so. Christakis proves that you can find examples of some society that will act out pretty much any scenario that can be imagined, good or bad. I appreciate that he didn't just use scenarios that proved his case, but with so many different evolutionary tracks I found it hard to believe that it will all work out okay in the end. And if we can't figure out an answer to the ""common-resource"" problem(explained above), we may not have an unlimited amount of time."

When thinking about questions like this, I am always reminded of Herodutus' powerful example of 'social constructs':> One might recall, for example, an anecdote of Darius. When he was king of Persia, he summoned the Greeks who happened to be present at his court, and asked them what they would take to eat the dead bodies of their fathers. They replied that they would not do it for any money in the world. Later, in the presence of the Greeks, and through an interpreter, so that they could understand what was said, he asked some Indians of the tribe called Callatiae, who do in fact eat their parents' dead bodies, what they would take to burn them. They uttered a cry of horror and forbade him to mention such a dreadful thing. One can see by this what custom can do.First few chapters survey of shipwrecks and the temporary societies that arise as a result. Fun way to start it.

14,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18185192-athan-tolis,4,"Author Nicholas Christakis spells out the main claim of this book on page 397: “The social suite is founded on human evolutionary biology and is therefore a universal feature of our societies.” In other words, the way we behave versus one another, the structure of our society, is built-in and it’s gotten to where it is now through natural selection.I read the whole thing, carefully, and my feeling is that “the jury’s out,” but I truly enjoyed this (epically discursive) exploration regardless.The structure of the book is that the author does not get down to the business of laying out his argument straight away. You’re first taken on a number of “tours” where you get to observe behavioral traits of groups. The sundry tours include, among other things:1.	an enumeration of castaways from the nineteenth century: what binds these people is that they did not plan to form a “society” 2.	a tour of utopian (American) experiments, who explicitly aimed to do so; 3.	an attempt at describing a taxonomy of communities; 4.	a full exploration of all the ways societies make their family arrangements (from Hazda foragers of Tanzania to the Na people in the Himalayas via the the Nuer of Sudan and the Tapirape people of Brazil)5.	a study of monogamy and polygamy in animals (including its relation to “key” genes that might potentially catalyze these behaviors)6.	an exploration of friendship in animals, including the examination of mathematical graphs of the links between animal “friends” which –amazingly, one must admit-- looks pretty much the same as they do for primitive humansWith one or two exceptions, what I took away from this tour (that takes you all the way to page 280 out of 420) is how immensely diverse all these arrangements are, which I think is pretty much the opposite of what I thought was the central tenet of the book. I mean, if the author is to believed when he says (p. 128) that “a global, cross-cultural survey found that kissing was present in only 46 percent of one hundred and sixty-eight cultures studied” I think we have conclusive proof that there ain’t no “Blueprint.” To say nothing of the castaways, some of whom looked after one another all the way to safety, when others went on to capture and subjugate women and form a child-exploitation colony that lasted generations.So Nicholas Christakis has his work cut out to convince you there is a “Blueprint,” let alone to do so in only half as many pages as he takes you on his wacky tour. He does do a tremendous job of explaining where genes come in and he builds a nice little mini-body of circumstantial evidence, but I don’t think he quite gets to a QED, or even an “aha” moment. Not for me, at any rate.Still, there are rewards to paying attention. It was interesting to read the argument regarding why the width and the length of a human nose --in contrast to the width and the length of one’s hand-- are uncorrelated: society rewards good people with progeny, but you need to identify those good people first and variety in facial characteristics is an aid in that quest. It was fascinating to follow the argument regarding teaching and how that can feed back into genes through the shaping of one’s environment, even if this was not the first time I heard the argument regarding fire, cooking, brain size etc. And it was intriguing to follow the argument that the pathogens make me sneeze so they can spread, much as I found it to otherwise be a non-sequitur.But did I REALLY change my mind about the fundamental question here? Do I now think my genes have predestined me to check on Linked In to see if I have any more links? Not really, especially since I know it’s my investor Andreas who demanded I get to 500+"
15,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47665820-robert-kortus,3,"Fascinating book that dives into the background of human societies and what drives them. This book differs from books like ""Sapiens"" and ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" in that it specifically looks at the way in which evolution and human genes shape how societies are created. A good summary of the book can be found at the end of chapter 3: ""When you put a group of people together, if they are able to form a society at all, they make one that is, at its core, quite predictable. They cannot create any old society they want. Humans are free to make only one kind of society, and t comes from a specific plan. Evolution has a blueprint.""My only critique of this book is that it was too long. Christakis could have shaved a good 50-75 pages off and still maintained the overall theme and important details. This made for a long and sometimes boring read."
16,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40281851-enrique,4,"Nicholas Christikas does an excellent work of presenting the state-of-the-art knowledge in social sciences regarding evolutionary foundations for social organization. His theory boils down to claiming that our genome encodes the so-called ""social suite"", the characteristics of stable human societies towards wich we are biologically inclined. These include allowance for individual identity, love for partners and children, friendship, social networks and cooperation, preference for your own group, hierarchy (by power, reputation, respect, etc.), and social learning and teaching. It is unclear how these came to be, and the author's hypothesis is that they were helpful to survive for early Homo species in the past hundreds of thousands of years, and they were gradually encoded in our genomes, at least as major trait shared by most of us. One possibility was female selection - if females preferred males that provided stability and care to children, while at the same time preferring those with higher reputation (larger number of friends), people with genetic inclination towards these traits were selected through the generations. This does not mean that 100% of human have all these traits, nor that they cannot be overruled by societal constructs and upbringing.There are plenty of examples of societies where one or several of these characteristics do not hold, for example, there is a society in which children are completely forbidden to play. While it is possible to have a society where children cannot play, it comes at the cost of very strong cultural pressure to overcome the natural tendency of children to explore the world and their place within it through play. Similarly, there have been societal experiments where children are not raised by parents but collectively, and most of these could survive for long. The first part of the book is very interesting with many stories about shipwrecks and examples of how castaways organized. When the person in power (normally the ship captain) was able to create an organization geared towards cooperation, group identity and at the same time respect of everyone's individual identity, success and eventually rescue was much more likely than the examples that started with surviving in caste systems (e.g. sailors and travellers, or white and natives) or, in the extreme cases, through cannibalism. Another chapter is devoted to societal experiments (shakers, Los Horcones, etc.), with claims that the further these experiments deviate from the social suite, the less likely to survive over long periods of time.It would have been nice to see more discussion about implications of these theories to today's mainstream societal changes. While the book is mostly optimistic about human's inclinations to create good societies, the idea of possible alterations of the social suite by genetically engineering humans brings uneasiness to me. In any case, I found it a very interesting book with enough food for thought. "
17,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20920102-les,5,"Nicholas Christakis' new book is a delightful look at why cooperation is hardwired in human society. He has the rare ability among academics to reach the common educated reader. Its clear prose and fascinating examples (e.g., what accounts for the vastly different results of 19th century shipwrecks) remind me of Jared Diamond's books. Christakis explains the riveting science that backs up his surprising conclusion that the evolutionary process favors cooperation rather than conflict in human society. When so much of what we see in the media focuses on war, greed, and misery, this compelling and humane work is a much needed corrective that explains why altruism and sacrifice make evolutionary sense. What a fascinating read! "
18,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13894377-aur-lien,4,"Excellent review of where we stand on the relationship between evolution and human society.The author is a sociologist with a focus on social networks and he shows that our number of friends and relationships depend on our genes (for humans as well as for elephants!). Consequently, it is possible that natural selection selected for pro-social genes/behaviours which made us friendlier.One of the best things about Blueprint is the feeling you get that we are at the dawn of very interesting times where we are going to learn so much more about the genes, culture and their coevolution.It's engrossing throughout, for readers looking for similar themes, I would recommend The Secret of our Succes from Henrich and The Goodness Paradox from Wrangham (both authors are cited by Christakis)."
19,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17187084-sean-goh,4,"Lengthy and spanning a range of topics, from evolutionary biology to sociology. TL;DR: friendship (non-reproductive long-term bonds amongst non-kin) is almost unique to humans, and Maslow's hierarchy might be inverted (the social needs help to satisfy the basic needs).___The desire for social connection and interpersonal understanding is so deep that it is with us to the end.Even though people may have varied life experiences, live in different places and look superficially different, there are significant parts of others' experiences that we can all understand. To deny this would be to abandon hope for empathy. Some scientists believe that awe is an evolved emotion intended to cause a cognitive shift that reduces egocentricity and makes people feel more connected to others. We form long-term, non-reproductive unions with other humans. This is exceedingly rare in the animal kingdom, but it is universal in us.Humans have always made their social environments, while shaping the physical environment is a recent innovation. The one constant in human environments is the presence of other humans.The ability to make and use a bellows appears frequently in successful stories of castaway survivors.All over the world, irrigation systems seem to be associated with the emergence of social stratification and a divergence between elites and the populace.Intentional utopian communities have always struggled with the problem of individuality. Celibacy reflects a rejection of the real world, because it intrinsically means that the way of life cannot reproduce itself. Paradoxically, the Shakers required connection to the outside world, because that was the movement's only source of new adherents. Communist societies have also been associated with collective child-rearing, the family is seen as a threat to state ideology because it fosters a sense of belonging to a family unit, and totalitarian ideology requires party or state allegiance to be paramount. Almost every innovation in child welfare in the US, including orphanages and subsidised child care, has been driven primarily by adult concerns. Of secondary importance were philosophical and pragmatic convictions about what was best for children. Structure: not only the hierarchy in a group but also the pattern of social relations in the group (are friendships reciprocated? extent of mutual friends) a shared moral understanding = a unified set of beliefs and a common sense of purpose, was crucial for a sense of belonging.Groups can have both instrumental leaders (task oriented), and expressive leaders (relationship oriented). Effective leaders have to help minimise group conflict, deal with troublesome individuals before they compromise group harmony, keep work on schedule, make rational decisions in emergencies, deal fairly with conflict, and facilitate communication. Sometimes it is not possible for the same person to do both, hence generals and diplomats (war and peace leaders). Groups in isolated environments often note the problem of ""constant gossip"" that adversely affects interpersonal relations.Collective activities such as games and songs are especially important when groups lack long-standing rituals or shared religious ideologies.Even the possibility of being able to change social connections can shape communities for the better.Kissing is most common in Africa and South and Central America. No ethnographers familiar with forager or horticultural groups in sub-Saharan Africa, Amazonia or New guinea have ever reported witnessing romantic-sexual kissing.It seems that across evolutionary time, that humans evolved to love their offspring first, then their mates, then to feel affection for their biological kin, then their affinal kin (in-laws), and then their friends and groups.Roughly 85% of human societies have permitted polygyny at some point.However polygyny deprives many men of partners, and causes many women to have to share their husband and overall household.By offering a man a high certainty of paternity (through pair bonding), a woman is better able to secure her husband's investment in her children. Mutual attachment solves an evolutionary conundrum.The drive to love your partner is universal.Like weddings all over the world, Turkana weddings include dancing, feasting, gossiping, and flirting among unmarried guests.The 'sneaky fucker' strategy: bystander males taking advantage of alpha males while they are fighting to mate with other inaccessible females. Our many marriage systems reflect the human capacity for social learning, a key part of the social suite. ""Crazy bastard"" strategy: where males at risk of being shut out of reproduction engage in riskier and more violent behaviour to secure a mate, by discounting their futures more steeply.First law of behaviour genetics: all human behavioural traits are heritable.Only the cognitive ability to remember the past is needed to make and maintain friendship ties, anticipation of the future isn't necessary.We are supposed to respond to our friends because they have a need, not because of what they have done for us or what we can expect from them. Real friendships are based on how each party feels about the other, not what each party can do for the other.Friendship is demonstrated by time-intensive, exclusive behaviours, honest expressions of emotion, and accepting vulnerability.In Greece male friends tirelessly and publicly accuse one another of being masturbators.The introduction of formal institutions (banking etc) may weaken traditional friendship ties.Being less reliant on friends in their community, Americans can afford to be more geographically mobile.The ability of friendships to be useful during reversal, when an even exchange is not possible, is precisely what makes friendship so valuable as an adaptation in our species.Friends tended to be significantly more genetically similar than strangers drawn from within the same population. As a benchmark the effect's size corresponds to the coefficient of relatedness expected for 4th cousins.The sense of togetherness and mutual aid leads to the higher evaluation of the in-group. When groups are united against a common enemy, negative attitudes abate.Both altruism and ethnocentrism need each other. In-group altruism in the service of out-group conflict.All it takes for people to like their own group and dislike others - is for people to be able to simply switch groups.Societies that stress uniqueness and individuality and that provide fertile terrain for friendship based on the personal and specific can actually be those where our common humanity is more easily recognised.The possibility of being alone reinforces the ability of a group to be together.One distinctive reason for animals to form social groups is the enhanced learning that can take place.Genes can have effects outside of the body (e.g. beavers' dam building, bower birds building nests.Status can be measured by prestige (benefits one can offer others) as well as dominance (traditional alpha male strength - i.e. costs one can inflict on others)In most species the trade off between dominance and prestige is usually presented as the shift from bodily to cognitive resources.When group size was increased, cultural knowledge was more often preserved, improvements more often made, and complexity in tool packages more often maintained. When it comes to cultural innovation and preservation, size matters.Religions are a cultural feature that secondarily allow unrelated individuals to expand the circle of cooperation, exchange goods, and maintain a division of labour.As a species, humans have evolved higher order needs (belonging, transcendence) precisely in order to more efficiently satisfy the basic needs of life. (Inversion of Maslow's hierarchy of needs)"
20,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/490156-lynne,4,"I set about reading this scholarly tome in order to find a counterpoint to my increasingly gloomy appraisal of human nature. Christakis makes a convincing case that human beings have developed a ""social suite"" of behaviors that are key to the success of groups: capacity to have and recognize individual identity, love for partners and offspring, friendship, social networks, cooperation, preference for one's own group, mild hierarchy, social learning and teaching. Through animal studies as well as anthropological study, and behavior research at the Yale Institute for Network Science, Christakis has convinced me that these ""good"" qualities are ""shaped by natural selection and partially encoded in our genes."" So I will choose to believe his conclusion: ""The arc of our evolutionary history is long. But it tends toward goodness."""

Christakis is no exception.What builds a good society? Why does it exist? How to promote it? They are the main questions of this book.The first thing to understand is that man is a social animal, and this makes society within us.The author begins by talking about some ""unintentional"" societies that arise from shipwrecks or just by ""trying"" to build societies that want to be different from the current one.Among the interesting topics mentioned are:Love: which is what moves us to be interested in another person and want to live with her. Being like we are animals, there are some that only come together to mate and separate, the human being seeks to consolidate with another person.The attraction to other beings and friendship: since time immemorial men have seen that they live better together and defend themselves more easily from other predators. Thus, another of the bases for a good society is the friends and social networks that we form.Genes and culture, one affects the other and vice versa, thus changing the destiny of human beings and society.Perhaps the topic that interested me most are the perspectives on how society will be affected by two things: artificial intelligence and the new inventions that come from it; and genetic manipulation, which can create changes no longer by natural selection but by ""rational"" selection.Great book"
25,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2855874-greg,4,"Nicholas Christakis provides a set of explanations from several angles on why we are social creatures. He approaches it with case studies, historical examples, and conclusions from evolutionary biology.I found his analysis of shipwrecked and isolated groups particularly interesting. He compares various accidents throughout history of people who were isolated from society, how they self-organized, and what made them succeed or fail. One day this sort of knowledge on organization and social structures might come in handy when you find yourself stranded on your own island staving off the desire to eat your shipmates. Or you might just apply some of the principles to everyday life in the office.The evolutionary biology section contains a large amount of overlap with other books on evolution, so if you are well read on the subject, there are no surprises here. He discusses the various ways that cooperation in family and tribal units is ultimately advantageous in the survival of those genes.Relatively short and not stuffed with detail, this is a highly accessible overview of a number of evolutionary and social concepts you'll often encounter."

I'm not all that sure if he proved his theory that society had a genetic component, as his evidence seemed to be very random and anecdotal, although the examples he used came from a wide variety of paleontology, zoology and anthropology. In other words, I believe he relied more on circumstantial evidence, albeit a great deal of it, more than actual genetics, which he does refer to but mostly with regards to physical attributes such as eye color, ability to fast and propensity for certain activities such as long distance running. It got somewhat repetitive for the third quarter, although still interesting. I enjoyed a lot of his philosophical arguments as well, and learned about several aspects of disciplines I was unfamiliar with. In all, pretty good if you want to read about a book that reflects an optimistic side of Homo sapiens."

The only real complaint I have - and how bitter I am! - is that it chooses to place its footnotes, along with quite a bit of valuable text, in the back of the book, so that one is constantly flipping back and forth - exhausting, and when I rule the world with an iron fist this sort of practice will be stamped out. One of the joys of the Collected Works of Carl Jung editions is that the footnotes, even if just source names, are at the bottom of the page.

The spirit of friendship and cooperation is not a uniquely human trait, it is found in some animals. The author discusses how humans have evolved to cooperate and develop friendships and culture as it has a survival benefit.Fascinating read on society and how its is impacted by genetics more than we think."

The author uses examples of how our behavior is similar to behaviors observed in other mammals, and of how certain aspects of human social behavior is consistent across cultures. The topic is interesting to me. As a writer, I’m always interested in human behavior. And I really enjoyed reading about animal social behavior. For example, elephants form friendships; that touched me deeply. I also liked how the author was very thorough in making his case. I hate when you read a book about human behavior that is just a series of assertions, without any cited evidence. This book was the opposite of that; it is long and, at times, a little too dense.

32,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3315851-roozbeh-daneshvar,3,"The title somehow explains well what this book is about. It is a fairly long book (it took me one year to finish it). The concepts were interesting for me and overall, I enjoyed it. I just had a feeling that the chapters were somehow disconnected (or the transition between the different chapters could have improved).I am bringing some quotes I found interesting in this book (and they might tell you if you'll like to read this book or not).People in crowds often act in thoughtless ways—shouting profanities, destroying property, throwing bricks, threatening others. This can come about partly because of a process known to psychologists as deindividuation: people begin to lose their self-awareness and sense of individual agency as they identify more strongly with the group, which often leads to antisocial behaviors they would never consider if they were acting alone. They can form a mob, cease to think for themselves, lose their moral compass, and adopt a classic us-versus-them stance that brooks no shared understanding.Crowds are especially feared by those in power when they emerge organically, without explicit organization, as they frequently do.Children’s behavior often involves innately making a kind of miniature and temporary society. From an early age, humans cannot help themselves.They believed it required as much bravery to approach the end of an age as to start it.Historian Steven Mintz noted in Huck’s Raft, his sweeping work on American childhood, that almost every innovation in child welfare in the United States, including orphanages and subsidized child care, has been driven primarily by adult concerns. Of secondary importance were philosophical and pragmatic convictions about what was best for children.One of the more intriguing consequences of collective child-rearing, however, was the virtual absence of marriage between peers. The longer individuals resided together on a kibbutz as children, the greater their aversion to sexual contact with one another. These findings support the so-called Westermarck effect, a psychological hypothesis proposed in 1891 by the Finnish anthropologist Edvard Westermarck. He suggested that childhood co-residence served as a kinship cue (people decide who their siblings are based on who they grew up with).Effective leaders have to help minimize group conflict, deal with troublesome individuals before they compromise group harmony, keep work on schedule, make rational decisions in emergencies, deal fairly with conflict, and facilitate communication.Balancing group identity and individuality is key for successful social systems.the tendency to cooperate is a property not only of individuals but also of groups. Cooperation depends on the rules governing the formation of friendship ties. Good people can do bad things (and vice versa) simply as a result of the structure of the network in which they are embedded, regardless of the convictions they hold or that the group espouses. It is not just a matter of being connected to “bad” people; the number and pattern of social connections is also crucial.Third, these examples—especially those far outside the region of the morphospace human societies actually occupy—can highlight how similar our societies are and how small a part of the range our species actually occupies. With ant colonies as an alternative, all human societies look extremely familiar.across many cultures throughout Amazonia, and in a few scattered elsewhere, children are believed to have multiple fathers.In one sample of two hundred and twenty-seven Aché children followed over ten years, 70 percent of those with one father survived to age ten, but 85 percent of those with two or more fathers did.We can see that many cultural practices might, from some points of view, enhance survival in difficult circumstances. Our ability to be cultural animals (with whatever beliefs, practices, or technology) and engage in teaching and social learning is an important part of the social suite.When scientists say that there is a gene or genes “for” a trait, it means that variations in a genotype correspond to variations in a phenotype, not necessarily that a specific gene is solely responsible for a specific phenotype.There is rarely a one-to-one relationship between genotype and phenotype. Instead, genes yield particular behaviors more than others on average—just like smoking cigarettes substantially increases your chance of getting lung cancer on average but does not make it a certainty.The environment in which genes find themselves is not always the same either. Although genetic information is basically unchanging throughout an individual’s lifetime, human physical and sociocultural environments are quite variable. As a consequence, genes can have very different effects on individuals depending on the context.the more social connections someone has, the higher one’s tolerance for pain—and even a connection to animals will do.The presence of pets encourages human interactions and possibly even increases empathy.It seems to me that people’s squeamishness about animal friendship reflects a certain degree of arrogance.It is true that we appear to be the only species that says “good-bye” and that other species seem to lack any special leave-taking rituals.69 But we are not the only species that says “hello” and that has specific greeting behaviors. Indeed, anticipation of the future is not absolutely necessary for the formation and maintenance of friendship ties. Only the cognitive ability to remember the past is needed. Even if the ability of other animals to anticipate the future is unclear, there is no doubt that many species have memory and even a sense of time.Many birds recognize their nest sites rather than their offspring, as sneaky ornithologists moving eggs and chicks around have discovered.Among humans, mutual exposure during childhood similarly weakens the sexual attraction between individuals when they are adults (as we saw with the kibbutzim). Conversely, there is some evidence that biologically related people reared apart sometimes report an overwhelming (and usually terribly unwelcome) physical attraction when they meet as adults.Feeling close to someone involves some inclusion of the other in one’s self-identification.Spending time with a friend or writing personal notes are good examples, because they are not scalable and are hard to fake.Scalability is an important factor: maybe explains why social media happy birthdays do not feel genuineThe fact that you are irreplaceable to your friends even though you are unremarkable to strangers suggests that there is a deep connection between individuality—another key part of the social suite—and friendship.Referring to someone as “irreplaceable” is a common form of praise. And many psychological phenomena in our species reflect the threatening nature of social replaceability, including the fact that we seem to like to form groups that are small enough for individuality to be appreciated. Ironically, then, individuality is crucial to the formation of social groups and to how the whole emerges from the parts.when people are left to choose friends among a group of people to whom they are not actually related, they have a discernible, if slight, preference for people who resemble them genetically.Just as friends tended to reciprocate friendship, enemies tended to reciprocate animosity, but the rates of reciprocation were quite different: 34 percent and 5 percent, respectively. That is, if you named someone as a friend, it was likely that person had also named you as a friend, but if you named someone as an enemy, it was less likely that individual had also named you as an enemy. This difference highlights the fact that people have secret enemies more often than they have secret friends. People declare their friendships to each other but are less likely to state that they are enemies.We also found that the more friends a person had, the more enemies he or she was likely to have, with each ten extra friends being associated with one extra enemy.Group identity, like sustained friendships, provides a solution to the risks of unreciprocated cooperation.Prejudicial treatment of out-groups starts when people are very young and it does not seem to vary much with age, which suggests that the capacity for intergroup cognition is innate.Many of the vilest expressions of racism and prejudice are likely extreme forms of out-group hatred, not of in-group affection.the more identities available for individuals to assume and the more cross-cutting they are (such that people who are discordant on religion might be members of the same political party, for instance), the more tolerant a society can be of outsiders and, hence, of everyone.Anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss observed that binary opposition (male/female, good/evil, hot/cold, conservative/liberal, human/animal, body/soul, nature/nurture, and so forth) is one of the simplest and most widespread ways that humans come to terms with complexities in the natural world.The independent evolution of eyes has occurred at least fifty times across different species—as if seeing the light is inevitable.You might take it for granted that you can differentiate yourself from others and tell others apart, but the ability to have an individual identity and recognize the identity of other individuals (especially beyond one’s mate or offspring) is uncommon in the animal world.There is much evidence that grief is physiologically harmful and can even increase one’s subsequent risk of death,Some theorize that grief motivates people to connect with others in order to reduce the pain. In this account, grief is adaptive because it keeps humans, a social species, from being alonesome hypothesize that the anticipation of grief might compel people to work harder to keep loved ones alive, which would be advantageous.another theory views grief as a signal from those who are suffering, a sort of plea for help.It is difficult to maintain cooperation as group size increases.77 Each person becomes individually less important for cooperation.evolution tends to favor free-riders more in larger groups.This willingness to pay a personal cost to punish someone else who is hurting a third person is known as altruistic punishment.culture is a set of beliefs, behaviors, and artifacts that can be arbitrary or adaptive, that are shared by members of a group and are typical of it, and that are socially transmitted.Though most of the cultural traditions we see in animals are practical ways to enhance survival—new methods to gather food, for example—some new cultural traditions seem arbitrary. A group of chimps at Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage Trust, a sanctuary in Zambia where the chimpanzees live in forested enclosures, developed a useless practice of putting a long blade of grass into one ear, like an earring (see figure 9.6). This appeared to serve no practical purpose and was thus akin to a fad in humans.While as much as a third of humans during the Paleolithic period died from intentional violence, only about one out of a thousand people in even our most violent communities die from it today.Status can be defined as the relative ability to gain or control valuable or contested resources within a group.Social learning is especially adaptive when a species faces an environment that is changing so frequently that genetic evolution—in which individual mutations lead to small differences in form and function—cannot do its job quickly enough.Humans are unusual among mammals in having the capacity to be marathon runners. Though we cannot outrun even our household pets in a short sprint, we have all sorts of adaptations that equip us to run for a long time (these include slow-twitch muscle fibers, which are useful for endurance, and the ability to regulate body temperature during long periods of exertion).Worldwide, the ability to digest milk in adulthood is uncommon and is generally absent in East Asia and Africa. Overall, perhaps 65 percent of the world’s population (including a significant fraction of North Americans and Europeans) lose their lactase enzymes by adulthood.Positivism asserts that truth can be known only via scientific study involving the application of logic and mathematics to the natural world in a manner that is verifiable and reproducible.Reductionism assumes that the whole is merely the sum of its parts and nothing more.Essentialism is the position that things in the material world (including people and society) have a fundamental set of properties that are necessary for their identity.determinism is the position that the state of any system is completely fixed by its preceding state or states.at least 99 percent of the DNA in all humans is exactly the same.In 1900, 41 percent of the workforce was employed in agriculture; in 2000, only 1.9 percent was."

""Blueprint"" continues on, expanding on all these points, and citing the relevant research that lead him to this thesis. He believes that humans are inherently ""good"", and uses his ""social suite"" to argue this point. I'm not sure if I fully agree with him, but he does make many good arguments, though.

44,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35335902-dave,3,"This is definitely a great topic for a book. I do wish it was written by someone who doesn't buy into Steven Pinker's crap though. It seems pretty obvious to me that if there is anything good about human nature then our current lifestyle is not the best way to foster it. I just can't stand how Pinker ignores all the insidious forms of violence that have grown as direct violence has shrank, and I'm not even sure he should attribute so much of that drop to our culture considering how much our testosterone levels have plummeted from pollution screwing up our endocrine systems. You also have to wonder how much that decrease in direct violence is just benefiting the worst among us. How long do you think the Trumps and Kochs of the world would get away with their bullshit if they weren't so thoroughly protected? Our ability to team up against bullies is what got us away from the alpha-male hierarchies of our ape ancestors. Now, with law enforcement resembling armies and a legal system skewed in their favor, the bullies are getting away with it again. Instead of stopping these idiots and going on with our lives, they continue to increase their power while the most desperate among us turn their anger on defenseless school children and random pedestrians on the street because they can't reach those they really want to hurt. I don't think the stats these people focus on do a very good job of showing that. Not to mention the sixth mass extinction and the very likely possibility of us literally destroying the entire planet we live on. So those might be things people should consider factoring in to their calculations. Anyway, that's getting a little off topic from this book. I don't think Christakis is an exact duplicate of Pinker. A lot of his ideas are just thrown off by Pinker's influence. I was expecting this book to be focused mainly on comparing statistics from different cultures around the world to see what works and what doesn't. There is a little of that but most of it just focuses on genetics and how our brains have evolved. Instead of getting into politics and polemics about different types of governments and economic systems, he talks about the ""social suite"" that's ingrained in our DNA. This includes things like love for sexual partners, friendship, cooperation among non-kin, mild hierarchy, allowance of individuality, in-group bias and social learning (I think I'm missing a couple others in there too). Most people interested in this book probably come to it looking for ideas about how to make our one global civilization better. Most of these ideas have to do more with how our ancient ancestors lived, which doesn't really operate the same at this enormous scale. Yet he still sort of praises large cities and seems to be implying that we can use these findings to better design our urban environments. While a lot of the concepts are interesting (he actually summarizes a lot of ideas from other popular science writers in here, like Robert Sapolski, Richard Prum, Richard Wrangham, Kathleen McAuliffe, and Christopher Boehm) I do feel like they should be leading more toward the advocacy of diversifying the world into smaller scale societies, not working out some perfect universal system for everyone to conform to. Christakis doesn't explicitly say that he wants a uniform world. He does show appreciation for cultural diversity but he doesn't seem to realize that supporting modern technology and the scientific crusade to understand every stupid thing in the universe goes against that.I know that's not exactly a popular opinion right now but, unlike most people, I came to this book more from an interest in alternatives to our one global civilization. Basically, if we want to get away from depending on such a destructive industrial infrastructure, what types of living arrangements could work? We've already seen the failures of past ""back to the land"" experiments, like hippie communes and religious cults. Yet those setting up new intentional communities keep buying into a lot of the same flawed ideas that we've already seen fail. There's always these weird ideas about property ownership and promiscuous relationships and things. This is one area where I think this book is actually on the right track, pointing out that there's nothing unnatural about monogamy, personal possessions or having leaders. I actually put together my own book on this topic a few years ago and came to some pretty similar conclusions, contrary to what the rest of my rewilding ilk believe (here's a link to that chapter if anyone's interested http://aproposalforprimitivism.blogsp...). I just really wish people would stop romanticizing and let themselves be more open-minded to these ideas.  Therefore, I do still think this book is worth reading, even though I do have some serious disagreements with this guy."

46,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18814486-rodrigo-barbosa,5,"Blueprint is a deeply insightful dive into the evolutionary origins of society.At the heart of this remarkable work is the idea that our genes have evolved to confer us not only the ability, but also the inevitability, to construct a good society. Christakis refers to this deeply ingrained imprint as the social suite. At its core lies our capacity for love, cooperation, friendship, teaching and learning. These manifest in many different ways, from our ability to recognize the identity of strangers, to our tendency toward tribalism and to aggregate in mildly hierarchical structures.In the first part of the book, Christakis discusses the cruciality of the social suite to a society’s continuity. For example, the survival of societies born out of shipwrecks is linked to the level of cooperation among its members. A dramatic example is presented: two shipwrecks that occurred around the same time on an island south of New Zealand, in the late 19th century. Risking their own lives, the men in the first shipwreck saved another member from drowning, while in the second shipwreck members took the critical decision of leaving a dying companion behind. These initial events set the stage for the eventual prosperity of the first, and utter collapse of the second community. Christakis also discusses how artificial societies that attempt to suppress parts of the social suite - such as both polyamorous and chaste communes in America - almost inevitably collapse.In the second part, the focus is geared towards exploring the genetic origins of the social suite, mostly by studying how parts of it emerge in animal societies. Intelligent mammals, such as chimpanzees, whales, dolphins and elephants, all display some, and sometimes all elements of the social suite. Many interesting examples are discussed, such as the mourning rituals of elephants, and the way chimpanzees can easily recognize themselves in the mirror, an ability lying at the cognitive boundary for elephants. A beautiful by-product of this discussion is that it rigorously approximates our humanity to other animals, and more generally, clearly introduces the ethos of humanity as part of nature. Although trivial from a biological perspective, this idea is clearly lacking in our man-above-nature Judeo-Christian culture that inevitably led us to the ecological crisis of our age, as was explained half a century ago by Lynn White Jr. Thus, the recognition of the social suite is not merely an academic insight, but possibly a compass pointing toward a betterment of our culture.In the last few pages, Christakis addresses two important (and related) points. Firstly, he appeals for a shift of perspective on societal issues from a divisive, rather pessimistic, purely historical viewpoint to acknowledge the ancient, powerful evolutionary forces at play - the same forces that shaped the social suite and allowed cooperative societies to exist in the first place. Secondly, with the advent of artificial intelligence, and especially, gene-modifying technology, we will soon have in our hands the ability to dramatically alter the stream of evolution, and as a corollary, society itself. As we enter this new era, recognizing the core importance of evolutionary forces will not be enough; a new social contract will be needed declaring the social suite a foundation stone of humanity, its structure inalienable.Evolutionary forces have shaped in us the ability for love, cooperation, friendship, teaching and learning. They led us to self-domestication of our species, creating societies that unconditionally reject both tyranny and complete anarchy. Christakis and his colleagues have shown that societies throughout the world all have the same structural patterns, evidence of the evolutionary origin of the social suite. The core essence of human society is a blueprint for goodness. As Christakis puts it at the end: “the arc of our evolutionary history is long. But it bends toward goodness”."

This he endured with great dignity, open-mindedness and thoughtfulness. I learned that he had authored five books and had done enormous research on social networks and on the socioeconomic, biosocial, and evolutionary determinants of behavior, health, and longevity. At least two of these books would place me out of my depth, so I settled on the most recently published. Superb from start to finish!The book  Blueprint: The Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society () is deep, wide and profoundly hopeful. Christakis is a masterful storyteller. He takes the reader through every imaginable ""pop-up"" social construct throughout history: shipwrecks, hippie communes, small religious sects. Going back as far as recorded history allows, he examines intentional communities, unintentional communities and artificial communities. Through the lens of his ""social suite"" he describes the successful and unsuccessful attempts at designing purposeful communities and his insights here are astounding.From start to finish, he is an architect of hope as he shares his expansive research and summarizes the broader implications of the role of networks in human activity.One of my favorite quotes:""...we carry within us innate proclivities that reflect our natural social state, a state that is, as it turns out, primarily good, practically and even morally. Humans can no more make a society that is inconsistent with these positive urges than ants can suddenly make beehives.""Finally, he gave me words to describe this question/observation which has plagued me for many years. It is this: Insane behavior in individuals, I rarely see. Insane behavior in large groups, I see far too often. Why? He explains:""People in crowds often act in thoughtless ways—shouting profanities, destroying property, throwing bricks, threatening others. This can come about partly because of a process known to psychologists as deindividuation : people begin to lose their self-awareness and sense of individual agency as they identify more strongly with the group, which often leads to antisocial behaviors they would never consider if they were acting alone. They can form a mob, cease to think for themselves, lose their moral compass, and adopt a classic us-versus-them stance that brooks no shared understanding.""This is a powerful knowledge; knowledge that should be remembered and internalized. Forever.If you are looking for hope in humanity, this is your book. It is not the standard-variety self help book; history, math and science are all big players in this text. I am very excited about his current focus on the (entire) human microbiota and have even more respect for Christakis's mind and heart, as he uses his knowledge to spread good. https://nomisfoundation.ch/2019/01/11...This is a great book."

Hearing him speak of this since then he sounds like an apologist for the Woke SJW’s, who obviously made a mistake in targeting him. It reminded me of Solzhenitsyn’s descriptions of the people who arrived in the Gulag’s thinking that the Party was mistaken, that in time the truth would come out and the injustice righted. Christakis maybe a true believer in the Utopian project. This book was an attempt to show that society and social groups are bent towards good.The premise of the book is ‘what is the Anna Karenina principle for successful societies and groups?’. I myself am seeking the Anna Karenina principles for living life successfully as possible, this would include being a good member of a group. I found this helpful in supporting the development of my own heuristics. Christakis does this by firstly looking at the success and failures of unintentional group (ship wrecks) and why some groups thrived, whilst members of other groups died. He then moves on to Intentional communities (such as communes). He reported that even in attempts to create utopian societies Women end up doing most of the childcare and housework and Men the maintenance and work that provided crops. What is worth remarking is the number of (intentional communities) communes that organically regressed towards the mean of the societies they were reportedly escaping. An example was polyamory that move towards monogamy as they evolve.He provided a good explanation for the nature of moral judgments, are they an ""is"" or an ""ought""? Am I bias towards providing the best environment for my children because that ""is"" who I am, or because this is what I think I ""ought"" to do. I cannot answer this question about myself, I do not have a good answer. This is something I am going to reflect on further. Christakis drew on what I had previously learn from Complexity Theory in emergent properties of complex systems. Qualities such as care and kindness are such emergent properties that are selected for as society gets increasingly complex (people do not repeatedly play with people with anti-social traits). He expresses concerns about the emergence of AI and CRISPR technology, and unintended consequences of changing out genome (who doesn’t?).In his concluding chapter he quotes extensively Erich Fromm, which is not surprising as they share the same collectivist utopianism that underlies their philosophy. Horrors are dramatic and reportable, goodness is the boring and dull acts we do everyday to help one another. The work of Pinker that show that by any measure society is getting better no matter where you live in the world. My own anecdotal evidence is that stuff that would not have been reported on in my childhood, is now so, such as a group of children being assaulted and having their bicycles stolen now makes the local news. It is taking less to get us horrified, and we have a higher expectation of the good. Christakis concludes with ""The arc of our evolutionary history is long. But it bends towards goodness"" p 353."
49,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47362929-andrew-williams,4,"I've been very interested in question of which (if any) of our societal values are arbitrary and therefore should be constantly open to experimentation and debate versus which (if any) are rooted in our biology and therefore constrain the types of values we can live by, should we desire a meaningful life. For example, can humans find meaning by having emotionless and carefree sex with multiple partners, as those growing up in the ""sexual revolution"" seem to have discovered? Or are there deeper biological reasons underpinning the stricter norms of the past? In other words, with only so much free time and resources available to us, I think it's important to understand which of our existing societal norms we shouldn't mess with and which of those we should experiment with.I've always thought that the most logical and scientific way to approach such a problem is to study different cultures that exist independently of one another, at least insofar as cultures can do so. For example, if we study 100 different cultures and we see the same features popping up in each one, then there becomes an increasingly small probability that these values were arbitrary. If you roll a dice 100 times and keep getting the same number, you can safely conclude that you're rolling a weighted dice.In this book Nicholas uses that approach but with some really cool data sets: shipwreck survivors, commune dwellers seeking utopia, isolated scientific communities and online groups working on specific tasks. Using these data sets he runs multiple ""natural experiments"" and extracts out a ""social suite"" of eight traits that are common to all humans. In those societies that were successful, he attributes it to creating an optimal balance of the eight traits and in those failed groups, he attributes it to those elements of the suite that were lacking. Like when we deal with any complex system, any tinkering should be done with extreme humility. I found this part of the book to be the most interesting as it provided a data set that I had no idea existed so this was really novel information for me.Unfortunately the rest of the book pulled away from this data set and summarized a lot of the latest, second hand research in other areas and was a bit redundant for me having previously read Robert Sapolsky's ""Behave"" and Joe Henrich's ""Secret of our Success"". I more-or-less scanned through these last few chapters of the book perhaps to my detriment and that likely makes this an unfair review. It also would have been cool to have a chapter on how one would design the optimal society using this knowledge of the ""social suite"" if we were to colonize, say, Mars. Perhaps that's a topic for the sequel?"

But, this book i am reading right now - ""Blueprint: The Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society"" by Nicholas A. Christakis, points towards a paradoxical factoid which I had conveniently overlooked.Almost all of the attempts which have tried to recreate - this tribal utopian community - seem to have failed. These attempts have come-about unintentionally, either because of tragedies in forms of ship-wrecks, or accidents during expeditions or naturally as our species have colonized islands after islands. Many rebellious cults, philosophically driven initiatives and very recently TV reality shows, have also tried to create utopian communes of similar nature - much more intentionally.Few such experiments have either failed miserably and ended in extreme grotesque acts such as cannibalism or sexual violence. But, most end up converging to the very contemporary social structure they were trying to rebel against. Anthropological studies of various indigenous tribes are also inconclusive as they showcase varied social norms stretching from cannibalism and ritualized violence on one end to unhappiness and social strife, very similar to modern human societies.Why is this the case ? If our instincts are still tribal - why don't we find peace & happiness when we try to recreate idyllic societies ? Have we evolved beyond our original evolutionary ""Blueprint"" or do we miss some critical ingredient in our attempts in re-creating ""edinu"" the mythical biblical earthly paradise ? Or perhaps, as many suggest that there never was a ""good strife free society"" and ""happy individuals"" even in the ancient grassland societies and we have always been this fucked up ?This book explores all these strands of thoughts and to my surprise comes up with much optimistic forecast for our civilization's future.Do check out."
51,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59252999-roo-phillips,3,"3.5 stars. The first half of this book is fascinating, probably 4.5 stars. Christakis gives a super interesting review of all the shipwrecks on record that lasted long enough for testing the social structures implemented by the stranded (19 accounts). He also reviews the modern attempts at replicating similar social experiments by looking at groups found in places like the online world of warcraft (which boasts hundreds of thousands), the kibbutz, the Mechanical Turks (you either know it or you don't), and others. It is worth reading this book just to get the analysis of how groups formed, and what happens to the different groups depending on how they formed. Christakis introduces what he calls the ""Social Suite"" and defines it as what social constructs (blueprint) are likely necessary to form a successful society. There are eight:1. The capacity to have and recognize individual identity2. Love for partners and offspring3. Friendship4. Social networks5. Cooperation6. Preference for one’s own group (“in-group bias”)7. Mild hierarchy (relative egalitarianism)8. Social learning and teachingYou see some weaving of the social suite in with the historical shipwreck accounts and modern experiments, but this is where the success of the book starts to wane. Christakis does little to actually quantify this suite and draw objective correlations, let alone causations. Then, for the second half of the book, he makes an abrupt change of narrative and just dives into the field of social evolution and beats it to death. I think his point was to try and give some meat behind his social suite from an evolutionary standpoint, but he hardly returns to the notion of his eight essential characteristics as a blueprint for society. It's almost as if he just wants to tell people about how much he knows about love, cooperation, etc. from an evolutionary perspective. It is interesting, and I didn't find it to be inaccurate based on other books I have read, but the whole idea of what ""THE BLUEPRINT"" actually is gets completely lost by the end.Still, I recommend any interested in history, shipwrecks, social constructs, etc. to at least read the first half of the book, well worth it."
52,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75504512-rishav,5,"The idea to read this book started after Bill Gate's recommendation.I took up this book just to clear my curious queries that had popped up in my mind while reading Yuval's sapiens.Sapien starts precisely with the interesting evolution theory, but I felt that some of the pertinent questions of the evolution of society remain unanswered in Sapiens.Blueprint gives us such traits that elaborate on the binding of society, the 8 NECESSARY social suites and also the importance of adherence to such traits. Christakis proves the NECESSITY of eloquent and beautiful examples.The book indeed helped me gain insights into how we react to situations ( differently at personal level and at a group level). The equation of favoring, altruistic attitude towards the community is well explained in the book. It showcases the dynamism of the real world.The book starts with making the claim that some social suites are needed for functioning of the society and there are chapters that follow strengthening that claim.After that, we see the dynamism and interplay of such suits in various types of societies in the world ( from the behavioral apprehension of the chimps, monkeys to the study of the villages of Honduras, to the diverse sexual orientation of different communities around the world - the book covers all).The most interesting part in the book was the idea to converge the graph theories ( ideation of cliques) to the study of community, the ideation of genetic pressure/roles in the interplay of society.The book spews an amazing amount of knowledge and compels the reader to think in the direction whether the humans possessed such traits or such traits were hard-wired into the human conscience right from the beginning.Was it natural selection? Or was it the incremental agile adoption of circumstances? The attributes open up the idea of exploring the evolution through the prism of empathy, love, altruism and social cognizance.It's a must-read for people who like sociology or want to understand the dynamics of society and its evolution."
53,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31723412-rob-tsai,3,"The author makes the case that humans are hardwired to evolve towards goodness, by analyzing various case studies and historical experiments.A couple sections stood out for me. The author analyzes shipwrecks to find out what made certain sets of castaways survive, and what made other sets perish. Not surprisingly leadership and cohesion matters, so certain groups that collaborated had a much higher chance of survival.The author also analyzes various societies and their attitude toward marriage and child rearing, and I found the contrast between the Western monogamous pairing of couples and other societies that did not fit that cultural standard to be fascinating. Many of the case studies of animal societies (chimpanzees, bonobos, dolphins, elephants) show shocking similarities to our own. Animals feel grief. They coordinate and work together. They fight and sometimes war. At the end of the day, these activities and behaviors may naturally evolve in any grouping of intelligent beings facing survival in a tough world.Are we as a species selfish or selfless? The author asks why do truckers tip waitresses when they have no expectation of seeing that same waitress ever again? (Social pressure and norms are extremely powerful, don't you think?)I enjoyed the studies of human experiment - where if you were given say 10 dollars, and had to split it with someone anonymous stranger, who would have the chance to accept or reject your split, what allocation would you make? Not surprisingly, not all societies default to the 50/50 split.Like this review, the book does feel like it meanders all over the place. The chapters on philosophy (Locke, Hobbes) feel pedantic. So did the social network analysis sections of mapping relationships on a social graph."
54,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112653152-richard,5,"Culture is an evolutionary adaptation, not of individuals, but of groups. When the adaptation no longer provides survival value, culture is lost, although introduced change or mutation may allow it to evolve. What would causes the change? What forces ‘direct’ its evolution?In biological evolution, the changes/mutations are believed to occur randomly - only becoming adaptive if they provide survival value in a ‘particular environment’. Results are not directed, the environment selects the result. Most change is not selected - not incorporated into the genome.In cultural evolution, the change doesn’t seem to be random, but caused by forces within pre-existing cultures through transmitted beliefs (‘information’) - beliefs as means to directed ‘effects’ - goals; i.e., better, fairer, healthier, more just, more free, more righteous, etc.Why do only some of these beliefs result in evolved culture? Christakis’ position seems to be that some beliefs can not result in a survivable culture. I don’t know whether this is true - the possible environments of the universe for potential biological groups are too unimaginable for me to judge. Nevertheless, I do assume we live in a culture that has been adaptively successful. And a culture with emerging beliefs competing for transmission. How does one choose what to believe?Changes in current culture may been seen as consequences of groups coming to believe either: 1) the goals are no longer acceptable, or 2) the goals are not obtainable by the prevailing means. This leaves us to consider on the one hand, what will be the new goals? And on the other hand, what will be the new means? That is the contest among the believers. What do you believe, and how did you choose to believe it? Beware of one proclaiming science and reason for the basis of belief, for science and reason seem to be the lest likely explanations for our choices."
55,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"Christakis's book is good and thorough introduction to evolutionary psychology and its impact on social life. Its ""blueprint"" refers to the set of evolved characteristics that underlie every human society despite the diversity of social expression in their customs and laws. The word ""blueprint"" is a bit of a red herring, however, since it does not entail a set of clear-cut instructions that determine the social construction of rules. It is simultaneously something less and more than that.From the point of view of evolution, all societies are constrained by behavioural traits that have been shaped by natural selection and cultural modification. They have endowed communities with a ""social suite"" (the author's own term) that embody the evolved passions and social instincts of humanity. The European conquerors of the Americans and the conquered native tribes, despite millennia of separation, shared much more in their biology and in their social life than either side was willing to admit. Both were driven by in-group bias and kinship loyalties that shaped their community rules, beliefs, and practices. Both sides had given different but overlapping expression to the biological roots of shared human sentiments, instincts, and evolved habits. There are a lot of books about evolutionary psychology, but Christakis's book stands above the pack in three respects: 1) It is entertainingly written and full of interesting anecdotes, for example about castaway societies and their fates. 2) It synthesizes a a century of academic literature, including hundreds of studies across multiple disciplines, into a compact narrative that avoids both hyperbole and understatement. 3) Its narrative crystallizes into memorable takeaway lessons that marry the two virtues above - the suaveness of expression and the solidity of the science - into one of the best introductions to evolutionary psychology out there, leagues above most of the competition. The book is not getting a full five star review from me, however, because the chapters are full of well-worn examples from evolutionary game theory, behaviourism, kin vs. group selection, the selfish gene theory, etc. As a result, the thorough narrative may feel a bit schoolmasterly, or familiar, to some readers. Although a bit vanilla or unadventurous in its detours, the author has clearly done a good job popularizing evolutionary psychology. Opposable thumbs up!"
56,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17464834-jakub-ferencik,5,"Christaki's new book, ""Blueprint: The Evolution of a Good Society"" is a great work of scientific scholarship. Each chapter is deeply informative, beaming with scientific research & insight. Christaki elaborates on the scientific literature surrounding how societies have independently evolved through the millennia and how evolution made sure to pass on genes that harness goodness. He discusses shipwrecks and the subsequent hierarchies that form, the development of monogamy, primates & monogamy, animal altruism, animal relationships, how genes influence our social lives, and so much more. Christakis is a masterful narrator. He always ties in fascinating research into his narration. Consider his explanation for the existence of the self and how lucid it is, observable in chimpanzees: ""Chimpanzees born in the laboratory and raised in isolation generally do not show signs of self-recognition. A sense of self and of being distant from others may actually require the presence of others from an early age"" (296). He raised a lot of research that I was not really aware of, such as the extended phenotype, as Dawkins calls them, of parasites & pathogens: ""Humans think that sneezing is something that we do to the germs to clear those pesky Invaders from our bodies and promote our own well-being. But maybe it is something that germs do to us to ... increase their fitness"" (343). Similarly, it is probable that when we are sick with pathogens, we act in childish ways to attract caregivers (343). The insights are endless and broad-ranging. All in all, a very interesting book. I will quote it extensively & often. ."
57,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81212229-mclaren-p,4,"It took me longer than I expected to finish this book but it was worthy it. Apart from reading other books in between(which I eventually had to dismiss on behalf of this masterpiece), I went slow paced due to the huge amount of detail within. The author didn't spare relevant sources, either evidence based on his own researches, from other scientist works and from historical records to defend his case. It is my first book by Nicholas Christakis and I was impressed with his scientific rigour, the way he presents the evidence and mainly counter-evidence for his claims was instructive. I remember when I was halfway commenting to my wife that it seems like he wanted to be disproved, by the amount of information he brought against his own claims. I had to stop several times not just to reflect and process the new information and the knowledge I was acquiring but to check other sources (mainly video footages), of other societies of which I wasn't well aware of like the Hazda, Na or Tongas. It was eye-opening and even heart-warming to now so many different groups with so many different practices. With this book I improved my cognitive toolkit in several ways. Things I took for granted I find out are not universal at all, and that knowledge alone just caused a shift in my perspective. for instance by paying more attention to the generalisation instinct(dubbed by Hans Rosling), due to the trap of ethnocentrism.I had the feeling of evolution shaping society and culture, the ideia was blurred though and I had never read a relevant work on the subject, this made it utterly clear. It may shed a light on the long discussion among historians regarding whether unusual leaders really changed the course of history, in my view after reading this book Echology and Gene pool(of the country) pose a greater thrust( you can think of a Nero born in America the outcome would PROBABLE be different at most I reckon he'd become a Charles Manson).Above all it was crucial to learn how we are wired by natural selection mainly to do good rather than do wrong( as many political parties and media outlets often claim).Last but not least I enjoyed Chapter 12 the most, a brief explanation of four ""Isms"" , and the subject of emergence Which I adore."
58,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54320432-ieva-gr,3,"Was it easy to read: Oh no, not really. I’ve listened to the audio version. Wasn’t the most difficult thing I’ve ever listened to. But I spaced out through quite a bit of it. What I liked about it:How scientific it was: author often discussed why this data set is not good enough, but interesting under the circumstances, how good data set would look like etc. Tried to look at the facts from different angles.How many different examples were used: from stories of shipwrecks and communes, to use of Amazon’s Mechanical Turk for scientific experiments.How it helps to fight the anthropocentric point of view: book is full of examples where animals feel and act very similar to humans. I think these things are very good for fighting animal cruelty.How it made me look at things differently: there were examples on how certain people can be genetically programmed to be e.g. polyamorous, introverted etc. I think this helps to accept people the way they are – because it is not exactly their choice and they are not doing it just to get on your nerves.How it expanded my knowledge: the book touched upon many topics I don’t read about on day to day bases. For example I learned the word exophenotype – or I think I did – the effects of external factors, environments to the characteristics of an organism. What I disliked: I mentioned a lot of things that were good in this book. But I have to admit I didnt really like it. The topic was a bit too foreign for me. So I didn’t have the right motivation nor excitement to listen to it. I managed to get through to the very end, but didn’t really enjoy it. "
59,0316230030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21201326-joe-koelsch,3,"When we think about human society, we often think about great thinkers or empires of the past. We think about the Greeks and their Democracy or the Holy Roman Empire or the Ancient Egyptians or Chinese. We might think about tribal culture in the Americas or in Africa or Australia. And when we think of these societies, we are apt to focus on their distinctive features. We wonder what made them unique. What lead to their success and their eventual failure.In this book, Christakis suggests that, by focusing on these differences, we are missing what is elemental to humanity. By noting what makes us distinctive, we are forgetting that we are genetically 99% identical, and, as a result we create societies that are striking in their similarities. He calls the collection of these similarities “the Blueprint” for human society, and it includes such concepts as love, friendship, social learning, and others. This book seeks to reunite all of humanity by pointing out how much we are alike not only in our biology, but also in the way we interact with one another. He proves his point using examples from sociology, biology and evolution. While I found his thesis compelling and interesting, at times, the sheer number of examples he provides to explain his point were a bit wearisome and technical. In short, I love his ideas, but I found this book to be a bit of a slog."
