The story of the discovery of the structure of DNA is a fascinating one and makes for a compelling must-read book. The research behind it merited a Nobel Award... But as any first year science student worth their salt can tell you it is a story mired in controversy. I was enthralled by the continuous advancement of ideas that led to the double helical model that we all are familiar with today, but what is deeply unsettling about this account of those events is the almost casual misogyny that bleeds off practically every page that features Rosalind Franklin. I don't think that one or two paragraphs in an epilogue, to attempt to paint her in a better light after defaming her character for the entirety of what has gone before it, can fully rectify the situation. This book recounts the occurrences during the early 1950s from the viewpoint of James Watson so the question could be asked, does the time period and accepted societal viewpoints excuse his narration of the events? This was a highly educated man. An intelligent man. Surely a man such as that should be held to higher standards and should have been a voice for equality and not one spreading misogynistic ideas?If Franklin had lived it also would have highlighted the quandary over whether or not she would she have been awarded a Nobel prize too? Undoubtedly her work was a key component in determining the structure of DNA. However, a Nobel Prize can only be awarded to a maximum of three people. Who would have lost out? Would perhaps the medical prize have been awarded to Watson and Crick and the chemistry prize to Franklin and Wilkins? Sadly we will never know. Rosalind Franklin died from ovarian cancer before the awarding of the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine which was jointly awarded to Francis Harry Compton Crick, James Dewey Watson and Maurice Hugh Frederick Wilkins ""for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material"". (ref. www.nobelprize.org)Has history been too kind to Rosalind Franklin and placed too much gravitas on her scientific work? Do we vilify James Watson and triumph Franklin as some sort of wronged feminist icon? Would Watson and Crick have determined DNA structure as quickly without access to Franklin's research....I know what I believe.Five stars for the science But one star for the blatant misogyny which I cannot condoneA prior knowledge of DNA structure and protein synthesis is best to enjoy this book and at the very least some basic understanding of the various principles of chemical bonding."
1,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,1,"I ended up skimming this. I really hope his more recent book DNA: The Secret of Life is considerably more interesting and considerably less sexist. It should be a fascinating story, but really it's mostly about James D. Watson bouncing around between different supervisors and making sexist comments about Rosalind Franklin -- sorry, ""Rosy"", who would've been much better in his eyes if she'd done something with her hair. [ETA: in total fairness to those who have difficulty recognising hyperbole, it's worth noting that it probably isn't mostly about these things... but it sure felt like it to me. His later book is much, much better and more to the point.]I can understand his fascination with DNA, but that's just about all I could get on board with. And his writing style was just completely flat. I do not honestly think all the details like how cold he was in Italy are at all relevant to the history of the discovery of the double helix."
2,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,4,"“In the end, though, science is what matters; scientists not a bit.” ― Steve Jones in, James D. Watson's The Double HelixI gave it three stars last night (DNA night, thanks Riku), but that just didn't seem right. The structure wasn't stable, and I felt it probably deserved four stars (one for A, one for T, one for G, one for C; also one for Watson, one for Crick, one for Wilkins, and yes one for Franklin).Short, interesting, personal and important but also sexist, biased, & according to Crick ""a violation of friendship"". Watson's attitudes towards Rosalind Franklin today seem so maligned that Watson eventually had to clarify that these were attitudes and view at the time of the discovery and not when he wrote the book. Still, despite this major and very real issue, the book (along with Watson, Crick & Wilkins contributions) cannot be undersold. The discovery of DNA's structure changed biology and the book catapulted Watson & Crick into that pantheon of fame that is seldom reached by even Nobel-level scientists."
3,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10592271-brokentune,1,"Gossip, backstabbing, petty squabbles, arrogance, snobbishness, and misogyny take a front row seat in this personal account of how the double helix structure of DNA was discovered. I expected more from Watson's book. And then there is the question about Rosalind Franklin's contribution to the discovery.While Watson does spend some time in the epilogue to credit Franklin for her work on the subject, it seems too little, too late. He spends the entire book painting her as an uncooperative, dour, argumentative, bossy, frump with an ""acid smile"" in a career mostly reserved for unattractive women who have little chance of catching a husband. (He actually introduces her in the book in almost exactly those terms.)Oh, and there is little explanation of the structure of DNA itself. It really is more of an account of his thoughts on girls, stomach pains, and on the personal lives of people Watson encountered when working on the project. "
4,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3020662-douglas,4,"I made the mistake of reading this over a long period of time. I see now that it really needs to be read in just a few sittings. Also, a basic background in chemistry and physics (none of which I have) would be beneficial. Thank goodness for Wikipedia. This is the riveting story of the discovery of the secret of life, the helical structure of DNA. Even though the Nobel award was given to both James D. Watson and Francis Crick, the pendulum of recognition swings to Watson for this well-known account of how it all came to be. The path to discovering the structure of DNA is of course fascinating, but Watson’s charming prose and thrilling narrative adds drama to the history. Watson’s writing style has that English charm, which is unique for an American. I did, however, sense a bit of false humility in his account. He often refers to his ignorance on certain scientific principles and his physical unattractiveness to perhaps gain sympathy for appropriating other’s work. “Sometimes I daydreamed about discovering the secret of the gene, but not once did I have the faintest trace of a respectable idea.”I find that hard to believe. Now, I, Douglas Feil, could honestly say, “not once did I have the faintest trace of a respectable idea”, but not Watson. After all, he had several traces of ideas, and he strategically and sometimes underhandedly put himself in the middle of those on the verge of scientific discovery. His theories were just wrong at first. Thanks to the work of Rosalind Franklin, Linus Pauling, Maurice Wilkins, and a host of others, he used their “faintest traces” to build upon his own theory. Discovering the structure of DNA was hard work, but much of it was timing. Kudos to Watson and Crick for that, and I do believe they deserved the Nobel for their work. I was disappointed in his treatment of Rosalind Franklin. He almost unapologetically skewers Rosalind Franklin and her contributions to the discovery of DNA. I say almost because he reserves the ending epilogue for a sort of apology. “Since my initial impressions of her, both scientific and personal were often wrong, I want to say something about her achievements.” He apologizes after her death and the apology was after the prior vilification. If Watson really respected Franklin and appreciated her contributions, why not leave out the dirt? Here’s a book that more properly defends Franklin: Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA.Overall, I found this account thrilling and vital. Few scientific discoveries get a story like this. Watson's writing is sure-footed and perfect for describing his accomplishments."
5,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92723-carlos,2,"Shows how arrogant, misogynistic, and plain stupid the ""discoverers"" of DNA's double helix were. Pros: Emphasizes the importance of being able to access a free, open, creative, in some ways childish state of mind in order to allow for truly creative and ""defocalized"" states of mind that allow for scientific discovery. Tunnel vision can be a scientist's worst nightmare.Cons: Shows how childish, pretentious and socially inept the scientific establishment can be. Also shows how a great scientist who suffered in silence due to being surrounded by sexist men in positions of authority was robbed of credit for providing the critical evidence necessary for finding and verifying the structure of DNA. Rosalind Franklin, you will not be forgotten. "
6,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl,2,I had to read this book for a science class in college. I've never forgiven that teacher.
7,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48011083-steve,5,"The Double Helix is a wonderfully candid recounting of the scientific process, revealing the interplay of conditions precedent—especially technology, observation and theory—and the human condition—especially ego, competition and teamwork. I can’t help wondering that many, if not all, of the scientists revered through history are really the beneficiaries of much good fortune and coincidence. Of course, they were accomplished and driven, necessary prerequisites to greatness, yet those factors are not enough, for a large amount of their success seems due to pure serendipity."
8,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5410681-tony61,5,"James D. Watson became a controversial figure later in life, but this story recounts the seminal event in his life: the 1953 discovery of the structure of DNA for which he received the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology with his collaborator Francis Crick and another, Maurice Wilkins. Watson is an excellent storyteller, something which cannot be said of most scientists. He successfully ensnares the reader into the drama of the moment, describing the personalities involved and making the science attainable to any reader. The discovery of the double helix as the structure of DNA is perhaps the most remarkable event in biology after Darwin's grand theory of Evolution. Watson and Crick devised the structure using tinker-toy-like models and corroborating their findings with x-ray crystallographs which were surreptitiously taken from the laboratory of Rosalind Franklin. Watson was a wunderkind American who acquired his PhD in zoology at the age of 23; Crick was a 35 year-old boisterous gad-about who was struggling for direction, having earned his BS in physics and unable to get the proper motivation for a PhD. The unlikely duo hit it off and agreed that DNA biochemistry was the ticket to recognition. At this time Linus Pauling at CalTech was transitioning his emphasis from proteins to DNA, setting the stage for a race to find the secret of the genetic code.Watson spins the yarn in dramatic fashion, writing in 1968, fifteen years after the discovery and 6 years after the Nobel. He offers an apologia of sorts to Dr. Franklin, who was taken aback by the use of her xrays without permission. Watson admits that her gender had much to do with the raw treatment she received in the male-dominated world of science. Franklin did not receive a Nobel because she tragically died in 1958 from ovarian cancer at the age of 37, and the Prize is only awarded to living scientists.I cannot believe that I've never read this book before. It's relatively short and remarkably easy to read. I highly recommend this to anyone who has any interest in science, medicine or the history of the 20th century. "
9,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8320288-heidi,2,"I have no doubt that James Watson was a (pretty) competent scientist - although the way he writes it, every thing seemed to favor him up to the discovery of the double helix structure. He chose the field by a mix of chance and cunning, having eliminated other fields which would require more effort, by his own words (I suppose some people call it self-disparaging, but somehow to me it reads like a humble brag) and less likely to yield the chance to make a huge discovery. If that's not cheating science, I don't know what is. I have more respect to great men and women who did science because they really loved digging up more and more facts about something they truly love, something that they can't stop thinking about. Such as Feynmann and Einstein and Curie and yes, Rosalind Franklin, the brilliant and dedicated molecular biologist upon whose work Watson and Crick built theirs.I hate the way Watson portrays Franklin, the way he demonizes her into someone difficult to work with, when in fact he and Crick did not really respect her as an equal. In some scenes that he recollects in the book it seems as if they resented her for getting the double helix images before them, because it means they needed the results of her research.Watson's writing is friendly and easy enough to read. But the vibe of the whole book seems to be: ""Oh the Nobel prize thing? I didn't really put that much effort into it, I just happen to be a scientific genius and a visionary."""
10,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,4,"After reading Bill Bryson’s wonderful A Short History of Nearly Everything, I’ve been effectively disabused of the notion that scientists are purely logical, rational, and reasonable folk, and that science progresses through mild-mannered and careful thinking. I bet it does, sometimes. But, like any dynamic human activity, science is populated by a diverse group of people. Some, I’m sure, are the workaday, tame people we like to imagine in white lab coats. But we also have half-deranged incorrigible bachelors who stick needles in their own eyes (Newton), adventurous world-travelers with exotic diseases (Darwin), and fun-loving, impetuous youngsters who enjoy chatting about foreign girls and wine as much as tinkering with organic chemistry (Watson). This book was great. We are all taught in school that DNA was discovered in 1953 by Watson and Crick. What we are not told about is the high school-type drama that was involved. Backstabbing, gossip, love, wine, vicious arguments, a race against time (and Linus Pauling)—after reading this, you’d be amazed that us humans ever get anything done. The elephant in the room here is, of course, Watson’s description of Rosalind Franklin. It’s very sexist. She comes across as a know-nothing bulldog. I’m sure many readers will be put off by it. Personally, I think it’s valuable to read about anyway. It’s a bird’s eye view into what institutional sexism was like. Moreover, I think that Watson’s honesty is preferable to a retrospective cover-up. I have no doubt that this was actually how Watson experienced the events he describes. Also, even Watson dedicates the last two paragraphs to an apology for his treatment of Rosalind, as well as an encomium to her scientific work. It’s a shame she died young, or she might have seen more of the credit in her lifetime. And (if you will pardon me for saying this) the sexism on display is a part of the charm of this book. Not that sexism is charming, of course, but that Watson gives us a singularly candid portrait of how scientists really operate. For The Double Helix has no pretense of objectivity or authority. It is a first-person account of one of the greatest scientific discoveries of the 20th century, with all of the peripheral thoughts, activities, interests, and proclivities that were part of Watson’s life while he struggled with the problem. So read this book, to see how a 24-year-old American with stomach pains from English food managed to uncover the secret of life by tinkering with a model in a cramped Cambridge office. And he didn't even need a lab coat."
11,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43931803-renuka,2,"I was expecting a lot from this book and it surely didn't meet my expectations. I picked this book because genetics always have been fascinating to me. When I was in college I did a course on molecular biology and DNA was really interesting and important topic. My professor mentioned this book but I couldn't find time to read it that time. Everything is wrong with this book from Watson's writing to his remarks on Rosalind Franklin. The only thing accurate here is the science which can't be overlooked. But I am also unable to digest the misogynist remarks of Watson, a well educated and renowned scientist. It felt like I was reading an article on a magazine rather than a very popular book. Two stars are just for the science!"
12,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,3,"Battle of egos, blind ambition, tensions, quarrels, conflicts of interests... Sadly or not, science goes hand in hand with the little defects of human nature. The race having led to the discovery of the structure of DNA is obviously no exception, and James Watson, the young lad (he was only 24!!) who was among whose hitting such jackpot, reminds us so here with his own version of the events.As every personal account such version is, of course, far from being objective! His arrogance is annoying. His egocentrism irritating. Some of his comments about Rosalind Franklin off the mark. He also was often accused of too much putting himself and Crick under the spotlights at the expense of other people's works. None-the-less, if the guy is a bore (gosh!) and his writing style full of difficult jargon, he delivers a fascinating testimony about, not only that great scientific triumph that was the discovery of the structure of DNA, but, also and beyond, how science is at times practiced. It is, at least, a powerfull insight no one interested in such topics should ignore."
13,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/128299-shawn,5,"This book was probably ten times as fun to read as I suspected it would be. The very idea of it, and its drab wrappings, led me to believe it would be dull, full of scientific mumbo-jumbo, slow, and poorly written. It was none of these. It's one of the few books that I have had a hard time putting down. The race between team Watson and Crick vs Linus was riveting, and even though I knew how it would generally work out, I was worried and on edge until their paper was published. I was especially interested in who would make that final leap (Watson or Crick) and break the problem open. I'm also certain that the importance of the discovery played a big part in the book's ability to keep me enthralled.The book is also especially eye-opening in regard to how some science is done. It's astounding how such an important and apparently hard problem could be solved by someone with a nature as lackadaisical as Watson. I suspect this nature in some way made him a perfect compliment to the much more driven and, by Watson's own account, intelligent Crick. A perfect combination of squishy and solid. It could be argued that Watson's great talent was his ability to work with Crick, which very few people seemed capable of.I wonder how ""obvious"" the solution is these days. I never took a biology class (not even in high school) and as soon as they mentioned the fact that certain base pairs were always equally represented I somehow knew that it was because they always connect together as pairs. So I assume it's knowledge that floats out their in the ether that is hard not to pick up these days, but it was still surprising to me that that was the key point that was holding them up for such a long time, and once it was understood it practically solved the problem.Of course there was a fair amount of science in the book that was beyond me, but I don't think it got in the way of the basic understanding of the story. Plus the reader doesn't feel terrible about their own ignorance because half of the book seemed to be Watson confessing to his own ignorance in most every encounter he had with any other scientist of any significance.I think it is clear that Watson is not the most reliable narrator, which makes for an interesting non-fiction read (about science no less). I'm certain he does a very poor job of accurately describing Rosy (which is confirmed in the epilogue when he admits to as much). And I'm not certain that his modesty is feigned or not. I suppose it's easy (as in it doesn't hurt one bit) to claim yourself to be an inferior intellect when you have the discovery of the structure under your belt and uncontested. But anyway, this unreliability, if accepted as a flaw (especially the mischaracterizations) I think only makes the story more interesting, as opposed to harming the story. It makes the journey that much more human.I've been debating the four or five star. In a perfect world/website it would be 4.5. Today I shall error on the side of too many stars."
14,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13298726-michael-perkins,2,"""For a long time, the world believed that Rosalind Franklin had nothing to do with James Watson’s and Francis Crick’s discovery of DNA’s structure. In no small part, that’s because Watson said she didn’t, and we believed him. His 1968 autobiography Double Helix was the first full-length account of the discovery story. He refers to Franklin as “Rosy” throughout the book, and describes her physical appearance in blatantly sexist ways. He also omits the part of the story in which he and Crick used Franklin’s Photograph 51 without her permission or knowledge; Photograph 51 was the key evidence to unlocking the structure of DNA. He couldn’t completely erase Franklin, since too many people knew who she was, but he diminished her enough with a whimsical nickname and assessments of her attractiveness that her part in the story could easily be missed.""-Leila McNeilhttps://thebaffler.com/outbursts/sure...far from his only transgression....https://www.vox.com/2019/1/15/1818253..."
15,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6638317-jill,3,"I'm going to talk about this in class in a few days, and I know we're going to spend the majority of the seminar on how the Old Boys of British science treated Rosalind Franklin. With good reason: her contributions to the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA are now well-known, and they were all pretty big dicks to her. Watson's misogynist jabs are deeply frustrating to read, often detracting from the narrative itself -- which is structured as a fun academic mystery (AND Y'ALL KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE MY ACADEMIC MYSTERIEEEES). It is profoundly important that we talk about how women are treated in science, in the 50s and today.That said, here are some other things I would like to talk about:- why Watson remembers every meal he eats- what Crick's laugh really sounded like- Watson and Odile's gossip dates cause they sounded like fun- how can Watson be such an obvious asshole yet so endearing?- dry humour in the sciences and why it is so very effective- is there fan fiction about this competitive circle of DNA-seeking dudes, cause like, there's gotta be, I feel like ya could cut the tension with a knife- or maybe we could do a movie? That Turing movie went over well, MOAR SCIENCE BIOGRAPHY MOVEEZ PLS- DNA is so, so, so fucking cool- biology wtf- I love when all the sciences get along <3 physics, chemistry, and biology all had to help on this one!! beebees!- how emotional I got when Watson finally figured out the base pairs and why did I cry when reading the appendixed Nobel presentation speechHopefully we do not have time to talk about most of those as I will sound ridiculous but whatever, Goodreads friends, you signed up for the real deal here.Anyway: totally worth the read. I tend to read more physics than biology pop-science; that's maybe gonna have to change."
16,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5507161-battle-slug,5,"Just finished this book. What can i say? It is totally worth reading, but if you are not afraid of some scientific words and descriptions. For me it is one of the best books ever, and i will explain why.First of all this short book tells about how really big discoveries are being made: surprisingly the regular people are making them. But those people are keen to make something new. They don't bother about the money, or sex, or new car - the biggest passion possessing them is the science. Such books are moving the science forward because they are making the young mind to think that he can move the science himself like watson and crick and to decide to master biochemistry or physics etc.Secondly this book is real story about the collaboration and opposition between the scientists, something that is not well-known to regular people. It is really interesting to learn about. As for me - i never suspected that so hard competition existed between american and britain scientists, moreover, that the cultures are so different: conspicuous adversary between US scientists, and, in contrast, unquestionable confession of the first right to make investigations for those who decided to investigate first, in britain.Thirdly this book is making you to think: surely you always can dismiss all chemical details, but what a pleasure to get into them!I saw negative opinions about the Double Helix counting 200 words or more, but i believe that the people wrote them have to keep their fervor for the whole bunch of other junk books, but not for the stories of the greatest scientific discoveries of the modern history."
17,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2231715-lewis-weinstein,5,"I had the great good fortune to meet Dr. James Watson, many times actually, and to have his kind assistance when I, a scientific novice, set out to save the venerable Public Health Research Institute in New York. Watson's major accomplishment, his role in determining the structure of DNA, is a fascinating tale well told in a form the lay reader can easily appreciate. For those who wonder how scientific discoveries are made, and indeed on the nature of scientific research itself, this is a great source."

19,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5197179-becky-douglas,2,"How to review The Double Helix? As a scientist who also happens to be a woman, I'm already biased against James Watson and Francis Crick, the two scientists credited with the discovery of DNA, because I'm aware of Rosalind Franklin. It's not very many pages into the book before Franklin appears and Watson's description of her makes me cross, but he's already failed to endear himself to me long before I get even that far.I'm not sure how tongue in cheek he's being, but he comes across as lazy and ruthless. He doesn't want to do the hard work; he avoids understanding x-ray crystallography, anything about biology, difficult mathematics and anything too far removed from what he already knows. He even acknowledges that during his PhD he was dangerous enough to be kept from the lab, meaning he got an easy ride on the way to collecting his degree. He avoids following the rules that are set for his fellowships and the funding that comes with them because he doesn't want to work on the difficult tasks he has been set. Even so, he wants to work with brilliant people enough to claim the prizes for their hard work. Doesn't he just sound like a joy?So when we get to Franklin and she's criticised for wanting credit for her own work and for not wearing lipstick, I'm already out of patience. Fine, so the book was first published in 1968, at time when a lot of people held ideas that now feel very backwards, but science had always tried (and almost always failed) to be a meritocracy - to so openly criticise a scientist for their appearance over their work is infuriating. No wonder Franklin didn't like them.In some later editions, including the beautiful Folio Society copy that I hold, Watson has added a note, admitting that he was unfair to Franklin and that she didn't deserve the treatment she received. This goes some way to fixing the problems, but not far enough.In terms of the science, it's fascinating. The x-ray crystallography field was still pretty new at the time and the work needed to find the structure of DNA was extensive. The importance of the results cannot be understated and, even if it's hard to like the scientists who did the work, the results are beautiful and elegant. Interestingly, this book is presented like something between a diary and a piece of pop-sci, except the science is pitched at someone who already has a decent background in chemistry. Very little is introduced at a layperson's level and someone who really wanted to understand, without a science background, would probably need to read it with a couple of Wikipedia tabs open.So it's a strange book. The science is cool, the characters are mostly awful and the pitch is all over the place. If you're going to read books about science then this is an obvious one to choose, but that doesn't have to mean that it's a good one."
20,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7216661-red,2,"So...umm. Hmm. Okay right off the bat, if you're not someone with a lot of biochem in their brain, this book is one-half to one-third wholly unfuckingcomprehensible. I say this as someone whose college sciences were Astrology and Geology. This was never meant to be the weird, scandalous, ego-driven smash hit it ended up being, is my impression. It didn't seem like Watson entirely expected the backlash and sensation of it. But there the book was, on Time Magazine's Top 100 non-fiction books, and so I wanted to read it. The bits that are good, and by good I mean bad (as in reality tv bad), are Watson repeatedly avoiding work, or deceiving grant committees, or sniping at society, his friends, his coworkers, etc. But it's so...guileless. And honest. He didn't write a PR fluff piece, he didn't write a thing that praises his GREAT MASSIVE WORTH as a human being, he didn't get a Nobel Prize and then set to pen to paper to say love me love me love me. Most memoirs of this nature are that, a big celebration of the author. But this isn't, he just says what he feels without the intent to tear anybody down. Which isn't to say he didn't say terrible, awful, unfair, inaccurate things about Rosalind Franklin. But he didn't know those things until a large group of other people told him. He lives in the same self-centered world we all do. If there's a coworker that annoys us, we don't try to find out their backstory, their struggles, their psyche. We lean back in our chairs and bitch about them, because every body wants there to be a villain to their hero. Watson has crafted here one of the most human and down-to-earth memoirs I've ever read, and he doesn't even feel like he's trying to accomplish that. He just doesn't have a filter, and I can't fault him for it. This is both an egotistical book (b/c it is purely his side of the story with no investigation into anyone else) and an ego-less book (in that he does not in any way praise himself or go on monologues about his individual worth and accomplishments as compared to others). A complicated book with a complicated history, but worthwhile if you enjoy nonfiction as a style to be investigated and are not just reading this for the story...unless you also understand biochem, in which case the story will make more sense to you. As for me, I'm going to find ways to insert ""diffraction patterns of crystallographic sculptures under X-rays"" into conversation to make me sound smart and make it sound like I read a smart book."
21,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4177031-troy-blackford,3,"Watson is one of those figures who's opinion of himself is so high, you can't help but be dissuaded from feeling the respect you would have been willing to give him merely on the basis of his accomplishments. Reading this book was full of cringe-worthy moments of self-aggrandizement, and times when his accounts of trying to pick up French girls at parties and things of that nature were just unwanted. Written in the late sixties about events that happened in the early fifties, I shouldn't be surprised and upset that his attitude towards women is so awful, and to his credit he gives an afterword basically apologizing for his treatment of Dr. Rosalind Franklin in life and in the text, which was a nice touch.But it was terrible reading about them trying to get her fired for wanting to be equal to the men she was educationally and career-wise actually equal to. The phrase ""our lab was no place for a feminist"" is used at one point. Maybe that afterword should have been a foreword! The science isn't well-explained at all. I think Watson likes to feel smarter than his readers, who he assumes will be along for the ride because of the importance of the finding. He makes no effort to do anything other than explain in technical terms what they were doing. No amount of educating laypeople in the science involved is attempted.Still, the finding of the double helix structure of DNA was a monumental human achievement, so this is still an interesting book.NOTE: I saw him on a recent science documentary, where he told the interviewer, unprovoked, that ""Aside from Hawking, I'm the most famous living scientist now."" Which I don't even think is true, but it is also a douchey thing to bring up for no reason."
22,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,3,"Glad I finally read this classic. It's a quick-reading sketch, two or three hours, a half day at most if you need a break. Watson's prose is obscurely ironic at times, which keeps the reader on his toes (or bores him as the case may be) along with quite a bit of humor if you are looking for it. The science, not difficult even at its original full strength, is hardly toned-down for the popular reader, which is a disctinct positive. Watson avoids confusion by simply skipping a few topics, like the mathematics of crystallography or the intimate details of chemical bonds, which are not necessary to follow the ""action"" anyway. All considered, it's a privilege to be able to share in his discovery first-hand.Now, what about the elephant in the room? Watson treated his female colleague Rosalind Franklin very badly, and he doesn't hide that from his readers. (They nearly come to blows at one point.) Apparently all the men at Cambidge looked down the same way at all women there. It's entirely unforgivable, but mitigated somewhat by what seems to be his sincere apology in the book's Epilogue. You'll make your own judgment. Certainly, Watson's recent racial shenanigans, 50+ years after his discovery, and at the end of his long life, are disgusting. None of this detracts from the brilliance of his youthful scientific accomplishment described herein.It might be argued that Linus Pauling, at Cal Tech, the beloved world's greatest chemist at the time, only a few weeks behind Watson's lead, hot on his trail, would have been a more worthy discoverer. That's not how science, and history, works, where there's usually no accounting for pleasantness."

In a review of that book, I suggested The Double Helix as a corrective; it made clear that competition, hunger for personal acclaim, and a desire to show up the famous guy (a role played here by Linus Pauling) all figure into the progress of science. The original Kirkus review of this book puts it nicely: ""What emerges here is not only a story of a scientific scrimmage as competitive as the race to the moon--but also a happy sense of surprise that anything as seemingly assiduous and systematic as pure science could be so much the result of random speculations at lunch and teatime and anything from light to 'solid fiddling' at odd hours. It all seems remarkably fresh and impulsive and adventitious.""Incidentally, this book figures into the debate over Rosalind Franklin’s work (which happens to be in the public eye as I write, thanks to a prominent London production of a play about her by Anna Ziegler), but little about that is simple. It seems clear that Watson and Crick stole a march on her, but she’s not absent from this telling of the tale—this book is where I first heard of her."
24,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4, Very short memoir/history by Watson of his and Cricks unravelling of DNA and coming up with the double helix. Thanks to X-ray crystallography and studies by experimentalists like Rosiland Franklin and near misses like JBS Haldane's attempts to model DNA as triple helix Watson and Crick were able to figure out the double helix and the G to C and A to T pairings of the nucleotides and provide a foundation for Genetics. Many teams at the time thought DNA was probably the molecule responsible for cell reproduction and were working on the problem but Crick and Watson unlocked the code first. What is shows through this short story is that science is a group effort and if Crick and Watson had not of solved the structure of DNA another team soon would have. Nice little short history.
25,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/882910-rob,4,"The molecular structure of DNA was determined in 1953 by James Watson and Francis Crick. That was probably the most influential discovery in all of biology and chemistry during that century. This book was written by Watson (comparatively younger and inexperienced compared to Crick, at the time) about how they did it. In great detail, he explains how they did it by essentially using Rosalind Franklin's data without her permission, how the more notorius Linus Pauling nearly beat them to it, and how their personal lives were consumed by the pursuit of it. A must read for anyone involved in scientific research."

Understanding the structure of DNA is especially important in the era of genetics, but this book also gives insight into the people behind the science, which is all too often overlooked.An aside: I literally ran into Watson when I came barreling around a corner with my arms full of books and papers. He helped me pick it all up before continuing on his way."

30,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15739346-vicki-doronina,3,"Is it just me, or are there not many well-written scientific memoirs around? Even the words “scientific memoir” brings up an image of a long and boring book. There are a lot of good books written about scientists, but not by scientists. Maybe it’s because the scientists are trained to write logically, objectively and dispassionately: this approach results in good papers and science books, but not a compelling “after hours” reading.“The Double Helix” by James Watson of Watson-Crick fame is a scientific memoir with a difference. Watson describes the period before and after the famous Letter to Nature paper about a possible structure of DNA, not scrimping on the details and being quite frank. The picture that emerges from the book paints Watson as a generator of (mostly incorrect) ideas with an aversion to experimental science and an interest in au pair girls – not what I expected from one of the most famous biologists of the 20th century.And if we are to believe the book, Watson’s collaborator and cheese to his chalk Crick did what any PhD student is advised not to do – instead of concentrating on working on his PhD calculating atom positions in haemoglobin (no computers or even calculators then), solving the structure which would later bring his thesis supervisor a Nobel Prize, he put his know-how into fleshing out Watson’s ideas about DNA structure.However, “The Double Helix” is not only a story about one of the biggest discoveries of the 20th century, but also an account of one of the major scientific controversies as well. The picture of DNA diffraction pattern used in the Nature paper was obtained by Rosalind Franklin and shown to Watson and Crick by Franklin’s colleague Maurice Wilkins, who later shared the Nobel prize with Watson and Crick – Franklin was dead by then from cancer caused by X-ray exposure, and the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously. Watson’s unsympathetic description of Franklin in “The Double Helix” caused Harvard University Press, the intended publisher, to cancel its publication, and Watson later admitted that he may have misrepresented Franklin in the book.But controversies notwithstanding, “The Double Helix” remains an engaging introduction to of the golden era of molecular biology. It also has a less well-known and, in my opinion, less interesting sequel “What a Mad Pursuit”."
31,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6126081-04victorias,1,"Who on earth would want to read an entire book about genetics and DNA? I certinly wouldn't, but I did because I had to for my grade in Biology. This book was very boring and confusing. There definately was a lot of information that might interest scientist or people studying that subject. Informative books are very great resources for research though. If you are researching stuff about DNA or genetics this would be a great book for you.James D. Watson was the main character in the book. There were a lot of famous scientist in this book. For example: Rosalind Franklin, Maurice Wilkins, etc. All these people contributed to the discovery of DNA. Together they won the Nobel Prize. The discovery of DNA is a long process; they tried so many different ways and expierments. They built many models to help them undestand and check their research. Finally they somehow figured it all out and DNA was discovered and understood. They got the name of the book The Double Helix because that was the shape of DNA; which is a double spiral. If I was to recommend this book to anyone, it would be someone who enjoys to learn about DNA, a scientist studying DNA, or a student needing a book for a term project about DNA. This book is very hard to understand, but if you just read it slowly and throughly you will make sense of it. There are a lot of big words in this book so another technique to use would be to ahve a dictionary to look up the word that you do not understand.In conclusion, The Double Helix was a book that I would never choose to read, but I'm glad I did. This book helped me understand how DNA was discovered. It is a very detailed book and I encourage you to read it if you are looking for a challenge. Good luck to all you decide to read it, enjoy!"
32,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2969156-trice,4,"Upon finishing:That was an interesting and an entertaining read. Glad to put aside claims of misogyny - I was doubtful of some readers' claims re: Watson's attitude toward Rosy because it seemed he just found her obnoxious, completely independent of any gender question. The last couple chapters of the book, in addition to his brief eulogy for her at the end, seem to affirm this opinion - while he does come to view her in more positive terms, it is because of how all the science works out and the newfound respect and understanding that he and Crick both seemed to have reached with and of her, when all sides finally understood that each was all about the science and not, as previously thought, simply consumed with being lazy or obstinate. I'm wishing we could have read this in and/or around the organic chem and genetics classes from my college days - would have been the more fascinating because I might actually remember some of the details he mentions in passing. So much tickles my memory without recalling the details that would reveal. The book has a lot of subdued tension in the (in one sense) casual race scientists in 3 labs around the world were engaged in, in pursuing the structure of DNA. I would love to read about how they proceeded to discover conclusive evidence of how DNA replicates and of how this is foundational, indeed, and as suspected, to all life.Midway:we interrupt our reading updates for this take on DNA and RNA by the Amoeba Sisters"

I wasn't sure whether or not it would be hard to understand, but there was very little about the technical aspects of Watson & Crick's discovery of DNA's form. The book is a very quick read and I thought, very exciting. :) The book is written as a scientific memoir about how Watson & Crick made their Nobel Prize-winning discovery.This book would be great for people thinking of entering scientific fields who aren't sure they've got what it takes to make it. Very encouraging! Watson's self-effacing style brings a human element to the race for discovery.

When Crick and Wilkins were approached with this novel before publication, they claimed that it was ""In bad taste"" and put everyone in a bad light besides Watson. I stand by this criticism especially in regards to his character Rosy/Rosalind Franklin. Franklin was a sophisticated, beautiful, and brilliant scientist who literally had her work stolen from her and has never received due credit. She died from cancer a decade before this books publication and is unable to defend the horrible image drawn by Watson."

Watson is a product of his time in his suggestions that women are too emotional and then not emotional enough. Yet, he is hysterical. This retelling of how the structure of DNA was discovered is a rare and genuine glimpse into the entire process of science-- from the social interactions, to the hard science, and through to the politics of competition. FANTASTIC read! "
41,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931387-dan,2,"An interesting science story wrapped in a pissing contest. Watson's insistence that he was writing about how he felt at the time and his brief paragraph praising his colleague Rosilind Franklin in the epilogue don't make up for his portrayal of her in the book proper.

Watson left me with an open jaw.  This book is full of gossip, backstabbing, deep unappreciation, and yeah misogyny. ""It was all too clear that the presence of popsies does not inevitably lead to a scientific future."" When Watson started his book with ""Thus many of the comments may seem one-sided and unfair"" you know you are getting yourself in some kind of juicy gossip!I cannot write the review without mentioning how much I was disappointed by the way Rosalind Franklin was mentioned in this book, in my opinion, it was simply disrespectful. ""By choice she did not emphasize her feminine qualities. Though her features were strong,she was not unattractive and might have been quite stunning  had she taken even a mild interest in clothes"" ""Also, there was no denying she had a good brain. If she could only keep her emotions under control, there would be a good chance that she could really help him""""But at least Pauling was six thousand miles away, and even Francis was separated by a two-hour rail journey.

It was unbelievably damp and heated only by an aged electric heater. Nonetheless, I eagerly accepted the offer. Though it looked like an open invitation to tuberculosis, living with friends was infinitely preferable to any other digs I might find at this late moment.""--Talking about his sister "" Furthermore, if Maurice really liked my sister, it was inevitable that I would become closely associated with his X-ray work on DNA.""""Though my sister was upset when she saw me, I knew that months, if not years, might berequired to replace her superficial values with those of the English intellectual. Carradale thus was the perfect environment to go one step further and acquire a beard.

Moreover, he remained unconvinced that Crick was needed. Already for thirty-five years, he had not stopped talking and almost nothing of fundamental value had emerged.""""Though a few dissidents still thought he was a laughing talking-machine, he nonetheless saw problems through to the finish line.""--Talking about Crick and Odile's relationship ""At no moment did Francis see any point in trying tosimplify the matter for Odile’s benefit. Ever since she had told him that gravity went only three miles into the sky, this aspect of their relationship was set. Not only did she not know any science, but any attempt to put some in her head would be a losing fight against the years of her convent upbringing. The most to hope for was an appreciation of the linear way in which money was measured.""I think I should end this review, I think what annoyed me the most is the fact that Watson admitted that he used Rosalind's data without her knowledge and that she never got the Nobel prize for her contribution ""Rosy, of course, did not directly give us her data.

Watson's honesty in admitting his laziness in certain areas of science...yet he had a vision and drive to be one of the scientists to discover the secret to life. He obviously wrote and worked in the science field at a time when women were not as respected. In the epilogue he did apologize for his attitude towards Rosalind Franklin who did much work on decoding DNA at the same time he and Crick worked out the problem. I have read several reviews that felt like he was quite sexist, and I certainly have to agree that he was at times. I found it fascinating how various scientists in different parts of the world were racing to figure out the coding of DNA, yet they also seemed to work in a such a way where they held back if they felt someone else had already begun work in a particular area. At least in England.I definitely felt like there were parts of the book that were way over my head, but I was comforted by the fact that even Watson felt the same in reading several of his colleague's papers. Overall, I enjoyed the book, but I think I kept pushing on in parts because it was a book club book-although I felt like it was written in a way that was interesting to those who do not have a science background. "
45,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63366285-anne,4,"Watson doesn’t use flowery language or attempt many literary devices and I’m so grateful for that. This story is told plainly, letting the excitement of the research speak for itself. The climax occurs a bit slowly and ends the book abruptly. It’s as if he’s telling someone the story over lunch. Because he is so straightforward, it allows you to focus on the experience itself - I found myself wondering again and again what it must feel like to find out something that in a few years is taken for granted worldwide. It was a mental exercise to strive to put myself in a place where I DIDN’T know the structure of DNA. Like when you imagine a place before you see it, after you see it it’s hard to remember how you used to imagine it. The mental working backwards like that for me reading it (as he also was working backwards in a way writing it - *after* his discovery) was really exciting. I also loved that he gave such good credit to the others working on the problem of DNA, and particularly that he includes such a respectful and changed perspective on Rosalind Franklin and the challenges she faced as a female scientist among them (acknowledged publicly after her death, unfortunately). This is a fast read that mimics in structure and payoff the elegant simplicity of the structure of DNA itself. “...the structure was too pretty not to be true.” :] "
46,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79820234-shortjg,4,"The amazing first hand story of the discovery of DNA structure takes you back to another time and place, Cambridge, England 1952. James Watson’s account reads more like a diary than a scientific treatise. He intersperses stories of his scientific progress with descriptions of the social scene of the day. The result is sometimes dated with awkward juxtapositions. “My first X-ray pictures revealed, not unexpectedly, much less detail than was found in the published pictures. Over a month was required before I could get even halfway presentable pictures. They were still a long way, though, from being good enough to spot a helix. The only real fun during February came from a costume party given by Geoffrey Roughton at his parents’ home on Adams Road.” But, In the end, Watson captures the personalities of the important contributors, the necessity of collaboration, and the sometimes messy way that science marches forward. The reader is left with a feeling of excitement and joy that comes with discovery. "

It's also a lot of fun to read, because Watson has a keen, sharp way of writing that reads almost as a fast paced novel instead of an autobiographical account of a hugely important scientific discovery. I think this would be a great work for non-scientists to read, as it shows how science is done, building off the work of others, and that even Nobel Laureates aren't universal experts in their own field. It was amusing to read Watson relay his ignorance of various aspects of chemistry and biology, even aspects that were vital to his discovery. Science is very much like this, requiring the best combined efforts of everyone interested in a project in order to cover all weaknesses."

Not the most easy-to-understand book that I've read because you would need a background in chemistry to understand what's going on. Even Einstein's General Theory of Relativity was easier to comprehend. However you can definitely relate to the urgency and competitiveness between the scientists as they race to determine the structure of DNA, the basic building block of life."

The epilogue contained a brief almost-apology to Rosalind Franklin, but it fell short for making up for his earlier disregard for her opinions and work, not to mention the numerous other women who seemed almost unimportant to him (depending on their attractiveness).I wish he would have stayed focused on the science. While this serves to show more about the culture of the time and the challenges women still face in research, I lost respect for the scientists involved (not due to their discovery, but due to their attitudes toward their peers and apparent unwillingness to change). So five stars for the science, one star for the attitudes. "

There is little to no introduction if you have no previous knowledge about DNA, the part about biology is little, but very specific. The story beats are there, but quite tame -- real life is usually quite tame :) -- and it's mostly about girls and holidays.The surrounding material is nice to anchor story in the historical and scientific events, and correct some misguided elements from the book.

I wanted to punch him in the face several times. Even thought the story itself is important. Surely they could have re-written the new versions to get rid of this and just keep what is actually relevant...

Watson is a story about himself that actually happened in the which he and his partner, Francis Crick, were able to find the chemical bonding of DNA and the overall structure of the code of life. This story is the story of how they slaved over the DNA molecule until they finally could make a model that well explained the structure of the DNA molecule. They received a Nobel prize for their efforts and both wrote a book recollecting what had happened. The Double Helix is a good book because it is not 100 percent science, it is very behaviorally interesting, and it grabs and takes your attention from the first few pages, although sometimes I disliked it because it was a little over my head in scientific matters. I liked reading this book most of the time,though. James Watson starts off his book in the first few pages by saying ""One could not be a successful scientist without realizing that . . . a goodly number of scientists are . . . narrowminded . . . dull. . . [and] just plain stupid."" He then goes on to tell how Francis Crick and he met and became lab partners who found that they were both interested in the structure of DNA. At this time, everyone wanted to be the first one to find out the structure of DNA because of the fame and rewards it would bring. With some help from Maurice Wilkins, a scientist their elder, and his assistant Rosy, they were able to discover that DNA was a double helix with bases on the inside and sugars and phosphate groups as the molecules that held the base ""rungs"" together. After their discovery was proven right by other scientists, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins all received the Nobel prize. This almost autobiography about the discovery of the structure of DNA is fascinating and spellbinding, and I enjoyed reading it. There were very few things about this book that I didn't like, although they are existent. A reason that made the book harder to read was how you understand the science. The times when James Watson makes an observation about a certain molecule in DNA, you want to know more about it because it is driving you crazy to know how he arrived at the solution that he did. For example, when he talks about the number of hydrogen atoms in a certain molecule and how they can be ""fudged"" somewhere else, I get that he knew that and how it works, but I don't know how it works, and I don't want him to explain it to me. Another small reason that made this book more difficult to read was that there were so many places and people to keep in line. There were a lot of scientists that Watson and Crick worked with from a lot of different places. Sometimes, the book could be slightly confusing, but I liked it overall. There are many things that I liked about this book, but to name a few: the ease on science, the anticipation, and the way that people interact with each other in this book. First, I like that the book wasn't all about science, it was about the people who made the science. You don't have to wade through difficult theorems and postulates to know what is going on, and sometimes, it is just plain funny how people react in this book, like the way everyone thinks that James Watson has the weirdest American hairdo, just because he likes it that way. Another thing that I liked about this book was that you knew that they were going to win at the end, but all through the book, you are wondering how they did it. Sometimes it seems like they are so close, you just want to tell them what it is. I also liked the way that the people interacted in this book. This is not a book about a bunch of dull scientists mumbling furiously about the structure of a deoxyribose, this about many colorful and unique personalities that all helped in making the discovery of the structure of DNA possible. For exapmle, take Francis Crick, an overexcited lab-nut who wants to tell everyone about how great or bad a certain theory might be, or Rosy, a stubborn loner X-ray diffraction scientist who wants to find the structure of DNA entirely though X-rays. They are all very different and unique, making this a fun book, not a science textbook. Overall, I give this book a good rating of four stars because, even though it may be slightly confusing at times, it was very well written and was made about people instead of science. Anyone can read a science textbook and say that it was boring, but it's hard to read this book and say that it was boring. It is very intricate and well crafted, a book deserving 2 thumbs up. I liked the human characteristics of this book and how they interacted, although I did not like the complex science sometimes involved and all the people that you had to remember. This book is a very good book that I recommend you read."

The book was beautifully written, in an easy-following narrative. But I remember how Watson in this book left an awfully bad impression on me. I think it has to do with something he said about women or Dr. Rosalind Franklin, or probably something about race and as 17-year-old brown person it made me feel uncomfortable. "
60,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12995319-laura-degenhardt,5,"I have to give this account of the discovery of the structure of DNA maximum rating: as gripping as an account can be of one of the greatest scientific discoveries of the Twentieth Century. This is an accessible read for the layperson (me); with fascinating insights into the eccentric personalities of the international physics community of the 1950s and 60s, and the two youngsters at Cambridge University who won the Nobel Prize for their discovery. This account is also infamous for Watson's treatment of fellow researcher Rosalind Franklin that shades from eccentricity to outright unacceptability: comments about her appearance and attractiveness dominate over any real consideration of her contribution to scientific discovery. Even the postscript, I suspect requested by the publisher of the original edition for appearance sake, does little to address what can only be seen as a blatant and disappointing case of male chauvenism that can be understood as typical of the scientific community and Cambridge not that long ago."
61,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84826805-aiman-adlawan,4,Wonderful account of James Watson's journey to his discovery of the DNA. It's like reading his journal way back when he was still in his mid twenties. All the blunt conversations and reactions of one fellow scientist's theory and another fellow's interpretations. Great story. Not too scientific but a little bit feminist knowing this was in the 50's which was probably just normal.

64,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1627591-robert,4,"Martin Amis or Evelyn Waugh might have written The Double Helix, but no, James Watson, co-discoverer of the structure of DNA wrote it, an entertaining, witty, bold series of swipes at himself, at his scientific partner, Francis Crick, and a long list of renowned researchers racing to discover ""the secret of life"" in the early 1950s.This is a fun book that probably isn't fair to anyone but reflects a young man's joyous arrogance, sharp tongue, and almost casual brilliance. Watson first receives a post-doc fellowship to Denmark, can't get any traction there, doesn't understand a lot about what he's supposed to have mastered, and sneaks over to Cambridge where is he is one of the few scientists in the Cavendish laboratory who can bear Francis Crick's laugh, rapid-fire talk and instant theorizing about almost anything. The two of them are a pair of untamed rascals who only behave when they're forced to behave. Neither of them wants to master the math or experimental techniques needed to advance their research, but they barrel along, find themselves in a competition with the scientific giant, Linus Pauling, and crack the code by what I would call ""if this, then that..."" reasoning, not always getting the ""if this"" part right and therefore not always getting the ""then that"" part right.""The Double Helix"" has been around a long time. Don't know why I haven't read it before. Probably because I never anticipated Watson's gift for characterization, skill in mixing inconsequential details with complex scientific facts, and willingness to expose himself as a bungling, fugitive American trying to fit into the staid ranks of British science.The best thing about the book is that Watson isn't trying to write a satire. He's just spilling a lot of beans."
65,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5069314,5,"James Watson’s style of writing flows such that this book reads more like a novel than an account of one of the very greatest discoveries in the biological sciences. He bares to his reader the frailties of individual human nature in addition to his passionate description of the sheer excitement of the final discovery which is only now beginning to really be exploited, in our twenty-first century.Watson’s humility shines throughout; not that he was adverse to taking an advantage when an opportunity arose! Life’s like that. In this book he succeeds in communicating with skill and unerring accuracy the sense of how easy a solution appears to be after it has been found; but how obtuse, opaque, and obscure the solution/s is/are when as yet unsolved, and why, overall, though it may not be recognised at the time, it is a great asset to have persons of different background, expertise and temperaments working (together or apart) on a problem.The Forward to this book contributed by Sir Lawrence Bragg’s acts as a timely reminder to the reader that although a scientist, or team of scientists, may be credited with a great discovery and Nobel prizes galore; the success of their work is always built upon the discoveries of others; in this case X-ray crystallography (for which Lawrence Bragg and his father were each awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1915 – 47 years before Nobel recognition (in Medicine, 1962) was made for the discovery of the structure of DNA.No child should be allowed to leave school without reading this gripping, emotionally engaging and intellectually satisfying book; and I heartily also recommend it to every adult who has not yet read it. Those who are not yet good readers might like to first watch the 1988 British Broadcasting Corporation ‘Horizon’ production called “Life Story”, starring starred Jeff Goldblum, Juliet Stevenson, Tim Piggot-Smith and Alan Howard."
66,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1771751-troy,3,"My one-line rundown: anyone who thinks the scientific process is a dry affair, barren of drama, silliness, oddity or personality, should read this book.I started trying to keep up with the great quotes from this book, but eventually gave up; there are too many. Take the opening salvo of the first chapter: 'I have never seen Francis Crick in a modest mood.' Or Watson's contention, as a 24 year-old graduate student, that 'in contrast to the popular conception supported by newspapers and mothers of scientists, a goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid.' Watson details a number of ridiculous sub-plots throughout the book, including forays into the sex life of bacteria, his attempt to set his sister up with Maurice Wilkins (to both keep her away from some 'mental defectives' and secure himself a direct line to Maurice's X-ray work on DNA), and deals made with disinterested lab supervisors which made it possible for him to live and work outside the institution required by his fellowship. Add I love the idea of cutting edge 1950s biochemistry revolving around people manipulating plaster-and-wire models.I have utterly no interest in biochemistry generally, and even less in trying to understand the specific details of the X-ray crystallography technology from a half-century ago. I just enjoyed reading Watson's sardonic references to 'dressing for dinner', girls, and the necessity of growing his hair into a wild mop to avoid being mistaken for those other local Americans - Air Force personnel. It helps me remember that, while this discovery was arguably the most important contribution to genetics since Mendel, the scientific endeavor is rarely if ever free from that entertaining and most fallible entity: humanity."
67,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/871468-andrewcharles420,4,"This was a strange edition of a book (any book) to read. In addition to the main text is a lot of mostly critical commentary about the book and its popular reception; also there were some original references, for those more concerned with the details of scientific history (I read 2 of the 6 academic papers included but then (like most academic papers) skimmed the rest).I thoroughly enjoyed the main text! I thought Watson did a wonderful job of describing life as a lowly researcher in a big institution, the politics and mentalities in academia, and the weird interplay of life (food, sex, movies, travel) in what is otherwise a daily 24-hour devotion. There are many times where the author comes across as an arrogant jerk (and his treatment of his only female colleague: appalling), but overall the balance is almost charming. Of course he's quite brusque, but his disdain is spread evenly about (and frequently on the mark) and his advancement along his quest is brilliant. I didn't find much value in the editor's notes and introductions, but I enjoyed most of the pieces included in the collection. The commentaries were widely varying in their opinion of Watson's account (and personality) but by and large they offered valuable and insightful comments on all aspects of the event: the scientific discovery, the scientific process, academia, the literary accomplishment of this scientific memoir, the personal character of Watson, etc. Overall a fascinating and strange thing to read!"
68,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5883693-andy,3,"Learned some new things in this book:1. How X-ray crystallography was used to help understand the structure of DNA, using Fourier transforms to find length measurements of the major structures and the orientation of the structures.2. Why guanine and cystosine, and adenine and thymine are associated with each other on the ""rungs"" of the ladder staircase. In a nutshell it provides a length that is roughly 3 benzene rings long and the connections between the two amino acids rely on 3 Nitrogen atoms and 1 Oxygen atom. It's illustrated in a figure in the book and it provided me a lot of insight to why that is. I had known about the association but hadn't known the why of it.3. Watson really was a jerk when describing Rosalind Franklin. There's a non-apology in the epilogue of the book that I suspect was not actually written by him, and I think was inserted into later editions of the book. I had also heard about this, but had never read the book in its entirety to see what his characterization was like.Interesting to see the process of doing science and his perspective on it. There's an account of having to hunt through bookstores looking for a copy of Linus Pauling's book on chemistry. Nowadays the internet is at your fingertips. Brings to mind having to search for information in the math library and hunting for books at other university librarys (I went to Temple, University of PA, Princeton) trying to hunt down information and reference sources for my master's paper back when the internet was kind of new."
69,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28000751-arimo,3,"The Double Helix is James D. Watson's memoir of the events that lead to his and Francis Krick's discovery of DNA's double helix structure. It's a very quick read that I finished in two days.The book itself is very short and straightforward. Watson gives colorful descriptions of his peers and writes about his daily struggles with chemistry, stomach aches, balding and other mundane things. Some (okay, most) of the scientific stuff went over my head, but the books is mostly easy to follow. However, there are lots of people involved in the events, so it's sometimes difficult to remember who everybody is.As a reading experience, The Double Helix is an entertaining little book, not much more. However, the book's main value lies in its historical significance. Discovering the double helix was one of the most significant scientific events of the 20th century. The Double Helix is like a small anecdote or footnote on the pages of history, showing what events lead to the correct solution.Perhaps more importantly, The Double Helix changed the way public saw science and scientists. The Double Helix showed how ordinary people researches could be, and how science may be thrust forward by very humane goals and behaviour. Being probably the first book of its kind, the Double Helix added a new level to popular scientific discourse."
70,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99666-audrey,3,"Watson's story is readable for the layperson, although I won't pretend I understood a lot of the science. I enjoyed the way Watson portrayed science like a creative endeavor: a stop-and-start business with a lot of false turnings and sudden inspirations. Watson explains all of it thoroughly, although perhaps overestimating how conversant a layperson is with biochemistry. I didn't expect Watson to focus so much on the personalities of the scientists involved, and how their personal dynamics affected their work. There's a lot about internal politics of Cambridge, rubbing elbows with the right people at conferences and, especially egregious, a lot of mean-spirited contempt towards the one woman working in the milieu, Rosalind Franklyn. Watson spends the entire book putting her down for being by turns unfeminine and emotional, and being afraid of her criticism. In the last chapter he does a 180 when they become friendly, and then it's practically a paean to her ""personal honesty and generosity."" Of course, since this is the 50's, you might expect this attitude, but given that women (and people of color) face similar obstacles today in science fields, I'm not inclined to give it a pass. "
71,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1687252-eric,5,"In this book James D. Watson chronicles the discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA along with Francis Crick, Rosalind Franklin, and Maurice Wilkins. It is a fascinating first-person account of what Watson was experiencing as it occurred, and includes his thoughts as he reflects back on the events and the people he misjudged at the time. The reader encounters such scientific giants as Linus Pauling, and is given a real feel for how Watson and Crick's thinking process occurred as they developed their model. You are given a real sense for the rivalries and other, usually unspoken, human sensibilities that underly even the greatest scientific discoveries. I honestly would recommend this book to almost anyone. It is a fascinating read from a historical, social, or scientific perspective. And it goes a long way toward knocking even our greatest scientific heroes off their pedestals and helping one to realize how their concerns, problems, and impressions are all too human. "
72,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1653168-larry,5,"This self promoting story of the conceptual breakthru that led to the discovery of the composition and structure of the DNA molecule has been in publication for over 50 years which attests to Watson's skill as a story teller. It does accomplish the goal of describing the agonizing task of unraveling the mystery and to that end is a darn good detective story. It also explains the science in terms understandable to us lay people but it only hints at the true magic of the discovery, the sequencing of the atoms, their ability to unzip, as it were, and to replicate some or all of their code. But that would come later largely from the intellectual curiosity of his partner Francis Crick. The discovery itself had a number of fathers and at least one critically important mother, who is mentioned on occassion. But the history has come down to us as a partnership of Watson and Crick largely because of this book. Like Darwin's first book the science of this book has changed our view of all life and our position therein."

James goes to the Cavendish lab to look at the molecular structore of proeins. he began his work by building 3-d models. he met a scientist named Crick. They were both interested in researching DNA. They had troubles seeing the DNA, because they cannot see weel through the microscope. They seek someone who specializes in crystallography so they can discover the DNA structure.I find Watson to be a very interesting scientist/ author. I liked how he wrote the book so people with simple minds could have an understanding. I recommend this to any student seeking an easier understanding, and perspective of DNA. "

Watson's style is easy to read, though there are portions which exhibit some science that most people will not understand, one should just gloss over them and continue on with the fast paced narrative. The history of the race for this discovery built in tension as the story progressed and the credit that Watson gives to all of the other individuals who assisted in some way is encouraging and thoughtful. His writing style is honest and trustworthy. At the outset he readily indicates that this is just his interpretation of events and that others would surely agree and disagree on many points. Though a peripheral character, the reader is given further insight into the nature and character of Linus Pauling, one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century. My favorite part, however, comes in the epilogue when Watson eulogizes Rosalind Franklin by giving her the credit and understanding she deserved being a woman in a male dominated scientific world during the mid 20th century."

I enjoyed the perspective and did find the final chapters engaging as the final pieces of the DNA puzzle were discovered. The book as a whole, however, was quite difficult to get through with feigned interest. Watson recounts the experience by pulling from personal letters and his journal, and it is quite obvious to the reader throughout. The writing style and quality is subpar, and he certainly focuses on aspects of the experience that I doubt many readers care about.The book itself is not horrible, and this first hand account certainly carries value, but it isn't something I would recommend to anyone other than those with a very keen desire to understand the discovery of the structure of DNA.

Written in a light, easy, and amusing style, it concentrates on Watson's own role and that of Crick, but does not fail to acknowledge the contributions of others. I particularly liked the fact that the forward was written by Bragg, who does not escape being made fun of in the book - the Professor clearly had the ability to laugh at himself.This is probably not the book to read for a thorough and scholarly account of all the main strands (ho ho) in this scientific discovery. But it more than makes up for that by providing such a fresh and exciting read. It also has the merit of being very short - an enjoyable way of spending an afternoon but then you'll have to find another amusement!"

This well-crafted narrative by James Watson, the co-discoverer of DNA along with Francis Crick, is perhaps one of the earliest modern demonstrations of this fact. Anyone who has done active research in any scientific discipline would read it as a well familiar account of aspirations, struggles, frustrations, hopes, fears and competitions; most importantly, competition to imagine and translate imaginations into experiments that can reject those imaginations or build upon them. Watson doesnt hide his sexism, and undertones of those early traces of racism of which he has been accused even recently can be seen scattered all over the story. I wont be cruel to deduct a star for these personal proclivities which are an essential part of this narrative."

Told through the eyes of a wide-eyed 20-something James Watson, The Double Helix makes scientific discovery feel like a high-speed chase. The race against Linus Pauling, the tension with Rosalind Franklin, coincidences and bursts of theoretical inspiration. All at a frenetic, whirlwind pace in just over 200 pages, including loads of photographs, diagrams and scanned images of notes scribbled on scrap paper that would change biology forever. This book has completely changed the way I think about the world of scientific research, and the esoteric world in which university scientists work. It's also just simple voyeuristic fun to get a front-row seat to one of the most important biological discoveries in the modern era."

It is an interesting illustration of the process of scientific discovery that I have experienced first hand in my work. There are a lot of conversations and back-and-forth ideas that lead to insights. In this environment, one or a few people finally get everything together, but the success wouldn't have been possible without many others. When Isaac Newton gave his famous quote ""If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."" He wasn't just being humble, he was acknowledging this vital interplay with both contemporary and past experts. "

Watson, for what he couldn't ignore for long; he did not give enough credits for the discovery of DNA helix construction to Rosalind Franklin BUT his language is far from a sorry, misogynic, degrading and the grateful letter and thank you's at the end of the book is not helping either. this is not changing the fact this book is a must-read and the neatly recorded time-line of the events is really mind-opening."

But James Watson was lazy, rude, and misogynistic, and it comes across clearly in his writing. The last line of the book was literally about him not wanting to date long haired girls??? Which had nothing to do with anything??I give James Watson zero stars, BUT I give the book 3 stars (maybe 2.5) because of the dramatic irony. Knowing everything we know about DNA today, it’s fun watching the founders of the theory put all the pieces together, and all the bad ideas that led to the good ones.Overall, It’s an easy, short read.

They were in a race with Linus Pauling and engaged in some scientific skullduggery to lunch off Rosalind Franklin's research. The latter might have been forgiven but for the fact that neither mentioned a word about her in thei Nobel Prize acceptance speeches. They explain the status of knowledge in this field at the time they began their work, how this evolved, the politics of getting money for the lab and the personalities of the people they dealt with.

I recall that the 2001 edition included a re-examination and fairer view of her contribution.BTW, Franklin was thrilled when the problem of DNA was solved and never complained about getting enough credit.

112,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29588908-kelley,3,"I was never in my depth with the science in this book. Not once. But Watson so powerfully captures the humanity of what was going on in the months leading up to the discovery of the structure of DNA that I was swept up in the story even as its facts flew over my head.Here’s what I mean “… we only wished to establish that at least one specific two-chain complementary helix was stereochemically possible. Until this was clear, the objection could be raised that, although our idea was aesthetically elegant, the shape of the sugar-phosphate backbone might not permit its existence. Happily, now we knew that this was not true, and so we had lunch, telling each other that a structure this pretty just had to exist.”My eyes filled with tears near the end as one collaborator after another looked at the model, checked the math, reviewed the chemistry and confirmed what he and his partners had done. I felt the magnitude of it.Watson was one of three scientists awarded the Nobel Prize for the discovery. He was 25 in 1953 when the structure was announced to the scientific world. This memoir was published about 15 years later, but it breathes the life of the younger man, from every boarding house or pub lunch to the breaks from chemical bonds to attend a party that was sure to attract all the international au pairs. Early in the book he takes science off its pedestal and sets it firmly on the ground. “One could not be a successful scientist without realizing that, in contrast to the popular conception supported by newspapers and mothers of scientists, a goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid.”And I was comforted as he read some early findings from another American working on the same problem. “Most of the language was above me, and so I could only get a general impression of his argument. I had no way of judging whether it made sense. The only thing I was sure of was that it was written with style.”He speaks often of the beauty he anticipated in the structure. It would never have occurred to me to describe it that way. I was fascinated, too, that the work was split between theory and equations and the literal, physical construction of the proposed structure. I could picture him – short American hair grown out into a floppy, European look – bent over the metal discs and spheres, manipulating one way, then another, determined to find the position that would hold them all in perfect order.He also speaks of a kind of meditation that bordered on obsession. It would distract him from girls, meals and sleep. Even moments not actively devoted to the question ended up feeding it: “I went ahead spending most evenings at the films, vaguely dreaming that any moment the answer would suddenly hit me.”At some point, I started noting the specific fields involved in (and impacted by) this discovery. Biology and math and genetics I could have anticipated, but then I wrote down specialties such as quantum mechanics, nucleic-acid biochemistry, and theoretical structural chemistry.To me, Watson’s account feels generously inclusive, naming scientist after scientist who contributed an answer to a question or a piece of research. He states in the beginning, in fact, that he would personally credit the discovery to five people, not just the three who received the prize. I’ve learned not everyone shares my opinion of his inclusiveness – and he seems to almost anticipate that in his opening words, acknowledging that any process over such a long time, involving so many people and so much work, is bound to be reported differently from various perspectives. I’m not qualified to give the definitive word, but I didn’t walk away feeling that he’d done this single-handedly or even with only the help of his fellow prize-winners.Don’t get bogged down by the paragraphs you don’t understand. I tried to reread them and despaired. You can appreciate the pursuit and the feat without grasping the details. I did."
113,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58444614-jenna,0,"A Scientist and A Writer	The Double Helix by James Watson is a well-written, informative autobiography about the lifelong workings of scientist James Watson and his partner, Francis Crick, in discovering the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid — more commonly known as DNA. James Watson’s and Francis Crick’s discovery was revolutionary to the scientific community. By discovering the double helix nature of all DNA molecules, it provided a gateway into further learning and understanding a myriad of important biological process such DNA replication, RNA replication, and protein production. In addition, the discovery allowed for an increase in understanding about the behavior of virus and infections. As a result, through research and development, scientists are able to create antibiotics and antiviral injections to improve human life. Therefore, Watson and Crick’s one discovery created a pathway for many discoveries. 	In cell biology, the central focus is DNA as everything always stems back to one’s DNA. Even though Watson is credited to for his work on discovering the DNA, his name is mentioned for a minute or two. Intrigued to learn more about his experiments, I decided to read his autobiography. After reading the book, James Watson does more than just recount the facts leading to the discovery. Through the use of his first-person narrator, he tells personal stories of the people he encountered and collaborated with. He shows the frustration and tedious work within all his trials. His thoughts and reasoning behind certain observations were made. Thus, as a reader, I was able to engage in the book and feel angry when Watson was angry or excited when an experiment had promising results. Additionally, it highlighted a major theme of success and failure. Every time, Watson and Crick endured a setback, they preserved until they reached a success. This concept of perseverance and success is important to young adults as they enter a world where failures and setbacks are inevitable. Overall, his autobiography was not a book filled with scientific jargon. Instead, it was a story with an actual plot, which made it more interesting. 	However, although the main focus of The Double Helix is about one of the greatest scientific discoveries, it also talks about a major scientific controversy. Watson talks about four people that helped him: Maurice Wilkins, Linus Pauling, Francis Crick, and Rosalind Franklin. In the 20th century, Rosalind Franklin was one of the few women working in a male-dominated field. It was her work with an x-ray cryptography that lead Watson and Crick to deduce a final conclusion. Without her knowing, Maurice Wilkins sent Watson and Crick the picture of Rosalind Franklin’s DNA x-ray, which clearly shows the double nature and overall structure of a DNA molecule. Therefore, Watson and Crick quickly learned that their prior structure was wrong. If it wasn’t for Rosalind Franklin, the two scientists would not have gotten the Nobel Prize, which excludes Franklin’s name. In his book, Watson unsympathetically describes Rosalind Frank, saying that “clearly Rosy had to go or be put in her place” when she would not give him what he wanted. In addition, because Rosalind Franklin was the only girl at that time, Watson and his colleagues made fun of her by calling her Rosy, which was demeaning. Watson carries this nickname into his book, thus showing the stereotypical behavior Rosalind endured. During this chapter of the book, the major theme of stereotyping against women in science in the 20th century was highlighted Overall, I would highly recommend this book who is fascinated by the subject of biology. Not only does it explain the science behind one of the greatest scientific discoveries of all time, it tells a story; one that is characterized by failures, successes, and stereotyping."
114,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92553179-faatihah-nayeem,2,"	As one of the most famous contributors to the biological sciences, you cannot read one biology textbook without learning about the Watson and Crick model. But, we don’t get the full story of how James Watson and Watson Crick determined the structure of DNA. Through their many tumults and endeavors, and even with the help of Rosalind Franklin’s X-ray diffraction of DNA to which she wasn’t given enough credit to, they eventually solved the mystery that codes all life.	The Double Helix is written and told through the eyes of American scientist James Watson where we get his perspective of his personal recollection of the discovery of the structure of DNA. He basically explains his journey from a little bit before his arrive in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1953, through his journey in collaboration with Francis Crick, to eventually the validation of their famous Watson and Crick model in 1953 where Watson, Crick, and another scientist named maurice Wilkins received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1962.	The book is structured and organized into Walston’s account from the intertwinement of letters and memories that reflect his thoughts. Watson chronologically shows the reader the process of how the structure of DNA was discovered and his partner relationship with Crick. He shows how science is discovered and studied through a human perspective instead of only from a factual standpoint. In fact, the terminology used in the book as well as the scientific comparisons are thoroughly explained and put into simpler terms for every audience to understand. Watson’s narrative illustrates how the science discoveries and long periods of research affect personal life. In fact, there are often shifts between the information of how each piece of the puzzle relates to the structure of DNA and the social/background lives of researchers.	Even though Watson mentioned some contributions from other scientists and their backgrounds, I felt as if he didn’t focus on how they were heavily involved. When it comes to these tremendous discoveries of science, we often see competition and separation which is exactly what the book shows. Although there were many characters working on this project, after it's DNA structure verification, Watson only emphasized himself and Cric as well as Wilkins. I was deeply disappointed how little he mentioned of Rosalind Franklin whose x-ray diffraction picture of the double helix was the major catalyst for the final determination of DNA’s structure. He often made sexist and controversial comments about her which I didn't like at all, discrediting her major contribution to science for she didn't receive a Nobel Prize. He often paints her as uncooperative and sour. This led me to kind of decreasingly like the book. Watson’s ego and arrogance shined through and his tone became proud.	Watson did successfully ensnare the reader into the dramatic events that led up to the discovery of DNA’s double helix structure; however, the problem was the drama that I felt like was created by himself. Gossip, pettiness, and misogyny take the wheel in this personal account of how the double helix structure of DNA was discovered, and I expected a more of a respectful, fortunate attitude from Watson. But, in the end, he just made it sound like it was all him and Crick. He owes a better recollection to Rosalind Franklin that was the main contributor to this tremendous discovery. Her years of working with radiation for this discovery cost her life, thus it should be honored.FN"
115,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1793373-misty,4,"Let’s get this straight: James Watson is a shitty human being. Not even counting the racist and eugenist comments that disgraced him in later life - as portrayed in this book, he’s a sexist, privileged dilletante. He’s a real dick. And considering the fact that he’s a mid-century male in the inequitable field of academia, he’s true to type.Yet reading it again feels like having a conversation with 11th-grade me. That’s when I saw the BBC adaptation, with Jeff Goldblum as Watson, and that’s when I read this book for the first time. I was obsessed. I hung paper double helixes in my locker and signed “Watson and Crick are COOL” in my yearbook. I dreamt of being a famous scientist who burned with the desire to make a discovery.I cracked it open again (actually, listened to the audiobook), because I needed a story of an exciting scientific discovery in the era of coronavirus, where it feels like science can’t move fast enough. And I see why 11th-grade me loved it. The discovery itself is thrilling. The science is action-packed and inspired, not just egghead stuff. Sure I’d like to play with models and talk passionately with friends and make history along the way. Who knew science could be so dramatic? The discovery of the double helix is a story of obsession, competition and drive, with a touch of chance that gives it a certain beautiful sense of meant-to-be. It’s a story of people who, while shitty, are brilliant. When not thinking of sex and tennis, they are thinking about big problems in mad flashes of inspiration and passion. Even though someone like me (female, not white) would never be included in the circles described in this book, it was a part of my personal dysfunction that I loved the images of these nerdy but jocular clubs for brilliant people - brilliant men in backrooms and the charming women who were charismatic enough to enthrall them. I had trouble feeling like I belonged, so ironically I was drawn to an ethic with a rigid or elite definition of belonging - geniuses, intellectuals, artists. I dreamt about being worthy enough to find a place in their ranks and having external validation that I was good enough. The tension with Rosalind Franklin adds to the dramatic tension - data versus theory and the clash of personalities. Then I only saw the drama. Now I see that Watson’s comments on Franklin are unforgivable. I knew it was sexism at the time, but I didn’t take it seriously enough. I’m sad that I didn’t empathize with Rosalind Franklin; I didn’t allow myself to identify with her. I was fine accepting a world where I was on the sidelines, just as she is on the sidelines of this story. And I’m horrified that I watched this in school. Is this the right message to send to young women interested in science?I’m still in awe of the discovery and the incredibly faulty and human narrative that describes it. It’s ugly - but girlfriend, it’s real. I took my last real science class in high school - I never even approached becoming the brilliant scientist I once dreamed of being. But I still am thrilled by this book because it shows science as a very human and relatable affair. Who gets the credit is not based purely on good work. People are pushed out or not included. Like all matters, it is highly political. Science is supposed to be objective, but this story pops that balloon in a way that resonates, thanks to the polarization around science today. I’m 43 and far from 11th-grade me. And while I no longer idolize these men, I appreciate the way it portrays science, warts and all."
116,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7069868-john,3,"The ""Double Helix"" is a colorful and informative scientific memoir, with a clear narrative from a clear, singular, and candid viewpoint as though at the time of the discovery. However, this candid viewpoint is in the hands of a fellow who holds the wicked sting of cleverness without the benefit of wisdom, perspective, empathy, or reflection; which is sadly not atypical for when many of us were in our early twenties. As a result of this perspective, it's a book that really demands more context to not be misleading and to do justice to the other participants in the story. For that reason, I'm really glad to have read the ""Norton Critical Edition"" of the book, which includes the original set of scientific papers from all of the three core groups involved, additional memories of the participants, reviews from the time, and facts about how the book came to be published, all set off with framing essays from a peer of the author. With the papers, the multiple remembrances, and the contents of ""The Double Helix"" itself, the core scientific questions are clearly explained, though some of the further supplemental details will be unclear to some, for example to those who have forgotten or never learned what Bessel functions are all about.Though the original reviews were maybe over-sampled for the casual reader, they certainly had their insights. For example, one reviewer keenly noted that this was a very atypical for a work of science. The necessary experimental work was already done, and there was also relatively little to do in terms of the theoretical framing to the problem. Instead of a problem, a question, or a muddle, they had a puzzle on their hands, a geometric and chemical puzzle. This fact the central issue is a race to solve a puzzle one factor in making the central narrative an easy read.The events of the main memoir concern two years in the mid-twenties of the author. However, it was published sometime later (when the author was in his forties). I hope the author must have access to some diaries, to be able to access the sensibilities and details of the younger author, and decided to keep as close to those materials as he could for the sake of giving a very accurate view of the author as those events were happening. Otherwise, it's a very unseemly perspective for someone then forty. From my perspective, there is a pervasive sexism that seems unremarked upon in the reviews. It's hard to tell if that is entirely the point of view of the author, or whether he's particularly uncharitable to Rosalind Franklin because of her critiques on his theory while enjoying the company of young women in a rather impersonal way. Either way, it was with some enjoyment that I noted that the acknowledgements of Franklin and Gosling's paper thank Crick, but not Watson, which seems appropriate given the circumstances.Overall, if you just read the core narrative, it's very bracing but you'll surely be misled. With all of the contextual materials, it's now a bit more work but provides a full experience."
117,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45541682-sachin-h-n,4,"The Double Helix (once intended to be titled 'Honest Jim' and 'Base Pairs') is a Nobel Laureate, Dr. James Watson's account of one of the ground breaking discoveries in science. Having read this book after reading Brenda Maddox's 'The Dark Lady of DNA', to come to an appropriate conclusion, as far as the accuracy of this book is concerned, is difficult. This is more a novel than history; though a feast for a non scientific reader, a historian would definitely object to the way one of the most important discoveries in the field of molecular biology and genetics has been retold. This is more a fast paced thriller (which in fact was, with Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin of King's college, Linus Pauling of CalTech and our boys from Cavendish all trying to have a crack at it) than a history of science. Then, there is the matter of Rosalind Franklin, a prolific x ray cryptographer (dubbed 'Rosy' which the feminist lot find offensive) being discredited of her contribution for the sake. Watson says 'It is quite possible that there are inaccuracies here and there. The portrayal of many might not do justice to their caliber, for i write this as I saw when i was 23.' The words written in the epilogue trying to remedy disregard towards Rosalind and her contribution to elucidation of the structure of DNA probably arise from the need to make the book more acceptable. The book was published in spite of uncompromising opposition from Francis Crick, putting their friendship at risk. Many argue that this book is a symbol of blatant misogyny, painting a monster out of Rosalind, who in a manner has become an icon for feminists. It is very unfortunate that she was not recognized for what she was by many. Yet, that is by no means a reason to not hear out what Watson has to say. At the end of the day it all comes down to Science and the hunger of mankind to uncover it's secrets, of which DNA was a huge chunk from a great puzzle whose solution would open up innumerable applications in the field of medicine later on.  To understand how it all went about, this book is a good place to begin with."
118,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17466394-rustyj,3,"The Double Helix is a personal account of the discovery of the double helical structure of the DNA by one of the co-discoverers, James D. Watson.Watson, his co-collaborator Francis Crick (the senior of the two) alongwith Maurice Wilkins (who was at the same time independently working on the structure of the DNA) were awarded the Noble Prize in Medicine in 1963, for their discovery in 1953.Considering the importance of the discovery on the future of science, it ought to have been a thrilling account, coming from one of the participants. Unfortunately, the book disappoints on many counts.Before getting into the review, we should remember that Watson was barely 25 years old when the discovery was made.Surprisingly for a work of autobiography, the picture that emerges of Watson is that of a flippant, misogynist, careless, lazy person, who just happened to be at the right place at the right time.The portrayal of Rosalind Franklin (who worked with Wilkins), the X-ray crystollagrapher without whose X-ray images of the DNA molecule, the discovery of the helical structure would have been impossible, borders on the disrespectful. That Rosalind believed for a long while that the molecule was not a helix is a different matter.So is the portrayal of Linus Pauling, a brilliant Caltech scientist who was independently working to unravel the structure of the DNA. Pauling is painted as a wolf to be wary of, while it turns out to be pretty opposite.There are pages devoted to the social life of the author, his (absence of) sexual life, food habits and other mundane details that reflects a lack of maturity in handling a subject matter of gravity.By the end of it, one cannot but wonder, if Rosalind was deprived of a deserved Nobel and whether Watson was truly deserving of it. I am sure he was a brilliant scientist and was deserving of the Nobel, but the manner in which the subject matter has been handled, and indeed presented, makes one wonder if it was otherwise.Recommended for aficionados of science."
119,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11990289-kevin,4,"It's a breezy read, iconoclastic and yes, sexist, and at turns charming in its candor and youthful enthusiasm, intriguing in its machiavellian nature, and annoying in its provincial attitudes. In short, it's an expose and it stepped on some toes. Crick, Watson's chief collaborator, considered it ""a betrayal of friendship"" (paraphrase). There are serious questions regarding the portrayal of Rosalind Franklin, who is essentially cast as the villain in the piece, that are tempered (albeit inadequately) at the conclusion of the tale. My impression is that Watson's prime directive beyond producing a credible account of his interpretation of the mood and circumstances leading to the discovery of ""the secret of life"" is that he not commit the cardinal sin of being a bore about it. He is anything but that. I was most surprised by the lack of technical training Watson had, and even Crick to a lesser extent, going in. Their ""structural approach"" to DNA made this possible, through a technique of model building borrowed from Linus Pauling, who became their foil in the race to the landmark discovery. Watson backfilled gaps in his knowledge as needed, gaining a working proficiency in the fields of organic chemistry and X-ray analysis, for example. There was thus a deeper, philosophical divide between Crick & Watson and Franklin regarding the relative merits of theory and practice in the understanding of DNA. The imperatives for such ""backfilling"" become apparent at various stages in their search and these manifest themselves in several ingenious ploys used to thwart institutional barriers and to pump experts for information. These negotiations, which are fleshed out by Watson's characterization of the people and circumstances involved, infuse the narrative with an immediacy and sense of purpose that builds to a climax when the final pieces of the puzzle are literally put into place. In this fashion, Watson and Crick's discovery of the structure of DNA emerges as a true tour de force. This, IMHO, redeems the narrative and is why I give it four stars, with the noted caveats. At a minimum I would augment this account with a reading of Rosalind Franklin's Wikipedia page."

142,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29588908-kelley,3,"I was never in my depth with the science in this book. Not once. But Watson so powerfully captures the humanity of what was going on in the months leading up to the discovery of the structure of DNA that I was swept up in the story even as its facts flew over my head.Here’s what I mean “… we only wished to establish that at least one specific two-chain complementary helix was stereochemically possible. Until this was clear, the objection could be raised that, although our idea was aesthetically elegant, the shape of the sugar-phosphate backbone might not permit its existence. Happily, now we knew that this was not true, and so we had lunch, telling each other that a structure this pretty just had to exist.”My eyes filled with tears near the end as one collaborator after another looked at the model, checked the math, reviewed the chemistry and confirmed what he and his partners had done. I felt the magnitude of it.Watson was one of three scientists awarded the Nobel Prize for the discovery. He was 25 in 1953 when the structure was announced to the scientific world. This memoir was published about 15 years later, but it breathes the life of the younger man, from every boarding house or pub lunch to the breaks from chemical bonds to attend a party that was sure to attract all the international au pairs. Early in the book he takes science off its pedestal and sets it firmly on the ground. “One could not be a successful scientist without realizing that, in contrast to the popular conception supported by newspapers and mothers of scientists, a goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid.”And I was comforted as he read some early findings from another American working on the same problem. “Most of the language was above me, and so I could only get a general impression of his argument. I had no way of judging whether it made sense. The only thing I was sure of was that it was written with style.”He speaks often of the beauty he anticipated in the structure. It would never have occurred to me to describe it that way. I was fascinated, too, that the work was split between theory and equations and the literal, physical construction of the proposed structure. I could picture him – short American hair grown out into a floppy, European look – bent over the metal discs and spheres, manipulating one way, then another, determined to find the position that would hold them all in perfect order.He also speaks of a kind of meditation that bordered on obsession. It would distract him from girls, meals and sleep. Even moments not actively devoted to the question ended up feeding it: “I went ahead spending most evenings at the films, vaguely dreaming that any moment the answer would suddenly hit me.”At some point, I started noting the specific fields involved in (and impacted by) this discovery. Biology and math and genetics I could have anticipated, but then I wrote down specialties such as quantum mechanics, nucleic-acid biochemistry, and theoretical structural chemistry.To me, Watson’s account feels generously inclusive, naming scientist after scientist who contributed an answer to a question or a piece of research. He states in the beginning, in fact, that he would personally credit the discovery to five people, not just the three who received the prize. I’ve learned not everyone shares my opinion of his inclusiveness – and he seems to almost anticipate that in his opening words, acknowledging that any process over such a long time, involving so many people and so much work, is bound to be reported differently from various perspectives. I’m not qualified to give the definitive word, but I didn’t walk away feeling that he’d done this single-handedly or even with only the help of his fellow prize-winners.Don’t get bogged down by the paragraphs you don’t understand. I tried to reread them and despaired. You can appreciate the pursuit and the feat without grasping the details. I did."
143,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58444614-jenna,0,"A Scientist and A Writer	The Double Helix by James Watson is a well-written, informative autobiography about the lifelong workings of scientist James Watson and his partner, Francis Crick, in discovering the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid — more commonly known as DNA. James Watson’s and Francis Crick’s discovery was revolutionary to the scientific community. By discovering the double helix nature of all DNA molecules, it provided a gateway into further learning and understanding a myriad of important biological process such DNA replication, RNA replication, and protein production. In addition, the discovery allowed for an increase in understanding about the behavior of virus and infections. As a result, through research and development, scientists are able to create antibiotics and antiviral injections to improve human life. Therefore, Watson and Crick’s one discovery created a pathway for many discoveries. 	In cell biology, the central focus is DNA as everything always stems back to one’s DNA. Even though Watson is credited to for his work on discovering the DNA, his name is mentioned for a minute or two. Intrigued to learn more about his experiments, I decided to read his autobiography. After reading the book, James Watson does more than just recount the facts leading to the discovery. Through the use of his first-person narrator, he tells personal stories of the people he encountered and collaborated with. He shows the frustration and tedious work within all his trials. His thoughts and reasoning behind certain observations were made. Thus, as a reader, I was able to engage in the book and feel angry when Watson was angry or excited when an experiment had promising results. Additionally, it highlighted a major theme of success and failure. Every time, Watson and Crick endured a setback, they preserved until they reached a success. This concept of perseverance and success is important to young adults as they enter a world where failures and setbacks are inevitable. Overall, his autobiography was not a book filled with scientific jargon. Instead, it was a story with an actual plot, which made it more interesting. 	However, although the main focus of The Double Helix is about one of the greatest scientific discoveries, it also talks about a major scientific controversy. Watson talks about four people that helped him: Maurice Wilkins, Linus Pauling, Francis Crick, and Rosalind Franklin. In the 20th century, Rosalind Franklin was one of the few women working in a male-dominated field. It was her work with an x-ray cryptography that lead Watson and Crick to deduce a final conclusion. Without her knowing, Maurice Wilkins sent Watson and Crick the picture of Rosalind Franklin’s DNA x-ray, which clearly shows the double nature and overall structure of a DNA molecule. Therefore, Watson and Crick quickly learned that their prior structure was wrong. If it wasn’t for Rosalind Franklin, the two scientists would not have gotten the Nobel Prize, which excludes Franklin’s name. In his book, Watson unsympathetically describes Rosalind Frank, saying that “clearly Rosy had to go or be put in her place” when she would not give him what he wanted. In addition, because Rosalind Franklin was the only girl at that time, Watson and his colleagues made fun of her by calling her Rosy, which was demeaning. Watson carries this nickname into his book, thus showing the stereotypical behavior Rosalind endured. During this chapter of the book, the major theme of stereotyping against women in science in the 20th century was highlighted Overall, I would highly recommend this book who is fascinated by the subject of biology. Not only does it explain the science behind one of the greatest scientific discoveries of all time, it tells a story; one that is characterized by failures, successes, and stereotyping."
144,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92553179-faatihah-nayeem,2,"	As one of the most famous contributors to the biological sciences, you cannot read one biology textbook without learning about the Watson and Crick model. But, we don’t get the full story of how James Watson and Watson Crick determined the structure of DNA. Through their many tumults and endeavors, and even with the help of Rosalind Franklin’s X-ray diffraction of DNA to which she wasn’t given enough credit to, they eventually solved the mystery that codes all life.	The Double Helix is written and told through the eyes of American scientist James Watson where we get his perspective of his personal recollection of the discovery of the structure of DNA. He basically explains his journey from a little bit before his arrive in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1953, through his journey in collaboration with Francis Crick, to eventually the validation of their famous Watson and Crick model in 1953 where Watson, Crick, and another scientist named maurice Wilkins received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1962.	The book is structured and organized into Walston’s account from the intertwinement of letters and memories that reflect his thoughts. Watson chronologically shows the reader the process of how the structure of DNA was discovered and his partner relationship with Crick. He shows how science is discovered and studied through a human perspective instead of only from a factual standpoint. In fact, the terminology used in the book as well as the scientific comparisons are thoroughly explained and put into simpler terms for every audience to understand. Watson’s narrative illustrates how the science discoveries and long periods of research affect personal life. In fact, there are often shifts between the information of how each piece of the puzzle relates to the structure of DNA and the social/background lives of researchers.	Even though Watson mentioned some contributions from other scientists and their backgrounds, I felt as if he didn’t focus on how they were heavily involved. When it comes to these tremendous discoveries of science, we often see competition and separation which is exactly what the book shows. Although there were many characters working on this project, after it's DNA structure verification, Watson only emphasized himself and Cric as well as Wilkins. I was deeply disappointed how little he mentioned of Rosalind Franklin whose x-ray diffraction picture of the double helix was the major catalyst for the final determination of DNA’s structure. He often made sexist and controversial comments about her which I didn't like at all, discrediting her major contribution to science for she didn't receive a Nobel Prize. He often paints her as uncooperative and sour. This led me to kind of decreasingly like the book. Watson’s ego and arrogance shined through and his tone became proud.	Watson did successfully ensnare the reader into the dramatic events that led up to the discovery of DNA’s double helix structure; however, the problem was the drama that I felt like was created by himself. Gossip, pettiness, and misogyny take the wheel in this personal account of how the double helix structure of DNA was discovered, and I expected a more of a respectful, fortunate attitude from Watson. But, in the end, he just made it sound like it was all him and Crick. He owes a better recollection to Rosalind Franklin that was the main contributor to this tremendous discovery. Her years of working with radiation for this discovery cost her life, thus it should be honored.FN"
145,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1793373-misty,4,"Let’s get this straight: James Watson is a shitty human being. Not even counting the racist and eugenist comments that disgraced him in later life - as portrayed in this book, he’s a sexist, privileged dilletante. He’s a real dick. And considering the fact that he’s a mid-century male in the inequitable field of academia, he’s true to type.Yet reading it again feels like having a conversation with 11th-grade me. That’s when I saw the BBC adaptation, with Jeff Goldblum as Watson, and that’s when I read this book for the first time. I was obsessed. I hung paper double helixes in my locker and signed “Watson and Crick are COOL” in my yearbook. I dreamt of being a famous scientist who burned with the desire to make a discovery.I cracked it open again (actually, listened to the audiobook), because I needed a story of an exciting scientific discovery in the era of coronavirus, where it feels like science can’t move fast enough. And I see why 11th-grade me loved it. The discovery itself is thrilling. The science is action-packed and inspired, not just egghead stuff. Sure I’d like to play with models and talk passionately with friends and make history along the way. Who knew science could be so dramatic? The discovery of the double helix is a story of obsession, competition and drive, with a touch of chance that gives it a certain beautiful sense of meant-to-be. It’s a story of people who, while shitty, are brilliant. When not thinking of sex and tennis, they are thinking about big problems in mad flashes of inspiration and passion. Even though someone like me (female, not white) would never be included in the circles described in this book, it was a part of my personal dysfunction that I loved the images of these nerdy but jocular clubs for brilliant people - brilliant men in backrooms and the charming women who were charismatic enough to enthrall them. I had trouble feeling like I belonged, so ironically I was drawn to an ethic with a rigid or elite definition of belonging - geniuses, intellectuals, artists. I dreamt about being worthy enough to find a place in their ranks and having external validation that I was good enough. The tension with Rosalind Franklin adds to the dramatic tension - data versus theory and the clash of personalities. Then I only saw the drama. Now I see that Watson’s comments on Franklin are unforgivable. I knew it was sexism at the time, but I didn’t take it seriously enough. I’m sad that I didn’t empathize with Rosalind Franklin; I didn’t allow myself to identify with her. I was fine accepting a world where I was on the sidelines, just as she is on the sidelines of this story. And I’m horrified that I watched this in school. Is this the right message to send to young women interested in science?I’m still in awe of the discovery and the incredibly faulty and human narrative that describes it. It’s ugly - but girlfriend, it’s real. I took my last real science class in high school - I never even approached becoming the brilliant scientist I once dreamed of being. But I still am thrilled by this book because it shows science as a very human and relatable affair. Who gets the credit is not based purely on good work. People are pushed out or not included. Like all matters, it is highly political. Science is supposed to be objective, but this story pops that balloon in a way that resonates, thanks to the polarization around science today. I’m 43 and far from 11th-grade me. And while I no longer idolize these men, I appreciate the way it portrays science, warts and all."
146,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7069868-john,3,"The ""Double Helix"" is a colorful and informative scientific memoir, with a clear narrative from a clear, singular, and candid viewpoint as though at the time of the discovery. However, this candid viewpoint is in the hands of a fellow who holds the wicked sting of cleverness without the benefit of wisdom, perspective, empathy, or reflection; which is sadly not atypical for when many of us were in our early twenties. As a result of this perspective, it's a book that really demands more context to not be misleading and to do justice to the other participants in the story. For that reason, I'm really glad to have read the ""Norton Critical Edition"" of the book, which includes the original set of scientific papers from all of the three core groups involved, additional memories of the participants, reviews from the time, and facts about how the book came to be published, all set off with framing essays from a peer of the author. With the papers, the multiple remembrances, and the contents of ""The Double Helix"" itself, the core scientific questions are clearly explained, though some of the further supplemental details will be unclear to some, for example to those who have forgotten or never learned what Bessel functions are all about.Though the original reviews were maybe over-sampled for the casual reader, they certainly had their insights. For example, one reviewer keenly noted that this was a very atypical for a work of science. The necessary experimental work was already done, and there was also relatively little to do in terms of the theoretical framing to the problem. Instead of a problem, a question, or a muddle, they had a puzzle on their hands, a geometric and chemical puzzle. This fact the central issue is a race to solve a puzzle one factor in making the central narrative an easy read.The events of the main memoir concern two years in the mid-twenties of the author. However, it was published sometime later (when the author was in his forties). I hope the author must have access to some diaries, to be able to access the sensibilities and details of the younger author, and decided to keep as close to those materials as he could for the sake of giving a very accurate view of the author as those events were happening. Otherwise, it's a very unseemly perspective for someone then forty. From my perspective, there is a pervasive sexism that seems unremarked upon in the reviews. It's hard to tell if that is entirely the point of view of the author, or whether he's particularly uncharitable to Rosalind Franklin because of her critiques on his theory while enjoying the company of young women in a rather impersonal way. Either way, it was with some enjoyment that I noted that the acknowledgements of Franklin and Gosling's paper thank Crick, but not Watson, which seems appropriate given the circumstances.Overall, if you just read the core narrative, it's very bracing but you'll surely be misled. With all of the contextual materials, it's now a bit more work but provides a full experience."
147,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45541682-sachin-h-n,4,"The Double Helix (once intended to be titled 'Honest Jim' and 'Base Pairs') is a Nobel Laureate, Dr. James Watson's account of one of the ground breaking discoveries in science. Having read this book after reading Brenda Maddox's 'The Dark Lady of DNA', to come to an appropriate conclusion, as far as the accuracy of this book is concerned, is difficult. This is more a novel than history; though a feast for a non scientific reader, a historian would definitely object to the way one of the most important discoveries in the field of molecular biology and genetics has been retold. This is more a fast paced thriller (which in fact was, with Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin of King's college, Linus Pauling of CalTech and our boys from Cavendish all trying to have a crack at it) than a history of science. Then, there is the matter of Rosalind Franklin, a prolific x ray cryptographer (dubbed 'Rosy' which the feminist lot find offensive) being discredited of her contribution for the sake. Watson says 'It is quite possible that there are inaccuracies here and there. The portrayal of many might not do justice to their caliber, for i write this as I saw when i was 23.' The words written in the epilogue trying to remedy disregard towards Rosalind and her contribution to elucidation of the structure of DNA probably arise from the need to make the book more acceptable. The book was published in spite of uncompromising opposition from Francis Crick, putting their friendship at risk. Many argue that this book is a symbol of blatant misogyny, painting a monster out of Rosalind, who in a manner has become an icon for feminists. It is very unfortunate that she was not recognized for what she was by many. Yet, that is by no means a reason to not hear out what Watson has to say. At the end of the day it all comes down to Science and the hunger of mankind to uncover it's secrets, of which DNA was a huge chunk from a great puzzle whose solution would open up innumerable applications in the field of medicine later on.  To understand how it all went about, this book is a good place to begin with."
148,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17466394-rustyj,3,"The Double Helix is a personal account of the discovery of the double helical structure of the DNA by one of the co-discoverers, James D. Watson.Watson, his co-collaborator Francis Crick (the senior of the two) alongwith Maurice Wilkins (who was at the same time independently working on the structure of the DNA) were awarded the Noble Prize in Medicine in 1963, for their discovery in 1953.Considering the importance of the discovery on the future of science, it ought to have been a thrilling account, coming from one of the participants. Unfortunately, the book disappoints on many counts.Before getting into the review, we should remember that Watson was barely 25 years old when the discovery was made.Surprisingly for a work of autobiography, the picture that emerges of Watson is that of a flippant, misogynist, careless, lazy person, who just happened to be at the right place at the right time.The portrayal of Rosalind Franklin (who worked with Wilkins), the X-ray crystollagrapher without whose X-ray images of the DNA molecule, the discovery of the helical structure would have been impossible, borders on the disrespectful. That Rosalind believed for a long while that the molecule was not a helix is a different matter.So is the portrayal of Linus Pauling, a brilliant Caltech scientist who was independently working to unravel the structure of the DNA. Pauling is painted as a wolf to be wary of, while it turns out to be pretty opposite.There are pages devoted to the social life of the author, his (absence of) sexual life, food habits and other mundane details that reflects a lack of maturity in handling a subject matter of gravity.By the end of it, one cannot but wonder, if Rosalind was deprived of a deserved Nobel and whether Watson was truly deserving of it. I am sure he was a brilliant scientist and was deserving of the Nobel, but the manner in which the subject matter has been handled, and indeed presented, makes one wonder if it was otherwise.Recommended for aficionados of science."
149,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11990289-kevin,4,"It's a breezy read, iconoclastic and yes, sexist, and at turns charming in its candor and youthful enthusiasm, intriguing in its machiavellian nature, and annoying in its provincial attitudes. In short, it's an expose and it stepped on some toes. Crick, Watson's chief collaborator, considered it ""a betrayal of friendship"" (paraphrase). There are serious questions regarding the portrayal of Rosalind Franklin, who is essentially cast as the villain in the piece, that are tempered (albeit inadequately) at the conclusion of the tale. My impression is that Watson's prime directive beyond producing a credible account of his interpretation of the mood and circumstances leading to the discovery of ""the secret of life"" is that he not commit the cardinal sin of being a bore about it. He is anything but that. I was most surprised by the lack of technical training Watson had, and even Crick to a lesser extent, going in. Their ""structural approach"" to DNA made this possible, through a technique of model building borrowed from Linus Pauling, who became their foil in the race to the landmark discovery. Watson backfilled gaps in his knowledge as needed, gaining a working proficiency in the fields of organic chemistry and X-ray analysis, for example. There was thus a deeper, philosophical divide between Crick & Watson and Franklin regarding the relative merits of theory and practice in the understanding of DNA. The imperatives for such ""backfilling"" become apparent at various stages in their search and these manifest themselves in several ingenious ploys used to thwart institutional barriers and to pump experts for information. These negotiations, which are fleshed out by Watson's characterization of the people and circumstances involved, infuse the narrative with an immediacy and sense of purpose that builds to a climax when the final pieces of the puzzle are literally put into place. In this fashion, Watson and Crick's discovery of the structure of DNA emerges as a true tour de force. This, IMHO, redeems the narrative and is why I give it four stars, with the noted caveats. At a minimum I would augment this account with a reading of Rosalind Franklin's Wikipedia page."

172,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29588908-kelley,3,"I was never in my depth with the science in this book. Not once. But Watson so powerfully captures the humanity of what was going on in the months leading up to the discovery of the structure of DNA that I was swept up in the story even as its facts flew over my head.Here’s what I mean “… we only wished to establish that at least one specific two-chain complementary helix was stereochemically possible. Until this was clear, the objection could be raised that, although our idea was aesthetically elegant, the shape of the sugar-phosphate backbone might not permit its existence. Happily, now we knew that this was not true, and so we had lunch, telling each other that a structure this pretty just had to exist.”My eyes filled with tears near the end as one collaborator after another looked at the model, checked the math, reviewed the chemistry and confirmed what he and his partners had done. I felt the magnitude of it.Watson was one of three scientists awarded the Nobel Prize for the discovery. He was 25 in 1953 when the structure was announced to the scientific world. This memoir was published about 15 years later, but it breathes the life of the younger man, from every boarding house or pub lunch to the breaks from chemical bonds to attend a party that was sure to attract all the international au pairs. Early in the book he takes science off its pedestal and sets it firmly on the ground. “One could not be a successful scientist without realizing that, in contrast to the popular conception supported by newspapers and mothers of scientists, a goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid.”And I was comforted as he read some early findings from another American working on the same problem. “Most of the language was above me, and so I could only get a general impression of his argument. I had no way of judging whether it made sense. The only thing I was sure of was that it was written with style.”He speaks often of the beauty he anticipated in the structure. It would never have occurred to me to describe it that way. I was fascinated, too, that the work was split between theory and equations and the literal, physical construction of the proposed structure. I could picture him – short American hair grown out into a floppy, European look – bent over the metal discs and spheres, manipulating one way, then another, determined to find the position that would hold them all in perfect order.He also speaks of a kind of meditation that bordered on obsession. It would distract him from girls, meals and sleep. Even moments not actively devoted to the question ended up feeding it: “I went ahead spending most evenings at the films, vaguely dreaming that any moment the answer would suddenly hit me.”At some point, I started noting the specific fields involved in (and impacted by) this discovery. Biology and math and genetics I could have anticipated, but then I wrote down specialties such as quantum mechanics, nucleic-acid biochemistry, and theoretical structural chemistry.To me, Watson’s account feels generously inclusive, naming scientist after scientist who contributed an answer to a question or a piece of research. He states in the beginning, in fact, that he would personally credit the discovery to five people, not just the three who received the prize. I’ve learned not everyone shares my opinion of his inclusiveness – and he seems to almost anticipate that in his opening words, acknowledging that any process over such a long time, involving so many people and so much work, is bound to be reported differently from various perspectives. I’m not qualified to give the definitive word, but I didn’t walk away feeling that he’d done this single-handedly or even with only the help of his fellow prize-winners.Don’t get bogged down by the paragraphs you don’t understand. I tried to reread them and despaired. You can appreciate the pursuit and the feat without grasping the details. I did."
173,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58444614-jenna,0,"A Scientist and A Writer	The Double Helix by James Watson is a well-written, informative autobiography about the lifelong workings of scientist James Watson and his partner, Francis Crick, in discovering the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid — more commonly known as DNA. James Watson’s and Francis Crick’s discovery was revolutionary to the scientific community. By discovering the double helix nature of all DNA molecules, it provided a gateway into further learning and understanding a myriad of important biological process such DNA replication, RNA replication, and protein production. In addition, the discovery allowed for an increase in understanding about the behavior of virus and infections. As a result, through research and development, scientists are able to create antibiotics and antiviral injections to improve human life. Therefore, Watson and Crick’s one discovery created a pathway for many discoveries. 	In cell biology, the central focus is DNA as everything always stems back to one’s DNA. Even though Watson is credited to for his work on discovering the DNA, his name is mentioned for a minute or two. Intrigued to learn more about his experiments, I decided to read his autobiography. After reading the book, James Watson does more than just recount the facts leading to the discovery. Through the use of his first-person narrator, he tells personal stories of the people he encountered and collaborated with. He shows the frustration and tedious work within all his trials. His thoughts and reasoning behind certain observations were made. Thus, as a reader, I was able to engage in the book and feel angry when Watson was angry or excited when an experiment had promising results. Additionally, it highlighted a major theme of success and failure. Every time, Watson and Crick endured a setback, they preserved until they reached a success. This concept of perseverance and success is important to young adults as they enter a world where failures and setbacks are inevitable. Overall, his autobiography was not a book filled with scientific jargon. Instead, it was a story with an actual plot, which made it more interesting. 	However, although the main focus of The Double Helix is about one of the greatest scientific discoveries, it also talks about a major scientific controversy. Watson talks about four people that helped him: Maurice Wilkins, Linus Pauling, Francis Crick, and Rosalind Franklin. In the 20th century, Rosalind Franklin was one of the few women working in a male-dominated field. It was her work with an x-ray cryptography that lead Watson and Crick to deduce a final conclusion. Without her knowing, Maurice Wilkins sent Watson and Crick the picture of Rosalind Franklin’s DNA x-ray, which clearly shows the double nature and overall structure of a DNA molecule. Therefore, Watson and Crick quickly learned that their prior structure was wrong. If it wasn’t for Rosalind Franklin, the two scientists would not have gotten the Nobel Prize, which excludes Franklin’s name. In his book, Watson unsympathetically describes Rosalind Frank, saying that “clearly Rosy had to go or be put in her place” when she would not give him what he wanted. In addition, because Rosalind Franklin was the only girl at that time, Watson and his colleagues made fun of her by calling her Rosy, which was demeaning. Watson carries this nickname into his book, thus showing the stereotypical behavior Rosalind endured. During this chapter of the book, the major theme of stereotyping against women in science in the 20th century was highlighted Overall, I would highly recommend this book who is fascinated by the subject of biology. Not only does it explain the science behind one of the greatest scientific discoveries of all time, it tells a story; one that is characterized by failures, successes, and stereotyping."
174,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92553179-faatihah-nayeem,2,"	As one of the most famous contributors to the biological sciences, you cannot read one biology textbook without learning about the Watson and Crick model. But, we don’t get the full story of how James Watson and Watson Crick determined the structure of DNA. Through their many tumults and endeavors, and even with the help of Rosalind Franklin’s X-ray diffraction of DNA to which she wasn’t given enough credit to, they eventually solved the mystery that codes all life.	The Double Helix is written and told through the eyes of American scientist James Watson where we get his perspective of his personal recollection of the discovery of the structure of DNA. He basically explains his journey from a little bit before his arrive in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1953, through his journey in collaboration with Francis Crick, to eventually the validation of their famous Watson and Crick model in 1953 where Watson, Crick, and another scientist named maurice Wilkins received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1962.	The book is structured and organized into Walston’s account from the intertwinement of letters and memories that reflect his thoughts. Watson chronologically shows the reader the process of how the structure of DNA was discovered and his partner relationship with Crick. He shows how science is discovered and studied through a human perspective instead of only from a factual standpoint. In fact, the terminology used in the book as well as the scientific comparisons are thoroughly explained and put into simpler terms for every audience to understand. Watson’s narrative illustrates how the science discoveries and long periods of research affect personal life. In fact, there are often shifts between the information of how each piece of the puzzle relates to the structure of DNA and the social/background lives of researchers.	Even though Watson mentioned some contributions from other scientists and their backgrounds, I felt as if he didn’t focus on how they were heavily involved. When it comes to these tremendous discoveries of science, we often see competition and separation which is exactly what the book shows. Although there were many characters working on this project, after it's DNA structure verification, Watson only emphasized himself and Cric as well as Wilkins. I was deeply disappointed how little he mentioned of Rosalind Franklin whose x-ray diffraction picture of the double helix was the major catalyst for the final determination of DNA’s structure. He often made sexist and controversial comments about her which I didn't like at all, discrediting her major contribution to science for she didn't receive a Nobel Prize. He often paints her as uncooperative and sour. This led me to kind of decreasingly like the book. Watson’s ego and arrogance shined through and his tone became proud.	Watson did successfully ensnare the reader into the dramatic events that led up to the discovery of DNA’s double helix structure; however, the problem was the drama that I felt like was created by himself. Gossip, pettiness, and misogyny take the wheel in this personal account of how the double helix structure of DNA was discovered, and I expected a more of a respectful, fortunate attitude from Watson. But, in the end, he just made it sound like it was all him and Crick. He owes a better recollection to Rosalind Franklin that was the main contributor to this tremendous discovery. Her years of working with radiation for this discovery cost her life, thus it should be honored.FN"
175,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1793373-misty,4,"Let’s get this straight: James Watson is a shitty human being. Not even counting the racist and eugenist comments that disgraced him in later life - as portrayed in this book, he’s a sexist, privileged dilletante. He’s a real dick. And considering the fact that he’s a mid-century male in the inequitable field of academia, he’s true to type.Yet reading it again feels like having a conversation with 11th-grade me. That’s when I saw the BBC adaptation, with Jeff Goldblum as Watson, and that’s when I read this book for the first time. I was obsessed. I hung paper double helixes in my locker and signed “Watson and Crick are COOL” in my yearbook. I dreamt of being a famous scientist who burned with the desire to make a discovery.I cracked it open again (actually, listened to the audiobook), because I needed a story of an exciting scientific discovery in the era of coronavirus, where it feels like science can’t move fast enough. And I see why 11th-grade me loved it. The discovery itself is thrilling. The science is action-packed and inspired, not just egghead stuff. Sure I’d like to play with models and talk passionately with friends and make history along the way. Who knew science could be so dramatic? The discovery of the double helix is a story of obsession, competition and drive, with a touch of chance that gives it a certain beautiful sense of meant-to-be. It’s a story of people who, while shitty, are brilliant. When not thinking of sex and tennis, they are thinking about big problems in mad flashes of inspiration and passion. Even though someone like me (female, not white) would never be included in the circles described in this book, it was a part of my personal dysfunction that I loved the images of these nerdy but jocular clubs for brilliant people - brilliant men in backrooms and the charming women who were charismatic enough to enthrall them. I had trouble feeling like I belonged, so ironically I was drawn to an ethic with a rigid or elite definition of belonging - geniuses, intellectuals, artists. I dreamt about being worthy enough to find a place in their ranks and having external validation that I was good enough. The tension with Rosalind Franklin adds to the dramatic tension - data versus theory and the clash of personalities. Then I only saw the drama. Now I see that Watson’s comments on Franklin are unforgivable. I knew it was sexism at the time, but I didn’t take it seriously enough. I’m sad that I didn’t empathize with Rosalind Franklin; I didn’t allow myself to identify with her. I was fine accepting a world where I was on the sidelines, just as she is on the sidelines of this story. And I’m horrified that I watched this in school. Is this the right message to send to young women interested in science?I’m still in awe of the discovery and the incredibly faulty and human narrative that describes it. It’s ugly - but girlfriend, it’s real. I took my last real science class in high school - I never even approached becoming the brilliant scientist I once dreamed of being. But I still am thrilled by this book because it shows science as a very human and relatable affair. Who gets the credit is not based purely on good work. People are pushed out or not included. Like all matters, it is highly political. Science is supposed to be objective, but this story pops that balloon in a way that resonates, thanks to the polarization around science today. I’m 43 and far from 11th-grade me. And while I no longer idolize these men, I appreciate the way it portrays science, warts and all."
176,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7069868-john,3,"The ""Double Helix"" is a colorful and informative scientific memoir, with a clear narrative from a clear, singular, and candid viewpoint as though at the time of the discovery. However, this candid viewpoint is in the hands of a fellow who holds the wicked sting of cleverness without the benefit of wisdom, perspective, empathy, or reflection; which is sadly not atypical for when many of us were in our early twenties. As a result of this perspective, it's a book that really demands more context to not be misleading and to do justice to the other participants in the story. For that reason, I'm really glad to have read the ""Norton Critical Edition"" of the book, which includes the original set of scientific papers from all of the three core groups involved, additional memories of the participants, reviews from the time, and facts about how the book came to be published, all set off with framing essays from a peer of the author. With the papers, the multiple remembrances, and the contents of ""The Double Helix"" itself, the core scientific questions are clearly explained, though some of the further supplemental details will be unclear to some, for example to those who have forgotten or never learned what Bessel functions are all about.Though the original reviews were maybe over-sampled for the casual reader, they certainly had their insights. For example, one reviewer keenly noted that this was a very atypical for a work of science. The necessary experimental work was already done, and there was also relatively little to do in terms of the theoretical framing to the problem. Instead of a problem, a question, or a muddle, they had a puzzle on their hands, a geometric and chemical puzzle. This fact the central issue is a race to solve a puzzle one factor in making the central narrative an easy read.The events of the main memoir concern two years in the mid-twenties of the author. However, it was published sometime later (when the author was in his forties). I hope the author must have access to some diaries, to be able to access the sensibilities and details of the younger author, and decided to keep as close to those materials as he could for the sake of giving a very accurate view of the author as those events were happening. Otherwise, it's a very unseemly perspective for someone then forty. From my perspective, there is a pervasive sexism that seems unremarked upon in the reviews. It's hard to tell if that is entirely the point of view of the author, or whether he's particularly uncharitable to Rosalind Franklin because of her critiques on his theory while enjoying the company of young women in a rather impersonal way. Either way, it was with some enjoyment that I noted that the acknowledgements of Franklin and Gosling's paper thank Crick, but not Watson, which seems appropriate given the circumstances.Overall, if you just read the core narrative, it's very bracing but you'll surely be misled. With all of the contextual materials, it's now a bit more work but provides a full experience."
177,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45541682-sachin-h-n,4,"The Double Helix (once intended to be titled 'Honest Jim' and 'Base Pairs') is a Nobel Laureate, Dr. James Watson's account of one of the ground breaking discoveries in science. Having read this book after reading Brenda Maddox's 'The Dark Lady of DNA', to come to an appropriate conclusion, as far as the accuracy of this book is concerned, is difficult. This is more a novel than history; though a feast for a non scientific reader, a historian would definitely object to the way one of the most important discoveries in the field of molecular biology and genetics has been retold. This is more a fast paced thriller (which in fact was, with Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin of King's college, Linus Pauling of CalTech and our boys from Cavendish all trying to have a crack at it) than a history of science. Then, there is the matter of Rosalind Franklin, a prolific x ray cryptographer (dubbed 'Rosy' which the feminist lot find offensive) being discredited of her contribution for the sake. Watson says 'It is quite possible that there are inaccuracies here and there. The portrayal of many might not do justice to their caliber, for i write this as I saw when i was 23.' The words written in the epilogue trying to remedy disregard towards Rosalind and her contribution to elucidation of the structure of DNA probably arise from the need to make the book more acceptable. The book was published in spite of uncompromising opposition from Francis Crick, putting their friendship at risk. Many argue that this book is a symbol of blatant misogyny, painting a monster out of Rosalind, who in a manner has become an icon for feminists. It is very unfortunate that she was not recognized for what she was by many. Yet, that is by no means a reason to not hear out what Watson has to say. At the end of the day it all comes down to Science and the hunger of mankind to uncover it's secrets, of which DNA was a huge chunk from a great puzzle whose solution would open up innumerable applications in the field of medicine later on.  To understand how it all went about, this book is a good place to begin with."
178,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17466394-rustyj,3,"The Double Helix is a personal account of the discovery of the double helical structure of the DNA by one of the co-discoverers, James D. Watson.Watson, his co-collaborator Francis Crick (the senior of the two) alongwith Maurice Wilkins (who was at the same time independently working on the structure of the DNA) were awarded the Noble Prize in Medicine in 1963, for their discovery in 1953.Considering the importance of the discovery on the future of science, it ought to have been a thrilling account, coming from one of the participants. Unfortunately, the book disappoints on many counts.Before getting into the review, we should remember that Watson was barely 25 years old when the discovery was made.Surprisingly for a work of autobiography, the picture that emerges of Watson is that of a flippant, misogynist, careless, lazy person, who just happened to be at the right place at the right time.The portrayal of Rosalind Franklin (who worked with Wilkins), the X-ray crystollagrapher without whose X-ray images of the DNA molecule, the discovery of the helical structure would have been impossible, borders on the disrespectful. That Rosalind believed for a long while that the molecule was not a helix is a different matter.So is the portrayal of Linus Pauling, a brilliant Caltech scientist who was independently working to unravel the structure of the DNA. Pauling is painted as a wolf to be wary of, while it turns out to be pretty opposite.There are pages devoted to the social life of the author, his (absence of) sexual life, food habits and other mundane details that reflects a lack of maturity in handling a subject matter of gravity.By the end of it, one cannot but wonder, if Rosalind was deprived of a deserved Nobel and whether Watson was truly deserving of it. I am sure he was a brilliant scientist and was deserving of the Nobel, but the manner in which the subject matter has been handled, and indeed presented, makes one wonder if it was otherwise.Recommended for aficionados of science."
179,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11990289-kevin,4,"It's a breezy read, iconoclastic and yes, sexist, and at turns charming in its candor and youthful enthusiasm, intriguing in its machiavellian nature, and annoying in its provincial attitudes. In short, it's an expose and it stepped on some toes. Crick, Watson's chief collaborator, considered it ""a betrayal of friendship"" (paraphrase). There are serious questions regarding the portrayal of Rosalind Franklin, who is essentially cast as the villain in the piece, that are tempered (albeit inadequately) at the conclusion of the tale. My impression is that Watson's prime directive beyond producing a credible account of his interpretation of the mood and circumstances leading to the discovery of ""the secret of life"" is that he not commit the cardinal sin of being a bore about it. He is anything but that. I was most surprised by the lack of technical training Watson had, and even Crick to a lesser extent, going in. Their ""structural approach"" to DNA made this possible, through a technique of model building borrowed from Linus Pauling, who became their foil in the race to the landmark discovery. Watson backfilled gaps in his knowledge as needed, gaining a working proficiency in the fields of organic chemistry and X-ray analysis, for example. There was thus a deeper, philosophical divide between Crick & Watson and Franklin regarding the relative merits of theory and practice in the understanding of DNA. The imperatives for such ""backfilling"" become apparent at various stages in their search and these manifest themselves in several ingenious ploys used to thwart institutional barriers and to pump experts for information. These negotiations, which are fleshed out by Watson's characterization of the people and circumstances involved, infuse the narrative with an immediacy and sense of purpose that builds to a climax when the final pieces of the puzzle are literally put into place. In this fashion, Watson and Crick's discovery of the structure of DNA emerges as a true tour de force. This, IMHO, redeems the narrative and is why I give it four stars, with the noted caveats. At a minimum I would augment this account with a reading of Rosalind Franklin's Wikipedia page."
180,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8284707-louisa,4,"The idea was so simple that it had to be right.In this little book, Watson recounts the events and pieces of research leading up to the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA, but also the fierce competition between scientists in the US and England, the jealousy and irritation even among colleagues in the same science lab.

202,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29588908-kelley,3,"I was never in my depth with the science in this book. Not once. But Watson so powerfully captures the humanity of what was going on in the months leading up to the discovery of the structure of DNA that I was swept up in the story even as its facts flew over my head.Here’s what I mean “… we only wished to establish that at least one specific two-chain complementary helix was stereochemically possible. Until this was clear, the objection could be raised that, although our idea was aesthetically elegant, the shape of the sugar-phosphate backbone might not permit its existence. Happily, now we knew that this was not true, and so we had lunch, telling each other that a structure this pretty just had to exist.”My eyes filled with tears near the end as one collaborator after another looked at the model, checked the math, reviewed the chemistry and confirmed what he and his partners had done. I felt the magnitude of it.Watson was one of three scientists awarded the Nobel Prize for the discovery. He was 25 in 1953 when the structure was announced to the scientific world. This memoir was published about 15 years later, but it breathes the life of the younger man, from every boarding house or pub lunch to the breaks from chemical bonds to attend a party that was sure to attract all the international au pairs. Early in the book he takes science off its pedestal and sets it firmly on the ground. “One could not be a successful scientist without realizing that, in contrast to the popular conception supported by newspapers and mothers of scientists, a goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid.”And I was comforted as he read some early findings from another American working on the same problem. “Most of the language was above me, and so I could only get a general impression of his argument. I had no way of judging whether it made sense. The only thing I was sure of was that it was written with style.”He speaks often of the beauty he anticipated in the structure. It would never have occurred to me to describe it that way. I was fascinated, too, that the work was split between theory and equations and the literal, physical construction of the proposed structure. I could picture him – short American hair grown out into a floppy, European look – bent over the metal discs and spheres, manipulating one way, then another, determined to find the position that would hold them all in perfect order.He also speaks of a kind of meditation that bordered on obsession. It would distract him from girls, meals and sleep. Even moments not actively devoted to the question ended up feeding it: “I went ahead spending most evenings at the films, vaguely dreaming that any moment the answer would suddenly hit me.”At some point, I started noting the specific fields involved in (and impacted by) this discovery. Biology and math and genetics I could have anticipated, but then I wrote down specialties such as quantum mechanics, nucleic-acid biochemistry, and theoretical structural chemistry.To me, Watson’s account feels generously inclusive, naming scientist after scientist who contributed an answer to a question or a piece of research. He states in the beginning, in fact, that he would personally credit the discovery to five people, not just the three who received the prize. I’ve learned not everyone shares my opinion of his inclusiveness – and he seems to almost anticipate that in his opening words, acknowledging that any process over such a long time, involving so many people and so much work, is bound to be reported differently from various perspectives. I’m not qualified to give the definitive word, but I didn’t walk away feeling that he’d done this single-handedly or even with only the help of his fellow prize-winners.Don’t get bogged down by the paragraphs you don’t understand. I tried to reread them and despaired. You can appreciate the pursuit and the feat without grasping the details. I did."
203,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58444614-jenna,0,"A Scientist and A Writer	The Double Helix by James Watson is a well-written, informative autobiography about the lifelong workings of scientist James Watson and his partner, Francis Crick, in discovering the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid — more commonly known as DNA. James Watson’s and Francis Crick’s discovery was revolutionary to the scientific community. By discovering the double helix nature of all DNA molecules, it provided a gateway into further learning and understanding a myriad of important biological process such DNA replication, RNA replication, and protein production. In addition, the discovery allowed for an increase in understanding about the behavior of virus and infections. As a result, through research and development, scientists are able to create antibiotics and antiviral injections to improve human life. Therefore, Watson and Crick’s one discovery created a pathway for many discoveries. 	In cell biology, the central focus is DNA as everything always stems back to one’s DNA. Even though Watson is credited to for his work on discovering the DNA, his name is mentioned for a minute or two. Intrigued to learn more about his experiments, I decided to read his autobiography. After reading the book, James Watson does more than just recount the facts leading to the discovery. Through the use of his first-person narrator, he tells personal stories of the people he encountered and collaborated with. He shows the frustration and tedious work within all his trials. His thoughts and reasoning behind certain observations were made. Thus, as a reader, I was able to engage in the book and feel angry when Watson was angry or excited when an experiment had promising results. Additionally, it highlighted a major theme of success and failure. Every time, Watson and Crick endured a setback, they preserved until they reached a success. This concept of perseverance and success is important to young adults as they enter a world where failures and setbacks are inevitable. Overall, his autobiography was not a book filled with scientific jargon. Instead, it was a story with an actual plot, which made it more interesting. 	However, although the main focus of The Double Helix is about one of the greatest scientific discoveries, it also talks about a major scientific controversy. Watson talks about four people that helped him: Maurice Wilkins, Linus Pauling, Francis Crick, and Rosalind Franklin. In the 20th century, Rosalind Franklin was one of the few women working in a male-dominated field. It was her work with an x-ray cryptography that lead Watson and Crick to deduce a final conclusion. Without her knowing, Maurice Wilkins sent Watson and Crick the picture of Rosalind Franklin’s DNA x-ray, which clearly shows the double nature and overall structure of a DNA molecule. Therefore, Watson and Crick quickly learned that their prior structure was wrong. If it wasn’t for Rosalind Franklin, the two scientists would not have gotten the Nobel Prize, which excludes Franklin’s name. In his book, Watson unsympathetically describes Rosalind Frank, saying that “clearly Rosy had to go or be put in her place” when she would not give him what he wanted. In addition, because Rosalind Franklin was the only girl at that time, Watson and his colleagues made fun of her by calling her Rosy, which was demeaning. Watson carries this nickname into his book, thus showing the stereotypical behavior Rosalind endured. During this chapter of the book, the major theme of stereotyping against women in science in the 20th century was highlighted Overall, I would highly recommend this book who is fascinated by the subject of biology. Not only does it explain the science behind one of the greatest scientific discoveries of all time, it tells a story; one that is characterized by failures, successes, and stereotyping."
204,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92553179-faatihah-nayeem,2,"	As one of the most famous contributors to the biological sciences, you cannot read one biology textbook without learning about the Watson and Crick model. But, we don’t get the full story of how James Watson and Watson Crick determined the structure of DNA. Through their many tumults and endeavors, and even with the help of Rosalind Franklin’s X-ray diffraction of DNA to which she wasn’t given enough credit to, they eventually solved the mystery that codes all life.	The Double Helix is written and told through the eyes of American scientist James Watson where we get his perspective of his personal recollection of the discovery of the structure of DNA. He basically explains his journey from a little bit before his arrive in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1953, through his journey in collaboration with Francis Crick, to eventually the validation of their famous Watson and Crick model in 1953 where Watson, Crick, and another scientist named maurice Wilkins received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1962.	The book is structured and organized into Walston’s account from the intertwinement of letters and memories that reflect his thoughts. Watson chronologically shows the reader the process of how the structure of DNA was discovered and his partner relationship with Crick. He shows how science is discovered and studied through a human perspective instead of only from a factual standpoint. In fact, the terminology used in the book as well as the scientific comparisons are thoroughly explained and put into simpler terms for every audience to understand. Watson’s narrative illustrates how the science discoveries and long periods of research affect personal life. In fact, there are often shifts between the information of how each piece of the puzzle relates to the structure of DNA and the social/background lives of researchers.	Even though Watson mentioned some contributions from other scientists and their backgrounds, I felt as if he didn’t focus on how they were heavily involved. When it comes to these tremendous discoveries of science, we often see competition and separation which is exactly what the book shows. Although there were many characters working on this project, after it's DNA structure verification, Watson only emphasized himself and Cric as well as Wilkins. I was deeply disappointed how little he mentioned of Rosalind Franklin whose x-ray diffraction picture of the double helix was the major catalyst for the final determination of DNA’s structure. He often made sexist and controversial comments about her which I didn't like at all, discrediting her major contribution to science for she didn't receive a Nobel Prize. He often paints her as uncooperative and sour. This led me to kind of decreasingly like the book. Watson’s ego and arrogance shined through and his tone became proud.	Watson did successfully ensnare the reader into the dramatic events that led up to the discovery of DNA’s double helix structure; however, the problem was the drama that I felt like was created by himself. Gossip, pettiness, and misogyny take the wheel in this personal account of how the double helix structure of DNA was discovered, and I expected a more of a respectful, fortunate attitude from Watson. But, in the end, he just made it sound like it was all him and Crick. He owes a better recollection to Rosalind Franklin that was the main contributor to this tremendous discovery. Her years of working with radiation for this discovery cost her life, thus it should be honored.FN"
205,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1793373-misty,4,"Let’s get this straight: James Watson is a shitty human being. Not even counting the racist and eugenist comments that disgraced him in later life - as portrayed in this book, he’s a sexist, privileged dilletante. He’s a real dick. And considering the fact that he’s a mid-century male in the inequitable field of academia, he’s true to type.Yet reading it again feels like having a conversation with 11th-grade me. That’s when I saw the BBC adaptation, with Jeff Goldblum as Watson, and that’s when I read this book for the first time. I was obsessed. I hung paper double helixes in my locker and signed “Watson and Crick are COOL” in my yearbook. I dreamt of being a famous scientist who burned with the desire to make a discovery.I cracked it open again (actually, listened to the audiobook), because I needed a story of an exciting scientific discovery in the era of coronavirus, where it feels like science can’t move fast enough. And I see why 11th-grade me loved it. The discovery itself is thrilling. The science is action-packed and inspired, not just egghead stuff. Sure I’d like to play with models and talk passionately with friends and make history along the way. Who knew science could be so dramatic? The discovery of the double helix is a story of obsession, competition and drive, with a touch of chance that gives it a certain beautiful sense of meant-to-be. It’s a story of people who, while shitty, are brilliant. When not thinking of sex and tennis, they are thinking about big problems in mad flashes of inspiration and passion. Even though someone like me (female, not white) would never be included in the circles described in this book, it was a part of my personal dysfunction that I loved the images of these nerdy but jocular clubs for brilliant people - brilliant men in backrooms and the charming women who were charismatic enough to enthrall them. I had trouble feeling like I belonged, so ironically I was drawn to an ethic with a rigid or elite definition of belonging - geniuses, intellectuals, artists. I dreamt about being worthy enough to find a place in their ranks and having external validation that I was good enough. The tension with Rosalind Franklin adds to the dramatic tension - data versus theory and the clash of personalities. Then I only saw the drama. Now I see that Watson’s comments on Franklin are unforgivable. I knew it was sexism at the time, but I didn’t take it seriously enough. I’m sad that I didn’t empathize with Rosalind Franklin; I didn’t allow myself to identify with her. I was fine accepting a world where I was on the sidelines, just as she is on the sidelines of this story. And I’m horrified that I watched this in school. Is this the right message to send to young women interested in science?I’m still in awe of the discovery and the incredibly faulty and human narrative that describes it. It’s ugly - but girlfriend, it’s real. I took my last real science class in high school - I never even approached becoming the brilliant scientist I once dreamed of being. But I still am thrilled by this book because it shows science as a very human and relatable affair. Who gets the credit is not based purely on good work. People are pushed out or not included. Like all matters, it is highly political. Science is supposed to be objective, but this story pops that balloon in a way that resonates, thanks to the polarization around science today. I’m 43 and far from 11th-grade me. And while I no longer idolize these men, I appreciate the way it portrays science, warts and all."
206,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7069868-john,3,"The ""Double Helix"" is a colorful and informative scientific memoir, with a clear narrative from a clear, singular, and candid viewpoint as though at the time of the discovery. However, this candid viewpoint is in the hands of a fellow who holds the wicked sting of cleverness without the benefit of wisdom, perspective, empathy, or reflection; which is sadly not atypical for when many of us were in our early twenties. As a result of this perspective, it's a book that really demands more context to not be misleading and to do justice to the other participants in the story. For that reason, I'm really glad to have read the ""Norton Critical Edition"" of the book, which includes the original set of scientific papers from all of the three core groups involved, additional memories of the participants, reviews from the time, and facts about how the book came to be published, all set off with framing essays from a peer of the author. With the papers, the multiple remembrances, and the contents of ""The Double Helix"" itself, the core scientific questions are clearly explained, though some of the further supplemental details will be unclear to some, for example to those who have forgotten or never learned what Bessel functions are all about.Though the original reviews were maybe over-sampled for the casual reader, they certainly had their insights. For example, one reviewer keenly noted that this was a very atypical for a work of science. The necessary experimental work was already done, and there was also relatively little to do in terms of the theoretical framing to the problem. Instead of a problem, a question, or a muddle, they had a puzzle on their hands, a geometric and chemical puzzle. This fact the central issue is a race to solve a puzzle one factor in making the central narrative an easy read.The events of the main memoir concern two years in the mid-twenties of the author. However, it was published sometime later (when the author was in his forties). I hope the author must have access to some diaries, to be able to access the sensibilities and details of the younger author, and decided to keep as close to those materials as he could for the sake of giving a very accurate view of the author as those events were happening. Otherwise, it's a very unseemly perspective for someone then forty. From my perspective, there is a pervasive sexism that seems unremarked upon in the reviews. It's hard to tell if that is entirely the point of view of the author, or whether he's particularly uncharitable to Rosalind Franklin because of her critiques on his theory while enjoying the company of young women in a rather impersonal way. Either way, it was with some enjoyment that I noted that the acknowledgements of Franklin and Gosling's paper thank Crick, but not Watson, which seems appropriate given the circumstances.Overall, if you just read the core narrative, it's very bracing but you'll surely be misled. With all of the contextual materials, it's now a bit more work but provides a full experience."
207,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45541682-sachin-h-n,4,"The Double Helix (once intended to be titled 'Honest Jim' and 'Base Pairs') is a Nobel Laureate, Dr. James Watson's account of one of the ground breaking discoveries in science. Having read this book after reading Brenda Maddox's 'The Dark Lady of DNA', to come to an appropriate conclusion, as far as the accuracy of this book is concerned, is difficult. This is more a novel than history; though a feast for a non scientific reader, a historian would definitely object to the way one of the most important discoveries in the field of molecular biology and genetics has been retold. This is more a fast paced thriller (which in fact was, with Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin of King's college, Linus Pauling of CalTech and our boys from Cavendish all trying to have a crack at it) than a history of science. Then, there is the matter of Rosalind Franklin, a prolific x ray cryptographer (dubbed 'Rosy' which the feminist lot find offensive) being discredited of her contribution for the sake. Watson says 'It is quite possible that there are inaccuracies here and there. The portrayal of many might not do justice to their caliber, for i write this as I saw when i was 23.' The words written in the epilogue trying to remedy disregard towards Rosalind and her contribution to elucidation of the structure of DNA probably arise from the need to make the book more acceptable. The book was published in spite of uncompromising opposition from Francis Crick, putting their friendship at risk. Many argue that this book is a symbol of blatant misogyny, painting a monster out of Rosalind, who in a manner has become an icon for feminists. It is very unfortunate that she was not recognized for what she was by many. Yet, that is by no means a reason to not hear out what Watson has to say. At the end of the day it all comes down to Science and the hunger of mankind to uncover it's secrets, of which DNA was a huge chunk from a great puzzle whose solution would open up innumerable applications in the field of medicine later on.  To understand how it all went about, this book is a good place to begin with."
208,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17466394-rustyj,3,"The Double Helix is a personal account of the discovery of the double helical structure of the DNA by one of the co-discoverers, James D. Watson.Watson, his co-collaborator Francis Crick (the senior of the two) alongwith Maurice Wilkins (who was at the same time independently working on the structure of the DNA) were awarded the Noble Prize in Medicine in 1963, for their discovery in 1953.Considering the importance of the discovery on the future of science, it ought to have been a thrilling account, coming from one of the participants. Unfortunately, the book disappoints on many counts.Before getting into the review, we should remember that Watson was barely 25 years old when the discovery was made.Surprisingly for a work of autobiography, the picture that emerges of Watson is that of a flippant, misogynist, careless, lazy person, who just happened to be at the right place at the right time.The portrayal of Rosalind Franklin (who worked with Wilkins), the X-ray crystollagrapher without whose X-ray images of the DNA molecule, the discovery of the helical structure would have been impossible, borders on the disrespectful. That Rosalind believed for a long while that the molecule was not a helix is a different matter.So is the portrayal of Linus Pauling, a brilliant Caltech scientist who was independently working to unravel the structure of the DNA. Pauling is painted as a wolf to be wary of, while it turns out to be pretty opposite.There are pages devoted to the social life of the author, his (absence of) sexual life, food habits and other mundane details that reflects a lack of maturity in handling a subject matter of gravity.By the end of it, one cannot but wonder, if Rosalind was deprived of a deserved Nobel and whether Watson was truly deserving of it. I am sure he was a brilliant scientist and was deserving of the Nobel, but the manner in which the subject matter has been handled, and indeed presented, makes one wonder if it was otherwise.Recommended for aficionados of science."
209,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11990289-kevin,4,"It's a breezy read, iconoclastic and yes, sexist, and at turns charming in its candor and youthful enthusiasm, intriguing in its machiavellian nature, and annoying in its provincial attitudes. In short, it's an expose and it stepped on some toes. Crick, Watson's chief collaborator, considered it ""a betrayal of friendship"" (paraphrase). There are serious questions regarding the portrayal of Rosalind Franklin, who is essentially cast as the villain in the piece, that are tempered (albeit inadequately) at the conclusion of the tale. My impression is that Watson's prime directive beyond producing a credible account of his interpretation of the mood and circumstances leading to the discovery of ""the secret of life"" is that he not commit the cardinal sin of being a bore about it. He is anything but that. I was most surprised by the lack of technical training Watson had, and even Crick to a lesser extent, going in. Their ""structural approach"" to DNA made this possible, through a technique of model building borrowed from Linus Pauling, who became their foil in the race to the landmark discovery. Watson backfilled gaps in his knowledge as needed, gaining a working proficiency in the fields of organic chemistry and X-ray analysis, for example. There was thus a deeper, philosophical divide between Crick & Watson and Franklin regarding the relative merits of theory and practice in the understanding of DNA. The imperatives for such ""backfilling"" become apparent at various stages in their search and these manifest themselves in several ingenious ploys used to thwart institutional barriers and to pump experts for information. These negotiations, which are fleshed out by Watson's characterization of the people and circumstances involved, infuse the narrative with an immediacy and sense of purpose that builds to a climax when the final pieces of the puzzle are literally put into place. In this fashion, Watson and Crick's discovery of the structure of DNA emerges as a true tour de force. This, IMHO, redeems the narrative and is why I give it four stars, with the noted caveats. At a minimum I would augment this account with a reading of Rosalind Franklin's Wikipedia page."
210,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8284707-louisa,4,"The idea was so simple that it had to be right.In this little book, Watson recounts the events and pieces of research leading up to the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA, but also the fierce competition between scientists in the US and England, the jealousy and irritation even among colleagues in the same science lab. (What a characters, now I understand what E.O. Wilson must have gone through with these people!) A short and engaging read, even a bit of a page turner. "

232,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29588908-kelley,3,"I was never in my depth with the science in this book. Not once. But Watson so powerfully captures the humanity of what was going on in the months leading up to the discovery of the structure of DNA that I was swept up in the story even as its facts flew over my head.Here’s what I mean “… we only wished to establish that at least one specific two-chain complementary helix was stereochemically possible. Until this was clear, the objection could be raised that, although our idea was aesthetically elegant, the shape of the sugar-phosphate backbone might not permit its existence. Happily, now we knew that this was not true, and so we had lunch, telling each other that a structure this pretty just had to exist.”My eyes filled with tears near the end as one collaborator after another looked at the model, checked the math, reviewed the chemistry and confirmed what he and his partners had done. I felt the magnitude of it.Watson was one of three scientists awarded the Nobel Prize for the discovery. He was 25 in 1953 when the structure was announced to the scientific world. This memoir was published about 15 years later, but it breathes the life of the younger man, from every boarding house or pub lunch to the breaks from chemical bonds to attend a party that was sure to attract all the international au pairs. Early in the book he takes science off its pedestal and sets it firmly on the ground. “One could not be a successful scientist without realizing that, in contrast to the popular conception supported by newspapers and mothers of scientists, a goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid.”And I was comforted as he read some early findings from another American working on the same problem. “Most of the language was above me, and so I could only get a general impression of his argument. I had no way of judging whether it made sense. The only thing I was sure of was that it was written with style.”He speaks often of the beauty he anticipated in the structure. It would never have occurred to me to describe it that way. I was fascinated, too, that the work was split between theory and equations and the literal, physical construction of the proposed structure. I could picture him – short American hair grown out into a floppy, European look – bent over the metal discs and spheres, manipulating one way, then another, determined to find the position that would hold them all in perfect order.He also speaks of a kind of meditation that bordered on obsession. It would distract him from girls, meals and sleep. Even moments not actively devoted to the question ended up feeding it: “I went ahead spending most evenings at the films, vaguely dreaming that any moment the answer would suddenly hit me.”At some point, I started noting the specific fields involved in (and impacted by) this discovery. Biology and math and genetics I could have anticipated, but then I wrote down specialties such as quantum mechanics, nucleic-acid biochemistry, and theoretical structural chemistry.To me, Watson’s account feels generously inclusive, naming scientist after scientist who contributed an answer to a question or a piece of research. He states in the beginning, in fact, that he would personally credit the discovery to five people, not just the three who received the prize. I’ve learned not everyone shares my opinion of his inclusiveness – and he seems to almost anticipate that in his opening words, acknowledging that any process over such a long time, involving so many people and so much work, is bound to be reported differently from various perspectives. I’m not qualified to give the definitive word, but I didn’t walk away feeling that he’d done this single-handedly or even with only the help of his fellow prize-winners.Don’t get bogged down by the paragraphs you don’t understand. I tried to reread them and despaired. You can appreciate the pursuit and the feat without grasping the details. I did."
233,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58444614-jenna,0,"A Scientist and A Writer	The Double Helix by James Watson is a well-written, informative autobiography about the lifelong workings of scientist James Watson and his partner, Francis Crick, in discovering the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid — more commonly known as DNA. James Watson’s and Francis Crick’s discovery was revolutionary to the scientific community. By discovering the double helix nature of all DNA molecules, it provided a gateway into further learning and understanding a myriad of important biological process such DNA replication, RNA replication, and protein production. In addition, the discovery allowed for an increase in understanding about the behavior of virus and infections. As a result, through research and development, scientists are able to create antibiotics and antiviral injections to improve human life. Therefore, Watson and Crick’s one discovery created a pathway for many discoveries. 	In cell biology, the central focus is DNA as everything always stems back to one’s DNA. Even though Watson is credited to for his work on discovering the DNA, his name is mentioned for a minute or two. Intrigued to learn more about his experiments, I decided to read his autobiography. After reading the book, James Watson does more than just recount the facts leading to the discovery. Through the use of his first-person narrator, he tells personal stories of the people he encountered and collaborated with. He shows the frustration and tedious work within all his trials. His thoughts and reasoning behind certain observations were made. Thus, as a reader, I was able to engage in the book and feel angry when Watson was angry or excited when an experiment had promising results. Additionally, it highlighted a major theme of success and failure. Every time, Watson and Crick endured a setback, they preserved until they reached a success. This concept of perseverance and success is important to young adults as they enter a world where failures and setbacks are inevitable. Overall, his autobiography was not a book filled with scientific jargon. Instead, it was a story with an actual plot, which made it more interesting. 	However, although the main focus of The Double Helix is about one of the greatest scientific discoveries, it also talks about a major scientific controversy. Watson talks about four people that helped him: Maurice Wilkins, Linus Pauling, Francis Crick, and Rosalind Franklin. In the 20th century, Rosalind Franklin was one of the few women working in a male-dominated field. It was her work with an x-ray cryptography that lead Watson and Crick to deduce a final conclusion. Without her knowing, Maurice Wilkins sent Watson and Crick the picture of Rosalind Franklin’s DNA x-ray, which clearly shows the double nature and overall structure of a DNA molecule. Therefore, Watson and Crick quickly learned that their prior structure was wrong. If it wasn’t for Rosalind Franklin, the two scientists would not have gotten the Nobel Prize, which excludes Franklin’s name. In his book, Watson unsympathetically describes Rosalind Frank, saying that “clearly Rosy had to go or be put in her place” when she would not give him what he wanted. In addition, because Rosalind Franklin was the only girl at that time, Watson and his colleagues made fun of her by calling her Rosy, which was demeaning. Watson carries this nickname into his book, thus showing the stereotypical behavior Rosalind endured. During this chapter of the book, the major theme of stereotyping against women in science in the 20th century was highlighted Overall, I would highly recommend this book who is fascinated by the subject of biology. Not only does it explain the science behind one of the greatest scientific discoveries of all time, it tells a story; one that is characterized by failures, successes, and stereotyping."
234,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92553179-faatihah-nayeem,2,"	As one of the most famous contributors to the biological sciences, you cannot read one biology textbook without learning about the Watson and Crick model. But, we don’t get the full story of how James Watson and Watson Crick determined the structure of DNA. Through their many tumults and endeavors, and even with the help of Rosalind Franklin’s X-ray diffraction of DNA to which she wasn’t given enough credit to, they eventually solved the mystery that codes all life.	The Double Helix is written and told through the eyes of American scientist James Watson where we get his perspective of his personal recollection of the discovery of the structure of DNA. He basically explains his journey from a little bit before his arrive in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1953, through his journey in collaboration with Francis Crick, to eventually the validation of their famous Watson and Crick model in 1953 where Watson, Crick, and another scientist named maurice Wilkins received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1962.	The book is structured and organized into Walston’s account from the intertwinement of letters and memories that reflect his thoughts. Watson chronologically shows the reader the process of how the structure of DNA was discovered and his partner relationship with Crick. He shows how science is discovered and studied through a human perspective instead of only from a factual standpoint. In fact, the terminology used in the book as well as the scientific comparisons are thoroughly explained and put into simpler terms for every audience to understand. Watson’s narrative illustrates how the science discoveries and long periods of research affect personal life. In fact, there are often shifts between the information of how each piece of the puzzle relates to the structure of DNA and the social/background lives of researchers.	Even though Watson mentioned some contributions from other scientists and their backgrounds, I felt as if he didn’t focus on how they were heavily involved. When it comes to these tremendous discoveries of science, we often see competition and separation which is exactly what the book shows. Although there were many characters working on this project, after it's DNA structure verification, Watson only emphasized himself and Cric as well as Wilkins. I was deeply disappointed how little he mentioned of Rosalind Franklin whose x-ray diffraction picture of the double helix was the major catalyst for the final determination of DNA’s structure. He often made sexist and controversial comments about her which I didn't like at all, discrediting her major contribution to science for she didn't receive a Nobel Prize. He often paints her as uncooperative and sour. This led me to kind of decreasingly like the book. Watson’s ego and arrogance shined through and his tone became proud.	Watson did successfully ensnare the reader into the dramatic events that led up to the discovery of DNA’s double helix structure; however, the problem was the drama that I felt like was created by himself. Gossip, pettiness, and misogyny take the wheel in this personal account of how the double helix structure of DNA was discovered, and I expected a more of a respectful, fortunate attitude from Watson. But, in the end, he just made it sound like it was all him and Crick. He owes a better recollection to Rosalind Franklin that was the main contributor to this tremendous discovery. Her years of working with radiation for this discovery cost her life, thus it should be honored.FN"
235,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1793373-misty,4,"Let’s get this straight: James Watson is a shitty human being. Not even counting the racist and eugenist comments that disgraced him in later life - as portrayed in this book, he’s a sexist, privileged dilletante. He’s a real dick. And considering the fact that he’s a mid-century male in the inequitable field of academia, he’s true to type.Yet reading it again feels like having a conversation with 11th-grade me. That’s when I saw the BBC adaptation, with Jeff Goldblum as Watson, and that’s when I read this book for the first time. I was obsessed. I hung paper double helixes in my locker and signed “Watson and Crick are COOL” in my yearbook. I dreamt of being a famous scientist who burned with the desire to make a discovery.I cracked it open again (actually, listened to the audiobook), because I needed a story of an exciting scientific discovery in the era of coronavirus, where it feels like science can’t move fast enough. And I see why 11th-grade me loved it. The discovery itself is thrilling. The science is action-packed and inspired, not just egghead stuff. Sure I’d like to play with models and talk passionately with friends and make history along the way. Who knew science could be so dramatic? The discovery of the double helix is a story of obsession, competition and drive, with a touch of chance that gives it a certain beautiful sense of meant-to-be. It’s a story of people who, while shitty, are brilliant. When not thinking of sex and tennis, they are thinking about big problems in mad flashes of inspiration and passion. Even though someone like me (female, not white) would never be included in the circles described in this book, it was a part of my personal dysfunction that I loved the images of these nerdy but jocular clubs for brilliant people - brilliant men in backrooms and the charming women who were charismatic enough to enthrall them. I had trouble feeling like I belonged, so ironically I was drawn to an ethic with a rigid or elite definition of belonging - geniuses, intellectuals, artists. I dreamt about being worthy enough to find a place in their ranks and having external validation that I was good enough. The tension with Rosalind Franklin adds to the dramatic tension - data versus theory and the clash of personalities. Then I only saw the drama. Now I see that Watson’s comments on Franklin are unforgivable. I knew it was sexism at the time, but I didn’t take it seriously enough. I’m sad that I didn’t empathize with Rosalind Franklin; I didn’t allow myself to identify with her. I was fine accepting a world where I was on the sidelines, just as she is on the sidelines of this story. And I’m horrified that I watched this in school. Is this the right message to send to young women interested in science?I’m still in awe of the discovery and the incredibly faulty and human narrative that describes it. It’s ugly - but girlfriend, it’s real. I took my last real science class in high school - I never even approached becoming the brilliant scientist I once dreamed of being. But I still am thrilled by this book because it shows science as a very human and relatable affair. Who gets the credit is not based purely on good work. People are pushed out or not included. Like all matters, it is highly political. Science is supposed to be objective, but this story pops that balloon in a way that resonates, thanks to the polarization around science today. I’m 43 and far from 11th-grade me. And while I no longer idolize these men, I appreciate the way it portrays science, warts and all."
236,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7069868-john,3,"The ""Double Helix"" is a colorful and informative scientific memoir, with a clear narrative from a clear, singular, and candid viewpoint as though at the time of the discovery. However, this candid viewpoint is in the hands of a fellow who holds the wicked sting of cleverness without the benefit of wisdom, perspective, empathy, or reflection; which is sadly not atypical for when many of us were in our early twenties. As a result of this perspective, it's a book that really demands more context to not be misleading and to do justice to the other participants in the story. For that reason, I'm really glad to have read the ""Norton Critical Edition"" of the book, which includes the original set of scientific papers from all of the three core groups involved, additional memories of the participants, reviews from the time, and facts about how the book came to be published, all set off with framing essays from a peer of the author. With the papers, the multiple remembrances, and the contents of ""The Double Helix"" itself, the core scientific questions are clearly explained, though some of the further supplemental details will be unclear to some, for example to those who have forgotten or never learned what Bessel functions are all about.Though the original reviews were maybe over-sampled for the casual reader, they certainly had their insights. For example, one reviewer keenly noted that this was a very atypical for a work of science. The necessary experimental work was already done, and there was also relatively little to do in terms of the theoretical framing to the problem. Instead of a problem, a question, or a muddle, they had a puzzle on their hands, a geometric and chemical puzzle. This fact the central issue is a race to solve a puzzle one factor in making the central narrative an easy read.The events of the main memoir concern two years in the mid-twenties of the author. However, it was published sometime later (when the author was in his forties). I hope the author must have access to some diaries, to be able to access the sensibilities and details of the younger author, and decided to keep as close to those materials as he could for the sake of giving a very accurate view of the author as those events were happening. Otherwise, it's a very unseemly perspective for someone then forty. From my perspective, there is a pervasive sexism that seems unremarked upon in the reviews. It's hard to tell if that is entirely the point of view of the author, or whether he's particularly uncharitable to Rosalind Franklin because of her critiques on his theory while enjoying the company of young women in a rather impersonal way. Either way, it was with some enjoyment that I noted that the acknowledgements of Franklin and Gosling's paper thank Crick, but not Watson, which seems appropriate given the circumstances.Overall, if you just read the core narrative, it's very bracing but you'll surely be misled. With all of the contextual materials, it's now a bit more work but provides a full experience."
237,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45541682-sachin-h-n,4,"The Double Helix (once intended to be titled 'Honest Jim' and 'Base Pairs') is a Nobel Laureate, Dr. James Watson's account of one of the ground breaking discoveries in science. Having read this book after reading Brenda Maddox's 'The Dark Lady of DNA', to come to an appropriate conclusion, as far as the accuracy of this book is concerned, is difficult. This is more a novel than history; though a feast for a non scientific reader, a historian would definitely object to the way one of the most important discoveries in the field of molecular biology and genetics has been retold. This is more a fast paced thriller (which in fact was, with Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin of King's college, Linus Pauling of CalTech and our boys from Cavendish all trying to have a crack at it) than a history of science. Then, there is the matter of Rosalind Franklin, a prolific x ray cryptographer (dubbed 'Rosy' which the feminist lot find offensive) being discredited of her contribution for the sake. Watson says 'It is quite possible that there are inaccuracies here and there. The portrayal of many might not do justice to their caliber, for i write this as I saw when i was 23.' The words written in the epilogue trying to remedy disregard towards Rosalind and her contribution to elucidation of the structure of DNA probably arise from the need to make the book more acceptable. The book was published in spite of uncompromising opposition from Francis Crick, putting their friendship at risk. Many argue that this book is a symbol of blatant misogyny, painting a monster out of Rosalind, who in a manner has become an icon for feminists. It is very unfortunate that she was not recognized for what she was by many. Yet, that is by no means a reason to not hear out what Watson has to say. At the end of the day it all comes down to Science and the hunger of mankind to uncover it's secrets, of which DNA was a huge chunk from a great puzzle whose solution would open up innumerable applications in the field of medicine later on.  To understand how it all went about, this book is a good place to begin with."
238,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17466394-rustyj,3,"The Double Helix is a personal account of the discovery of the double helical structure of the DNA by one of the co-discoverers, James D. Watson.Watson, his co-collaborator Francis Crick (the senior of the two) alongwith Maurice Wilkins (who was at the same time independently working on the structure of the DNA) were awarded the Noble Prize in Medicine in 1963, for their discovery in 1953.Considering the importance of the discovery on the future of science, it ought to have been a thrilling account, coming from one of the participants. Unfortunately, the book disappoints on many counts.Before getting into the review, we should remember that Watson was barely 25 years old when the discovery was made.Surprisingly for a work of autobiography, the picture that emerges of Watson is that of a flippant, misogynist, careless, lazy person, who just happened to be at the right place at the right time.The portrayal of Rosalind Franklin (who worked with Wilkins), the X-ray crystollagrapher without whose X-ray images of the DNA molecule, the discovery of the helical structure would have been impossible, borders on the disrespectful. That Rosalind believed for a long while that the molecule was not a helix is a different matter.So is the portrayal of Linus Pauling, a brilliant Caltech scientist who was independently working to unravel the structure of the DNA. Pauling is painted as a wolf to be wary of, while it turns out to be pretty opposite.There are pages devoted to the social life of the author, his (absence of) sexual life, food habits and other mundane details that reflects a lack of maturity in handling a subject matter of gravity.By the end of it, one cannot but wonder, if Rosalind was deprived of a deserved Nobel and whether Watson was truly deserving of it. I am sure he was a brilliant scientist and was deserving of the Nobel, but the manner in which the subject matter has been handled, and indeed presented, makes one wonder if it was otherwise.Recommended for aficionados of science."
239,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11990289-kevin,4,"It's a breezy read, iconoclastic and yes, sexist, and at turns charming in its candor and youthful enthusiasm, intriguing in its machiavellian nature, and annoying in its provincial attitudes. In short, it's an expose and it stepped on some toes. Crick, Watson's chief collaborator, considered it ""a betrayal of friendship"" (paraphrase). There are serious questions regarding the portrayal of Rosalind Franklin, who is essentially cast as the villain in the piece, that are tempered (albeit inadequately) at the conclusion of the tale. My impression is that Watson's prime directive beyond producing a credible account of his interpretation of the mood and circumstances leading to the discovery of ""the secret of life"" is that he not commit the cardinal sin of being a bore about it. He is anything but that. I was most surprised by the lack of technical training Watson had, and even Crick to a lesser extent, going in. Their ""structural approach"" to DNA made this possible, through a technique of model building borrowed from Linus Pauling, who became their foil in the race to the landmark discovery. Watson backfilled gaps in his knowledge as needed, gaining a working proficiency in the fields of organic chemistry and X-ray analysis, for example. There was thus a deeper, philosophical divide between Crick & Watson and Franklin regarding the relative merits of theory and practice in the understanding of DNA. The imperatives for such ""backfilling"" become apparent at various stages in their search and these manifest themselves in several ingenious ploys used to thwart institutional barriers and to pump experts for information. These negotiations, which are fleshed out by Watson's characterization of the people and circumstances involved, infuse the narrative with an immediacy and sense of purpose that builds to a climax when the final pieces of the puzzle are literally put into place. In this fashion, Watson and Crick's discovery of the structure of DNA emerges as a true tour de force. This, IMHO, redeems the narrative and is why I give it four stars, with the noted caveats. At a minimum I would augment this account with a reading of Rosalind Franklin's Wikipedia page."
240,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8284707-louisa,4,"The idea was so simple that it had to be right.In this little book, Watson recounts the events and pieces of research leading up to the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA, but also the fierce competition between scientists in the US and England, the jealousy and irritation even among colleagues in the same science lab.

But Watson so powerfully captures the humanity of what was going on in the months leading up to the discovery of the structure of DNA that I was swept up in the story even as its facts flew over my head.Here’s what I mean “… we only wished to establish that at least one specific two-chain complementary helix was stereochemically possible. Until this was clear, the objection could be raised that, although our idea was aesthetically elegant, the shape of the sugar-phosphate backbone might not permit its existence. Happily, now we knew that this was not true, and so we had lunch, telling each other that a structure this pretty just had to exist.”My eyes filled with tears near the end as one collaborator after another looked at the model, checked the math, reviewed the chemistry and confirmed what he and his partners had done. I felt the magnitude of it.Watson was one of three scientists awarded the Nobel Prize for the discovery. He was 25 in 1953 when the structure was announced to the scientific world. This memoir was published about 15 years later, but it breathes the life of the younger man, from every boarding house or pub lunch to the breaks from chemical bonds to attend a party that was sure to attract all the international au pairs. Early in the book he takes science off its pedestal and sets it firmly on the ground. “One could not be a successful scientist without realizing that, in contrast to the popular conception supported by newspapers and mothers of scientists, a goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid.”And I was comforted as he read some early findings from another American working on the same problem. “Most of the language was above me, and so I could only get a general impression of his argument. I had no way of judging whether it made sense. The only thing I was sure of was that it was written with style.”He speaks often of the beauty he anticipated in the structure. It would never have occurred to me to describe it that way. I was fascinated, too, that the work was split between theory and equations and the literal, physical construction of the proposed structure. I could picture him – short American hair grown out into a floppy, European look – bent over the metal discs and spheres, manipulating one way, then another, determined to find the position that would hold them all in perfect order.He also speaks of a kind of meditation that bordered on obsession. It would distract him from girls, meals and sleep. Even moments not actively devoted to the question ended up feeding it: “I went ahead spending most evenings at the films, vaguely dreaming that any moment the answer would suddenly hit me.”At some point, I started noting the specific fields involved in (and impacted by) this discovery. Biology and math and genetics I could have anticipated, but then I wrote down specialties such as quantum mechanics, nucleic-acid biochemistry, and theoretical structural chemistry.To me, Watson’s account feels generously inclusive, naming scientist after scientist who contributed an answer to a question or a piece of research. He states in the beginning, in fact, that he would personally credit the discovery to five people, not just the three who received the prize. I’ve learned not everyone shares my opinion of his inclusiveness – and he seems to almost anticipate that in his opening words, acknowledging that any process over such a long time, involving so many people and so much work, is bound to be reported differently from various perspectives. I’m not qualified to give the definitive word, but I didn’t walk away feeling that he’d done this single-handedly or even with only the help of his fellow prize-winners.Don’t get bogged down by the paragraphs you don’t understand. I tried to reread them and despaired. You can appreciate the pursuit and the feat without grasping the details. I did."
263,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58444614-jenna,0,"A Scientist and A Writer	The Double Helix by James Watson is a well-written, informative autobiography about the lifelong workings of scientist James Watson and his partner, Francis Crick, in discovering the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid — more commonly known as DNA. James Watson’s and Francis Crick’s discovery was revolutionary to the scientific community. By discovering the double helix nature of all DNA molecules, it provided a gateway into further learning and understanding a myriad of important biological process such DNA replication, RNA replication, and protein production. In addition, the discovery allowed for an increase in understanding about the behavior of virus and infections. As a result, through research and development, scientists are able to create antibiotics and antiviral injections to improve human life. Therefore, Watson and Crick’s one discovery created a pathway for many discoveries. 	In cell biology, the central focus is DNA as everything always stems back to one’s DNA. Even though Watson is credited to for his work on discovering the DNA, his name is mentioned for a minute or two. Intrigued to learn more about his experiments, I decided to read his autobiography. After reading the book, James Watson does more than just recount the facts leading to the discovery. Through the use of his first-person narrator, he tells personal stories of the people he encountered and collaborated with. He shows the frustration and tedious work within all his trials. His thoughts and reasoning behind certain observations were made. Thus, as a reader, I was able to engage in the book and feel angry when Watson was angry or excited when an experiment had promising results. Additionally, it highlighted a major theme of success and failure. Every time, Watson and Crick endured a setback, they preserved until they reached a success. This concept of perseverance and success is important to young adults as they enter a world where failures and setbacks are inevitable. Overall, his autobiography was not a book filled with scientific jargon. Instead, it was a story with an actual plot, which made it more interesting. 	However, although the main focus of The Double Helix is about one of the greatest scientific discoveries, it also talks about a major scientific controversy. Watson talks about four people that helped him: Maurice Wilkins, Linus Pauling, Francis Crick, and Rosalind Franklin. In the 20th century, Rosalind Franklin was one of the few women working in a male-dominated field. It was her work with an x-ray cryptography that lead Watson and Crick to deduce a final conclusion. Without her knowing, Maurice Wilkins sent Watson and Crick the picture of Rosalind Franklin’s DNA x-ray, which clearly shows the double nature and overall structure of a DNA molecule. Therefore, Watson and Crick quickly learned that their prior structure was wrong. If it wasn’t for Rosalind Franklin, the two scientists would not have gotten the Nobel Prize, which excludes Franklin’s name. In his book, Watson unsympathetically describes Rosalind Frank, saying that “clearly Rosy had to go or be put in her place” when she would not give him what he wanted. In addition, because Rosalind Franklin was the only girl at that time, Watson and his colleagues made fun of her by calling her Rosy, which was demeaning. Watson carries this nickname into his book, thus showing the stereotypical behavior Rosalind endured. During this chapter of the book, the major theme of stereotyping against women in science in the 20th century was highlighted Overall, I would highly recommend this book who is fascinated by the subject of biology. Not only does it explain the science behind one of the greatest scientific discoveries of all time, it tells a story; one that is characterized by failures, successes, and stereotyping."
264,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92553179-faatihah-nayeem,2,"	As one of the most famous contributors to the biological sciences, you cannot read one biology textbook without learning about the Watson and Crick model. But, we don’t get the full story of how James Watson and Watson Crick determined the structure of DNA. Through their many tumults and endeavors, and even with the help of Rosalind Franklin’s X-ray diffraction of DNA to which she wasn’t given enough credit to, they eventually solved the mystery that codes all life.	The Double Helix is written and told through the eyes of American scientist James Watson where we get his perspective of his personal recollection of the discovery of the structure of DNA. He basically explains his journey from a little bit before his arrive in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1953, through his journey in collaboration with Francis Crick, to eventually the validation of their famous Watson and Crick model in 1953 where Watson, Crick, and another scientist named maurice Wilkins received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1962.	The book is structured and organized into Walston’s account from the intertwinement of letters and memories that reflect his thoughts. Watson chronologically shows the reader the process of how the structure of DNA was discovered and his partner relationship with Crick. He shows how science is discovered and studied through a human perspective instead of only from a factual standpoint. In fact, the terminology used in the book as well as the scientific comparisons are thoroughly explained and put into simpler terms for every audience to understand. Watson’s narrative illustrates how the science discoveries and long periods of research affect personal life. In fact, there are often shifts between the information of how each piece of the puzzle relates to the structure of DNA and the social/background lives of researchers.	Even though Watson mentioned some contributions from other scientists and their backgrounds, I felt as if he didn’t focus on how they were heavily involved. When it comes to these tremendous discoveries of science, we often see competition and separation which is exactly what the book shows. Although there were many characters working on this project, after it's DNA structure verification, Watson only emphasized himself and Cric as well as Wilkins. I was deeply disappointed how little he mentioned of Rosalind Franklin whose x-ray diffraction picture of the double helix was the major catalyst for the final determination of DNA’s structure. He often made sexist and controversial comments about her which I didn't like at all, discrediting her major contribution to science for she didn't receive a Nobel Prize. He often paints her as uncooperative and sour. This led me to kind of decreasingly like the book. Watson’s ego and arrogance shined through and his tone became proud.	Watson did successfully ensnare the reader into the dramatic events that led up to the discovery of DNA’s double helix structure; however, the problem was the drama that I felt like was created by himself. Gossip, pettiness, and misogyny take the wheel in this personal account of how the double helix structure of DNA was discovered, and I expected a more of a respectful, fortunate attitude from Watson. But, in the end, he just made it sound like it was all him and Crick. He owes a better recollection to Rosalind Franklin that was the main contributor to this tremendous discovery. Her years of working with radiation for this discovery cost her life, thus it should be honored.FN"
265,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1793373-misty,4,"Let’s get this straight: James Watson is a shitty human being. Not even counting the racist and eugenist comments that disgraced him in later life - as portrayed in this book, he’s a sexist, privileged dilletante. He’s a real dick. And considering the fact that he’s a mid-century male in the inequitable field of academia, he’s true to type.Yet reading it again feels like having a conversation with 11th-grade me. That’s when I saw the BBC adaptation, with Jeff Goldblum as Watson, and that’s when I read this book for the first time. I was obsessed. I hung paper double helixes in my locker and signed “Watson and Crick are COOL” in my yearbook. I dreamt of being a famous scientist who burned with the desire to make a discovery.I cracked it open again (actually, listened to the audiobook), because I needed a story of an exciting scientific discovery in the era of coronavirus, where it feels like science can’t move fast enough. And I see why 11th-grade me loved it. The discovery itself is thrilling. The science is action-packed and inspired, not just egghead stuff. Sure I’d like to play with models and talk passionately with friends and make history along the way. Who knew science could be so dramatic? The discovery of the double helix is a story of obsession, competition and drive, with a touch of chance that gives it a certain beautiful sense of meant-to-be. It’s a story of people who, while shitty, are brilliant. When not thinking of sex and tennis, they are thinking about big problems in mad flashes of inspiration and passion. Even though someone like me (female, not white) would never be included in the circles described in this book, it was a part of my personal dysfunction that I loved the images of these nerdy but jocular clubs for brilliant people - brilliant men in backrooms and the charming women who were charismatic enough to enthrall them. I had trouble feeling like I belonged, so ironically I was drawn to an ethic with a rigid or elite definition of belonging - geniuses, intellectuals, artists. I dreamt about being worthy enough to find a place in their ranks and having external validation that I was good enough. The tension with Rosalind Franklin adds to the dramatic tension - data versus theory and the clash of personalities. Then I only saw the drama. Now I see that Watson’s comments on Franklin are unforgivable. I knew it was sexism at the time, but I didn’t take it seriously enough. I’m sad that I didn’t empathize with Rosalind Franklin; I didn’t allow myself to identify with her. I was fine accepting a world where I was on the sidelines, just as she is on the sidelines of this story. And I’m horrified that I watched this in school. Is this the right message to send to young women interested in science?I’m still in awe of the discovery and the incredibly faulty and human narrative that describes it. It’s ugly - but girlfriend, it’s real. I took my last real science class in high school - I never even approached becoming the brilliant scientist I once dreamed of being. But I still am thrilled by this book because it shows science as a very human and relatable affair. Who gets the credit is not based purely on good work. People are pushed out or not included. Like all matters, it is highly political. Science is supposed to be objective, but this story pops that balloon in a way that resonates, thanks to the polarization around science today. I’m 43 and far from 11th-grade me. And while I no longer idolize these men, I appreciate the way it portrays science, warts and all."
266,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7069868-john,3,"The ""Double Helix"" is a colorful and informative scientific memoir, with a clear narrative from a clear, singular, and candid viewpoint as though at the time of the discovery. However, this candid viewpoint is in the hands of a fellow who holds the wicked sting of cleverness without the benefit of wisdom, perspective, empathy, or reflection; which is sadly not atypical for when many of us were in our early twenties. As a result of this perspective, it's a book that really demands more context to not be misleading and to do justice to the other participants in the story. For that reason, I'm really glad to have read the ""Norton Critical Edition"" of the book, which includes the original set of scientific papers from all of the three core groups involved, additional memories of the participants, reviews from the time, and facts about how the book came to be published, all set off with framing essays from a peer of the author. With the papers, the multiple remembrances, and the contents of ""The Double Helix"" itself, the core scientific questions are clearly explained, though some of the further supplemental details will be unclear to some, for example to those who have forgotten or never learned what Bessel functions are all about.Though the original reviews were maybe over-sampled for the casual reader, they certainly had their insights. For example, one reviewer keenly noted that this was a very atypical for a work of science. The necessary experimental work was already done, and there was also relatively little to do in terms of the theoretical framing to the problem. Instead of a problem, a question, or a muddle, they had a puzzle on their hands, a geometric and chemical puzzle. This fact the central issue is a race to solve a puzzle one factor in making the central narrative an easy read.The events of the main memoir concern two years in the mid-twenties of the author. However, it was published sometime later (when the author was in his forties). I hope the author must have access to some diaries, to be able to access the sensibilities and details of the younger author, and decided to keep as close to those materials as he could for the sake of giving a very accurate view of the author as those events were happening. Otherwise, it's a very unseemly perspective for someone then forty. From my perspective, there is a pervasive sexism that seems unremarked upon in the reviews. It's hard to tell if that is entirely the point of view of the author, or whether he's particularly uncharitable to Rosalind Franklin because of her critiques on his theory while enjoying the company of young women in a rather impersonal way. Either way, it was with some enjoyment that I noted that the acknowledgements of Franklin and Gosling's paper thank Crick, but not Watson, which seems appropriate given the circumstances.Overall, if you just read the core narrative, it's very bracing but you'll surely be misled. With all of the contextual materials, it's now a bit more work but provides a full experience."
267,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45541682-sachin-h-n,4,"The Double Helix (once intended to be titled 'Honest Jim' and 'Base Pairs') is a Nobel Laureate, Dr. James Watson's account of one of the ground breaking discoveries in science. Having read this book after reading Brenda Maddox's 'The Dark Lady of DNA', to come to an appropriate conclusion, as far as the accuracy of this book is concerned, is difficult. This is more a novel than history; though a feast for a non scientific reader, a historian would definitely object to the way one of the most important discoveries in the field of molecular biology and genetics has been retold. This is more a fast paced thriller (which in fact was, with Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin of King's college, Linus Pauling of CalTech and our boys from Cavendish all trying to have a crack at it) than a history of science. Then, there is the matter of Rosalind Franklin, a prolific x ray cryptographer (dubbed 'Rosy' which the feminist lot find offensive) being discredited of her contribution for the sake. Watson says 'It is quite possible that there are inaccuracies here and there. The portrayal of many might not do justice to their caliber, for i write this as I saw when i was 23.' The words written in the epilogue trying to remedy disregard towards Rosalind and her contribution to elucidation of the structure of DNA probably arise from the need to make the book more acceptable. The book was published in spite of uncompromising opposition from Francis Crick, putting their friendship at risk. Many argue that this book is a symbol of blatant misogyny, painting a monster out of Rosalind, who in a manner has become an icon for feminists. It is very unfortunate that she was not recognized for what she was by many. Yet, that is by no means a reason to not hear out what Watson has to say. At the end of the day it all comes down to Science and the hunger of mankind to uncover it's secrets, of which DNA was a huge chunk from a great puzzle whose solution would open up innumerable applications in the field of medicine later on.  To understand how it all went about, this book is a good place to begin with."
268,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17466394-rustyj,3,"The Double Helix is a personal account of the discovery of the double helical structure of the DNA by one of the co-discoverers, James D. Watson.Watson, his co-collaborator Francis Crick (the senior of the two) alongwith Maurice Wilkins (who was at the same time independently working on the structure of the DNA) were awarded the Noble Prize in Medicine in 1963, for their discovery in 1953.Considering the importance of the discovery on the future of science, it ought to have been a thrilling account, coming from one of the participants. Unfortunately, the book disappoints on many counts.Before getting into the review, we should remember that Watson was barely 25 years old when the discovery was made.Surprisingly for a work of autobiography, the picture that emerges of Watson is that of a flippant, misogynist, careless, lazy person, who just happened to be at the right place at the right time.The portrayal of Rosalind Franklin (who worked with Wilkins), the X-ray crystollagrapher without whose X-ray images of the DNA molecule, the discovery of the helical structure would have been impossible, borders on the disrespectful. That Rosalind believed for a long while that the molecule was not a helix is a different matter.So is the portrayal of Linus Pauling, a brilliant Caltech scientist who was independently working to unravel the structure of the DNA. Pauling is painted as a wolf to be wary of, while it turns out to be pretty opposite.There are pages devoted to the social life of the author, his (absence of) sexual life, food habits and other mundane details that reflects a lack of maturity in handling a subject matter of gravity.By the end of it, one cannot but wonder, if Rosalind was deprived of a deserved Nobel and whether Watson was truly deserving of it. I am sure he was a brilliant scientist and was deserving of the Nobel, but the manner in which the subject matter has been handled, and indeed presented, makes one wonder if it was otherwise.Recommended for aficionados of science."
269,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11990289-kevin,4,"It's a breezy read, iconoclastic and yes, sexist, and at turns charming in its candor and youthful enthusiasm, intriguing in its machiavellian nature, and annoying in its provincial attitudes. In short, it's an expose and it stepped on some toes. Crick, Watson's chief collaborator, considered it ""a betrayal of friendship"" (paraphrase). There are serious questions regarding the portrayal of Rosalind Franklin, who is essentially cast as the villain in the piece, that are tempered (albeit inadequately) at the conclusion of the tale. My impression is that Watson's prime directive beyond producing a credible account of his interpretation of the mood and circumstances leading to the discovery of ""the secret of life"" is that he not commit the cardinal sin of being a bore about it. He is anything but that. I was most surprised by the lack of technical training Watson had, and even Crick to a lesser extent, going in. Their ""structural approach"" to DNA made this possible, through a technique of model building borrowed from Linus Pauling, who became their foil in the race to the landmark discovery. Watson backfilled gaps in his knowledge as needed, gaining a working proficiency in the fields of organic chemistry and X-ray analysis, for example. There was thus a deeper, philosophical divide between Crick & Watson and Franklin regarding the relative merits of theory and practice in the understanding of DNA. The imperatives for such ""backfilling"" become apparent at various stages in their search and these manifest themselves in several ingenious ploys used to thwart institutional barriers and to pump experts for information. These negotiations, which are fleshed out by Watson's characterization of the people and circumstances involved, infuse the narrative with an immediacy and sense of purpose that builds to a climax when the final pieces of the puzzle are literally put into place. In this fashion, Watson and Crick's discovery of the structure of DNA emerges as a true tour de force. This, IMHO, redeems the narrative and is why I give it four stars, with the noted caveats. At a minimum I would augment this account with a reading of Rosalind Franklin's Wikipedia page."

Early in the book he takes science off its pedestal and sets it firmly on the ground. “One could not be a successful scientist without realizing that, in contrast to the popular conception supported by newspapers and mothers of scientists, a goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid.”And I was comforted as he read some early findings from another American working on the same problem. “Most of the language was above me, and so I could only get a general impression of his argument. I had no way of judging whether it made sense. The only thing I was sure of was that it was written with style.”He speaks often of the beauty he anticipated in the structure. It would never have occurred to me to describe it that way. I was fascinated, too, that the work was split between theory and equations and the literal, physical construction of the proposed structure. I could picture him – short American hair grown out into a floppy, European look – bent over the metal discs and spheres, manipulating one way, then another, determined to find the position that would hold them all in perfect order.He also speaks of a kind of meditation that bordered on obsession. It would distract him from girls, meals and sleep. Even moments not actively devoted to the question ended up feeding it: “I went ahead spending most evenings at the films, vaguely dreaming that any moment the answer would suddenly hit me.”At some point, I started noting the specific fields involved in (and impacted by) this discovery. Biology and math and genetics I could have anticipated, but then I wrote down specialties such as quantum mechanics, nucleic-acid biochemistry, and theoretical structural chemistry.To me, Watson’s account feels generously inclusive, naming scientist after scientist who contributed an answer to a question or a piece of research. He states in the beginning, in fact, that he would personally credit the discovery to five people, not just the three who received the prize. I’ve learned not everyone shares my opinion of his inclusiveness – and he seems to almost anticipate that in his opening words, acknowledging that any process over such a long time, involving so many people and so much work, is bound to be reported differently from various perspectives. I’m not qualified to give the definitive word, but I didn’t walk away feeling that he’d done this single-handedly or even with only the help of his fellow prize-winners.Don’t get bogged down by the paragraphs you don’t understand. I tried to reread them and despaired. You can appreciate the pursuit and the feat without grasping the details. I did."
293,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58444614-jenna,0,"A Scientist and A Writer	The Double Helix by James Watson is a well-written, informative autobiography about the lifelong workings of scientist James Watson and his partner, Francis Crick, in discovering the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid — more commonly known as DNA. James Watson’s and Francis Crick’s discovery was revolutionary to the scientific community. By discovering the double helix nature of all DNA molecules, it provided a gateway into further learning and understanding a myriad of important biological process such DNA replication, RNA replication, and protein production. In addition, the discovery allowed for an increase in understanding about the behavior of virus and infections. As a result, through research and development, scientists are able to create antibiotics and antiviral injections to improve human life. Therefore, Watson and Crick’s one discovery created a pathway for many discoveries. 	In cell biology, the central focus is DNA as everything always stems back to one’s DNA. Even though Watson is credited to for his work on discovering the DNA, his name is mentioned for a minute or two. Intrigued to learn more about his experiments, I decided to read his autobiography. After reading the book, James Watson does more than just recount the facts leading to the discovery. Through the use of his first-person narrator, he tells personal stories of the people he encountered and collaborated with. He shows the frustration and tedious work within all his trials. His thoughts and reasoning behind certain observations were made. Thus, as a reader, I was able to engage in the book and feel angry when Watson was angry or excited when an experiment had promising results. Additionally, it highlighted a major theme of success and failure. Every time, Watson and Crick endured a setback, they preserved until they reached a success. This concept of perseverance and success is important to young adults as they enter a world where failures and setbacks are inevitable. Overall, his autobiography was not a book filled with scientific jargon. Instead, it was a story with an actual plot, which made it more interesting. 	However, although the main focus of The Double Helix is about one of the greatest scientific discoveries, it also talks about a major scientific controversy. Watson talks about four people that helped him: Maurice Wilkins, Linus Pauling, Francis Crick, and Rosalind Franklin. In the 20th century, Rosalind Franklin was one of the few women working in a male-dominated field. It was her work with an x-ray cryptography that lead Watson and Crick to deduce a final conclusion. Without her knowing, Maurice Wilkins sent Watson and Crick the picture of Rosalind Franklin’s DNA x-ray, which clearly shows the double nature and overall structure of a DNA molecule. Therefore, Watson and Crick quickly learned that their prior structure was wrong. If it wasn’t for Rosalind Franklin, the two scientists would not have gotten the Nobel Prize, which excludes Franklin’s name. In his book, Watson unsympathetically describes Rosalind Frank, saying that “clearly Rosy had to go or be put in her place” when she would not give him what he wanted. In addition, because Rosalind Franklin was the only girl at that time, Watson and his colleagues made fun of her by calling her Rosy, which was demeaning. Watson carries this nickname into his book, thus showing the stereotypical behavior Rosalind endured. During this chapter of the book, the major theme of stereotyping against women in science in the 20th century was highlighted Overall, I would highly recommend this book who is fascinated by the subject of biology. Not only does it explain the science behind one of the greatest scientific discoveries of all time, it tells a story; one that is characterized by failures, successes, and stereotyping."

But, we don’t get the full story of how James Watson and Watson Crick determined the structure of DNA. Through their many tumults and endeavors, and even with the help of Rosalind Franklin’s X-ray diffraction of DNA to which she wasn’t given enough credit to, they eventually solved the mystery that codes all life.	The Double Helix is written and told through the eyes of American scientist James Watson where we get his perspective of his personal recollection of the discovery of the structure of DNA. He basically explains his journey from a little bit before his arrive in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1953, through his journey in collaboration with Francis Crick, to eventually the validation of their famous Watson and Crick model in 1953 where Watson, Crick, and another scientist named maurice Wilkins received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1962.	The book is structured and organized into Walston’s account from the intertwinement of letters and memories that reflect his thoughts. Watson chronologically shows the reader the process of how the structure of DNA was discovered and his partner relationship with Crick. He shows how science is discovered and studied through a human perspective instead of only from a factual standpoint. In fact, the terminology used in the book as well as the scientific comparisons are thoroughly explained and put into simpler terms for every audience to understand. Watson’s narrative illustrates how the science discoveries and long periods of research affect personal life. In fact, there are often shifts between the information of how each piece of the puzzle relates to the structure of DNA and the social/background lives of researchers.	Even though Watson mentioned some contributions from other scientists and their backgrounds, I felt as if he didn’t focus on how they were heavily involved. When it comes to these tremendous discoveries of science, we often see competition and separation which is exactly what the book shows. Although there were many characters working on this project, after it's DNA structure verification, Watson only emphasized himself and Cric as well as Wilkins. I was deeply disappointed how little he mentioned of Rosalind Franklin whose x-ray diffraction picture of the double helix was the major catalyst for the final determination of DNA’s structure. He often made sexist and controversial comments about her which I didn't like at all, discrediting her major contribution to science for she didn't receive a Nobel Prize. He often paints her as uncooperative and sour. This led me to kind of decreasingly like the book. Watson’s ego and arrogance shined through and his tone became proud.	Watson did successfully ensnare the reader into the dramatic events that led up to the discovery of DNA’s double helix structure; however, the problem was the drama that I felt like was created by himself. Gossip, pettiness, and misogyny take the wheel in this personal account of how the double helix structure of DNA was discovered, and I expected a more of a respectful, fortunate attitude from Watson. But, in the end, he just made it sound like it was all him and Crick. He owes a better recollection to Rosalind Franklin that was the main contributor to this tremendous discovery. Her years of working with radiation for this discovery cost her life, thus it should be honored.FN"

Not even counting the racist and eugenist comments that disgraced him in later life - as portrayed in this book, he’s a sexist, privileged dilletante. He’s a real dick. And considering the fact that he’s a mid-century male in the inequitable field of academia, he’s true to type.Yet reading it again feels like having a conversation with 11th-grade me. That’s when I saw the BBC adaptation, with Jeff Goldblum as Watson, and that’s when I read this book for the first time. I was obsessed. I hung paper double helixes in my locker and signed “Watson and Crick are COOL” in my yearbook. I dreamt of being a famous scientist who burned with the desire to make a discovery.I cracked it open again (actually, listened to the audiobook), because I needed a story of an exciting scientific discovery in the era of coronavirus, where it feels like science can’t move fast enough. And I see why 11th-grade me loved it. The discovery itself is thrilling. The science is action-packed and inspired, not just egghead stuff. Sure I’d like to play with models and talk passionately with friends and make history along the way. Who knew science could be so dramatic? The discovery of the double helix is a story of obsession, competition and drive, with a touch of chance that gives it a certain beautiful sense of meant-to-be. It’s a story of people who, while shitty, are brilliant. When not thinking of sex and tennis, they are thinking about big problems in mad flashes of inspiration and passion. Even though someone like me (female, not white) would never be included in the circles described in this book, it was a part of my personal dysfunction that I loved the images of these nerdy but jocular clubs for brilliant people - brilliant men in backrooms and the charming women who were charismatic enough to enthrall them. I had trouble feeling like I belonged, so ironically I was drawn to an ethic with a rigid or elite definition of belonging - geniuses, intellectuals, artists. I dreamt about being worthy enough to find a place in their ranks and having external validation that I was good enough. The tension with Rosalind Franklin adds to the dramatic tension - data versus theory and the clash of personalities. Then I only saw the drama. Now I see that Watson’s comments on Franklin are unforgivable. I knew it was sexism at the time, but I didn’t take it seriously enough. I’m sad that I didn’t empathize with Rosalind Franklin; I didn’t allow myself to identify with her. I was fine accepting a world where I was on the sidelines, just as she is on the sidelines of this story. And I’m horrified that I watched this in school. Is this the right message to send to young women interested in science?I’m still in awe of the discovery and the incredibly faulty and human narrative that describes it. It’s ugly - but girlfriend, it’s real. I took my last real science class in high school - I never even approached becoming the brilliant scientist I once dreamed of being. But I still am thrilled by this book because it shows science as a very human and relatable affair. Who gets the credit is not based purely on good work. People are pushed out or not included. Like all matters, it is highly political. Science is supposed to be objective, but this story pops that balloon in a way that resonates, thanks to the polarization around science today. I’m 43 and far from 11th-grade me. And while I no longer idolize these men, I appreciate the way it portrays science, warts and all."
296,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7069868-john,3,"The ""Double Helix"" is a colorful and informative scientific memoir, with a clear narrative from a clear, singular, and candid viewpoint as though at the time of the discovery. However, this candid viewpoint is in the hands of a fellow who holds the wicked sting of cleverness without the benefit of wisdom, perspective, empathy, or reflection; which is sadly not atypical for when many of us were in our early twenties. As a result of this perspective, it's a book that really demands more context to not be misleading and to do justice to the other participants in the story. For that reason, I'm really glad to have read the ""Norton Critical Edition"" of the book, which includes the original set of scientific papers from all of the three core groups involved, additional memories of the participants, reviews from the time, and facts about how the book came to be published, all set off with framing essays from a peer of the author. With the papers, the multiple remembrances, and the contents of ""The Double Helix"" itself, the core scientific questions are clearly explained, though some of the further supplemental details will be unclear to some, for example to those who have forgotten or never learned what Bessel functions are all about.Though the original reviews were maybe over-sampled for the casual reader, they certainly had their insights. For example, one reviewer keenly noted that this was a very atypical for a work of science. The necessary experimental work was already done, and there was also relatively little to do in terms of the theoretical framing to the problem. Instead of a problem, a question, or a muddle, they had a puzzle on their hands, a geometric and chemical puzzle. This fact the central issue is a race to solve a puzzle one factor in making the central narrative an easy read.The events of the main memoir concern two years in the mid-twenties of the author. However, it was published sometime later (when the author was in his forties). I hope the author must have access to some diaries, to be able to access the sensibilities and details of the younger author, and decided to keep as close to those materials as he could for the sake of giving a very accurate view of the author as those events were happening. Otherwise, it's a very unseemly perspective for someone then forty. From my perspective, there is a pervasive sexism that seems unremarked upon in the reviews. It's hard to tell if that is entirely the point of view of the author, or whether he's particularly uncharitable to Rosalind Franklin because of her critiques on his theory while enjoying the company of young women in a rather impersonal way. Either way, it was with some enjoyment that I noted that the acknowledgements of Franklin and Gosling's paper thank Crick, but not Watson, which seems appropriate given the circumstances.Overall, if you just read the core narrative, it's very bracing but you'll surely be misled. With all of the contextual materials, it's now a bit more work but provides a full experience."
297,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45541682-sachin-h-n,4,"The Double Helix (once intended to be titled 'Honest Jim' and 'Base Pairs') is a Nobel Laureate, Dr. James Watson's account of one of the ground breaking discoveries in science. Having read this book after reading Brenda Maddox's 'The Dark Lady of DNA', to come to an appropriate conclusion, as far as the accuracy of this book is concerned, is difficult. This is more a novel than history; though a feast for a non scientific reader, a historian would definitely object to the way one of the most important discoveries in the field of molecular biology and genetics has been retold. This is more a fast paced thriller (which in fact was, with Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin of King's college, Linus Pauling of CalTech and our boys from Cavendish all trying to have a crack at it) than a history of science. Then, there is the matter of Rosalind Franklin, a prolific x ray cryptographer (dubbed 'Rosy' which the feminist lot find offensive) being discredited of her contribution for the sake. Watson says 'It is quite possible that there are inaccuracies here and there. The portrayal of many might not do justice to their caliber, for i write this as I saw when i was 23.' The words written in the epilogue trying to remedy disregard towards Rosalind and her contribution to elucidation of the structure of DNA probably arise from the need to make the book more acceptable. The book was published in spite of uncompromising opposition from Francis Crick, putting their friendship at risk. Many argue that this book is a symbol of blatant misogyny, painting a monster out of Rosalind, who in a manner has become an icon for feminists. It is very unfortunate that she was not recognized for what she was by many. Yet, that is by no means a reason to not hear out what Watson has to say. At the end of the day it all comes down to Science and the hunger of mankind to uncover it's secrets, of which DNA was a huge chunk from a great puzzle whose solution would open up innumerable applications in the field of medicine later on.  To understand how it all went about, this book is a good place to begin with."
298,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17466394-rustyj,3,"The Double Helix is a personal account of the discovery of the double helical structure of the DNA by one of the co-discoverers, James D. Watson.Watson, his co-collaborator Francis Crick (the senior of the two) alongwith Maurice Wilkins (who was at the same time independently working on the structure of the DNA) were awarded the Noble Prize in Medicine in 1963, for their discovery in 1953.Considering the importance of the discovery on the future of science, it ought to have been a thrilling account, coming from one of the participants. Unfortunately, the book disappoints on many counts.Before getting into the review, we should remember that Watson was barely 25 years old when the discovery was made.Surprisingly for a work of autobiography, the picture that emerges of Watson is that of a flippant, misogynist, careless, lazy person, who just happened to be at the right place at the right time.The portrayal of Rosalind Franklin (who worked with Wilkins), the X-ray crystollagrapher without whose X-ray images of the DNA molecule, the discovery of the helical structure would have been impossible, borders on the disrespectful. That Rosalind believed for a long while that the molecule was not a helix is a different matter.So is the portrayal of Linus Pauling, a brilliant Caltech scientist who was independently working to unravel the structure of the DNA. Pauling is painted as a wolf to be wary of, while it turns out to be pretty opposite.There are pages devoted to the social life of the author, his (absence of) sexual life, food habits and other mundane details that reflects a lack of maturity in handling a subject matter of gravity.By the end of it, one cannot but wonder, if Rosalind was deprived of a deserved Nobel and whether Watson was truly deserving of it. I am sure he was a brilliant scientist and was deserving of the Nobel, but the manner in which the subject matter has been handled, and indeed presented, makes one wonder if it was otherwise.Recommended for aficionados of science."
299,0451037707,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11990289-kevin,4,"It's a breezy read, iconoclastic and yes, sexist, and at turns charming in its candor and youthful enthusiasm, intriguing in its machiavellian nature, and annoying in its provincial attitudes. In short, it's an expose and it stepped on some toes. Crick, Watson's chief collaborator, considered it ""a betrayal of friendship"" (paraphrase). There are serious questions regarding the portrayal of Rosalind Franklin, who is essentially cast as the villain in the piece, that are tempered (albeit inadequately) at the conclusion of the tale. My impression is that Watson's prime directive beyond producing a credible account of his interpretation of the mood and circumstances leading to the discovery of ""the secret of life"" is that he not commit the cardinal sin of being a bore about it. He is anything but that. I was most surprised by the lack of technical training Watson had, and even Crick to a lesser extent, going in. Their ""structural approach"" to DNA made this possible, through a technique of model building borrowed from Linus Pauling, who became their foil in the race to the landmark discovery. Watson backfilled gaps in his knowledge as needed, gaining a working proficiency in the fields of organic chemistry and X-ray analysis, for example. There was thus a deeper, philosophical divide between Crick & Watson and Franklin regarding the relative merits of theory and practice in the understanding of DNA. The imperatives for such ""backfilling"" become apparent at various stages in their search and these manifest themselves in several ingenious ploys used to thwart institutional barriers and to pump experts for information. These negotiations, which are fleshed out by Watson's characterization of the people and circumstances involved, infuse the narrative with an immediacy and sense of purpose that builds to a climax when the final pieces of the puzzle are literally put into place. In this fashion, Watson and Crick's discovery of the structure of DNA emerges as a true tour de force. This, IMHO, redeems the narrative and is why I give it four stars, with the noted caveats. At a minimum I would augment this account with a reading of Rosalind Franklin's Wikipedia page."
