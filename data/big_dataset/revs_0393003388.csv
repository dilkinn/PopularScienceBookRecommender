0,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8178894-nostalgebraist,1,"David Foster Wallace was a great writer of fiction. He was not a great writer of popular math exposition, as this book shows.The main reason I read this book, besides just curiosity about one of the lesser-read Wallace books, was my interest in figuring out a certain infamous scene in Wallace's wonderful novel Infinite Jest. In that scene, one character (Michael Pemulis) dictates to another a description of a mathematical method, based on the Mean Value Theorem, that he says will simplify the calculations involved in playing a certain complicated wargame. But Pemulis' proposed method does not actually make any mathematical sense. (He states the Mean Value Theorem correctly, but there is no useful way to apply it to the problem he wants to solve.) Ever since reading that scene, I've wondered if this was a mistake on Wallace's part or a deliberate choice intended to cast doubt on Pemulis' mathematical ability. Since Everything and More deals with some of the same sort of math that appeared in that scene (elementary calculus), it seemed like a good place to look for answers about Wallace's own grasp of that material.Unfortunately, it was. This book is full of errors. A lot of them are just terminological solecisms that general readers won't notice or care about, but there are also some mathematical arguments in the book that are seriously flawed -- some of them much worse, in fact, than Pemulis' argument. (Some of them are wrong in an utterly weird, ""only a stoned undergrad at 3 AM could think like this"" way, which makes me wonder how on earth they got found their way into the book -- extreme time pressure, maybe?) I'm now forced to conclude that the Mean Value Theorem thing in IJ is not a sly bit of characterization, but simple authorial incompetence.Everything and More is also very poorly written and organized. There's very little of the usual Wallace charm and cleverness, and a lot of aimless rambling, needless distinctions and clarifications-that-don't-really-clarify. Anyone who reads this book without no knowledge of the relevant math will come out of the experience with the impression that it is incredibly thorny and complicated and that Wallace has done his heroic best to shape it into some popularly presentable form. As it happens, most of the math is actually quite simple, and most of the appearance of complexity here is an artifact of Wallace's style -- the result of inconsequential (or incorrect!) nitpicking and a dizzying, needlessly scattered order of presentation.It makes me sad to think that there are people out there whose first impression of Wallace will come from this book."
1,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/614862-mykle,5,"HERE IS WHY THIS BOOK IS AWESOME:This book addresses three related enthusiasms: for mathematics itself, for math history (the lives of the mathematicians & the historical chain of deduction that gave us the math of today) and for DFW's high school math teacher (who sounds totally amazing). A book about any one of these might be more straightforward but DFW conflates the three in a breezy, entertaining mess. The operating concept is the history of infinity as a topic that has driven mathematicians nuts. The designated hero of the story is Gregory Cantor, but you hardly even see him until the last chapter. The rest is foreshadowing & background material & lots and lots (lots!) of math.Lovers of DFW's prose couldn't ever find a purer source of it. I was constantly laughing at footnotes, loving the intertwine of math and history, enjoyed all the ways he bent the conventions of mathematical writing to the weird shape of his brain. If you like DFW but have been putting this one off, this really is not the one to put off. His stated goal is to make a bunch of boring math more interesting and to walk you through the hard parts. I am probably his ideal reader: an interested and smart yet lazy & unconcerned person who hasn't thought about infinity lately.My measure of a good book is how much it makes me think, and this book gets five starts for reminding me that Math is a planet and not just a multi-tool. And for succeeding in highlighting that the paradoxical nature of infinity is hiding right behind all the math-tricks I learned in high school, had anyone ever pointed them out to me or had I ever bothered to look. (I recall the opposite: we were encouraged not to go there.) The nature of the infinitely large and the infinitely small has felt, at least for a few days, like a metaphor for all sorts of other failures of logic and rationality. Likewise, the concept of a discrete set vs. a continuum is ably and interestingly highlighted here. The many ways in which it seems all of geometry and all of arithmetic are non-identical conjoined twins, even though that distinction divides math history into two warring camps, is suitably made deep. My appetite for understanding is bolstered. Infinity is fun!I have to admit my main discouragement in following the math presented here is that I can't seem to summon the sense of dread and confusion that comes from, for instance, asserting that 9.999... repeating forever is equal to 10. Maybe because I didn't have DFW's high school math teacher, I find I'm blasé about infinity in a way that I gather would appall most of the mathematicians who have grappled with the concepts. In a sense, I just don't care. And so many different ways of talking about the problems of infinity and discontinuity, from Zeno up to Cantor, as presented by DFW, really do feel like a long series of restatements of the obvious: that infinity is a paradox math can't ever straighten out, but if you don't worry too hard it's actually present everywhere and quite handy. A sad truth this book drives home, once again, is that high school Math is too often taught -- was taught to me, even in ""Honors"" math courses -- as Computation: come, kids, and learn about these nifty, cryptic, useful symbolic systems we found over here on this bookshelf! Do some drills, get some practice using them to solve certain kinds of problems, and just maybe (via the dreaded Word Problems) develop some intuition about which of these solutions might apply to which of your upcoming future questions. Wheras Math, as understood by mathematicians (such as DFW's amazing-sounding HS math teacher) is more like another planet -- an actual landscape, a real thing that exists and can be perceived, initially by our intuitions (i.e. that two grapes and two oranges are similar in the sense that there are two of them, and therefore ""twoness"" exists and can be known, as can the nesses of other integers) and then later by deducing from just those truths plus our intuitions, just as astrophysicists can know the likely orbits of habitable planets in far-off galaxies. There is this incredible detail to the mathematical landscape, and the people who discovered it were real explorers. This version of Math relates to mere Computation in about the same way that the study of physics relates to auto shop. But efforts to base grade school mathematical education in intuition of mathematical truths instead of computation drills (see: New Math) are constantly met with deep suspicion by all the parents and administrators who themselves only learned Computation and don't get the difference. So DFW lucked out there. (One thesis of Neal Stephenson's introduction is that this was a direct result of DFW growing up in a midwest college town, overpopulated with humble degreed braniacs who did things like teach high school math. Whereas I -- in defense of my own quite likable Honors Math teacher -- grew up in Silicon Valley, a society fairly fixated on Computation for Computation's sake.)Which in the end means that, to me, Cantor's diagonal proof about the rational number set & subsequent branding of the real number set as a higher order of infinity seems like much ado about nothing, just another rephrasing of the fact that the latter is continuous and the former is not, which means that the former is composed of numbers and the latter of spaces containing numbers, which really doesn't seem so ""hard"" to me, but i'm totally willing to accept that I'm just missing something. Perhaps this is the inevitable result of an education in Computation of math instead of Comprehension of it: I'm too quick to discount the divine & take the rest for granted.HERE IS WHY THIS BOOK SUCKS:I had a big objection to Infinite Jest based on one mathematical footnote DFW gave which convinced me his grasp of mathematics was not all he thought it was. I must look up and revisit that, because this book really thoroougly convinces me that he knew way more about Math than I ever will. Reading it, I have not just been entertained by a whole bunch of chaotic, burbling DFW-prose; I have also come to believe that I learned something.However, there are quite a few Real Mathematicians who would dispute that. This book was not well-reviewed by mathematicians, in two senses First, it seems not enough of them were asked to review the manuscript for errors before publication. Second, upon publication, many of them found the math to be full of holes. Here is probably the most charitable review in this vein; Here is one that really slides the knife in. I will not get into them. Suffice it to say that I have two warring concepts of DFW: one is True Genius, the other is Bullshitter In Genius Clothing. Reading the book, I was lured back to the Genius side. But I felt a necessity to check the facts, and when I did -- just like with Infinite Jest -- the odor of Bullshit again became detectable. Mathematicians, of course, are just the sort of fun-free jerks who would be anal enough to poke holes in a lyrical work of math fantasy that the rest of us are trying to enjoy. How you feel about that is a really important question. Please take a moment to ponder it; it is pertinent across the entire Popular Science section of your local bookstore.The math-reviewers don't hesitate to label DFW a ""fiction writer"" although his best work IMHO is journalism. But yes, he writes to entertain. This book is entertaining. And Popular Science, taken as a genre -- with Popular Math, its more recent sub-genre -- strives to entertain. That's how it gets Popular. Publishers put these books out to sell them, and the idea of DFW writing a treatise on the history of infinity had to sound good in the boardroom. He wrote something -- apparently something a bit more erudite and symbol-encrusted than they were hoping -- but they printed it anyway. It seemed entertaining enough. Print it! Sell it!And that's fine for fiction, but this book purports to relay mathematical and historical fact. In such a book, facts should be checked and then double-checked -- that is, if the book is really striving to educate. It would not have been hard AT ALL. But, if you believe science is a decorative art and history is ""true stories"", it's not much of a stretch to consider Mathematics a flexible world of witchcraft akin to that found in Harry Potter books.Can you tell how much that offends me? It really does.This book, brilliant as it is, comes across as a first draft, despite at least one mention of a previous, even more chaotic draft, and despite what undoubtedly must have been a fair amount of research. Then again, he's faulted by some for not researching better; for not having read more of the available research on Cantor, for instance -- recall that Gregory Cantor is the purported star of this book, and DFW screws up certain facts about his life. Meanwhile, an extremely mathy-looking organizational scheme is invented on the fly for the sole purpose of making the book seem more organized than it is.In a word: sloppy. DFW was a writer who's so talented at rhetoric, forming excellent sentences and entertaining voices, and also with a certain talent for bedazzling us with concepts from math, philosophy and tennis, that he could just ramble on about anything he thought was really interesting and sell the first draft to a major publisher. He was absolutely brilliant at sounding brilliant. But I keep on catching him trying to sound erudite without checking his facts, and it keeps eroding my faith in him. "

3,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24133187-usha,2,"I love David Foster Wallace, however this book was a flop. The writing is good but it fails in delivery. It was not an enjoyable read."
4,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1313409-matt-evans,3,"I've now read everything that David Foster Wallace published in book form, which became a goal of mine back on 09/15/08 when I heard that he'd hanged himself on 09/12/08. At that time, this book and ""Signifying Rappers"" were the only two I hadn't yet read. I wouldn't otherwise have read ""Everything and More,"" given that I'm not all that strong a math student.With that happy preface, let me tell you that ""Everything and More: A Compact History of ∞"" is very technical, and its reader should ideally possess a medium to strong math background. This reader, mathematically anemic at best, did however enjoy the good old DFW rhetorical japes and games and general good times, which are also present in this work. Also, I did enjoy learning the basic rough outlines of such concepts as Zenos's Paradox, Vicious Infinite Regress, number theory, etc. (""Rough outlines"" not because DFW doesn't devote considerable rhetorical- and word-count attention to the concepts, but ""rough"" because so much of it went over my head.) Here's what the back of the book says, ""[DFW:] brings his intellectual ambition and bravura style to the story of how mathematicians have struggled to understand the infinite, from the ancient Greeks to the nineteenth-century mathematical genius Georg Cantor's counterintuitive discovery that there was more than one kind of infinity.""Okay. Not exactly ADD medicine here, but the blurb is at least generally accurate. But not ""sexy,"" which is DFW's operative term (that and synonyms like ""eros-laden"", ""zaftig"", etc.) for interesting or exciting concepts. Sexy is this quote from the little booklet's text (which quote will be this review's conclusion):""The Mentally Ill Mathematician seems now in some ways to be what the Knight Errant, Mortified Saint, Tortured Artist, and Mad Scientist have been for other eras: sort of our Prometheus, the one who goes to forbidden places and returns with gifts we all can use but he alone pays for. That's probably a bit overblown, at least in most cases. (FN2: Although, so is the other, antipodal stereotype of mathematicians as nerdy little bowtied fissiparous creatures. In today's archetypology, the two stereotypes seem to play off each other in important ways.) But Cantor fits the template better than most. And the reasons for this are a lot more interesting than whatever his problems and symptoms were. (FN3: In modern medical terms, it's fairly clear that G.F.L.P. Cantor suffered from manic-depressive illness at a time when nobody knew what this was, and that his polar cycles were aggravated by professional stresses and disappointments, of which Cantor had more than his share. Of course, this makes for less interesting flap copy than Genius Driven Mad By Attempts To Grapple With ∞. The truth, though, is that Cantor's work and its context are so totally interesting and beautiful that there's no need for breathless Prometheusizing of the poor guy's life. The real irony is that the view of ∞ as some forbidden zone or road to insanity -- which view was very old and powerful and haunted math for 2000+ years -- is precisely what Cantor's own work overturned. Saying that ∞ drove Cantor mad is sort of like mourning St. George's loss to the dragon: it's not only wrong but insulting.)""Please recall or here be informed (as wikipedia just informed me) that St. George actually first wounded then tamed and finally slew the dragon. Which of course underscores DFW's point about Georg F.L.P. Cantor first (figuratively) taming then slaying the ∞.DFW: requiescat in pace."
5,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/585893-steev-hise,4,"Well, as you might expect, this is great writing, at least the parts of it that are plain english. I hesitated to read it because it was, well, a math book, and the 7 semesters of college math i had to take was enough to last me a lifetime. Although I must say that if I had math teachers like David Foster Wallace, I probably would have liked it more. So anyway the book was a gift but sat on my shelf for a few months but I eventually sat down and read it. It was worth reading, but... I doubt it will be my favorite DFW book ( so far Infinite Jest is the only other one I've read - I like it much more). It's just lots of slogging through a subject that has no real bearing on anything in my life and is also not that entertaining other than the 5% of it that is Wallace saying hilarious little things in footnotes, for instance that Kurt Gödel is the Dark Prince of math. It's alluring in a geeky way but that's about the extent of it. It doesn't make me wiser about life, or help me be a better person, or a better anything else that I am, and it wasn't a whole lot of fun. Those are my criteria for reading a book. But I will give this one 4 stars because I think Wallace did probably about the best job possible of doing what he set out to do.But you can pretty much summarize the book thus: ""Mathematicians and philosophers kept putting off dealing with the concept of infinity for centuries. Finally some guys in Germany dealt with it. They showed that there are different kinds of greater and lesser infinities. This created more paradoxes and problems for the field, some of which still never got solved. David Foster Wallace was a really smart guy and really geeky (even though he may have screwed up some of the finer points of the math)."""
6,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11228-suman,4,"Reading other goodreads reviews, I decided I should write something because it seems that the other reviewers are either lazy or illiterate. ""Everything and More"" is unlike any other ""pop"" math book I've ever read. Most math books involve the personalities of these mythical math beings with some horrible math analogies sprinkled in to deceive the reader into thinking she is reading a math book rather than a poor biography. DFW does something completely different, actually writing about the intricacies of a math concept (that of infinity), while trying to break down the Hollywood notions of the mathematicians behind the work. Yes, the book is tough to read, and this is probably why it has received mixed reviews. The problem, however, is the underlying math is much harder to understand/enjoy if one decided to take a real analysis course (which is all about these type problems) instead of reading this book.* The book is not perfect (sometimes the frenetic style is a bit much, even for me), but it will be the most rewarding math book you have read.* IYI(If you're interested) - I suffered through a real analysis course for a while before finding it completely boring and useless. After reading this work, I've decided that these questions are deep and beautiful and I will take another shot at learning this material "
7,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3030419-fraser-kinnear,4,"I bought this book despite the strong criticism it got from mathematicians who found pretty egregious mistakes in some of the math. But I'd never read David Foster Wallace before (aside from some of his journalism) and I wanted to try him out. I suspect the criticism is largely unwarranted - DFW provides enough forewarning that he has ""dumbed down"" much of the math in order to bridge the gap to the difficult and abstract math he is describing. Doing so comes with the sacrifice of some accuracy. Richard Feynman once explained that there is no real substitute to getting down and dirty in the math - no amount of summarizing and translation into layman's terms will ever do. So for those who want a complete and 100% correct understanding of these ideas, well, caveat emptor. Then again, for those who want a complete understanding, none of these kind of books will really do.DFW keeps a very conversational tone throughout the book - peppering words like ""stuff"" around concepts like Fourier series and uniform convergence, which helps keep your attention without blunting the fidelity (can you blunt fidelity???) of the explanation. I also really enjoyed his extensive foot-noting, which I understand turns a lot of people off. DFW defended his footnotes in Infinite Jest on Charlie Rose, and I think the defense works very well for this book also:""There is a way, it seems to me, that reality is fractured right now (at least the reality that I live in) and the difficulty of writing about that reality is that text is very linear, and I am constantly on the lookout for ways to fracture the text that aren't totally disorienting."" http://www.charlierose.com/view/inter...The history of our grasp of infinity from a mathematical perspective isn't linear, so why should the telling of it be? DFW's constant use of IYI (his invented acronym for ""if you're interested"") allows for the reader to delve deeper into the history, if they're interested. In this way, DFW writes Everything And More mimics the way that I amble wikipedia. Or perhaps I go too far, the asides are always brief and are seldom interconnected.I enjoyed it, and I suspect that I'll pick it up again."
8,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335221-kaila,3,"I DID IT. I FINISHED IT. Phew, the last half was a slog.This was basically a history of math, with the bent of focusing on how/why we got to certain calculations about infinity. I can easily recommend the first 100 pages to everybody who has a passing interest in philosophy or David Foster Wallace. I have read exactly two things by him (now three): Infinite Jest and This is Water, both things I bend over backward to recommend to people. The first 100 pages of Everything and More were like a confluence of everything I love about those two pieces and it was seriously blowing my mind.Then it got into math, and my eyes started to glaze over. Math has never been a strong suit of mine, and there are some page-long proofs that I straight up skipped. It got harder and harder to understand what was happening because I didn't really understand the formative/underlying principles, so when he started to build on them, I really didn't get it.Loved the first part though and I can recommend that with abandon."

10,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3423279-ben-richmond,3,"	I’m going to describe the one person I can possibly imagine whom I would recommend this book to. His name is Andy; he was a contemporary of mine during my undergraduate days. Andy was a math major who at one point scheduled (or maybe just invited a bunch of people to?) a talk in a library conference room about how he found math to be beautiful, and in fact in some way divine. Andy left the study of mathematics after several months teaching remedial algebra in a public school on Chicago’s South Side. I suppose the episode, the most memorable aspect of which revolved around the nickname “Mr. Mayo” (which oddly was bestowed upon him by a student in the hallway who wasn’t in any of his classes), taught him that what he lacked was not mathematical acumen, but rather patience and possibly quite a bit of compassion. As I write this Andy is in seminary. Which is all to say as I read David Foster Wallace’s Everything And More, I was able to vividly imagine the ideal audience for the work. Conspicuously I was not part of this ideal audience. The point of this digression, if there is one, is to answer the only “big question” that I really understood as I read Everything, which is: who is this for? It is a work that, perhaps quixotically and much like Andy in the library conference room, seems to be trying to bring the complex tangle of math’s centuries-long tangle with the concept of infinity out of the dry math classroom environment and into a broader philosophical and historically placed context, for the public good/enjoyment. A celebration of mathematics for all to join. This is a quick and messy definition, that I wouldn’t advise adhering to too closely, lest the book too swiftly be dismissed as an utter and total failure. Because as I tried to convey with my Andy-anecdote, this might be a bit of niche thing. I imagine most people’s interest in and knowledge of calculus won’t be adequate to make this book reach the status of “page-turner.” Wallace begins in ancient Greece, where the questions are raised, and in his narrative, placed aside until the Renaissance, and not really grasped for another 300 years give or take. The hero of the story is Georg Cantor who lurks in the background until the late 19th century, who eventually comes along, resolves things in a way that confused me (though by this point the dilemma posed by infinity was too obscured by hundreds of years of dramatic advances), and ultimately led to more questions for mathematicians. By all accounts Cantor is a big deal and I believe it, but I couldn’t begin to explain why, or even quote why, due to not really knowing where to find Greek letters on my keyboard. Is this due to my math background, or is this due to the author? Did this inability to really grasp the material impair my ability to enjoy myself? Well, as must be obvious at this point, the attraction leading me to this book was to the author, not to the subject, per say. DFW casts a long shadow in the contemporary literature world. His massive masterwork, Infinite Jest, is regarded as one of the most important pieces of (at least) American literature of the last twenty years. He committed suicide in 2008, and his death was probably the first celebrity passing that actually affected me. His work revolves around a profound unironic enthusiasm, and often characters digress and discuss philosophy for pages. Not that he is ever too dense, often times those very philosophical discussions are followed by a gag, or punctuated with a joke. Those looking for the same in Everything and More, should be warned that while the book is unmistakably DFW, it is on the subject of infinity viewed through the lens of math. Pure and simple. Conspicuously, while DFW got a degree in modal logic (!), “mathematician” is not on his resume. So clearly affection for the author may be causing me to spare him the rod of having written a book on a subject that he may not grasp-- at least not well enough to find the terms to explain it to a layman. A colleague of mine found out what I was reading and said that a few legitimate mathematicians had come forward to critique DFW’s work, to point out holes in his retelling of the grand old tale. Indeed DFW admits that the legitimate mathematician is going to find his explanations either too swift, or too fraught with his idiomatic prose. So he’s painted himself into a corner. “How can the discussion be pitched so that it’s accessible to the neophyte without being dull or annoying to someone who has had a lot of college math?” he asks at the end of the foreword. Apparently the answer wasn’t giving a lot of biographical or historical context to the mathematicians in question, though each time he did, it was riveting. Neal Stephenson wrote a foreword for my copy of the book (which supplemented the DFW foreword nicely), and he noted that one could interpret the entire effort of Everything as sort of ostentatious. But Stephenson asked for our charity in reading “one of the other smart kids trying to explain some cool stuff.” So the book is probably bad journalism. It pains me to say it, but if journalism writes with an audience in mind, and if the author, the author of the foreword, and the reviewer all sort of wonder who could like this book, the odds are it needed a good hard look at the concept (of the book) before proceeding, or at the very least a good stiff edit.Yet herein lies the lesson. At no point did it feel like DFW was taking a page or section off. His profound love of the subject is catching, even if his comprehension isn’t. It would be easy to dismiss this whole effort as too insular, but DFW’s tone is always to catching, too inviting. I read 300 pages and was enthusiastic whenever I thought the narrator was. As journalism starts to structure itself to more and more specific audiences, it will become easier and easier to say, “That really doesn’t apply to me,” and go about your day. Already RSS feeds, customizable news aggregators like Google News, and other technologies are making it easier to block out that which we know doesn’t interest us (like 300 page books about not only calculus, but the history of calculus), in favor of that which does. But the journalist and the science writers who can make you believe you do care, even when you can’t really grasp the point because they show such utter care and diligence are the ones who can buck this trend. Journalism that has the power to wake you up to the complexity of the world, to shake your suppositions, is worth the effort to make, and worth the effort to read. "
11,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41911492-isabelle-leo,4,Very fun and occasionally existentially terrifying. I appreciate Dave's confidence in my mathematical/logical acuity but I would not have been insulted if he had dumbed it down just a little bit more.
12,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,1,"Love him or hate him, DFW is a prodigious talent. Except for the disturbing ""Conversations with Hideous Men"" I have found his previous material to be so hilariously, intelligently, on-target that I was willing to overlook a multitude of stylistic transgressions (chiefly, the overly cutesy tone, gratuitous flaunting of the author's erudition, the footnote fetish). So I was reasonably disposed to like this book and was looking forward to reading it. Sadly, it turns out that this was a case where DFW's various idiosyncrasies combine to produce a book which is fundamentally unreadable. Normally, once I start a book, I feel enormous guilt if I don't finish. No guilt here - just exasperation. One can reasonably argue that DFW's enormous talent might justify certain peculiarities of style, but every author needs the discipline of a good editor. W.W. Norton seems to have dispensed with editors altogether, certainly with the sentient kind. A pity, because somebody should have explained to DFW that prefacing any section of text with the title ""Soft-news interpolation, placed here ante rem because this is the last place to do it without disrupting the juggernaut-like momentum of the pre-Cantor mathematical context"" is not just completely unhelpful. It is an irritating distraction, the sorry result of the inability of this talented writer to vanquish the demons which continue to plague his undisciplined style. Unfortunately, this kind of self-indulgent stylistic mannerism recurs with infuriating frequncy. As a result, this book is a complete train wreck."

But DFW is like an obsessive-compulsive, who is both trying to simplify but isn't happy with hand-waving... so you get a complex mess. I love it.I will say that his description of Dedekind's schnittzing to prove irrationals has me completely bamboozled. But at least after reading this I am VERY interested in it.I've read about Cantor's diagonalizing before, and once again was delighted to learn about it. It is seriously delightful.I think the story that I loved the most, running through this, was the intuitionists vs the platonists (vs the formalists?) and I have no idea where I stand on this issue. Intuitionism is seriously lovely, and when you consider how all math is essentially done on computers (discrete)... then what does it matter if we don't allow transfinite math into existence? Anyways, it makes me really excited to learn more about discrete math and computability etc. etc.I now want to read What is Mathematic, Really? by some guy... I can't remember.And Ian Hacking's new book on math.Which is to say: DFW's book on infinite has given me a boner for math. A boner I have not had for a long, long time. I missed this boner.:)"

In fact it's quite soothing to try to see how many layers of abstraction you can hold in your mind at once. However, I only seem to be able to read 2-5 pages at a time before the soothingness of it puts me to sleep, and my mind really is somewhat math resistant. I've gotten to a point in the book where the equations are just meaningless to me. One of my best friends loved this book intensely, and actually kept a note pad at hand so she could work out the math problems for herself, so she could follow more closely. Maybe that would have helped me, but I didn't want to! So, Dan Newton, I'll be handing this off to you! "

I can't read any of Wallace's work right now, it makes me really sad. Because when I've read it in the past I've always been like: THIS IS SO BRILLIANT and I think of how amazing it is that someone so genius is alive. But.. he's not. Anymore. I realize whining about his death is not a review. This is a review placeholder. "
16,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/501971-jeff,3,"This wasn't written by a mathematician; math specialists seem to notice its flaws. It was written by a literary golden boy; literati seem to like its style. Some people seem to believe these aspects roughly balance out, resulting in a somewhat pleasing and somewhat unsatisfying read.I hoped that Wallace's treatment would be at least as much about the philosophical concept as about the mathematical description of infinity. Since it wasn't and since almost all of the math was too hard for me, i couldn't really dig it. The dude seems to know way more than the average bear about this topic ... or maybe the 1-star reviewers are on point ... i really have no way to assess. Good thing you're not looking to me for the answers.All i can say is that if calculus was a stopping point for your mathematical education then this book's math might be too much for you also."
17,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/150648-tiffany,2,"I don't know how I feel about this book. It was a math-related book, which is good (Math! Yay! Fun!), but... I just ... It wasn't as good as other math books I've read. I found myself skimming parts, and my brain glazing over at other parts.This is the first DFW book I've ever read, which may have some impact on my reception of it (Although, come to think of it, there is a DFW article in The New Kings of Nonfiction, which I didn't really have problems with.). I had a friend once, however, (actually, the person who gave me this book) who LOVED Wallace, and subsequently wrote like him -- his style and his affinity for footnotes (in every sentence, it sometimes feels like). And at many points, I thought his [DFW's] writing style was somewhat similar to my own (which makes me now have pity for anyone who's ever read anything [e-mail, letter, article, essay, school report...Goodreads review] I've written.). And yet, I sometimes (often) had troubles following him/his style. Plus, then, often his footnotes would be something snarky like ""Don't ask,"" implying that the history behind a certain concept (that wasn't a main focus, but merely a comment in the text) was too complex to cover. Then why bring it up?? Why do I need a footnote telling me not to ask you about a certain convoluted concept? If I wanted more information about something you didn't go in-depth on, I know how to use a library. And again, it sounds like my style of writing, but here's the one important difference: I DON'T WRITE PROFESSIONALLY. And if I did, I wouldn't put comments like those in my published writing.But I digress. Anyway, his style, not my cup of tea, at least not in this book. I will say, though, that many (most?) of his footnotes were designated ""If you're interested,"" so at least the reader could know to skip/skim if they aren't really all that interested in the topic at hand. But still, his writing (the footnotes, the digressions within the text, the text itself) made the book way more difficult than I think it needed to be. ""Slog"" is a good word to describe my time with it. My other major problem with this book is that he says it's for the layman or someone with *some* math classes in school. Now, I know I'm not the smartest person in the world, but I do know *some* math (with it being my minor, and having been a math tutor for 12+ years), and yet I WAS LOST. A LOT. He kind of talks about the challenges of writing a piece that is simple enough for someone without a math background, and yet interesting enough for someone who does have that technical math knowledge; I just know that he lost me a lot (hence the skimming and brain glazing over), which means it was too technical for someone with even some amount of math background. Plus, he gets into REALLY technical math, and a lot of times I couldn't figure out (or forgot) how they related to infinity. (I know they do, but he was just so mired in math, and technical math, and set theory, and on and on, that I forgot that this was all supposed to come back around to the idea of infinity.)I thought To Infinity and Beyond was a much (MUCH!) better book about infinity. (But even with that, DFW criticizes other ""pop culture"" math books, saying they gloss over things, or misrepresent things [like Cantor's mental issues and his study of infinity], and I kept wondering if Eli Maor's book was one of those. Damn you, DFW!)"
18,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1027339-dead-letter-office,2,"I really wanted to like this, since I like the idea of it so much: a preternaturally fearless and curious outsider explaining the world of mathematics and mathematical philosophy to other outsiders. DFW's at his best when he's talking about the philosophy (or is it that I'm out of my depth there...), but his mathematics is in places disconcertingly shaky, and he seems too ready to abandon mathematical carefulness for the sake of literary fireworks. And yes, I find his so-called ""conversational"" writing style (this description seems not quite right, unless you throw around lots of Latin abbreviations, e.g. e.g., and footnotes in your conversations) really irritating and not that illuminating*.I guess I might like the idea of David Foster Wallace more than I like reading his stuff....*For example, the following passage:You'll have noticed that we've run up against these sorts of questions dozens of times already and we're still 2,000+ years from G. Cantor. They are the veritable bad penny in the Story of Infinity, and there's no way around them if you don't want just a bunch of abstract math-class vomitus on transfinite set theory. Deal. Right now is the time for a sketch of Plato's One Over Many argument, which is the classic treatment of just these questions as they apply to the related issue of predication. You might recall the O.O.M., too, from school, in which case relax because this won't take long. "
19,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3059598-miles,2,"Despite Herculean efforts on Wallace's part, to get the most out of this book you really need more math (and more recently) than what I've taken. At least some calculus, probably. Ostensibly the book's about the history of infinity, which sounds pretty interesting, but what it's really about the history of how infinity as a concept has been treated in mathematics — which is still a fairly interesting-sounding topic, except it turns out that for it to make sense you have to understand a lot of pretty advanced mathematical concepts. At least they seemed advanced to me. Wallace does try really hard to assume not very much math knowledge, and actually apologizes a lot throughout the text about how 'brutal' and 'eyeglazing' and 'nutcrunching' big portions of the text are. Several times the reader is invited to take deep breaths, and to read sentences multiple times to try to get their meaning. So all in all, I found the book not that enjoyable nor very edifying. I got a pretty basic sense of the accomplishments of one G. Cantor to the mathematics of infinity, and Wallace's style was as usual frequently delightful. Mostly though the book made me feel kind of dumb. :("
20,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/543919-sabel,4,"I read a german translation which is marketed as a a biography of Cantor, and that really does not do justice to the book -it really is more of a biography of the modern idea of the mathematical infinite, with a good deal of tangential mathematical history thrown into the package. If you actually are a mathematician and have not heard much math history definitely a recommended read, as it gives some insight into how the notions we learned to take for granted actually could have developped in other directions. The book has weaknesses, though, and as a mathematician I winced at some parts, but I really liked the braveness to be idiosyncratic - I have read too many popularizations of mathematics that repeated the eversame stories. Also, the first § really intrigued me very much(the book is sectioned in 7 §s). Perhaps one should take the instructions to skip parts more seriously, but who ever does that, really :-)"

22,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1720603-baal-of,3,"This is the most difficult book I've read in a while. It took me 2 months, but it felt like 4 months. By the last 40 pages I was pretty much lost with the math, and found the presentation fairly confusing with the mix of footnotes, ""IYI"" (If Your Interested) sections, and historical digressions. Despite all that, I did come out with a couple things of value.First, Dedekind's schnitt proof, which I had to work through myself on my white board, over the course of a few days, writing it out in my own words, and attempting to explain it to a couple cow-orkers who are also interested in math. After going through that process, I felt like I had at least a layman's passing understanding of the proof, and it was a new one to me which I found fascinating. It is still churning around in my head.Second, I am astounding by the brilliance of those top tier mathematicians with their ability to make some pretty amazing leaps of logic, which I know is also the result of tremendous amounts of very hard work, when figuring out how to go about proving various propositions. Over and over I kept thinking ""how did you figure out to do that?"" Of course the answer is complicated.I've read a few of the pretty harsh negative reviews of this book, saying their were lots of mistakes, and pointing out that the book was poorly organized and made the math more complicated than it needed to be. I don't know enough to be able to gauge the accuracy of those claims, but there was at least enough right that I (vaguely) remember from my college math courses that I feel this was on some level a worthwhile refresher."
23,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6405404-kurt,3,"I read this book due to a sense of DFW fanboy completionism, not from any sense of subject matter interest. I was then pleasantly surprised at the (very) beginning of this book, that the book was self-described as a beginner level read to a very complex subject, and that - though much of the verbiage was out in the weeds - I was able to discern some interesting points from the heavy theories presented in this book. But that all ended pretty quickly. Much of this book is the embodiment of that nightmare of stepping midway into a class of which you've somehow managed to miss the first half of the semester. I blame myself more than the author - except for his constant preambles that what he's about to discuss should be obvious to anyone who has completed ""fourth grade math,"" before delving immediately into Cantorian Super Set Theorems. DFW and I attended very different fourth grades."
24,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/676492-jean-luc,5,"According to David Ulin, David Foster Wallace is ""one of the most influential and innovative writers of the last 20 years"". Yet, to the best of my knowledge, he didn't write about space marines, so could he have really been that good? After reading this, I can conclusively say YES.In Math, Better Explained, Kalid Azad says ""Children are expected to cope with mathematics that drove educated adults insane hundreds of years ago."" Amusing, true, and yet no one really explained the insanity the way DFW does here. Yes, yes, everyone knows the story of imaginary numbers:""Of course we can't take the square root of a negative number... but what if we could???""In essence, it was just a rule change. We also know the story of the axioms of Euclidean Geometry:5 axioms, with the 5th (the parallel postulate) being so complicated that people wondered if it was necessary. After thousands of years, people realized you could make new geometries by not assuming this axiom.Again, this was just a rule change. Shocking, but still doable if you believe that rules can change.Now consider this: in math, the ""derivative"" of a function is the rate of change of that function. You can tell the rate of change of a function at a specific point by drawing the tangent line at that point. To draw the tangent line, you have zoom deep into that point. But of course, a line requires 2 points, so you need the 2nd point to be close to the point in question, but no closer. You set up your equation: f'(a) = limit (h → 0) (f(a+h) - f(a)) / h. So far, so good, right? a+h and a are right next to each other but not equal because h is as close to 0 as possible w/out being 0. That's what I learned in my first calculus course, 3 times. (I didn't pass until the 3rd time.) And in all the math courses I've taken, in all the math books I've read, it never once occured to me that the definition of the derivative is asking me to believe 2 mutually exclusive things: h is small enough that a and a+h are barely distinguishable, yet h is big enough to divide by. In logic, a proposition is either true or false, it cannot be both at the same time. So which is it? And if this equation is asking us to believe 2 things at the same time, 2 things which cannot be simultaneously true, how is it that the equation works?That question drove men mad for centuries. In fact, just trying to read that paragraph may have driven you mad, because I am not 1/10th the writer Wallace was. The idea that something could be both true and not true was repugnant, but... but... but what if... what if it could be?Infinty and insanity go hand in hand, and anyone who's stared at a wall lying on the razor's edge of asleep and awake will find this book a disturbingly familiar description of being. Knowing that Wallace killed himself makes this a different experience than if he were alive, because there's no longer any way to accurately assess whether he was foreshadowing.--Things I either didn't know or didn't understand fully before reading this book:* Bremermann's limit is the maximum computational speed of any theoretical computer.* Eudoxus' method of exhaustion was a precursor to calculus.* We know Johannes Kepler from his laws of planetary motion, but he also worked out a method for calculating the volume of a wine barrel.* 0 and nothing are not the same.--If no one minds me speaking ill of the dead, what the FUCK is up with the footnotes? FOOT-NOTES are supposed to come at the bottom of the page and they're supposed to be short enough to fit in the bottom of the page. The book is littered with footnotes that sometimes take the entirety of the page, and they kill the pacing of the book having to go back and forth. Of course, you have to go back and forth to enjoy the setup and payoff in various parts, but that's the way it should be! Not going back and forth because ""wait, what?"" There are numerous parts marked ""IYI"", which stands for ""if you're interested"", and of course we're fucking interested, that's why we're reading the book! Why is any one part of the text IYI and another a footnote? Pure whimsy, whimsy of the worst kind. Maybe an editor could've helped by saying ""reading this page out loud, does this make any fucking sense?"" This is a great book, well worth the effort, but make no mistake, it requires an effort. (Helen Rittelmeyer explores this question more maturely.)Speaking of editors, how on Xenu's green earth did this book get published without an index?--If you are into math and/or science or you are looking for a challenge or you think about triangles when you're lying in bed, this is a book for you.

Whilst lovely to hear DWF's voice again, how anyone ever thought that here is an author suited to accessibly reducing complexity to simplicity is beyond me."
26,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856047-jonna-higgins-freese,3,"I read the whole thing, but I had to force myself. The beginning was much, much better in terms of its appeal to a non-mathematical audience than the end. And while I like and admire Wallace, his self-referential, post-structuralist, ironic schtik just seems precious at times, and I get tired of it."
27,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8706348-geoff,2,"This book took me nearly a year to read until I stopped trying to puzzle out the equations and realized I didn't care. The first time a DFW piece has failed to hold my interest (for context, his book review of dictionaries and English usage guides is one of my all time favorite magazine articles. I loved that, because he made the effort to explain the jargon and ground the minutia in real stakes, something that was lost in the historical narrative here. )."
28,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4820973-nate,3,"So I definitely learned a whole bunch that I'm still trying to absorb but its like 2am as I'm writing this so you'll have to forgive me. Very idiomatic at some points and honestly it felt very disordered. More or less it goes chronologically but even Wallace himself goes to pains to discuss how fractured and disordered the whole text tends to get. A lot of times there's a whole bunch ""we're just going to skip..."" kind of talk which just gives me a sense of unease even though I know my overly literary mind wouldn't be able to handle it. As he nota benes several times there are several more technical texts available but I wish this was a little more narrative and straight forward. That said if you have a good grasp for Wallace's use of language you should be to get through it. There are definitely rough spots were I'm forgetting what some abreviation is or where things are exasperatingly unclear but usually the concepts end up making sense. I suppose if I was more concerned with the whole ""rigorous proof"" stuff I would be more worried about the small things making sense, but again I'm not a math person and I'm trying to get the big ideas and let my memory of the little stuff fill in from there. The last ten or twelve pages were amazing if that's not too strong. Just the idea that there are two huge pieces (the Continuum Hypothesis and the ZFP axiomatic rules) that are largely unprovable and provide huge gaps is crazy to think about. It reminds me of something Stephen Hawking said in regards to a Unified Theory of Gravity and Quantum Mechanics saying that basically there is no unified theory and if there is it would be impossible to prove or disprove. I want to give it four stars but it's too clunky and slow in some parts. So I'll give it three and see how long I meditate on it to potentially change that rating...Initial Reactions about mid-way through:From what I've read so far you need to be about as comfortable with Wallace's syntax as you do some calculus mathematics. Having taken Calculus I three times (twice in college, once in high school) and having read parts or all of a number of Wallace's book I'm very comfortable with the digressions and idiosyncratic language uses and footnote fetishes. I just finished reading ""Zero: the biography of a dangerous Idea"" and I would recommend this to non-math-brain type people. Very narrative and much more layman friendly. "
29,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3355789-mark,3," I am daunted by this book. First of all, the beautiful beautiful words! I have just finished something (else: Chomsky) where I crossed out acres of text to chop it down to syntactic ligaments, only. You can't do that with THIS book! Every Word Matters; it is a thing of beauty.However, now half way through the book, I am unable to appreciate a big part of the thesis, which has to do with the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus which takes an integral by limiting a little slice of incremental area down smaller and smaller as the d(x) approaches zero. The problem is that DFW advertises this as a very big paradox, that for some time (until our hero Cantor saves the day by slaying infinity) calculus was simultaneously kicking ass, and built upon a foundation of sand. (There's a beautiful passage wherein he chronicles the gleeful religious response to this. You'll well imagine that finding that Holy Mathematics is founded on Mere Faith is quite a hoot if you're in divinity school! I cannot begin to do this part justice; you must imagine yourselves enraptured (by the writing.))But, as I said, I'm not getting it. Either I am too much the engineer, and not bothered at the distinction between the values of (~0) and (0,dammit), or maybe I have too LITTLE math to appreciate the beauty of the dilemma.In any event, DFW is a hero of mine, and I am distraught to begin to worry that I will lose a bit of adoration for him as this book goes down.Well, now I'm done. I put in some effort to ensure I ""got"" parts of it. Lots of work with not too much reward. Areas of special interest: Dedekind's proof of irrational numbers, and Cantor's argument that # rationals >> # reals. These were ok, and good to challenge my brain, but it's still the language I love. Here's an example:""Here I perceive the reason why one has to regard the rational, irrational and complex numbers as being just as thoroughly existent as the finite complex integers. This last and clearest sentence is a tiny blown kiss to L. Kronecker.""...how sweet! Those cute mathematicians, with their little trysts! The beauty of DFW is that he can extract the humanity from a footnote in a proof in a math text. Way to go, David."
30,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33765-justin,4,"The reason this book works so well is that Wallace writes about the history of grappling with possibly the most slippery and forbidding concept (infinity) in a very conversant tone. While at times, I did feel like he went overboard a bit so that it went from ""conversant"" to ""patronizing,"" I generally like DF Wallace a lot and appreciated what he was trying to do with this book (i.e. write a book that ""anyone can read"" about a ""very complicated subject"").This is one in a number of books written or due out under the Great Discoveries series that Norton is putting out under their Atlas imprint. Wallace's is, I believe, the first. Regardless, this isn't typical pop science/math literature. I read this book because I really like Wallace and I had a general interest in the subject. True to form, though, this book is written in classic Wallace style. The sentences are not as long as what you may be used to with Wallace, but he has not abandoned his love for profuse footnotes, the acronym (there is an acronym glossary in the beginning of the book in case you lose track), occassionally turning common nouns into proper nouns, and generally using a very conversant prose style interpolated with really impressive words you have to look up in the dictionary that remind you just how smart Wallace is (if the suject matter itself isn't doing the trick). All of this, I believe, stems from Wallace's (perhaps excessive) concern with his audience, which, also, I believe, is what led him in part to do postmodern fiction in the first place. My main problem was that even though this was supposedly written for the layman, I had trouble with A LOT of the heavier, abstract math, which is, well, a large part of the book. I basically just bit the bullet and trudged through it because I'm a dedicated enough Wallace fan to do that. Depending on how much you like Wallace, and how much math you had (and can remember) in high school and college, the reading may be more or less enjoyable for you. Overall, good stuff. I'm looking forward to reading Consider the Lobster."
31,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42069961-marcelo,4,"Exceptional book. Exceptional in a sense that not too many authors would like to explain a matter so complicated to readers not having a background related to the subject. Also, not many authors would try to do that while actually having a solid background themselves on the subject.DFW is a great guide to the theories on the infinity. Mind you, it's a book about math, philosophy and logic. It's not a regular non-fiction read, since the idea is much more to really explore and explain the subject than to talk about 'factoids', as DFW puts it. That said, Neil Stephenson really nails it on the Introduction: the book is based on the ideia that you can explain anything to anyone, if you don't take your readers for idiots and really devote yourself. (BTW: said introduction is precious. Explores how the mind of the author works, and the context where it grew, in an admirable way).It's not a book for understanding every little detail, but to follow the big picture. Sometimes, a given theory may seem too complicated (and they are), but DFW seems to acknowledge that, and remind you: ""just hang on, you'll understand why this"".As for DFW's prose, it's beautiful. He mixes flowery language with slangs sometimes in the same sentence, the result being amazing and very fitting.If you are from a logical/technical/numerical background, I strongly recommend this. If you're from the Humanities (like me), I recommend it if you are interested in learning more about different systems and ways of thought, based on logic. In this sense, it's very mind expanding.The reason I'm giving 4 stars is because is not for everyone: it can get really heavy sometimes. P.S.: Don't miss the footnotes, some are gems."

I'm a huge David Foster Wallace fan, as in David-Foster-Wallace-Changed-My-Life-kind of huge, but, I simply lacked the math with which to really appreciate this book. I gave it an earnest try, swear I did, but, alas, after a certain point I was pretty much just reading to read it. I need try this again with someone who owns a greater, or less deficient, knowledge of math. D'oh. So not proud of myself here... And yet, fans of D.F.W.'s writing will find a lot to like in here. For example, the author's noble attempts to demystify Aristotle's status as the King of Western Thought alone are almost worth the price of admission. Even more interesting, however, was how, despite his usual practice of engaging in a host of foot notes and screwball chapter titles, a more earnest, straightforward and professorly D.F.W comes across through the writing here. Kinda touching. Alas, where EVERYTHING AND MORE is concerned, without the proper skill-set, not only will you ultimately exhaust your knowledge of math, but your appreciation of David Foster Wallace's philosophizing as well."
33,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1140777-rob,3,"A fun experiment. The noted author DFW attempted to write a treatise on a highly technical subject (the development of Cantor's mathematics of transfinite numbers and abstract set theory) and popularize it. While initially propelled along with DFW's arsenal of post-modern tools and tricks, it seemed to lose some of this steam, and in fact become somewhat rushed toward the end in a case of what seemed (and in fact was confirmed in a footnoted aside to the reader) that DFW had let the pacing of the narrative get out of hand as he rapidly ran out of space. The victims of this acceleration were first, the enjoyable pyrotechnics and meta-layer of author breaking the fourth wall with reader, and second, the amount of time he had to make clear increasingly complex items to the ""lay"" reader. So for me a mixed result that became less enjoyable as it went on. The first half is accessible enough for anyone who made it through Calc I and has a little patience. After that, due to space constraints, it becomes increasingly difficult going for anyone without a significant amount of higher math, especially w/r/t logic and set theory (my CS degree came in handy after all...)."
34,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27043880-ken-gloeckner,2,"A near joyless slog of a book. DFW is needlessly obtuse and wordy and relies on ad hoc acronyms that maybe were supposed to impress upon the reader the symbology in mathematics and logic but end up being suffocatingly obnoxious (and inconsistent). If this book had an editor, they were clearly trampled or hurdled en route to publishing.I know DFW studied mathematical logic in college and washed out, so it's hard not to read this as anything but a self gratifying attempt at redemption. The amount of footnotes, footnotes of footnotes, ""interpolations"", and various other methods he used to pile details on the reader muddle instead of clarify, dishearten rather than please. It might be projection, but I get the sense DFW was just as lost as he assumed his readers would be and without a coherent narrative guiding his choice to omit or include a given detail, he errs on the side of projectile vomiting his ""compact history"" and hoping something approaching coherence spontaneously manifests out of it.Blargh."

Seeing that this was subtitled ""A Compact History of Infinity"" I of course thought it was a tongue-in-cheek joke from Wallace, just an ironic outlandish name to title a selection of essays that obviously doesn't measure up to the concept of infinity. Except, no, David Foster Wallace wrote a legit history of infinity and quite literally writes what is basically a math textbook, with just a little of that Wallace flair. I'm not going to act like I understood more than 5% of what he was talking about, but it certainly was something to marvel over. It's like you knew David Foster Wallace was some kind of literary savant on some high level, but then he busts this thing out of nowhere and you think this guys has gotta be on some kind of genius level to have all these scholarly strength rattling up in his brain. It's kinda crazy how he can switch from writing about sociology to tennis to politics to complex math problems and make them all digestible and brilliant in their own way."

However, I don't want my math explained to me in the form of a Wallacean narrative full of footnotes-- as charming as that is for fiction and the creative essay-- but rather, presented in textbook fashion. That way I can actually grasp the math at my own pace, and grasp the patterns as I go. The head-crash of ironic tone and dense technical jargon, while it makes for a fascinating narrative device, but does little to actually explain serious mathematical and scientific ideas. I seriously appreciate Cantor's contribution to the world of mathematical concepts. However, his theories deserve a better interlocutor."

So much was over my head aside from the historical bits and some of theorems which rang vague bells.

44,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5039223-ben-gutierrez,5,"David Foster Wallace is a titan of modern literature. His essays and novels can't be ignored and we usually have the idea that people can be a good writer or good at math, but not both. It makes this book (or booklet, as he called it) on infinite and transfinite math a surprising addition to his works. Fans of DFW know that sincerity and plain-speaking were important to him, but you can still read his stuff and think, ""Now, is he really using the best words he can find, or is he just showing off an enormous vocabulary? Did this essay/novel/booklet have to be so damn dense? Was it all to show how very smart you are?""The title of this book wasn't a joke or exaggeration; this really is a compact history of infinity. We learn about the ancient Greeks and their abhorrence of infinity, zero, and irrational numbers. We learn that at a certain point, concrete ideas about infinity were necessary for math to progress. About mathematicians that moved ideas forward.And we learn about the core mathematical ideas here. That there are different infinities, some kinds larger than other kinds. That 2 has no rational square root. Lots of things that could have been just math and math history factoids.That could have been enough, but DFW wants us to come with him and explore these vistas. Maybe we don't get to the summit of Mt. Everest, but there are lots of accessible things for us to see if we're willing to put a bit of effort in it. DFW is willing to show us the way and hold our hand when we need it. And so he explains the proof that the square root of 2 is not rational. He proves to us that there are the same infinite number of integers and rational numbers, but there are more irrational numbers. And along the way, he proves that power sets of infinite sets are bigger than the original infinite sets. He talks us through all of it in a way that is clear and lets us enjoy the beauty of what we're seeing.And it's all so empathetic and sincere. There's a sense that, given that we're there and we're trying, he'll do his best to make the journey as fun and insightful as possible.While you're at it, you can take some time to ask yourself how real numbers are. Are they as real as you? Because this book dips into metaphysics and explains the views of some mathematicians who argue that mathematics is invented to describe what we observe or math is invented wholly from imagination. And others (esp. the hero mathematicians of this book) argue that mathematics is something we discover. That mathematics is fundamental to existence or perhaps even more fundamental than even that; after all, if the physical constants to our universe were slightly different, the math would still be the same, right?The two-fold pleasure of this book is to understand a few things about infinity, and to have it explained by someone that seems to really care that you truly understand it."
45,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47975-robu-sensei,3,"Quick summary: Navigating Wallace's tortuous prose is like eating a glass jawbreaker with a wisdom center: if you can tough it out through the pain, not to mention considerable loss of blood, you will discover something beautiful and profound. If you enjoy beauty and profundity in mathematics, at least. If you aren’t, but are still curious about Georg Cantor’s work showing that not all infinities are created equal, the essentials of Everything and More are summarized far more succinctly and accessibly in Aha! Gotcha by Martin Gardner (see “Hotel Infinity,” “The Ladder of Alephs” and “Zeno’s Paradoxes,” pp. 50-53, 143-144 of the 1982 paperback edition).Full review:§1a. Everything and More traces Western thought on the infinite from Pythagoras to the 20th century. The classical Greeks viewed infinity as a philosophical conundrum: like irrational numbers (numbers that can’t be expressed as a ratio of integers, like the square root of 2), transfinite (i.e., infinite) numbers had no place in their orderly universe. Infinity really got its start in the paradoxes of Zeno of Elea (ca. 490-430 BCE). Take his famous story of Achilles and the Tortoise, for example. Imagine the great warrior Achilles in a race against a tortoise. Achilles, a sporting fellow, gives the tortoise a hundred-meter head start. Now suppose that in the time Achilles runs the hundred meters to the tortoise’s starting line, the tortoise manages to walk ten meters. (It’s an uncommonly fast tortoise.) Achilles now has to catch up ten meters, but while he does, his opponent pulls ahead another meter. We can continue forever this way: each time Achilles closes the gap between where he is and where the tortoise was, the tortoise gains a little more ground, and so on, ad infinitum. The important point is that although we can easily identify the flaw in Zeno’s thinking; namely, that an infinite series can have a finite sum (here, the infinite series is the ever-decreasing lengths the tortoise gains on Achilles as the latter is catching up), a conceptual solution is not the same as a mathematical proof. Amazingly, Zeno’s paradoxes weren’t resolved with what we today consider mathematical rigor until the 19th century—nearly two and a half millennia later.The first four-fifths of Everything and More is a long crescendo building toward the central figure of the story, 19th-century mathematician Georg Cantor, whose ideas on infinite sets revolutionized set theory and shook the very foundations of mathematics. Within that last fifty pages we finally get the lowdown on the different classes of infinity*, and consequently, the great undecidable proposition rumored to have driven Cantor insane.(*IYI It wasn’t until p. 248 that I encountered the word “countable.” I’d been expecting it since p. 1.)§1b. Wallace appears to be motivated by veneration of his high-school AP math teacher, E. Robert Goris, about whom nothing is available on the Web. Dr. Goris clearly made the subject fun and exciting, and did so largely by relating fascinating tidbits about the history of mathematics. Wallace attempts to do the same for the reader, but with limited success.§2a. Wallace briefly reviews the mathematics necessary to understand Cantor's work on transfinite numbers, but be warned: unless you've had at least integral calculus, and preferably analysis—a subject usually reserved for hard-science majors—you’re going to have a rough time of it. The technical level isn’t even remotely similar to what I’ve seen in other (alleged) popular science books.§2b. That’s the first challenge of this book that might narrow the audience a bit. The second is that the style of writing is, to put it kindly, informal, and the organization, t.p.i.k, haphazard. While the narrative generally follows a historical timeline, Wallace takes so many diversions and delegates so much crucial information to footnotes (and not necessarily where it’s most needed) that much of the time it’s hard to distinguish the main avenue from all the side streets. The text is imperceptibly divided into seven major sections, each with several subsections. If, through superhuman effort, you succeed in noticing any section heading (see the beginning of this paragraph for an example), you’d better mark it with a Post-It Note, because you’ll be flipping back to it a dozen or more times later on. Most of the footnotes, and a fair amount of the main text, is marked “If You’re Interested,” or IYI for short. In principle, this material is expendable—but as it contains the bulk of the most informative and enjoyable reading, I would disagree.(IYI With these section signs, Wallace may be imitating the style of certain famous books on math such as The Principles of Mathematics by Bertrand Russell. If so, he has succeeded too well.)Also important, but nearly impossible to find later on, are the three Emergency Glossaries plunked down seemingly at random, containing mathematical terms that are either about to become crucial, or not. Fortunately, my math major served me well and I didn’t need to refer back to them; but the non-mathematician reader had better mark these, as well.§2c. Don’t get me wrong; I like informal writing. And sentence fragments, with which this volume abounds. Wallace’s tongue-in-cheek writing style reminds me of my own, which is simultaneously flattering and embarrassing. Yet some of the more eccentric passages and phrases fall less into the “informal” category and more into the “help, I need an editor” category. Foremost in the latter is the author’s frequent, and inconsistent, use of abbreviations for words that really don’t call for abbreviating.At one point, a bit of parenthetical material was concluded with, “This may be important later.” With comments like this, it is difficult to believe that any editor even glanced at the manuscript—but Wallace clearly refers elsewhere that a particular footnote was inserted “at the insistence of the editor.” Which creates a paradox all of its own.§3a. I shouldn’t lead you on that everything I thought about this book was negative. With patience, I gained an entirely new, historical perspective on the mathematics of the infinite—a story whose end I already knew from the classroom, but in the absence of any meaningful context. As a side benefit, I also understood, for the first time, the proof showing that the square root of 2 is irrational, and why the harmonic series—{1/2, 1/3, 1/4, …}—has an infinite sum. If these are the kinds of things that pique your interest, by all means give this book a try. Otherwise, if you wish to know a little about transfinite numbers, look elsewhere for a more accessible introduction without all the brain ouchies."

Newman's 4 vol The World of Mathematics from 1958.Being an eccentric book, with cryptic abbreviations all over every other page, which holds your hand with dorky humor and then blasts them with a hair dryer on a few convoluted technical point every 4 pages, so it's going to attract attention of some sort![has anyone done a type of errata sheet for any of his mistakes?]"

While mostly a math-for-masses book, there's a healthy mix of historical context and philosophical commentary, and DFWs voice brings a sort of freshness rarely encountered in the genre. It's an intriguing concept, so it's sad that the execution falls this flat. Though smirkishly snarky and linguistically fun - this is DFW, after all - ""Everything and More"" is mostly a mess and ultimately a disappointment.The bulk of the book falls in the ""pop math"" camp, and some of the material is solid. This is the first pop-math book I've encountered willing to tackle hairy topic like real analysis, Dedekind cuts, Cauchy's definition of limits, etc, and the book does a good job striking the balance between high-level and nitty-gritty. DFW has a background in modal logic, and it's (mostly) clear he's not out of his depth.That said, there are a few painful math fails I'm shocked made it to the printing press, and suggest the editor has absolutely zero mathematical background / competence. One particular multi-page proof (on proving a certain limit) is so completely and unambiguously botched that my aforementioned confidence in DFW's competence was seriously shaken.Still, a handful of math fails would be easy to forgive. What's less excusable is that many of DFW's explanations are just confusing as hell. His coverage of ordinals - and much of set theory - is muddy and mangled, and I say this as someone with decent familiarity with the topic. I can only imagine how confusing-to-the-point-of-hollowness these sections would land with a casual reader.At it's best, then, ""Everything and More"" poses some interesting philosophical questions about the metaphysics of infinity, and makes some interesting infinity-related connections between various genres of mathematics that got me thinking. The good stuff would have made for some interesting essays. Unfortunately, there's too hearty a helping of muddled, messy bad, and the resulting rough-draft-of-a-book ultimately isn't worth your time."
48,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3778271-zack,4,"To say that I am not the audience for this book is an understatement. My math skills and knowledge are woefully, embarrassingly underdeveloped, such that probably 75% of this book was complete gibberish to me. I don't know that anything Wallace is saying is right, or true, or what almost any of it means anyways.What I am, though, is a Wallace fan, and in this instance more of a fan of seeing how Wallace is doing the work of writing this book than I am of anything else. Watching him not only try to explain these complicated topics in simple language, but then try to communicate the importance of such things was fascinating, as he clearly knew that he was working towards a Herculean task. While somehow not quite flaunting his own clearly prodigious understanding of the world of Pure Math, Wallace manages to remain entertaining and even funny as he works his way through the symbol-heavy prose of the book, the copyediting of which must have been pure joy for him. There are all sorts of little rhetorical asides and flairs that say to me that there is more going on in this book than meets the eye in terms of its mathematical complexity. While certainly a depiction of Cantor and the importance of infinity and infinite sets, it almost seems to me that this entire project was a kind of exercise for Wallace, an attempt to see just how far he could push himself editorially and rhetorically in engaging audiences and working with them to cultivate a persona and an ethos in what is truly a highly technical document. I'd need to think more about it, but it feels at the outset like this project is rhetorically alive in the way that Plato's Phaedrus is - it is simultaneously a discussion of a subject and an exercise in depicting that subject.All throughout Wallace's personality, his quirks, and his passion come through. I may have understood far less than even the average reader of this particular book, but I enjoyed my time with it nonetheless."
49,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1393704-brian,3,"I like to read at least one or two math / logic books a year to keep current. David Foster Wallace's writing makes the history and philosophy of infinity accessible to someone conversant in calculus, but never delved deeper. It was fascinating to learn the metaphysical origins of infinity, and why it was seen as a threat to organized religion. The Church suppressed its exploration until the Enlightenment. The conversant style is engaging. Wallace reassures readers that if the subject seems difficult to understand, well, that is because it /is/ difficult to understand. Wallace acknowledges in the foreword that the work is filled with interpolations, asides labeled 'IYI' for 'If You're Interested' and emergency glossaries in the middle of the text that break the flow and make it sometimes difficult to follow the logical path. These can be skipped without losing the central theme. Mathematical purists may find them inelegant. Some were entertaining, some were tolerable, and some I skipped. About two-thirds of the way through, he said that the subject was going to get much harder, and it did. My reading rate slowed down considerably, and some passages required several readings to go from ""Huh?"" to ""Oh!"" He also warns readers that several of the authors he cites went insane. Whether they were predestined to insanity and chose an insanely difficult subject or the subject was what drove them mad, he declines to speculate. Given DFW's tragic end, and his early and long-standing interest in the debate of free-will vs. determinism, one cannot help but wonder whether he shared their fate or met his demise through his chosen path of inquiry."

For my friend, the very technical passages beginning about halfway through were incomprehensible because they were too technical. For me, the very technical passages beginning about halfway through were infuriating because they were wrong. A few examples: 1. DFW wants to emphasize to the reader how important it is to understand the distinction between pointwise convergence and uniform convergence of a sequence of functions; he then then carefully states this distinction completely incorrectly. 2. His worked out example of an epsilon-delta proof is an utter fiasco. 3. He seems to imply that 0 is not an even number at one point.I began skimming the technical parts myself because I had lost trust that they contained anything of substance. The inclusion of these passages thus seems to be a total waste, which is disappointing, because there is a good book in here somewhere. As a mathematician whose knowledge of math history is rather lacking, I really enjoyed learning about the ideas of the ancient Greeks and about the development of mathematical ideas that we take completely for granted today as they arose throughout the 18th-19th centuries. I just wish, though, that if it was so important to include ""rigorous math"" within the text itself, then it had been edited carefully by someone with the knowledge to catch all of the hogwash. "

In attempting to (partially) explain mathematical developments without the actual use of mathematics, Wallace has managed to make the material more esoteric than any math text I have ever read. It's unfortunate--I had high hopes for this book. However, I should have known that its aim was largely a pipe dream, if said aim was to explain the theories of infinity.I enjoyed the historical narrative portions of the book. The interactions and circumstances surrounding the key players in the philosophy and theory of infinity are quite interesting, and Wallace does a good job of weaving the story of history in a cogent and entertaining manner. But Wallace, please stay away from ever trying to teach mathematics. The enemy of mathematical understanding is vagueness and underdevelopment, and the vast amount of ""asides"" and footnotes is extremely frustrating. The attempts to explain the math arguments require these in order to even properly define what's at play, yet this approach is wholly nonsensical. There is a reason math texts are laid out the way they are: they are the best tools (in print) to communicate the math ideas that we have discovered. If you want to have understanding of the math, read the math book. Even though it is difficult, it is the only path to understanding.TL;DR Historical portions good, maths part bad."

Wallace is often too dense here for a truly casual read yet also too light for truly thorough mathematical instruction, but still his pyrotechnic flair with the written word is on display, as dazzling and dizzying as ever. Really, who better than DFW to parse and analyze the curious quirks of infinity, the quagmires of regressive yet logical thought, the anxieties of knowing that there's something out there that is true and yet incomprehensible? That's the real appeal of this book; to dust off the old cliche, it's about the journey and not the destination. The form of the text is more entertaining than the content.3.5 stars out of 5.

DFW weaves the narrative of the various paradoxes posed by infinity and infinitesimals at almost every stage of mathematical history. He begins from Zeno's paradoxes and how the ancient Greeks tried their best to avoid infinity. Following the dark ages of Europe, infinitesimals became the backbone of the new field of calculus by Newton/Leibniz. But they in turn posed a problem for mathematicians of the 19th century till Bolzano, Cauchy, Abel and Weierstrass put Analysis on a solid theoretical footing. This in turn led to paradoxes in the definition of irrational numbers till Dedekind and Cantor finally laid the founding stones for set theory... which continued to have its own paradoxes till Godel put things to rest.This book requires some attention to read. The material is presented in a lucid way. The history presented in the book shows the role of metaphysical beliefs of mathematicians (Platonism vs intuitionism vs constructivism) in the discovery/proving of the foundations of mathematics.There are errata in the text which can be found here: http://www.thehowlingfantods.com/dfw/..."

But it falls between several stools which would all be hard to reach individually, let alone together: engaging mathematical history, teaching aid, great writing.Overall it has too many shortcomings to make it easy to recommend.

And yet, for every square there is exactly one positive number that is its square root, and for every number there is exactly one square; hence, there cannot be more of one than of the other.Cantor's paradox: The size of an infinite set can be measured, so not only are there infinitely many infinities, but this infinity is larger than any of the infinities it enumerates."

This books definitely satisfied some of those urgings. It starts by raising fundamental questions about the nature of the infinitesimal and the infinite, how great minds over the centuries were baffled by it, and how Weirstrass, Dedekind and most of all Cantor tamed these concepts and brought mathematical rigor into them. The treatment was definitely abstruse given the nature of the problem, and a considerable fraction of the book did go over my head. But whatever I did understand was absolutely delightful and brought home the sheer joy of abstract mathematics."

It's like the difference between a math textbook and the dictionary's definition of math terms.

87,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11561017-matthew-ritter,4,"To judge the review, you need to know at least a little about the reviewer. To that end, I'll begin by admitting I am not particularly interested in mathematics. I am particularly interested in David Foster Wallace (DFW). I bought this book a few years ago in a now forlorn attempt to be a DFW completist. Because of my disinclination towards numbers, Everything and More (EaM) was destined to be the last significant work of his I bought, let alone read.You can imagine my relief when, after the first page, it was abundantly clear that EaM was clearly written by DFW. The text bears his fingerprints. Even the esoteric topics within a history of mathematics' purview could not muffle his distinctive voice, his authorial candor, his cheeky juxtaposition of high-and-low brow, and his prodigious use of linear disruptions like footnotes and interpolations. As a product of a man whose thought is legendarily recursive, Wallace can't tell you about George Cantor (EaM's supposed focus) unless he tells you about Cantor's forebearers, and their forebearers, and their forebearers' forebearers... until we get back to the Scientific Revolution, which can only be explained by brief reference to the medieval era and a long recapitulation of ancient Greek philosophy and the mathematical developments borne out of it. He'll season the whole ""booklet"" with references to his doubtlessly embellished high school math teacher and a thousand ""If You're Interested"" sidebars into related (but not essentially so) subjects. Which is all to say, if you like Wallace, you're going to find a lot of this book familiarly styled and intermittently pleasant.I say ""intermittent"" because the subject matter is Death-Valley-levels-of-dry. Know that the reviewer was a philosophy major and has the intellectual equivalent of drought tolerance that's a prerequisite for reading books by dust-bags like Kant and Hegel. So if I say it's dry, it's dry. After the first 70ish pages of stimulating discussion about human curiosity, our aversion to abstract thinking, and what we do with things that don't make sense, Wallace dives headlong into the sand dunes of functions, derivatives, and set theory. EaM becomes a very detailed account of very high level, very abstract mathematical concepts, axioms, and proofs. Even a man of Wallace's obscene levels of intelligence and perspicacity cannot render things like the Continuum Hypothesis interesting. Tragically, this failing is in the reader, not in the author. But books are written by authors for readers and what's true of all readers is that before a thing can be interesting to them, it needs to be at least partially understandable. I'm sorry to say that even Wallace's conversational tone and generous use of basic examples was not enough to dumb the subject matter down to make sense to a guy who has verifiably above average intelligence but who elected to forgo college level math. All of the symbols, formulas, and terminology is dehydrating. Which, when added to the following fact, makes for a terrible bind for any author trying to write a book about transfinite math. Namely: if you have consulted professional reviews in trying to decide whether or not to pick up a copy of EaM, you'll find the brunt of criticism against the book is technical. Apparently, Wallace cuts too many corners in his attempt make infinity approachable. A number of people with PhDs in math have taken issue with Wallace's retelling of the last 2,500 years of our thoughts on unboundedness and have pointed out places where he is just plain wrong. Of course, whatever the field, experts don't take kindly to non-experts trespassing in on their turf, so these knocks against the genius-but-not-math-doctorate-holding DFW are to be expected. Alas, the general public is not in a position to disagree with the experts. If we submit to these Phds' authority and concede the EaM if laden with inaccuracies, it's another major blow to the project. From the preceding three paragraphs, the reviewer concludes that the author has made something too smart for the general public and too dumb for the specialists.Part of me wishes W.W. Norton had not asked Wallace to write something for their Great Discoveries series. God knows the author of essays about lobsters, John McCain, and the Illinois State Fair and a 1,000 page novel about Quebecois terrorists, tennis prodigies, and recovering drug addicts loved a challenge. His time and energy expenditures on EaM were evidently immense and, in my opinion, squandered on a Herculean task. But if you already love Wallace and you want to hear him basically read the phone book or if for some reason that is wholly foreign to this reviewer you find math interesting enough to have willingly learned calculus but not interesting enough to have looked into how the man who saved that branch of knowledge from ruin in the 20th century also left it a huge, uncleanable mess, then pick up a copy. Otherwise, you should probably leave it on the shelf."

147,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11561017-matthew-ritter,4,"To judge the review, you need to know at least a little about the reviewer. To that end, I'll begin by admitting I am not particularly interested in mathematics. I am particularly interested in David Foster Wallace (DFW). I bought this book a few years ago in a now forlorn attempt to be a DFW completist. Because of my disinclination towards numbers, Everything and More (EaM) was destined to be the last significant work of his I bought, let alone read.You can imagine my relief when, after the first page, it was abundantly clear that EaM was clearly written by DFW. The text bears his fingerprints. Even the esoteric topics within a history of mathematics' purview could not muffle his distinctive voice, his authorial candor, his cheeky juxtaposition of high-and-low brow, and his prodigious use of linear disruptions like footnotes and interpolations. As a product of a man whose thought is legendarily recursive, Wallace can't tell you about George Cantor (EaM's supposed focus) unless he tells you about Cantor's forebearers, and their forebearers, and their forebearers' forebearers... until we get back to the Scientific Revolution, which can only be explained by brief reference to the medieval era and a long recapitulation of ancient Greek philosophy and the mathematical developments borne out of it. He'll season the whole ""booklet"" with references to his doubtlessly embellished high school math teacher and a thousand ""If You're Interested"" sidebars into related (but not essentially so) subjects. Which is all to say, if you like Wallace, you're going to find a lot of this book familiarly styled and intermittently pleasant.I say ""intermittent"" because the subject matter is Death-Valley-levels-of-dry. Know that the reviewer was a philosophy major and has the intellectual equivalent of drought tolerance that's a prerequisite for reading books by dust-bags like Kant and Hegel. So if I say it's dry, it's dry. After the first 70ish pages of stimulating discussion about human curiosity, our aversion to abstract thinking, and what we do with things that don't make sense, Wallace dives headlong into the sand dunes of functions, derivatives, and set theory. EaM becomes a very detailed account of very high level, very abstract mathematical concepts, axioms, and proofs. Even a man of Wallace's obscene levels of intelligence and perspicacity cannot render things like the Continuum Hypothesis interesting. Tragically, this failing is in the reader, not in the author. But books are written by authors for readers and what's true of all readers is that before a thing can be interesting to them, it needs to be at least partially understandable. I'm sorry to say that even Wallace's conversational tone and generous use of basic examples was not enough to dumb the subject matter down to make sense to a guy who has verifiably above average intelligence but who elected to forgo college level math. All of the symbols, formulas, and terminology is dehydrating. Which, when added to the following fact, makes for a terrible bind for any author trying to write a book about transfinite math. Namely: if you have consulted professional reviews in trying to decide whether or not to pick up a copy of EaM, you'll find the brunt of criticism against the book is technical. Apparently, Wallace cuts too many corners in his attempt make infinity approachable. A number of people with PhDs in math have taken issue with Wallace's retelling of the last 2,500 years of our thoughts on unboundedness and have pointed out places where he is just plain wrong. Of course, whatever the field, experts don't take kindly to non-experts trespassing in on their turf, so these knocks against the genius-but-not-math-doctorate-holding DFW are to be expected. Alas, the general public is not in a position to disagree with the experts. If we submit to these Phds' authority and concede the EaM if laden with inaccuracies, it's another major blow to the project. From the preceding three paragraphs, the reviewer concludes that the author has made something too smart for the general public and too dumb for the specialists.Part of me wishes W.W. Norton had not asked Wallace to write something for their Great Discoveries series. God knows the author of essays about lobsters, John McCain, and the Illinois State Fair and a 1,000 page novel about Quebecois terrorists, tennis prodigies, and recovering drug addicts loved a challenge. His time and energy expenditures on EaM were evidently immense and, in my opinion, squandered on a Herculean task. But if you already love Wallace and you want to hear him basically read the phone book or if for some reason that is wholly foreign to this reviewer you find math interesting enough to have willingly learned calculus but not interesting enough to have looked into how the man who saved that branch of knowledge from ruin in the 20th century also left it a huge, uncleanable mess, then pick up a copy. Otherwise, you should probably leave it on the shelf."

207,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11561017-matthew-ritter,4,"To judge the review, you need to know at least a little about the reviewer. To that end, I'll begin by admitting I am not particularly interested in mathematics. I am particularly interested in David Foster Wallace (DFW). I bought this book a few years ago in a now forlorn attempt to be a DFW completist. Because of my disinclination towards numbers, Everything and More (EaM) was destined to be the last significant work of his I bought, let alone read.You can imagine my relief when, after the first page, it was abundantly clear that EaM was clearly written by DFW. The text bears his fingerprints. Even the esoteric topics within a history of mathematics' purview could not muffle his distinctive voice, his authorial candor, his cheeky juxtaposition of high-and-low brow, and his prodigious use of linear disruptions like footnotes and interpolations. As a product of a man whose thought is legendarily recursive, Wallace can't tell you about George Cantor (EaM's supposed focus) unless he tells you about Cantor's forebearers, and their forebearers, and their forebearers' forebearers... until we get back to the Scientific Revolution, which can only be explained by brief reference to the medieval era and a long recapitulation of ancient Greek philosophy and the mathematical developments borne out of it. He'll season the whole ""booklet"" with references to his doubtlessly embellished high school math teacher and a thousand ""If You're Interested"" sidebars into related (but not essentially so) subjects. Which is all to say, if you like Wallace, you're going to find a lot of this book familiarly styled and intermittently pleasant.I say ""intermittent"" because the subject matter is Death-Valley-levels-of-dry. Know that the reviewer was a philosophy major and has the intellectual equivalent of drought tolerance that's a prerequisite for reading books by dust-bags like Kant and Hegel. So if I say it's dry, it's dry. After the first 70ish pages of stimulating discussion about human curiosity, our aversion to abstract thinking, and what we do with things that don't make sense, Wallace dives headlong into the sand dunes of functions, derivatives, and set theory. EaM becomes a very detailed account of very high level, very abstract mathematical concepts, axioms, and proofs. Even a man of Wallace's obscene levels of intelligence and perspicacity cannot render things like the Continuum Hypothesis interesting. Tragically, this failing is in the reader, not in the author. But books are written by authors for readers and what's true of all readers is that before a thing can be interesting to them, it needs to be at least partially understandable. I'm sorry to say that even Wallace's conversational tone and generous use of basic examples was not enough to dumb the subject matter down to make sense to a guy who has verifiably above average intelligence but who elected to forgo college level math. All of the symbols, formulas, and terminology is dehydrating. Which, when added to the following fact, makes for a terrible bind for any author trying to write a book about transfinite math. Namely: if you have consulted professional reviews in trying to decide whether or not to pick up a copy of EaM, you'll find the brunt of criticism against the book is technical. Apparently, Wallace cuts too many corners in his attempt make infinity approachable. A number of people with PhDs in math have taken issue with Wallace's retelling of the last 2,500 years of our thoughts on unboundedness and have pointed out places where he is just plain wrong. Of course, whatever the field, experts don't take kindly to non-experts trespassing in on their turf, so these knocks against the genius-but-not-math-doctorate-holding DFW are to be expected. Alas, the general public is not in a position to disagree with the experts. If we submit to these Phds' authority and concede the EaM if laden with inaccuracies, it's another major blow to the project. From the preceding three paragraphs, the reviewer concludes that the author has made something too smart for the general public and too dumb for the specialists.Part of me wishes W.W. Norton had not asked Wallace to write something for their Great Discoveries series. God knows the author of essays about lobsters, John McCain, and the Illinois State Fair and a 1,000 page novel about Quebecois terrorists, tennis prodigies, and recovering drug addicts loved a challenge. His time and energy expenditures on EaM were evidently immense and, in my opinion, squandered on a Herculean task. But if you already love Wallace and you want to hear him basically read the phone book or if for some reason that is wholly foreign to this reviewer you find math interesting enough to have willingly learned calculus but not interesting enough to have looked into how the man who saved that branch of knowledge from ruin in the 20th century also left it a huge, uncleanable mess, then pick up a copy. Otherwise, you should probably leave it on the shelf."

266,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5368536-mugren-ohaly,2,Most of this went over my head. But I’m a fan of Wallace and I enjoy his writing. 
267,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11561017-matthew-ritter,4,"To judge the review, you need to know at least a little about the reviewer. To that end, I'll begin by admitting I am not particularly interested in mathematics. I am particularly interested in David Foster Wallace (DFW). I bought this book a few years ago in a now forlorn attempt to be a DFW completist. Because of my disinclination towards numbers, Everything and More (EaM) was destined to be the last significant work of his I bought, let alone read.You can imagine my relief when, after the first page, it was abundantly clear that EaM was clearly written by DFW. The text bears his fingerprints. Even the esoteric topics within a history of mathematics' purview could not muffle his distinctive voice, his authorial candor, his cheeky juxtaposition of high-and-low brow, and his prodigious use of linear disruptions like footnotes and interpolations. As a product of a man whose thought is legendarily recursive, Wallace can't tell you about George Cantor (EaM's supposed focus) unless he tells you about Cantor's forebearers, and their forebearers, and their forebearers' forebearers... until we get back to the Scientific Revolution, which can only be explained by brief reference to the medieval era and a long recapitulation of ancient Greek philosophy and the mathematical developments borne out of it. He'll season the whole ""booklet"" with references to his doubtlessly embellished high school math teacher and a thousand ""If You're Interested"" sidebars into related (but not essentially so) subjects. Which is all to say, if you like Wallace, you're going to find a lot of this book familiarly styled and intermittently pleasant.I say ""intermittent"" because the subject matter is Death-Valley-levels-of-dry. Know that the reviewer was a philosophy major and has the intellectual equivalent of drought tolerance that's a prerequisite for reading books by dust-bags like Kant and Hegel. So if I say it's dry, it's dry. After the first 70ish pages of stimulating discussion about human curiosity, our aversion to abstract thinking, and what we do with things that don't make sense, Wallace dives headlong into the sand dunes of functions, derivatives, and set theory. EaM becomes a very detailed account of very high level, very abstract mathematical concepts, axioms, and proofs. Even a man of Wallace's obscene levels of intelligence and perspicacity cannot render things like the Continuum Hypothesis interesting. Tragically, this failing is in the reader, not in the author. But books are written by authors for readers and what's true of all readers is that before a thing can be interesting to them, it needs to be at least partially understandable. I'm sorry to say that even Wallace's conversational tone and generous use of basic examples was not enough to dumb the subject matter down to make sense to a guy who has verifiably above average intelligence but who elected to forgo college level math. All of the symbols, formulas, and terminology is dehydrating. Which, when added to the following fact, makes for a terrible bind for any author trying to write a book about transfinite math. Namely: if you have consulted professional reviews in trying to decide whether or not to pick up a copy of EaM, you'll find the brunt of criticism against the book is technical. Apparently, Wallace cuts too many corners in his attempt make infinity approachable. A number of people with PhDs in math have taken issue with Wallace's retelling of the last 2,500 years of our thoughts on unboundedness and have pointed out places where he is just plain wrong. Of course, whatever the field, experts don't take kindly to non-experts trespassing in on their turf, so these knocks against the genius-but-not-math-doctorate-holding DFW are to be expected. Alas, the general public is not in a position to disagree with the experts. If we submit to these Phds' authority and concede the EaM if laden with inaccuracies, it's another major blow to the project. From the preceding three paragraphs, the reviewer concludes that the author has made something too smart for the general public and too dumb for the specialists.Part of me wishes W.W. Norton had not asked Wallace to write something for their Great Discoveries series. God knows the author of essays about lobsters, John McCain, and the Illinois State Fair and a 1,000 page novel about Quebecois terrorists, tennis prodigies, and recovering drug addicts loved a challenge. His time and energy expenditures on EaM were evidently immense and, in my opinion, squandered on a Herculean task. But if you already love Wallace and you want to hear him basically read the phone book or if for some reason that is wholly foreign to this reviewer you find math interesting enough to have willingly learned calculus but not interesting enough to have looked into how the man who saved that branch of knowledge from ruin in the 20th century also left it a huge, uncleanable mess, then pick up a copy. Otherwise, you should probably leave it on the shelf."
268,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6079817-rich-bergmann,5,"It's DFW. Marvelous, exquisite, thoughtful, intelligent DFW writing. Beyond that I lack the equipment to critique his writing."
269,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100171325-maude,3,Excellent book of writing advice. I love Writer’s style. Highly recommend for other.
270,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69681561-chris-marks,2,"As impressive as the work is, it fails to give much to a reader not already well familiar with the topic. While the print version would probably deliver more, the Kindle version certainly suffers from an inadequate table of contents, making it impossible to effectively navigate the many cross references. Wallace's frequent use of terms of endearment and abbreviations for the advanced mathematical concepts adds some literary interest but at too high a pedagogical cost. Overall the book is overambitious and disappointing."
271,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27795852-aurora,1,I wanted to love this book...I thought it would be a strange--albeit fascinating--look at infinity. A rare math book taught by a brilliant writer. Infinity given the same treatment as the lobster. But this book was just a little too rambling for it to be interesting. It took math concepts which I love and adore and made me bored. I still love DFW for his essays (he could very well be the type of writer which I only enjoy 20 pages at a time) and I still love infinity. But I might let them stay separate from here on out...this combination just wasn't my cup of tea.
272,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22811057-eric-smith,5,"By far the best-written and most entertaining math book I have ever read. Wallace does a superb job of explaining some extremely difficult mathematical concepts. And what's more, he manages to weave centuries of mathematical advances into an engaging story. There are several points where Wallace elucidates a proof and I literally said ""Wow"" out loud.As an additional bonus, if you hated calculus in university, reading this book may convince how cool it actually is."
273,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91134853-andrew-hardy,4,"Just a wonderful wacky introduction to real analysis, logic, and set theory. It dives head first into some wacky formal results like Dedekind cuts or Bolzano Weirestrass Theorem that are used to springboard even casual readers into the swamp of modern set theory, complete with a discussion of the Continuum Hypothesis. The ending did feel quite abrupt and unfinished, but I guess that's why math departments still exist."
274,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5932356-tim-robinson,1,"It is difficult to write about infinity in layman's terms. But this is no excuse for waffle, pointless digression, philosophising and arrant nonsense. The whole point of Cantor's work was to cut through the irrelevancies and focus on the essentials, to speak clearly about the infinite and indeed to demistify it. That was his great achievement. The author here goes in almost exactly the opposite direction.Unforgivable."
275,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64537960-susanne-kali,3,"I was going to give this four stars - it is quite hard to digest for what it is, but overall good. Then the last 30 pages happened and contained a fair few non-justified inaccuracies and approximations that just didn't sit right with me on a different level from everything else DFW had glossed over for the sake of legibility etc. - so three stars it has to be. "
276,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108010-tina,3,"Was looking for the name of a DFW book and it reminded me that I've actually subjected myself to a few of them. This one I actually really liked the first half of, during which he explores the history of infinity as a mathematical concept. The second half of the book was entirely too equation-heavy. And the whole thing had wayyyyyyy too many footnotes, per DFW's typically obnoxious style. "
277,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17004114-max-urai,3,"Is it possible that DFW was actually too smart to write pop science? I've read other books that touch on Cantor, and most of those were a lot easier to follow. But still: I do completely understand the Diagonal Proof now, which is great and I will bother other people with it for the rest of my life."
278,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5919994-brendan,5,"This book is a painful reminder of why AP Calculus was the last advanced math class I ever took. Most of the abstractions presented here are completely incomprehensible to me. It is, however, a joy to read DFW’s attempt to break them down into understandable concepts. I most likely won’t ever read this again, but I’m glad I read it once. "
279,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19121539-joyce,4,"rated highly purely for some more small snatches of dave's voice, even at the basic ""jnr high"" maths i was completely lost. one regrets he didn't have more time and space and better collaborators to make this worthwhile to more than just completionist wonks like me "
280,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36489074-dan,2,"Just what the subtitle promises, a history of the concept of infinity from the ancient Greeks to the modern mathematical formalism of infinity. I am in general a huge fan of DFW nonfiction, but I couldn’t connect with this one at all. Only made it about a third of the way through. "
281,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12627084-jody-sperling,4,What can I say? Only Wallace could make math this abstract that interesting. I loved it. 
282,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29958225-burck-smith,5,"This is one of my favorite books, though it's a hard, slow read. It brings humor and history to a really dense, but necessary topic. I've struggled through it twice. "
283,0393003388,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32622125-roger-b,3,cluttered meandering read but some interesting history is covered.
