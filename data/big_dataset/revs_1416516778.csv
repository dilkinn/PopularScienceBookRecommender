0,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10433489-david,5,I have been studying Quantum Physics since I read Fritjof Capra’s “Tao of Physics” about 35 years ago. I have also studied C.G. Jung’s Psychological books for the past 40 years and when you compare the thoughts of both writers there is a definite correlation between Quantum and ESP. The simplest source of this phenomena is that in Quantum Physics it is possible for neutrons that are a universe apart that if one stops spinning in one direction and changes it’s course the exact redirection will happen virtually 1000’s of light years apart to the twin. So the concept that as humans we do have entanglements between each others minds is a real possibility according to one of the basic laws of Quantum Mechanics. C.G. Jung investigated Synchronicity for that last 50 years of his life convinced that there are no such of a thing called coincidence but that signals do travel throughout the consciousness universe that relays information to other beings. Both concepts have been proven enough for me to take a very serious look at the possibility that there is a highway at a deep level of consciousness that we all should be watching for events that may seem like extreme coincidence when we actually have been duped into thinking that they are random coincidences instead of an internal Quantum highway of information that makes us feel like we are experiencing deja vu all over again.
1,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/949191-julie,4,"This book was really neat. Reading study after study after study after study, all of which demonstrate that the universe and consciousness are NOT random drives home with scientific evidence that impossible things are not only possible, but common and replicable under scrutiny. Psi (psychic) phenomena, including telepathy, clairvoyance, psychokinesis are explored in the laboratory and grounded in hard science. (Seriously, read it yourself). It serves to point out that the views we have acquired and accepted as ""of course that's the way things are"" are really not that way. The author says, ""Something very interesting is going on here."" Which of course begs the question--WHAT? How can our minds know and respond to things beyond the constraints of sensory stimuli and beyond time?One scientific theory that really stuck with me was an extension of the Quantum wave experiment (which shows that particles behave differently when they are observed. When they are not observed they behave like waves instead of particles--so all outcomes are real in a state of probability). The theory in this book likened neurons firing from the narrow channels in the brain across synapse gaps to the quantum wave experiment. Essentially, the neurons we pay attention to becomes particles, and all the other millions of firing neurons in our brains are probability! After all, if we don't KNOW and aren't PAYING ATTENTION and WATCHING -- does this shadowy netherworld outside of our attention exist??? So incredible! I love this book. It's clear and easy and kind of quietly mind-blowing in its ordinary presentation the data and the data's implications. "

3,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23730910-karl,5,"In his book, “Entangled Minds”, Dean Radin blends his experience as a scientist with his sincere desire to present readers with easily understood and timely information about quantum mechanics and Psi research (Psi as it is used here can be defined as, “A means by which information can be gained from a distance without the use of the ordinary senses.”)After a brief, but thorough, look at the history/origins of Psi, dating all the way back to 2000 BC when the Egyptians used a practice known as ‘dream incubation’ to connect with oracles, Dean takes us through many of the most recent studies into the nature of Psi and then connects this to the realms of science via the world of quantum physics.As science progressed from Newtonian physics into the world of quantum physics in the early 1900s, many of the traditional views and beliefs that were held for hundreds of years started to be re-examined. In spite of assertions made by people like physicist Albert Michelson, the first American to win a Noble prize, who claimed that the laws of physics had all been discovered (by the end of the 19th century), we see that the five basic assumptions in classical physics: reality, locality, causality, continuity, and determinism are now being questioned under the new rules of quantum physics. Non-locality, entanglement, the Observer effect, and even retroactivity are terms now being used that at one time would have been considered preposterous, nonsensical and even heretical.Scientific research, conducted over many decades, in different labs around the world, with different research teams and participants, has proven that various forms of Psi do indeed exist; however, the precise mechanisms of how these phenomena work is still a mystery and the topic of much debate. In spite of this, various hypotheses do already exist and one underlying fact that they all seem to have in common (in my layman’s opinion) is that the mechanisms of Psi cannot be explained with traditional, Newtonian physics: it seems that the answer lies in the quantum world.It is this possibility that Dean explores with a sense of wit and optimism in “Entangled Minds” and I believe a comment that Dean makes sums up perfectly the views that scientists must take if they do wish to discover the nature of the universe. Dean states that, “My prejudice is that it’s more important to promote the serious study of novel ideas than it is to worry that some of those ideas might be wrong. I feel this way because history shows that virtually all exciting breakthroughs in science come from entertaining “crazy” ideas.”Perhaps one day in the not too distant future, scientists like Dean Radin will have conquered the unfounded fears of Flat Earth folks who refuse to accept that there might truly be “spookiness at a distance” and perhaps at that time it will be common sense that the field of science and, heaven forbid, psychic phenomena are indeed children of the same parents."
4,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40458247-lext,4,"This book can be roughly divided into two halves. In the first half, the author primarily talks about parapsychology experiments and the scientific/mathematics reasoning behind them (to prove that they're real and not random). Although the math is sound, the reading can get a bit boring and repetitive, especially if you're already familiar with parapsychology books before.The second half is what I find much more interesting. Here the author talks about quantum-related or quantum-oriented phenomenon that are remarkably similar in behavior to what's happening in parapsychology. There's no link of course: no one has yet been able to show a link between quantum physics and these otherwise non-physics phenomenon. But the similarity between them is remarkable, and does make one wonder about the possibilities.The second half while interesting is also very complex. Even though you can understand a paragraph or even an experiment, it's easy to lose track of the big picture and get confused the next time you reread. So this will be more appropriate as a book for you to keep and go back again and again until you're totally familiar with everything the author wants to say. I didn't have that chance because I only borrowed it from the library, so in a few months time I'll probably forget what the experiments were about. So be prepared to exercise your mind a bit (unless you already have a PhD degree in math/physics) and spend some quality time with it. It's not for the casual reader for sure."

That probably haven't been presented as substantially in one single work before, or even separately. It goes through the history of the most scientifically relevant studies in psychic phenomena, since their inception. It investigates and presents evidence (reserch, not just arguments) about why psychic phenomena have been traditionally regarded as an exotic, to say the least, field of research, and usually there is very little, close to zero funding and ""serious researchers"" avoid getting close to it, so their careers and reputations don't get contaminated. It goes on showing what are now the main fields of research, in psychic phenomena, the names and findings to look for. And it gives a clue for a theory that can explain, in a global way, extrasensory experiences. That is where the name came from. Entagled Minds came from the quantum physics expression ""entaglement"" and it sugests that, since particles are entangled, entaglement is what could explain such things as telepathy."
7,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20821394-laine-cunningham,2,"The title of this book promises to delve into the connections between quantum physics and ESP. While it provides a wealth of information about the history of ESP research, including studies that prove that it's real, the book deals only lightly with the quantum side. It's not that the explanations of quantum theories aren't there; they are, in a way that is easily understood by folks like me who aren't scientists. There just isn't a whole lot of it. Because of this lack, I was disappointed in the book. It made for some interesting reading about ESP alone but I wasn't looking for that. If the title had been different, it wouldn't have been disappointing because my expectations would have been different. "
8,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/643681-rick,5,"Warning: Although well written, this is a hard book to read with a lot of statistical analysis.This is essentially the follow-on of Dean Radin's earlier book ""The Conscious Universe"". Personally, I think it is one of the most significant books I have ever read. Chapter 13 (Theories of Psi) is especially thought provoking....and sometimes hard to grasp...I had to read it twice. Chapter 14 (Next) is kind of fun to read, especially when he takes the skeptical scientific community to task...well deserved in my opinion :-) "
9,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1892712-krista,5,"Without overstating the case, this books rolls out in logical order a volume of legitimate scientific research on extrasensory perception and links it to quantum physics, including Einstein's action at a distance observations and Bell's theorem. I intended to skim this book, but I ended up reading every word of every experiment and every argument for and against. You can't really read this book and ignore the implications. Fascinating. "

Radin come across as a completely thorough, almost anal retentive-seeming scientist/researcher/practitioner.

It is not quite for general audience, some basic knowledge of scientific inquiry is needed but you don't need a degree. It is well researched with a ton of notes at end. For such an ""iffey"" or pseudoscience-like topic, Radin is very careful and submits a ton of experimental evidence going back a century and keeps his conclusions limited to what the evidence actually shows.Unlike other science authors, Radin does not try to fit in his own commentary or go off on tangents or offer up a ton of theories based on nothing.Only negative thing I can say is, it is a little bit long. There was one or two chapters I found painful to read but the other 80-90% book was definitely worth it."

Radin's book presents a through explanation of documented phenomena and data obtained through controlled methods, thus providing an accessible and supported introduction to the real science of quantum entanglement. I found the thread exploring collective psi effects, interlaced with global occurrences of premonitions of 9/11, especially interesting. The chapter on the mind's influence on matter (through random number generators [RNGs]) to be exceptionally relevant and an increasingly important consideration in understanding the way we interact with our machine/device world.

32,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12122183-pam,4,This book confirmed many of my personal beliefs and experiences. It was very good but I enjoyed the stories far more than the technology of the brain. 
33,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13177682-sky-feather,4,"A detailed presentation with proofs about all the different types of psi phenomena, along with the history of parapsychology, everything beautifully organized with end-notes for instant reference. Dean Radin did a great job by presenting all those references about studies in the field of parapsychology/paranormal.The section of the history of parapsychology and paranormal was interesting –even for me that I don't go nuts about history– as I learned things I didn't know. Just the hyper-analyses of the various experiments and studies and the specific methods to analyze such studies, was a bit tedious at times, though, I know that its usefulness needed to be mentioned, either way.Though the information provided in this book is very interesting, most of the scientists fail to grasp the –even subtler– quantum and conscious reality around us. By which –and according to what I sense– we should not be so much concerned about the brain and its mechanisms. The brain is just an organ of measurement; and in fact the heart emits a much stronger ""signal"" than that of the brain. The ""magic"" is happening at the subtle energetic bodies, externalized to the outer body; there at the connection of our subtle bodies to the Field (meaning here the high intelligent field that unifies everything and all information). And then perhaps the hard-shelled skeptic will rush to add: but we can't measure those phenomena!Yes–for now, and that's what makes it more attractively interesting; because we can have information about these fields of research only from clairvoyants–for now. And by cross-reference of these observations we can see distant points suddenly starting to connect.When we try to put ""magic"" into a scientific laboratory, is when we lose (the ""magic""). Dean Radin tried to build a bridge from the quantum fields of unexplained phenomena to those hard-shelled skeptics out there. In my opinion... perhaps that could never be accomplished. And... that's the magic of it."
34,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2412666-mangoo,3,"This is in essence an updated and slightly lighter (at least if one also reads the endnotes; if not, quite lighter) version of Radin's previous and bigger work (""The consciuous universe""). Structure, claims and content are similar, and in fact this will also repeat to a fair extent in his later offering (""Supernormal""). While in the latter the core is whether current knowledge and experimental data can support the claims of the Yoga Sutras, here the main claim is that psi is getting enough evidence to be considered in our worldview, one where psi is in fact not inadmissible but rather on the verge of being inevitable given what quantum theory and particularly the concept of entanglement purports. In particular, Radin claims that psi is the subjective feeling of entanglement, and supports the opinion that the analogies between quantum behavior and psi may be real as in fact the latter may be enabled or fundamentally based on properties of reality described by quantum theory.As nicely usual, Radin is cautious but strict in reporting cumulative scientific evidence (including his own, until 2005 here), aware of fair criticisms and of psychological reasons for the reactions to psi evidence, and solid in debunking extreme skepticism as well. The final part of the book, dealing with quantum theory and tentative explanations and perspectives, is legitimately speculative and at the moment rather opinable toward the end; yet the book remains a good source of references to academic studies and rather impressive evidence of positive signs that something more than pure chance is at play - which should solicit some serious reform of thought and revisitation of time-tested lore eventually."
35,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48945687-raman-chopra,3,"This is a new genre i have been pointed towards by a friend. This was my second book in this direction, and i liked it. I am a skeptic (as most of us 'science-oriented' people are) but i see as the author points out, this is a field which has been shunned by the scientific community citing this to be voodoo and not to have any scientific basis or studies. However, I paraphrase the author Science is meant to explain what we do not understand, that is the very foundation and purpose of Science.I believe that this field is largely ignored due to the presence of a lot of 'fakes' or people who cheat others citing 'gifts' and ESP capabilities when they have none. This has created a sense of distrust among the masses making people cynical and even aggressively against the entire domain. The author presents some critical experiments performed in very strict and controlled conditions. I did not understand some numbers that the author used to support his claims, for e.g. an increase of 5% over chance (viz. 55% heads in a coin toss experiment against the chance based 50%) was translated into probabilities of numbers like 1 billion to 1, i even saw numbers going upto 10 to the power 100 against 1; which i could not understand. How does an increase of 5-7% as opposed to chance translate to such huge numbers, maybe i need to delve a little deeper on how these figures were arrived at, but its the ideology which mattered to me.It's a nice book, i would recommend it to anyone who is interested in understanding the facts behind this greatly veiled facet of 'Science' :P.Another book, The Holographic Universe is a better read though..."

(Here's my related story: http://www.bastyr.edu/news/general-ne...) Radin sorts through the scientific literature on psi, or extrasensory perception, and argues it's much more robust and convincing than people realize. He wonders if a connected universe will be the next great scientific discovery. As if we live in a ""gigantic bowl of clear jello,"" with actions rippling and touching people further away than modern science allows.Most of the book sailed well above my head, but I enjoyed trying something very different than most of what I read.One of the most surprising discoveries of modern physics is that objects aren't as separate as they may seem. When you drill down into the core of even the most solid-looking material, separateness dissolves. All that remains, like the smile of the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland, are relationships extending curiously throughout space and time. These connections were predicted by quantum theory and were called ""spooky action at a distance"" by Albert Einstein. One of the founders of quantum theory, Erwin Schrödinger, dubbed this peculiarity entanglement, saying ""I would not call that one but rather the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics."""

Lovers of the procedural aspects of science might really take to this, as there are pages and pages and pages dedicated to methodological descriptions and statistical analysis of past experiments. I'm not complaining--this is certainly important for posterity and for fellow scientists. My issue with Radin's approach in this book is that he tries to, on the one hand, validate some aspects of metaphysics while, on the other hand, dismiss and deride it throughout the book in order to distance himself and the work he describes from anything ""new age."" For those of us who feel there is room at the table for visionary, open-minded science AND metaphysics this is disconcerting and a real turn off.

For the last few centuries the overriding classical deterministic, local and casual theory of physics have pushed the idea of psi into the realm of the ridiculous, but with recent developments in quantum theory, technology, and progress in neuroscience etc., the ideas of telepathy, clairvoyance, psychokinesis and so on have become considerably less far-fetched. The agenda of this book is to simply put psi on the scientific agenda, and provides many reasonable and definitive arguments as to why it should be. Unfortunately, apart from proving that psi is real, it falls short of providing a solid framework for developing it further, but it does provide the reader with plenty of food for thought. Perhaps in the coming decades scientific interest, technology and theory will develop enough to help us understand this slippery subject in more depth."

Probably true in some cases, but I don't think it's fair to lump everyone - in any camp - into one big assumption.Because I've given up on the book, be aware I could be wrong about my assumption, perhaps the author portrays things differently further along.

43,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4481388-michael-graeme,5,"A very convincing book that presents the evidence for the ways in which the human mind can impact on events in the universe, can see around corners and seemingly ignore the normal rules of time and space. If you're serious about paranormal research, psi, psychical research or whatever it's called these days, this is a must read."
44,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8767442-rick,3,Starts out trying too hard to be convincing using some questionable logic but half way through uses scientific studies to better make the point. I would have preferred a more objective approach but I do understand that when you're on the fringe it is tempting to appeal to the emotion. Overall I was convinced there is something inexplicable which we would do well to explore.
45,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1043180-tara-thai,3,"The topic is certainly interesting and intriguing, and the book is written in such a way that you don't need to be a quantum physics and entanglement expert to understand it. However, although it started with a bang and got me extremely interested, it ended up spending far too much time trying to justify and prove the validity of psi."
46,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12807072-b-r-gonzales,4,"A very-well written (and well endnoted) account of the (then) current scientific studies of various psi phenomena. By presenting numerous scientific studies of psi, Dean Radin argues the psi phenomena are real and worthy of further scientific investigation. In the latter part of the book, he delves into some speculative explanations for what psi might be."
47,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/290968-barbara,4,"This is a good book for people interested in psychic phenomena. The author does a good job of offering evidence for the existence of certain phenomena that can't be explained by science but which are hard to deny. Many have tried to do this, but Radin does a particularly good job."
48,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2042662-juanita,4,This books feels a little like Galileo must have felt when he figured out the world was round. Dean Radin discusses some cutting-edge science that will change the way the world thinks when people are ready to fathom the unfathomable. 
49,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36582446-brandon,1,"Terrible book, the author washed away any potential the content had for being profound and stimulating. This book is filled with obscure statistics that did not mean anything to me, would not recommend. "
50,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1123797-harry,4,Surprised me how much good research already exists on Psi effects. I now have a different understanding of skeptical thinking.
51,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2171809-robin,5,Quantum physics. awesome. love it.

53,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/799735-gabrielle,0,Skimmed passages. Interesting and hopeful.
54,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2862837-kim-jinnett,4,"If you like psi, read this!"
55,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1690842-tim,5,"Great book, however a basic understanding of Quantum principles will help. "
56,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13187772-shaunt,2,Slippery-slope bunk about psychic mysticism with no real science to back it. Mostly a collection of lucky observational studies.Look elsewhere for topics on quantum entanglement.
57,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13360848-darren-randall,3,"Some interesting stuff, bit too much fluffing about experiments ect for me. Maybe not quite the book I was after but still an interesting read. "
58,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23806255-tom-hull,4,"About the science behind the interconnection of consciousness, and the experiments and people who have been studying/researching this subject matter "
59,1416516778,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2409668-bert-hopkins,5,Book is so dense that an additional reading will be required. But well worth the time invested.
