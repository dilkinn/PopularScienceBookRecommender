0,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5155466-clare,3,"My fiance is a mathematician and I am a biologist. One of his professors reviewed this book, and he wound up with a copy. I wanted to like this book, I really did. And there were parts of it that were quite good. The treatment of Darwin was very good -- even though I have read quite a bit about Darwin's life, I still found it enlightening. The there were lively overviews of networked systems and emergent behavior, and the philosophical/logical discussions of what life is and whether it could exist elsewhere were intriguing. However, the book felt hastily written and/or edited. There were numerous factual errors or misstatements. I can't believe that Ian Stewart didn't know that some of the things that he said were wrong (the possible outcomes of some of the Mendelian crosses, for example), but there it is in print, wrongly stated. One or two errors of this type are forgivable, but I spotted quite a few, and it grew very tiresome.Even worse than the occasional factual misstatement, there were a few places where the logical underpinnings of some ideas were not fully explained or explored in a way that made them misleading. For example, in the ""Lizard Games"" chapter, he talks in depth about the mating strategies of the side-blotched lizard. There are three different types of male lizard: fighters can defeat pair-bonders, pair-bonders can defeat sneakers, and sneakers can slip past fighters. This is sort of an oversimplification of the system, but you can see how it is analogous to the game rock-paper-scissors. Stewart explains that if Alice and Bob play rock-paper-scissors over and over, if Bob always plays rock, Alice can figure out how to beat him. Therefore, both players should play all three strategies in roughly equal frequency. But wait! Each individual lizard does only play one strategy! How does that work? Who are the ""players"" in this game? Stewart just leaves the argument there and doesn't close the loop. The ""players"" aren't necessarily the male lizards themselves, but their mothers. A mother will be most fit if her sons successfully father offspring. She will do the best if she always ""plays"" the best strategy by having the type of sons that defeat the most common type of male in the population -- she doesn't have to do this consciously. Therefore the system as a whole will tend to have equal numbers of all three types of males; whenever fighters are most common, sneakers will be selected for until they are most common, in which case pair-bonders will be selected for, and on and on. By failing to finish the logical progression in his argument, Stewart left the reader with an incomplete perception of how this type of system becomes stable, and how evolution in general works. The rest of that chapter has nothing to do with game theory, and in fact, ends with a very misleading hint that the lizards might be in the process of becoming separate species (which they aren't, because their genes are always mixed in the same pool of females -- unless females strongly prefer to mate with males of their father's type).That chapter was the worst offender for incomplete and therefore incorrect logic, but it wasn't the only case in which his analogies were bad or his arguments left puzzlingly open. Which is too bad, because when I wasn't annoyed at the errors and inconsistencies, I liked the book. It just felt like it was maybe pushing up against a deadline, and Stewart or his editor didn't do the final careful read through that it really needed."
1,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Having dealt with mathematics as applied to physics all of my professional life, this book provides a welcome change. What amazed me is the sheer variety of mathematical approaches that are being applied to biology, including Fibonacci sequences, networks, cellular automata, topology, game theory, multi-dimensional geometries. I had no idea that Alan Turing did work with reaction-diffusion equations, that can be used to model patterns in animal skin stripes versus spots.The book is written very clearly, well organized, and is completely understandable to the layman. Stewart explains that while mathematical models are not completely realistic, simplifying approximations help to generate insights into the underlying biological mechanisms. And, this book is jam-packed with wonderful insights into an array of biology issues. The penultimate chapter deals with the question of life on other planets. While not dealing directly with mathematics, Stewart explains that the possibility of alien life does not necessarily require a planetary system ""just like the Earth"". A wide range of planetary conditions may be able to foster life, and we should not jump to hasty conclusions based on the conditions that seem ""normal"" to us on Earth."
2,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,3,"Stewart argues that mathematics is becoming increasingly important in biology; an uncontroversial enough point.In trying to demonstrate this he is alternately very careful (the first few chapters and large swathes of the later ones serve no apparent purpose other than to show that he bothered to open a college-level textbook at some point during his research for this book; presumably he's trying to pre-empt the criticism that usually applies to people who write outside their field, but I like to think he's trying to atone for his part in Science of Discworld III: Darwin's Watch) and his usual sloppy self (the last few chapters, in particular, on the origin of life and its presence on other planets, are likely to anger you even if the general thrust of his arguments is correct), and the whole thing is a bit of a tangled mess rendered more pointless than it has to be because he is, as usual, afraid of discussing interesting mathematics in anything but the shallowest sense, but I can see how it could be interesting to people to whom any of this would be new (that is, people who have never read any popular biology written in the past four decades).Mostly, though, it's a good demonstration of why people shouldn't attempt to write outside of their field without at least a co-author in the field they're trying to write in. As you would expect."
3,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7051008-elena,3,"Wow! Quite a dense book. When you first start this book, it almost seems like it's going to be an easy read. If you have a background in the sciences or biology, you'll notice even more how easy of a read it is. Boy does it turn out to be otherwise. I kept reading through this book for months. I have finally finished it, truthfully by skimming the last twenty pages or so. I'm entering a quick review of it, but I intend to go back to it this year and read it one chapter at a time again. Really, there are at least five great reasons to read this book.1. You'll learn how the spirals in the head of a sunflower grow at an exact rotation of a specific degree and angle.2. You'll find out how petal and leaves of specific flowers and plants form at specific number combinations and alternate patterns.3. You'll learn about viruses from a fourth dimention.4. Darwin is going to be described in whole new light.5. Variety of mathematical approaches from sequences, networks, cellular and topological theories, as well as multi-dimentional geometries.If you're a scientist, of someone who has been surrounded by the field of science and biology, this is definitely one of those books you HAVE to read. I am absolutely intrigued by how mathematics integrates in every aspect of our lives, to the very cellular level of our existence. This book not only covers our own world, but the whole sets of worlds on our planet. It connects every realm of existence through mathematics.As I mentioned before, though. I will be reading it again. I think you'll either read this book once and that's it, or you'll read it once and you'll crave to go back and revisit some concepts that didn't quite settle with you.How do you feel about mathematical theories being part of every aspect of our lives?"
4,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37016651-sergio-rico,4,Excellent book! Worth reading if you have biology or math interest. My only complaint is the on the chapter on aliens ... a bit unnecessary to say the least.
5,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,3,"I had a notion of Biology as a safe-haven for students challenged by Mathematics. Author Ian Stewart deals a permanent blow to this notion in this book . He says that Biology is at the cusp of what he calls a sixth revolution. According to him, the Life Sciences have gone through five revolutions in the past. They are as follows:(i) the invention of the Microscope,(ii) the systematic Classification of Earth's living creatures,(iii) the theory of Evolution,(iv) the discovery of the Gene and(v) the discovery of the structure of the DNA.The embrace of Mathematics by the Life Sciences now would be the sixth revolution.In some ways, this foray of Maths into the Life Sciences should not come as a surprise. Over the years, we already have an image of the Life Sciences as consisting of a lot of Physics and Chemistry. For example, the study of the Brain morphs at times into a study of networks of Neurons. The study of the DNA is often about various chemicals and helix-like structures. Where there is Physical Science, there is Mathematics.This book contains nineteen chapters. It provides an overview of the role Mathematics has played in unlocking the secrets of the Natural world. It also shows what prospects lie in store for us in the future. I will touch upon a couple of examples from the book as a sample. The chapter 'Florally finding Fibonacci' elaborates on the Fibonacci series and the Golden Ratio. The Golden Ratio of 'phi' (phi = 1.61803....) is a major player in many patterns which occur in the universe. The number of petals in a flower follows the Fibonacci sequence. Each petal is placed at 0.618034 per turn (out of a 360° circle). This allows for the best possible exposure to sunlight. Snail shells follow the logarithmic spiral. Spiral galaxies in our Universe follow the familiar Fibonacci sequence.The chapter 'Lizard Games' touches on the mathematician Alan Turing's work. Turing gave a mathematical explanation for the patterns in the spots on a leopard and the stripes of a tiger. The chapter 'Virus from the Fourth Dimension' discusses the structure of Viruses. It deals with the application of multi-dimensional Geometry in their understanding. As early as 1956, scientists observed that a majority of Viruses are either like a football or a spiral staircase in shape. In other words, they have a shape as an icosahedron or a helix. Abstract Geometry in higher dimensions is used in the study of Icosahedrons. An Icosahedron is a solid figure with twenty plane faces, especially equilateral triangular ones. At the heart of the Icosahedron is the concept of symmetry. Mathematicians have developed a profound theory of symmetry called group theory. It has applications throughout the sciences. All this is applicable to real viruses, which we observe in three dimensions. The one catch is that we need to apply a geometry in six dimensions!The author makes some philosophical observations on Science and Mathematical models. He says that Science is rarely about direct observation but mostly about indirect inference. For example, no one observed the evolutionary divergence of humans from chimpanzees. Still, we know for sure through indirect evidence that it did happen. On models, he says ""What counts is what the model predicts, not what it leaves out”. In other words, it is important that a model must be consistent with existing data. But its real value comes from its predictive capabilities.I must say that I found the book a tough read, because of my lack of grounding in the Life Sciences. I had started reading the book with certain assumptions. I thought that it would be about the application of Mathematical concepts in Biology as of today. But the so-called sixth revolution is just beginning, according to the author. So, there is a lot less Maths and a lot more of Biology in the book. This makes it difficult for readers who do not have a good grounding in Biology. I would say that this is a serious book on Biology rather than a popular one on Mathematics. Still, I could get a broad idea of the fundamentals of the elements of Life and how Mathematics interacts with it. The author himself sums it all up quite well in the end as follows:"" In Darwin's day, geology, not mathematics, was vital to the nascent theory of evolution. In the 1960s, Chemistry became an essential foundation for cell biology. Then, computer science joined in, with the advent of bio-informatics. Now, physics and mathematics are entering the fray. ....you can no longer study biology as if the rest of science didn't exist"""
6,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4541461-james,4,"Did you know that there are 300,000 species of plants, 30,000 species of fungi and 1.25 million species of animals of which 1.2 million are invertebrates (lack a backbone)or that the majority of viruses are icosahedral(20 sided)or helical in shape. Ian Stewart has sprinkled these knowledge nuggets throughout his book, The Mathematics of Life. In the first third of this book he also provides a well done capsule history of biology by discussing the five revolutions in biology: the microscope,classification,evolution,genetics and DNA structure. The remainder of the book discusses areas of mathematics such as Fibonacci and Lucas sequences,geometry,topology,probability theory,group theory, network theory and mathematical modeling and their application to numerous topics in biology. Topics such as spiral patterns in sunflowers and pineapples, the shape of DNA and protein molecules,genetics,the structure of viruses,evolution and even hallucination patterns. This was primarily an easy read except for a couple of chapters like the one on viruses where subjects like group theory and Penrose tiling require a little more intellectual digestion and maybe a re-read. I particularly enjoyed reading the chapter entitled ""Is Anybody Out There?"" which discusses what alien life forms should look like."
7,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25299762-jeff,3,"This book was tricky. If you read the first few chapters, you’ll start to wonder that you’ve made a mistake and picked up a book that’s going to be TOO easy to read. You’ll start with the history of the microscope and the “structure of DNA,” and re-read things you learned in high-school biology like the structure of a cell or how plants and animals are classified into various orders or kingdoms.After being lulled into a false-sense of security, you’ll learn about how the spirals in the head of a sunflower grow at an exact rotation of a specific degree of angle, or how leaves on plants bud at common and predictable angles, or why 137.5 degrees is the golden angle and how nature uses it to produce beautiful displays of art.At this point, you might think, hope even, that the book will tell you all of nature’s mathematical secrets—and in a way, Ian Stewart does. But with each successive page, the depth of his examples made me feel less and less adequate to take on such a book. By the end, I was hopelessly clamoring to understand everything he was telling me, but finding myself unable to do so.This is a book that will take more than one reading—and most likely research on the side—to understand. Stewart has a great writing style and a slew of other books that compliment this one, I’ll be reading more of him soon."
8,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6376052-lois-keller,4,"I thought this was an amazing piece of non-fiction. I would very highly recommend this book to just about anyone. Why? Stewart is one of those people who's real calling in life is too teach, and it permeates every chapter of this book. Although I am not a biologist, I felt like I could follow and understand the basic biology concepts used in this book after freshman year biology. However, I can not attest to accuracy in a lot of his claims on biology for that reason also - it would be nice to have an evolutionary biologist weigh in on a lot of the topics he addresses. As for the Mathematics part, Stewart keeps it straight forward and does an excellent job of explaining a lot of the mathematical concepts and terms. Most of them are patterns, like the Fibanacci Sequence, and are easy for just about everyone to understand if explained properly. There were only a few times in this book that I felt a little bogged down and lost, which, quite frankly, is impressive for a non fiction about math and biology. If you have a chance or you are interested in applied mathematics, I think this would be a fantastic read for you, and it comes with my highest recommendation. You will definitely learn and few new things and maybe even see the world a litte differently. "
9,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2978799-meg,2,"Stewart's primary argument is that mathematics is a revolution to biological sciences on the order of the microscope, DNA, Mendelian genetics, Darwin, and classification of species. The first part of the book, which he spends discussing each of these biological revolutions in turn is well-written and easily followed. The second part of the book is more mixed in its successes. In instances, Stewart takes exceedingly complicated mathematics and explains them in brilliantly simplistic terms for the layperson. There were chapters, however, where I felt that either his arguments were less effective or his explanation of the mathematics was less successful. Regardless, this is still a dense book, but one from which I feel I learned quite a bit."
10,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36538611-ken-ransom,5,"For readers with painful memories of high-school algebra and geometry, this book about mathematics is for you. You'll understand and enjoy Stewart's explanations of population growth, speciation, brain function, chaos, Darwin and evolution, and game theory, networking, symmetry and even the mechanism that produces animal stripes and spots. All chapters begin with basics, but if you don't have a wee bit of scientific background it can be a struggle to the end. But it is written so well that it is a book you'll want to pick up and read again later. Something I intend to do."
11,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/165324-hom-sack,2,"There is very little mathematics in this book about biology. What little there is is not all that interesting. Nevertheless, the topics covered could have been made more engaging and better explained had they been accompanied by animation. The book would have been ideal written in the new Wolfram Research Computable Document Format (CDF). Instead, it only has black and white illustrations that mostly appear after the page cited."
12,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6619427-josh-mcdevitt-spall,2,"Even a giant math nerd like myself found some of this difficult to follow. Appreciated finally learning to understand the Fibonacci connection to flowers, but after that it kinda became way too deep into the applied physics of DNA proteins for me."
13,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1415461-chris-webber,4,"Awesome. If you like the mating of math and science to explain the complexities of the world around you, you will love this book."
14,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4723937-j,3,"There is definitely some good stuff in the middle of this book, but the first half is taken up recapping big moments in biology and it's hard to imagine anyone reading the book not knowing that stuff already, so it probably could have been done much, much quicker. Also, the author seems repeatedly to convince the reader that evolution is a real thing, but -again- who's reading this sort of book without believing in evolution? So if you skip the first third-to-half of the book, there's plenty of cool examples of mathematical usage in biology, generally well-explained in a non-technical manner. But, man, the intended audience is really weird."
15,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26099559-beau,4,"“What is Life?”“What is Life?” Is the title of a little book written by Erwin Schrödinger in the early 1940s. It explores the fact that life is a process of negative entropy (as all machines are) in that livings borrow energy from the environment to organise and build their bodies. (In plants, sunlight, in animals, the biological life forms they eat) I was disappointed in the first page through that the Author did not address this issue, an issue I consider crucial to life. It is essentially a mathematical exercise to understand thermodynamics."
16,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19893787-andrew-goddard,2,I feel like this book could have been improved with a different structure. Frontloading biological history without integrating the maths stuff until about halfway through made this book a bit dull at points. The author also flippantly slags off GTA for no apparent reason. I therefore docked a star from the rating for no apparent reason.
17,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100066042-bhargavi,5,I m also a biology studen but this book give me to think also from mathematics angle in biological world nd there Twist nd turn... 
18,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2899477-bryan-higgs,4,"I am a fan of Ian Stewart. I own several of his earlier books, all of which I have read and enjoyed immensely. So, I had high expectations of this book, his latest. However, I was disappointed. But perhaps it is more my own biases than any failings on Prof. Stewart's part that explain this. I was educated in Physics and Mathematics -- I have a Ph.D. in Experimental High Energy Particle Physics -- and gave up Biology in school at the age of about 14, because I couldn't stand having to copy drawings from the book, and regurgitate stuff out of that same book. Physics suited my urge to have a measurable science, one based on principles upon which one could build with precision. In those days (in the 1950s), biology seemed like a very weak science, and this was before many of the major discoveries in Biology -- and the creation of microbiology and other branches -- had made their way into the school Biology curriculum.I find that, whenever I read something about Biology -- for example, in Discover Magazine or similar -- I quickly lose interest. Perhaps it's something to do with the great complexity and still lack of precision; perhaps it's related to the arcane language that seems to pervade the subject; perhaps all of the above and more. Of course, every science -- every discipline -- has its own jargon; it's just that I don't seem to be able to absorb it to the level where I can get engrossed in the subject.This book does a very admirable job of describing a lot of biological discoveries -- something I definitely needed! I think I was disappointed to see how little detailed mathematics was discussed. Note that there were lots of mathematical topics, and their relationships with aspects of biology, covered. It's just that the mathematical detail wasn't sufficient for my liking. I don't know whether this is a result of how Prof. Stewart wanted to present things, or whether the publisher told him the usual stuff about how ""every mathematical formula you put in will significantly reduce the sales of the book"" (or something like that).Perhaps the title ""The Mathematics of Life"" suggests that there will be more Mathematics covered than Life?Don't misunderstand me; this is a good book -- it's just not what I was hoping for."
19,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27131907-lauren,5,"This book has proved to me yet again that in order to become a mathematician you must have high levels of sarcasm and wit. Very entertaining. In addition, Stewart explains everything so well, and I learned more from the first twenty pages of this book than from a year of high school biology (but let's be honest here it's not like high school biology is really comparable with anything...). It was very well organised with no confusion, and it is definitely a book I will be purchasing a copy of as soon as possible."
20,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7836631-doc-kinne,4,"A better book than I originally gave it credit for, and an amazingly educational book for me. The writing was good and clear, and there was surprisingly little mathematics in a book that is titled The Mathematics of Life. What Stewart did was deal in concepts, which you can actually more readily do in higher mathematics. He was so good at it at one point that the chapter ""Viruses from the Fourth Dimension"" finally had me understanding n-dimensional mathematics. You would think that I would have understood that in graduate school when I was doing tensor mathematics, but, not so much.Two things that need to be communicating clearly to the general public were brought out clearly by this book. First, science is usually far more complex than is communicated to us, but that complexity - and what we don't know - does not necessarily lead to invalidating the basic concepts. Stewart, for example, thinks its crazy that we are genetically modifying foods and giving them to consumers as we are. Worse, he thinks that the companies involved know this or else they wouldn't be reacting as they are by wanting to hide what they're doing. However genetic modification, per se, is NOT bad, just how we're going about it by thinking that we can write Shakespeare when, right now, we just learned the letters to the alphabet.The second thing is best characterized by the following excerpt from the chapter, ""Lizard Games:""You may wonder how scientists can be sure that evolution happened when they don't understand many of the details. However, we are faced with exactly this situation on a regular basis. [...] We know that the cat brought a mouse in last night, because the gruesome evidence is on the kitchen floor, but we never saw the cat do it. Science is seldom about direct observation: it is nearly always about indirect inference.(Emphasis mine)If you're interested in the titled subject matter - but more, if you're interested in how science can work in the face of piecing things together across multiple areas and disciplines - The Mathematics of Life is worth it."
21,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2432880-bob,3," Stewart touches briefly on some of the many ways in which mathematics, just because it simplifies and idealizes situations, can point biologists to explanations of the extraordinarily complex processes they study. Examples include n-dimensional geometry to predict viral structures, number theory's contributions to Mendel, chaos theory to explain the conundrum posed by the huge variety of species in plankton exploiting a single environmental niche, game theory applied to interspecies competition, symmetry breaking in perception and pattern formation, neural networks, and knot theory applied to biochemical dynamics. The book is not so amusing as Flatterland, though Stewart has his moments: ""One of the biggest problems with the theory of evolution is that everyone thinks they understand it."" (p. 215) The explanations were also not as lucid. He does give a very clear notion of the way in which mathematics, so abstract and logical, can enlighten the messy, competitive, and ad hoc world of plants and animals fighting to stay alive. "
22,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22880326-mkfs,4,"I have long enjoyed Ian Stewart's mathematics books. This one started off pretty slow, but got better as the book went on. The first four chapters were a bit of a waste; from chapter ten onwards, the book became quite rewarding.This is, obviously, a layman's book about advances in biology. Unlike most popular science books, however, this one assumes a mathematical background on behalf of the layman. Whether this works or not will depend on the reader. I found it quite useful, as concepts in biology were mapped onto mathematical constructs which I already knew and understood.I found The Mathematics of Life to be much less mathematically demanding than A Mathematical Nature Walk. The discussion here is driven by narrative, rather than by equation, and the techniques tend to rely on abstract and linear algebra (which I encounter fairly frequently) more than geometry (which I rarely encounter)."
23,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2130032-daniel-r,3,"The book explores the author's premise that mathematics is the sixth revolution to impact biology following those of the microscope, classification, evolution, genetics, and DNA's structure. The first third of the book examines the history of each of those revolutions and the impact on biology. The remainder of the book consists of vignettes about the interplay between mathematics and biology. The breadth of material exposed me to fascinating tidbits about animal patterns, evolutionary niches, and general biology. Alas the chapters are loosely coupled and the drive to prove that mathematics is the sixth revolution for biology is barely mentioned at all. In fact the book concludes that ""I doubt that mathematics will ever dominate biological thinking in the way it now does for physics, but its role is becoming essential."" While I found the book enjoyable to read it's lack of depth or cohesiveness left me wanting more."

At some points, the mathematical concepts might have been above my level, but otherwise, the author did a good job of keeping the math understandable. He stressed throughout the book how interdisciplinary biology is, especially with mathematics, and showed how mathematical concepts as symmetry and the golden ratio are intertwined with biology. My favorite chapters involved the golden ratios found in botany, viruses, and the chances of life on other planets."
26,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2379275-greg,3,"In general this was pretty good, but he didn't quite make his case that Biology is about to undergo a mathematical revolution. It also lost its way in the final few chapters, where I think he ran out of relavant things to say, so searched the history books for fringe opinions that people held 20 years ago to show that maths shows it to have been wring, despite most people always having known that"
27,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1364455-matt,4,"I felt like it was mostly a history of science, highlighting the role that mathematics has played in the development of scientific discoveries in the past 150 years.

28,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2064318-shayla,4,"An interesting look at how biology and math intersect. Lots of fascinating quirks of nature that have a mathematical twist, and a convincing argument that biology needs mathematicians to go further.

35,0465022383,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9515506-tony-helies,4,life and biology are indeed determined by math as much as physics. This book shows why. Good read if you are interested in biology and math.

In this book in particular he starts off with a theme from biology and then expands on it using mathematics. If you've read some popular science books, you will be met with things that you know (the presence of fibonacci and the golden ratio everywhere). The only 'new' part which I enjoyed, was the reformulation of some theories from evolutionary biology. He spent an entire chapter introducing the game theory. "
