0,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"First you need to find yourself an interesting verb – Sway in this case, obviously, but Snoop is also good, as is Stick. It doesn’t have to start with ‘s’ – there’s Blink as well, of course. Then you need some really good stories about people at the end of their tether. Plane accidents are particularly good for this. Both Outliers and Sway both have plane crashes and both have you at the edge of your seat waiting for the inevitable.Then you need ‘get-out-of-here’ psychology tests – honestly, who comes up with the ideas for these things and why, WHY, are they still allowed to out on the streets? Clearly these people are a danger to themselves, their families and the rest of the community. I mean, who would think to test how much more attractive you find a woman after crossing a rickety bridge? What sort of sociopath would you need to be for that to present itself as something that you might like to test?If you do want to write one of these books it also seems to help if you are from Israel. I’m not going to pretend I understand this final connection – but that has been true of both this one and Predictably Irrational. Oh, and you might want to write the book with your brother. Not sure how this works either, but it does seem to. Made to Stick was also written by a pair of brothers.I have read so many of these books lately and I’m currently also struggling my way through another called Nudge (again written by two people, but this time not brothers, or even related – although both male). Even if I feel I’m overdosing on this stuff, this one was a particularly fine example of the genre.This was good not so much because all of the examples were new, but because they put an interesting twist on the interpretation of what these odd behaviours might ‘mean’.I’m not going to go into the explanation of why the chief pilot in charge of safety for an airline might end up causing the worst plane crash of all time – although, this would be as good a reason to read this book as any other I can think of, nor any of the other seemingly endless examples of human irrational behaviour. But I do mean to talk about who wants to be a millionaire, because this has really made me think.I really love the French. I know people don’t like them for some reason or other, generally involving some talk of arrogance, but I love their sense of humour and I love their sense of style. That whole stuff-the-rest-of-you-we’re-French thing or the, if we want to blast the b’Jesus out of some atoll in the South Pacific, well, it is our atoll. And if you want to stop drinking our wine to protest – what can we say, but you will only be punishing yourselves. I would love to have that level of self-confidence.I was talking to someone the other week about the whole ‘Freedom Fries’ thing – but I had forgotten some of the details of this story. This is retold here in full and is probably worth the price of the book for that alone. I had missed the French reply to the proposal to change the name of French Fries to Freedom Fries simply because the French had the audacity to say that it might be dumb to invade Iraq. I hadn’t realised they had responded by saying something to the effect of, “This is much more important than potatoes”. Given that most rational people in the world would now agree with France probably means we should change the name again to Fickle Fries.But I distract myself. The best bit of this book is the description of the French version of who wants to be a millionaire when the contestant turned to ask the audience the answer to what ought to have been a simple question of astronomy – what revolves around the earth and the audience effectively said ‘stuff you’. The Wisdom of Crowds points out that if you ever end up on this show and find yourself in difficulty you should rely on the answer given by the audience, as in the US the audience gets the right answer over 90% of the time. But in France or Russia this is not quite so simple a choice. In France if the audience thinks you are too thick to deserve to win they are just as likely on mass to give you the wrong answer. In Russia if they think you are stepping too far out of line they are also as likely to give you the wrong answer. Imagine that! Imagine that there are cultures that will decide whether to help you or not based on whether they think you deserve to win or not. This discussion really fascinated me.I really liked that this one started each chapter with a whole series of what were virtually headlines and it was only as you got into the chapter that you began to understand that “We don’t even know where the tunnel is” might refer to LBJ.But the bit of this book that will stay with me for months is the random attribution of ‘gradings’ to soldiers and how this got the soldiers to live up to how they were graded. If you ever needed some proof about why you should encourage your kids – this is it.This is a wonderfully well written book and one that really could not fail to amuse. Yet another of the long line of books on the troublesome boarder between economics and psychology that have been providing me with so much joy lately."
1,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,4,"I was not at all in the mood for another non-fiction book about human behavior when my husband asked if I wanted to read this one before he returned it to the library. I half-heartedly decided to scan a few pages before saying no, but I was quickly sucked in to a fictionalized re-creation of the last few hours in the cockpit of the KLM flight responsible for the 1977 Tenerife crash that claimed the lives of 583 people.Though this book looks at research from social psychology, behavioral economics, and organizational behavior in order to explain why humans often make highly irrational choices, it does so in a compulsively readable fashion. The authors are good storytellers who know how to engage the reader as they explain surprising findings from a whole host of diverse research.Though I was already familiar with how fear of loss and commitment to a position can have devastating effects on investors, I enjoyed reading about how these in-built habits played out on the football field and on anthropological digs. People responsible for hiring others will benefit from the chapter explaining the flaws of the ""first-date"" style interview, and pretty much everyone would do well to read the stunning findings on how negative attitudes about aging can affect one's health.The chapter in which the authors discuss how our innate capacity for altruism can be undermined by financial incentives is also fascinating, as is the authors' discussion with Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer on the impact of a lone dissenting voice on our highest court. In the epilogue, the authors summarize their main points and offer a few hints on how to avoid being negatively impacted by some of the factors most likely to sway us to make questionable choices. Though I'm not certain how easy it will actually be to overcome the multiple evolutionary habits that cause us to make irrational choices, it was still terribly fun to read."
2,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,4,"Great book. Quick read, and you learn about about psychology that you can apply to life or business.A few notes:- All about first impressions. First impressions can sway our opinion of something for years to come regardless of subsequent performance.- Labels matter. If you label someone as a higher performer, top of class, leader, having command potential, etc - it will translate into them actually having it. My high school motto was Principes Non Homines (leaders not men) - now I know why they thought that would work.- When we brand or label people they take on the characteristics of the diagnosis.- People are easily swayed when other people they deal with are decent or nice or fair to them. You enjoy a restaurant 10 times more if the waiter is really nice, regardless of the food (the product). Same goes for any service or business relationship.- Heightened adrenaline levels lead to higher levels of romantic interest - We have ""two engines"" running in our brain that don't operate simultaneously. So we usually approach things from either an altruistic perspective or a self-interested one. Money (self-interest) is not always the best motivator - sometimes pride (in your country, your city, what you do) will inspire people much more. "
3,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1944947-barnaby-thieme,2,"I wish I could recommend this book, as the topic is an interesting and important one, but I can't. It's simply not well written or organized. Brafman treats the hot topic of cognitive biases and nonconscious factors that contribute to decision making, an area which has received enormous attention in recent years in cognitive and social psychology (Wegner, Wilson), and economics (Tversky). I gather what he's trying to do is to present some of the basic findings to a lay audience. Either Brafman's wrong and he's dumbing it down WAYYYYY too much, or I'm wrong and we live in a nation of imbeciles. His organization of the basic concepts is simplistic and reductive, and the basic facts of the research are concealed by several thick interpretive layers. For readers who are not completely put off by scientific material -- who would be comfortable, say, with ""A Brief History of Time"" or Science Daily -- you will get much more from books like ""The Illusion of Conscious Will"" and ""Strangers to Ourselves."" "
4,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5647191-orsolya,3,"We’ve all made irrational decisions: be it in work, love, or finances. The question is, why? What psychological drive causes this behavior? Brothers Ori and Rom Brafman explore these burning questions in, “Sway: The Irresistible Pull of Irrational Behavior”. In “Sway”, Brafman and Brafman attempt to explore loss aversion, value attribution, and the diagnosis bias in order to explain human behavior which is either irrational or out of the norm. Sadly, they are not quite successful. “Sway” is geared toward reaching the general reading audience in a pop psychology way but goes too far in that direction over-simplifying the topic. Instead of focusing on the psychology, biology, neurology, or similar fields; Brafman and Brafman instead offer chapter after chapter of case study after case study. Don’t get me wrong: the text is accessible, exciting, and well-written but the scientific element in lost in the mix.Elaborating on this, the topics at hand are barely even mentioned when discussing a case study; with Brafman and Brafman then adding a line which basically says, “This was done because of so-and-so behavior” but failing to execute any back-up, proof, or experimentation. At least though, the text sounds professional in the sense that it isn’t simply opinionated.A strong suit of “Sway” is that although there are co-authors; the writing is smooth and cohesive with one communal voice versus the disjointed narrative some books take when having multiple authors. “Sway” is an easy and light read. Approximately half-way through, Brafman and Brafman finally begin to adhere more to scientific data and unique experimental results which turns “Sway” into a more compelling work. Much of the information is common sense and still just an introduction on the topic but it encourages further reading and exploration on the subject. It should also be noted that some of the experiments mentioned in “Sway” have been cited in other books on similar topics and none are primary, conducted by Brafman and Brafman.The concluding chapters are the strongest in “Sway” as a whole with insightful information and a steady pace while the Epilogue provides a summary of what has been learned. Followed by a brief notes section; Brafman and Brafman do try to cover their bases.Although “Sway” is not what I expected (which is a more heavy-hitting psych work); the text is an entertaining and readable introduction to the topic which sets the foundation for further research. “Sway” is a fast one-day read and is thus recommended for a brief but somewhat scientific foray into the psychological world of irrational behavior. However, if desiring a deep and multi-faceted scientific look; then this is not for you. "
5,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2190636-joselito-honestly-and-brilliantly,3,"Books are basically meant to be read (although some buy them for display purposes only). So you buy books because you intend to read them. But why buy more books if you already have so many books in your to-be-read pile that you can’t possibly finish reading them even if you live 150 years? IT is pointless, a waste of money and silly. Yet you keep on doing it. This book analyzes irrational behaviours like this.It starts with a real life story, a tragic one. KLM Flight 4805 was piloted by Captain Jacob Van Zanten, the head of KLM’s safety program and known for his attention to detail, methodical approach and spotless record in flying. His flight was en route from Amsterdam to the Las Palmas Airport in the Canary Islands but was diverted to the island of Tenerife because of a bomb explosion at the Las Palmas Airport. Parked at the Tenerife airport, the airport authorities had told him to unload his passengers because it may take a long while before the plane could be given a takeoff clearance. Van Zanten must have known what this means: passengers which need to be given accommodations, late arrivals to their destinations, more cancelled flights, etc. There was also the matter of his mandated rest period (time when a pilot needs to rest, with a heavy penalty if he does not) and his reputation as a pilot who always brings his passengers to their destinations on time. So this pilot, a paragon of flight safety and prudence, flew the plane in the fog, hit a parked Pan Am and killed all 584 people in his plane, including himself. So why did he act so irrationally? Would you buy 1,000 pesos for 1,100 pesos? You’d immediately think: “Why would anyone do that? Plain commonsense tells you that you’d incur a loss of 100 pesos if you buy 1,000 pesos for 1,100 pesos. So no, I definitely would not do that.” But there was a popular experiment, discussed in this book (though I tweaked it a little bit) where people would do such a purchase at a loss. A 1,000 peso bill is put on auction. The starting bid is 50 pesos, and successive bids can only go 50 pesos at a time. To the highest bidder goes the 1,000 pesos. But the second highest bidder will also pay the price of his bid and get nothing. So the first bidder places the initial 50 peso bid. If no one bids higher than that, he pays 50 and get 1,000. But someone bids 100. If no one bids higher, the 100-peso bidder pays 100 and gets the 1,000 AND the 50-peso bidder will have to pay 50 pesos and gets nothing (being the second highest bidder). The latter, of course, does not want to lose 50 pesos for nothing, so he places a bid of 150. This goes on and on until the highest bid goes 1,000. A no-gain-no-loss bid. However, the second highest bidder of 950 resents losing 950 for nothing. He reasons out: better to bid 1,050 pesos and lose 50, than not bid anymore and lose 950. So he bids 1,050. However, the other guy who had bid 1,000 reasons the same way: better to lose 100 by bidding 1100 than lose 1000 by not bidding anymore. So he bids 1100 for 1000 pesos. All these examples demonstrates how people can be pushed into irrational behaviour because OF THE FEAR OF LOSS (just one of the many factors the book discusses which influence men to do irrational things). I still buy more books, especially they are at a bargain, because I FEAR I may never be able to find that book again, or even if I find it again, not in such a bargain anymore. Van Zanten feared the loss of his spotless record of punctuality and of satisfying his passengers. The bidder fear the loss if he remains the second highest bidder. "
6,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/802791-ross,2,"Think of the the Brafman brothers as a poor man's Malcolm Galdwell. A very, very poor man. ""Sway"" covers interesting and important ground, but dumbs it down way too much.This might be the right call when presenting this material to a half-day corporate retreat. But it makes for a maddening read. Instead of building up their case based on evidence and support, the authors simply assert their conclusions (or the conclusions of the researchers on which they rely? It's never made clear). Instead of showing us something surprising, they simply append that descriptor before every other assertion. They don't discuss or share the actual data (so that you might draw your own conclusion, or verify theirs); potential confounding factors are waived away or (even worse) left unaddressed; the statistical significance of various ""findings"" also goes unremarked. I could go on.One of the authors claims to have studied ""magical moments"" but you would never know it because this book manages to generate none."
7,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/766512-brian,3,"Quick read - 181 pages. I banged it out over two days. Sway is a social economic book from the same vein as Freakonomics and The Tipping Point. The authors descibe psychological forces that can ""sway"" people into irrational decision making. Several well stated examples are given to support the authors theories throughout.Overall, Sway is entertaining. It falls short on meaningful substance, and some areas are fluff laden. However, there are several interesting points illustrated through engaging stories. The authors fall short describing tactics to counteract the psychological forces they write about in the book. They basically give you a phenomenon, support the phenomenon with insightful case studies, and then essentially say ""you probably should not let that happen to you."" "
8,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,5,"In my working life, I have observed first-hand smart, capable executives making poor business decisions. Although the common thinking is that business decisions are based on logic, such as cost-benefit analysis and business cases, in my experience, the optimal solution is not always selected. This cogent, enlightening book provides explanations of the variety of influences that may have contributed to these questionable decisions. At the beginning of each chapter, the author provides an example of an irrational decision, such as a pilot taking off in fog without clearance, and proceeds to explore the factors that may have contributed to the resulting catastrophe. The author “peels the onion,” delving into the complexities, citing numerous studies and examples in an easily understood manner. This method spurred my curiosity, and resulted in devouring the book in one sitting. I found it both entertaining and educational. Recommended to those who enjoy learning about human behavior and psychology, and highly recommended to management consultants to help their clients avoid biases in decision-making. "
9,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan,4,"This book is very readable and entertaining, and so engaging that I just kept reading and didn’t read the notes until after I’d finished the book, which is unusual for me. It’s fascinating knowlege for anyone who has an interest in universal human nature and/or group dynamics.The authors take a bunch of existing studies and do a tremendous job of presenting a cogent thesis about why human beings can exhibit such irrational behaviors. I was familiar with many of the studies cited in the book; I was even a participant in a friend's version of the “different lengths of lines” study described. I recommend this book to everyone, because it shows that even if we believe we’re logical and independent thinkers and reasonable in our decision making, and assume that we possess impeccable common sense, that there are factors at work that often make our assumptions not so. You may be surprised by the findings presented here re loss aversion, pull of commitment, value attribution, diagnostic bias, etc. Even if these concepts are not new to you, the way the information is presented here will make you think. Now that I’ve read this book, I’m confident that remembering the material presented will help me think before I act. I do think of myself as someone who thinks and makes decisions in a logical manner, although even though before I read this, I was very aware of my own aversion to loss, and also my tendency to be influenced by value attribution; the latter is something I’ve actually tried to work on with some success.I’d like to see this book assigned as an adjunct text for many psychology, sociology, economics, business, and education classes. I also hope that it’s read by every person who is in a position of power, especially our elected officials and those such as airplane pilots and others in similarly responsible jobs. Also finding it helpful would be those who work with others, including HR people (although preferably not those who will interview me for jobs since historically I do “very well” in job interviews, even though I’ve always thought they’ve had limitations.)My favorite portions of the book were the part that described the brain centers of altruism vs. pleasure, because that research was brand new information for me, and also the part where Stephen Breyer describes his process doing his work as a Supreme Court Justice, just because I found his explanation so fascinating. I also was extremely entertained by the $20 bill story, and I assume that all readers will find this story enjoyable, unless they were ever one of the final two participants in this or a similar activity.I appreciate that, while this is not a self-help book, reading the book isn’t an exercise in futility; having this information actually gives the readers tools to empower themselves.The formatting of the chapter headings is very clever too, as it ties into the sway/pull theme of the book."
10,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,4,"This book covers roughly the same behavioral economics territory considered in such recent books as Dan Ariely's ""Predictably Irrational"" (http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/....) and ""Nudge"" by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein (http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/....) It had been stalking me on my Amazon recommendations queue for at least a year, but I had resisted it successfully until this weekend, when I came across it in the bookstore and finally succumbed. I'm glad I did. I wasn't expecting to learn anything new, necessarily, but neither was I expecting a book as funny and engaging as this turned out to be. The Brafman brothers are whip smart, enthusiastic guides on this brilliant overview of recent research in behavioral science. As far as I can tell, throughout the book they are engaged in summarizing results of other people’s investigations (unlike Ariely or Sunstein & Cass, who are often reporting on their own, or colleagues’, work). They do it very well – clearly, succinctly, and with great examples. The book doesn’t discuss ways to trigger more honest behavior, as Ariely did in “Predictably Irrational”, neither does it contain the kind of discussion of implications for sensible public policy that was such a strength of “Nudge”. It does, however, provide a very lucid discussion of pitfalls to avoid in group decision-making.My favorite story in the book has to be that of the French “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire” audience who were apparently so disgusted by the contestant’s inability to answer the question “What revolves around the earth?” that they figured he deserved to be booted, so that 56% gave the answer “the sun”. It worked. Hapless Henri took the bait and was kicked off. (Russian audiences are apparently the worst on WWTBAM; regularly providing the wrong answer when polled. There is speculation that this stems from a broadly held Russian view that anyone trying to get ahead by amassing great personal wealth is, by definition, behaving anti-socially, and thus deserves to be cut down to size (the tall poppy syndrome at work)).An interesting and well-executed book."
11,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50647721-soheil,3,"There are two major flaws with Sway. One is that it does not tread any new ground. Most of what is conveyed has already been covered in other books. The other is the fact that the book has become more a collection of research citations than a solid idea structured book. I found the lack of summarizing sections at the end of each chapter annoying as well though that was somehow made up for by the Epilogue chapter.If you are a new comer in the field of behavioral sciences, Sway may have much to offer. But if your are looking for something groundbreaking you should look elsewhere."
12,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3730290-tjwphd,2,"This is extremely casual, and I would instead recommend ""Nudge"" instead for a better look at behavioral economics."
13,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44736633-james,3,"I was torn between 2 and 3 stars for this book. It is entertaining at times, which is why I opted for the third star, but it’s really just a very lightweight entry into the pop psychology genre. The writing is too cutesy for my tastes, while the conclusions drawn are ambiguous and, most of the time, could be supportive of the exact opposite point the authors intended. Since I listened to the audio version, I don’t know what sort of supporting detail the authors provided for their conclusions, but none of it was mentioned beyond such banalities as “a study was conducted by XYZ” or other anecdotal references.If you’re looking for a well-researched work on decision making, I’d suggest something by Robert Cialdini (although it will likely be very dry) or Daniel Kahneman (I’ve not read any of his non-academic publications but I understand THINKING, FAST AND SLOW is very readable)."
14,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36843999-k-s-corner,4,"Thoroughly enjoyed this short and powerful read. It is about various forces that drive our decision making, forces that too often sway us in the wrong direction without us even realizing that they are happening. It gives you some new perspective and awareness of what those 'sways' are, why they influence behaviors of those around us and our own selves and finally what you could potentially do to not be victimized by them. Very interesting!"

Still there were some interesting psychological experiments with some unexpected results, and overall it was a well-documented book and well-structured, covering most of what I expected. Nothing special anyway"
16,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47076655-ayush-shrestha,5,"Sway by, Rom Brafman and Ori Brafman, goes on to outstand us avid readers of psychology, by exposing why you bought those expensive pair of headphones when there were the exact same being sold for a lesser price. Why you got turned down your last job interview, and why we feel dumb when we’re called dumb. Sway utilizes the most interesting of experiments to uncover why we do, what we do, even if our choice was completely illogical. Placing doctors near a hotdog stand, a man boosted his sales through the roof, and through this experiment we are introduced to one of the most guileful thought processes of the human mind. I truly appreciate how, Sway, easily guides you down the path of exploring and explaining cognitive biases, human motivation, and plain foolishness while maintaining a eloquent yet understandable diction.	I recommend, Sway, to readers that read for the sake of education and understanding human nature, whilst also having some comedy incorporated into their learning. This comedy is not directly forced on to the reader rather than uncovered by the reader him/herself. By explaining the idiotic choices we humans make on a daily basis, we cannot help but to feel a little embarrassed, and this is where the comedy stems from. 	I first came across Sway when browsing on Google Chrome searching for an interesting read that would fit my tastes. The alluring reviews, proclaiming Sway to be one of the best psychological expeditions possible, were truly beguiling. This charm induced though multiple positive reviews is soon revealed in Sway, to be the cognitive bias known as “Value Attribution.” From the moment I had checked out this book I knew that I had been swayed."
17,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2949697-thewestchestarian,4,"I didn’t check the NYT Bestseller list but I would assume that Sway must be doing well. It is brief enough to read over a weekend and there is just enough psychology that you can repeat and sound like you know what you are talking. It is sort of a little tree that grew in the ground broken by Freakonomics.The book starts with a story of the mature, highly experienced, and well-trained head of safety at KLM airlines impulsively taking off without clearance, plowing into another plane and killing some 587 people. Why? The Brafmans chalk it up to the same reasons people will race to be on time for a meeting through heavy snow – loss aversion. They posit that people are hard-wired to make widely irrational choices to avoid perceived loss. They relate the story of a man who sold his biotech firm then stubbornly rode the stock from $47 to less than one dollar because he didn’t want to take the perceived loss at any point in the decline. Loss aversion is also proposed as the reason for a human tendency toward unreasonable commitment and here the Brafmans review the well-trodden retelling of the escalation of the Vietnam War. They relate a very interesting study on National Basketball players which does tend to support an unconscious commitment effect. The study found that regardless of performance, players chosen higher in the draft play more minutes, get traded less often and have a longer career. In other words, the commitment made in the draft directly affected the commitment made by coaches for as much as five years out despite the actual player performance. On a more hopeful note they relate a story on the success of Gordon Moore who was able to overcome the commitment bias by abandoning Intel’s dying but still profitable memory chip business to become the leader in microprocessors.The second sway is the misleading effects of context. The Brafmans relate a story about a virtuoso violinist who was ignored in the DC subway as supposedly demonstrating how context irrationally affects perceived value; frankly, I think it is just an indicator of classical music’s popularity. There is a also a story about the acceptance in the archeology community of a fraudulent missing link skeleton called Piltdown man contrasted with the denial of real find of a missing link skeleton in Java. Again, the story doesn’t convincingly suggest that there is an irrational impulse at work but rather regular, old, politics. In this chapter there is also a discussion of job interviews and how they lack any predictive power which probably won’t come as much of surprise and again not sure this fact really indicates an irrational motivation at play. Later the Brafmans take on psychiatry (maybe their Scientologists?) as an example of the sway of false authority. They relate an incredible rise of the diagnosis of bipolar disorder from its initial formalization based on little more than one doctor’s theorizing through direct popularization by drug companies. Children as young as two and dogs now can be diagnosed as bipolar. This same arc probably could be applied to Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and more recently autism. The book also reports on meta-analyses of psychiatric care outcomes and finds that the type of treatment or diagnosis has little to do with treatment success. Instead the idiosyncratic skill of the psychiatrist seems to be the only active ingredient.The sway of cultural norms is discussed using the example of the show Who Wants to be a Millionaire. In the U.S., using the audience lifeline will get you the correct answer better than 90% of the time, in France, the audience is about 50/50 on helping you out and in Russia, fully 90% of the audience will deliberately try to deceive you. There is also cross-cultural research on sharing norms showing that in the U.S., people will walk away from anything less than a 50/50 split of money in an experiment where one person gets to decide the distribution and the other has to live with the decision. When the study was tried with a tribe with no contact to the West, the distributor would keep better than 85% on average and the receiver would accept whatever they were given which is actually the rationale thing to do.The final chapters look at the sway of group thinking. The book relates a famous experiment which demonstrates that people will go along with obvious wrong answers in a line length comparison test rather than contradicting other members of the group (who were actually researcher confederates). This effect is applied to the Supreme Court where we learn that it takes a substantial amount of disagreement for a dissenting judge to write a dissenting opinion. The Brafman’s book is lean, tells some interesting stories and keeps the words and ideas snappy. They introduce their chapters with a neat trick, they give little snippets of text from the chapter such as ”51 women waiting by the phone” or “only the Gators walk away”. It is a very good ”sway” as they use the term."

Knowing the consequences of staying would be too costly, yet, I still hanged on, hoping an unfaithful person would change their behavior. ""To withdraw now is to accept a sure loss, and that option is deeply unattractive. When you combine this with the force of commitment, the option of hanging on will therefore be relatively attractive even if the chances of success are small, and the cost of delaying failure is high. Aversion to loss on its own is strong, but when it converges with commitment, the force becomes an even more powerful influence, and shapes our thinking and decision making.""I didn't want to accept a sure loss then, so the consequences grew and grew. This book doesn't justify my stupidity, but it helps me understand why I acted the way I did. "

In that way, it was a success.In most others, not so much. For a book published in 2008, it depends an awful lot on studies and publications from the mid-90s. The cited sources may have used adequate numbers and documentation, but this book certainly did not. ""Some"" as a quantifier was way, way overused.This book depended far too much on gimmicks like the chapter opening pages and other fluff, and not enough on actual DATA.Much of the information in this book (including some of the specific studies/incidents cited) can easily be found online."

Not only is it packed full of illuminating information, but it also contains lots of stories, which makes it very readable. I'd go so far as to say that the world would be a lot better off if everyone absorbed the lessons in this book, which should only take a couple days to breeze through."

26,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1180557-christal-badass-book-reviews,2,"Sway: The Irresistible Pull of Irrational Behavior by Ori and Ram Brofman is a very broad overview of several sociological attributes that may affect behavior, causing people to react and behave in unexpected ways. The Brofmans provide a multitude of anecdotal evidence to explain these topics and to demonstrate how they might be observed in everyday life. While this book isn’t very effective at explaining how to combat irrational behavior, it does succeed in introducing the common attributes in an engaging way that might lead the reader to further research or study of these issues.Initially, Sway focuses on three main processes that can trigger irrational behavior: loss aversion, commitment, and value attribution. Loss aversion relates to our tendency to persevere in situations to avoid additional loss, even if it might have made more sense to remove ourselves much sooner and suffer a minimal loss. For example, a dwindling stock should be sold right away for a small amount of loss, but people tend to hold on to the stock longer in case it possibly increases in value again. Commitment refers to our tendency to stick with a behavior or idea, even if something else might make more sense, just because we have committed to that path of action. You might see people in the workplace that have committed themselves to doing a task a particular way and refuse to change their process, even if it might take less time and effort. Value attribution relates to how valuable we perceive an item or service. For example, people tend to see designer bags and clothes as more valuable because they cost more than everyday clothing. Why wouldn’t you charge more if it is a better product? Value aversion can be used to blindside the public to an item’s true quality because we are conditioned to assumed high priced items equal higher quality and therefore, a higher value.Sway soon transitions into more sociologically-focused attributes such as the diagnosis bias, altruism vs. self-interest, and fairness. Each of these attributes focuses on ideas and qualities that have become recognized in our society and how they are used to influence our behavior. For instance, labeling is very prevalent in our society. We label people by their defining characteristics and can’t seem to see them in any other way. The Brofmans used the NBA draft picks to illustrate this example; players picked as early draft picks almost always received more playing time than players picked later in the draft, even if their other player statistics were equal or worse. The coaches label the early draft picks as better players and continue to treat them as such even if their quantifiable statistics do not support it. In situations where we have a choice between altruism and self-interest, most people will act in a way that supports their self-interest. This is the basic idea behind why we do not work for free. One very good takeaway from this principal is that you should reward after a positive action or behavior has been completed, not before. Once you create the expectation of reward, people stop working for good work’s sake and instead begin working for the reward only. If you then take the reward away, the positive behavior will cease. Fairness is a fairly simple idea; people want to feel they are being treated properly and that their opinions and ideas are being valued. People want to be listened to and heard, even if nothing changes.Group behavior is also touched on in the second half of Sway and is especially successful in covering the importance of group dissention. Our natural tendency to go with the group can be destructive overall. If someone has a valid point, or even an invalid point that might lead to questioning other more constructive issues, their reluctance to speak against the popular opinion hurts the group as a whole. The authors present research that shows even one other dissenter can cause bolster others in the group into offering their true feelings. These people no longer feel like they are standing alone and, even if their opinion differs from the dissenter, are more likely to provide their actual input to the group. Dissenters are important in group discussions because they open other avenues to communication and allow everyone to express their views. The book closes with a short epilogue that is intended to provide advice for counteracting the discussed irrational behaviors; this is where the book tends to fall short. The strategies presented are too simplistic to be truly effective and the short page count did not allow the authors to go into any specific depth. Along these same lines, the stories that the authors chose to demonstrate their topics, while entertaining, were sometimes suspect. They have been presented in such an abbreviated form that it becomes difficult to see how the authors drew causation conclusions instead of correlation. Presenting more statistically-proven studies and fewer colloquial examples would strengthen the authors’ research and lend more creditability to their conclusions.Sway succeeds as an introduction to irrational behavior and hopefully the reader will be better able to recognize these behaviors in their everyday lives. Unfortunately, it does the reader a disservice by not discussing potential problem solving strategies in more depth. That said, it is a quick read with a light narrative style that readers with little to no background in sociology/psychology should find engaging. This book would be perfect for the reader looking to begin learning about behavior patterns and societal impacts, with an eye toward more intensive study in the future."

The views on mental illness have not held up well, and the casual sexism? Even in 2008, I’m sure that was not okay."

31,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37755694-greta-samuelson,4,This one really made me think. I read it years ago and still think about some of the lessons it taught me
32,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2212839-yeribel,3,"Quotes/Notes:Aversion to loss: It doesn’t matter how wrong the decision is, as long as you believe that things will turn out well in the end you will do everything possible to keep in the path. Fighting is better than accepting defeat.Daniel Kahneman: “To withdraw now is to accept a sure loss,” he writes about digging oneself deeper into a political hole, “and that option is deeply unattractive.” When you combine this with the force of commitment, “the option of hanging on will therefore be relatively attractive, even if the chances of success are small and the cost of delaying failure is high.” Pg. 38Pg. 70: “But here’s where value attribution meets up with a sway called the diagnosis bias—our propensity to label people, ideas or things based on our initial opinions of them—and our inability to reconsider those judgments once we’ve made them.” Example being used here is of athletes being affected by their draft order.Pg. 75: “The baggage that comes with labeling is the notion of the blinders, really. It prevents you from seeing what’s clearly before your face; all you’re seeing now is the label.” Pg. 100: On talking about bipolar disorder, anxiety or depression diagnosis:“When we are labeled, explained psychologist Franz Epting, it’s easy to start acting it out as a way of being in the world.” We fit into the mold created by the diagnosis. “And then it becomes quite a tangle between what’s really going on with us versus what we have been labeled with.”“In other words, this molding process becomes self-perpetuating: when we take on characteristics assigned to us, the diagnosis is reinforced and reaffirmed.” … “And this is the third trap of diagnosis: when we brand or label people, they take on the characteristics of the diagnosis. In psychological circles, this mirroring of expectations is known as the Pygmalion effect (describing how we take on positive traits assigned to us by someone else) and the Golem effect (describing how we take on negative traits). Pgs 154-155 Group dynamics: When a group of people are trying to make a decision, it’s very likely that someone who is against the final decision will be swayed into what the rest of the group wants. However, having a dissenting voice in the group – even if it’s a wrong one – can help bring some type of balance to the final decision.Pg. 160: [Blockers:] play a vital role in maintaining balance in a group. A blocker functions as the brakes that prevent the group from going down a potentially disastrous path. Even if the blocker’s opinion is wrong, at least it adds a perspective to the debate—giving others an opportunity to look at things in a different light.Diagnosis bias: “the moment we label a person or a situation, we put on blinders to all evidence that contradicts our diagnosis.” Pg. 7Procedural justice: “when it comes to fairness, it’s the process, not the outcome, that causes us to react rationally.” Pg. 118Examples are given of two people having to share $10. One of them has to decide how they will split the money. Most people decide half. The interesting thing happens when people decide to take more for themselves and give less to the other person. The other people were very likely to choose nothing over less than half. It wasn’t about the money, but about the lack of fairness in the other person. Pg. 142-143“It’s as if we have two “engines” running in our brains that can’t operate simultaneously. We can approach a task either altruistically or from a self-interested perspective. The two different engines run on different fuels and also need different amounts of those fuels to fire up. It doesn’t take much to fuel the altruism center: all you need is the sense that you’re helping someone or making a positive impact. But the pleasure center seems to need a lot more—2.5 cents per right answer or a 5,000-franc stipend for agreeing to tolerate a nuclear dump site just isn’t enough.This intersection of economics, biology, and psychology regularly plays out in our everyday lives: if you have a friend that needs help moving and asks you for the favor, chances are, you’ll say yes. However, if your friend offers $10 to do it, then that’s not enough for your trouble and you are more likely to say no. Pg. 148: “The problem isn’t with rewards per se. It’s only when you dangle the possibility of a reward ahead of time—creating a quid pro quo situation—that these destructive effects arise. An extensive review and analysis of motivation studies found that the prospect of a reward excites the pleasure center even more than the attainment of the reward itself. Taking a kid to Disneyland because she won the science fair is one thing, but telling her ahead of time, “if you enter the fair and win it, I’ll take you to Disneyland,” is another. It’s the anticipation factor that drives the addictive behavior and suppresses the altruism center.”"

Predictably Irrational
 from earlier this year, Ori and Rom Brafman's Sway: The Irresistible Pull of Irrational Behavior seeks to educate us on quirks of the human mind that lead us to engage in decidedly irrational behavior. And it covers a lot of the same topics: confirmation bias, first impressions, loss aversion, diagnostic bias, sunk costs, and more. Along the way they use these kinks in human nature to answer a variety of questions. What causes college football coaches to doggedly stick to losing strategies? What caused a jet pilot to risk his life and the lives of his passengers just to save a little time? How does the U.S. Supreme Court manage its own group dynamics to ensure that dissenting opinions are heard? Why would someone pay $200 for a $20 bill? Why would a studio audience deliberately sabotage a contestant seeking a ""lifeline"" in the TV game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Why would a dot com millionaire to sit and watch all his newfound wealth slowly trickle away when he could stop it any time he wanted? Why would subway commuters ignore a free concert by a world-class musician playing on a priceless Stradivarius violin? Read this book and you'll not only find out, but you'll start to see where you're guilty of similar crimes of irrationality in your own life.Ultimately, though, I didn't like Sway as much as Predictably Irrational because the authors seemed intent on keeping the language and the approach too mainstream. Instead of relying on descriptions of scientific studies that prove their points, the authors rely more on stories and case studies to make most of their points. This is fine and they're good enough storytellers to keep your attention, but being trained in psychology and the associated research methods myself, I kind of a geek for descriptions of study designs, hypotheses, and the like.But maybe that's just me and Sway is the more accessible book for most people. The voice that the brothers Brafman use manages to strike the right balance between educational and breezy. They're often cheeky, too --you gotta respect any authors who, after listing blurbs and quotes by experts in praise of them on the back cover of the book, tell you that if you buy the book because of these quotes you're being completely irrational. (But, they say, you should totally still buy the book.)"
34,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46497366-isabella-victoria,4,"The story of sway is based on an airplane captain named Van Zanten who makes an irrational decision which ultimately kills himself and the people on his plane. The book then goes on to talk about the world of irrational thinking and what ""sways"" us to make these seemingly preposterous decisions. What I like about this book is that it just doesn't focus on one set particular culture, it can go from France to Russia and its good to get knowledge on different cultures because as we all know no two people think alike, so we can see what's outside of our culture and understand different individuals and all types of culture better. It also gives plentiful examples on each sway it gives in the book, so we get an array of knowledge from people with different educational backgrounds and get the most insight out of each topic.I liked the book overall because it was a good insight and perspective on the world around us. It makes us realize a lot of material that we might not have taken into account and notice. I also liked the concept of the book on how they took into account one scenario which was about this captain named Van Zanten and expanded on what may have been probable to going on in his mind and brought in various examples from plentiful and credible sources. The last thing I liked about the book was that it broadened my horizon's you can say on what goes on biologically within us when faced with many scenarios and decisions. The only thing I hated about the book was that it expanded on a topic that I got the jist of after just a couple pages. I learned a good amount of biological terms such as area 10,nucleus accumbens, and posterior superior temporal. This has expanded my vocabulary and make me more likely to engage in intellectual conversations. I would recommend due to the fact that it gives you an insight of what's in our biology and makes you aware of your different surroundings. "
35,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46549395-nikita-morrison,3,"the fact that this book is created by brothers you can tell that they work together and they've seen different things and they collaborate together to sum up this entire book which overall does depict humans in our society perfectly well. this is an excellent book for those who want to change their work ethics. especially for group work because you kind of understand where everyone comes from a little bit. the two brothers in my opinion were able to successfully kind of write similarly in behavioral science just like Dan Ariely's. Also all three were able to show their opinion and back it up with information they thought necessary. in this book they both were able to classify the different types of errors that we do as human beings such as diagnosis bias. a way for them to support this bias was that they basically explain that people in their everyday lives relate to this bias and it is relevant and the two brothers explain why it is relevant to this book. The book does come with a conclusion to an answer somewhat. one of my favorite examples they used in the book was when they talked about Barry and ha about the NBA Draft and players: in the inside of the team and the heads of the basketball team. some of the examples were also little bit ridiculous, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. I would only give this book a maybe 2.3 but that's about it. it lacked a lot of humor but it was still humorous to the point where I understood it and it wasn't too boring but at certain parts it was boring and I kind of just read through the book not really understanding certain parts of it but it was fine because I ended up reading online to understand a little bit and other people's opinion who have read the book. if I had to recommend it I'd say it's okay but not out of the blue type of recommendation."
36,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46514206-anderson-diaz,3,"Sway is an enjoyable piece of literature with quite a bit of interesting information. What I enjoyed about the book was that it provided many examples, and stories to relate the information it was trying to convey to the reader. I managed to learn quite a bit about dealing with irrationality and what even causes it in the first place. A topic I would never even imagine caring much about before reading this book. While it was enjoyable to read all those stories having to do with the research and application of understanding as well as dealing with irrationality sometimes it did feel as if it was just a list of case studies after case studies. What this book lacked for me was the ability to suck me in entirely. I would've definitely enjoyed if the writing style of the book had been a bit more interactive. While many of the stories were interesting some just didn't peak my interest and didn't draw me in enough for me to actually care remembering what they meant for the subject at hand. I simply found myself scanning over the text when it came to stories like that. The information I gathered from this book was still very useful. As I am full of irrational decisions everyday, I gained a better understanding as to why I make the choices that I do on a daily basis. This isn't only interesting but it can definitely help me regulate the amount of bad irrational decisions and behaviors I have in my life. In the end Sway is definitely not among my top favorite books, but do to its amount of interesting information and fun stories I would In fact recommend the book to a friend or anybody looking to try something new. "
37,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1361231-jonathan,4,"Very entertaining. It feels like the authors have just kind of thrown a lot of material together, but the material is fascinating. Roughly speaking, the book is about how people's behavior and decisions are driven by psychological factors they aren't aware of. Just to give an example, there was a study dealing with the impact of first impressions in which a class of college students were told they would have a substitute instructor for that day's lecture. Bios of the lecturer were handed out, and secretly there were two versions. One version referred to him as being considered ""very warm,"" the other ""rather cold."" At the end of the class, the students completed a questionnaire about the lecturer, and, what do you know, members of the first group tended to find him to be ""good natured, considerate of others, informal, sociable, popular, humorous, and humane,"" while members of the second group tended to find him ""self-centered, formal, unsociable, unpopular, irritable, humorless, and ruthless."" Scary stuff."
38,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7198893-jonathan-karmel,3,"This book describes a number of different ways that human psychology causes people to act illogically. Concepts such as value attribution, diagnosis bias and the Pygmalion effect are illustrated in a very entertaining way.If you're interested in the topic, Wikipedia has a good list of cognitive biases here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitiv...I thought it was interesting that on ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" in the US, the audience always tries to help the contestant. But according to this book, in other countries, if the audience doesn't like the contestant, they purposely give him the wrong answer. Some guy in France was asked what revolves around the Earth, and the majority of the audience voted it was the sun, not the moon, so that the contestant got it wrong. They wanted him to lose because they thought he was an idiot who didn't deserve to win. This story is used to illustrate the concept that our decisions are influenced by our sense of fairness. Sometimes we act according to our sense of fairness even if that is not in our rational (material) self-interest."
39,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7381871-allyson,4,"It seems that I'm on a kick with books that explore how we think and why we do the things we do. This reminded me of Malcolm Gladwell but honestly wasn't quite as good as his books. MG is a much better writer and storyteller. Still, I enjoyed this book. It explored and explained several ""sways"" that undermine our ability to make rational, intelligent decisions every day and also at crucial moments such as when we might or might not avoid danger. Though I love to read books like this, I always end up a little depressed. After all, if our minds are full of such traps and we are so easily manipulated and, well, swayed, then what chance have we at ever living better lives or creating a better world and society? The authors suggest that being aware of we are swayed can help us to counteract these mental weaknesses, and in the end they do offer some solutions. I wish they would have spent a little more time on that rather than including the ideas almost as an afterthought. Still, overall, a quick and easy and enlightening read. "

It is mostly a long collection of stories.Another downside for readers across this flat world: the book is for USA readers. For example the book assumes you are familiar with details of how NBA players are chosen by teams. It also abuses of acronyms, sometimes explained but not others. For example you are left alone to recognize what/who is LBJ. Wait I give you the context where LBJ is introduced to the reader: ""If 1950s politics was like an episode of Survivor, LBJ was surely the hands-down winner."" Clear now ? :-) LBJ = USA president Lyndon B. Johnson. Of course! "

The most helpful advice is geared towards the end of the Book, and gives an example is IBM. The CEO's asked themselves, why the company was failing, and if new CEO's were hired to save the company, what would they do considering that they would approach the decision, bases upon saving the company rather an emotional or historical view of someone that was present at the start of the company. After this the CEO's, killed the entire direction and purpose of IBM and reinvented the company into the Billion Dollar empire that it is today. The logic is that sometimes you have to let things die, or go even further and ""shoot it in the head"", taking the necessary steps to make a conscious decision to move forward from the past."

I am more than sure that some people will criticize it for being too much about the same themes over and over again. If you are looking for that sort of read, you should probably view the textbook section. This is more of an enjoyable leisure book filled with plenty of great statistics and quick reviews of recent work in psychology. The ideas are simple, and while not necessarily new, are important and profound. The examples are abundant without being boring. The entire piece is informative without being dull. Plus, it's short. While some of Gladwells and Levitt may have more remarkable pieces, this should tide lovers of this genre over for a bit."

The most interesting (NBA draft) were given lip service while the boring ones (""the missing link"") were beaten to death.

I'm sure I can find other books on these topics that would beat the subject to death but this book was delightful because of it's brevity.

It takes a cool, rational mind to walk away from a project, deal, etc. when everyone around you is urging the opposite. Knowing your own tendencies is the first step. Well, reading the book is the first step to understand the landscape of decision-making pitfall - and then avoid them. Would have liked to see more attention given to strategies for avoid poor behaviors. "

The book provides some very interesting stories to show you how everyone is prone to making irrational decisions -- even one of the world's most skilled aircraft captains.The writing is good and engaging. Recommended for anyone who wants a brief read on human behaviour without getting too deep into the scientific details."

Manipulations happen more often than we might believe.Chapter 5Reminders about The Chameleon Effect: “We fit into the mold created by the diagnosis. Once we are labeled, it’s easy to fall into the mold.”Franz Epstein said this I believe, or something similar, “Once we are diagnosed, everything; every symptom falls into that diagnosis.”But some new perspectives on misdiagnosis. For instance, if it’s true that rates of Bipolar had increased 4-fold for those 19 and under during the mid-late 1990s than suicides should have risen dramatically. However, according to authors’ claims and statistics and within that same time period, teen suicides actually went down by 23%.Simply more doctors diagnosing youth didn’t NOT actually reflect what was happening with those patients. As brothers Ori and Rom Brafman assert, “The more attention to the illness, the more therapists and clinicians assigned,” claiming or validating MISdiagnosis. It’s practically the Mob Mentality predicated by bottom-line profit margins or marketability of new-and-improved, socially accepted Disease of the Decade!But wait, there’s more!If you buy NOW!, we’ll throw in millions worth of prescriptions, perhaps leading to life-long dependencies guaranteeing greater revenues for decades.Socially, we’re providing easy OUTS, one-size-fits-everybody!!! That’s right, no matter what age, what offense, no matter the body count or the emotional wreckage, we have a socially acceptable LABEL, compete with application instructions that will forever be your excuse; your Get-Out-of-Jail Card, so to speak.Think studying is too difficult, need a break from stressful situations (daily life), we got your cure....errr...solution. The Final Solution?Not exactly, but one that will keep you indebted to us for decades!If you want to learn a little more about these and other irrationalities, or how we’re manipulated through deepest desires into motivations that often fail epically in their designed desired outcomes, we must learn how to re-engineer those methods of motivating.Anticipation FactorFor instance in Chapter 7, which analyzed how Pleasure Centers tend to Hijack Altruistic Centers, nothing new, there, but The Brafman Men chronicle teachers’ salaries bonuses or retention for subsequent years on improving attendance of wayward students, backfiring miserably as professors and other scoff a small rewards for hard work, sacrifices or other unhappy experience.However, while many Professors switched emphasis on $$ by incentivizing absentee students with more field trips, dumbing down curriculum and fluff-filling to get students to return, they actually1. Disservice those already paying hard-earned money for a proper education 2. React irrationally to the wrong motivation 3. Hurt their overall sustainability 4. Remove possible “Value Added”, which most true educators strive towards5. Show future students the wrong message about self-advocacy - empower them with their voice mixed with rational compromises or adequate middle roads/common grounds Again this echoes of John Assaraf’s “Innercise” book about having the idea to go biking today at 16:30, and how that thought alone releases many endorphins of the expected thrill of the endorphins from actually doing the activity will have. So by incentivizing someone by saying, “If you enter and win the contest, you will get this trip to Disneyland,” that automatically releases (nucleus accumbens) joy center or pleasure center’s endorphins before the person actually wins anything. So these professors, incentivized by a monetary bonus and told that upfront, changed the way they taught, or the emphasis on attendance and attacking absentee students as opposed to changing the curriculum to incentivize the opportunity for students to return to class seeking more applicable materials or methodologies. Perhaps if they had given those missing kids (AND those religiously attending) done a survey to find out what they needed or expected from the class, or how they learned or how they could access and apply taught materials- THEN altered the way they were teaching, they would’ve had more students in the seats, been upping their standards or, at the very least, kept Standards as high as they’d like to....or close to where they wanted them to be, and still got that monetary bonus for improving attendance.In the end, without taping into “The 3rd Alternative” or “The 8th Habit”, the only “winners” are those Profs with some extra duckets in their wallets. Hip-Hip-Hooray for a stronger, more equipped global student ready to meet the challenges of a burgeoning New World!In Chapter 8, “Deferred Justice”, whiffs of “12 Angry Men” - difficultly of standing our ALONE, came to mind as well as those aforementioned Dr. Stephen Covey books, where in efforts to break the Group Mentality, eEveryone speaks once in a Knights o’ the Round Table Socratic fashion echoes time and again in around “The 3rd Alternative” or “The 8th Habit”, except, UNLIKE King Arthur’s days, there’d actually be people without penises and of starkly varying hues.In fact thinking about Lancelot and his Merry Men (in Tights), I can’t help but see how most devolved and devolving worlds mirror those ancient days? Oh, the places we’ll go?"

53,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2025723-bill-o-hanlon,4,"I've read this one before and am going back over it taking notes for a seminar I am preparing on how to influence clients in therapy to change using social influence research, social psychology research, decision-making research and persuasion research. It's well written, engaging and has lots of good examples and research."
54,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3322680-amanda,4,"Sway: The Irresistible Pull of Irrational Behavior is a series of different examples of how normally rational humans can convince themselves that seemingly irrational behavior is the best path.As a retail employee, this book helped me understand the sometimes completely irrational behavior of the customers that come to my store! It was a good, short read."
55,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9482173-matthew,4,"Popular non-fiction books like this are fun. This one describes the reasons we all fall into irrational behavior. For example, adding a little financial incentive to an experiment or task can actually backfire and produce terrible results. This book explains why.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Malcolm Gladwell, or those kinds of books."
56,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31467977-tom-quinn,4,"A combination of intriguing topics and fast-paced writing makes ""Sway"" straight-up gripping. At just under 200 pages, grab this one before a flight and you won't be disappointed.3.5 stars out of 5. Though the content is often surface-level (prepare for a whirl of psychological survey summaries) the style makes for an enjoyable and quick read."

I'm glad the authors mentioned Zen Buddhism, because that philosophy certainly aids one in approaching the world with an uncluttered outlook."
58,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,3,An enjoyable read that reveals nothing more than grandma's common sense dressed up in modern jargon (think the little boy and the emperor's new clothes; beauty is only skin deep; it's the marathon not the 100m dash; keeping with the flock get's you fenced in)I would wish to give it 3.5 
59,0385524382,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7439517-monica,5,"Loved it! Easy to read but still made me think. It's kind of like Freakanomics, but with more of the why we think this way. I would consider buying this book so I can read it now and again to remind myself to think beyond the herd."
