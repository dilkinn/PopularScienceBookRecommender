Chaotic as it looked, these earliest scientists declared, the universe was in fact an intricate and perfectly regulated clockwork. This was the tail-end of Shakespeare's century, and these were brilliant, ambitious, confused, conflicted men. They believed in angels and alchemy and the devil, and they believed that the universe followed precise, mathematical laws. -- from the author’s websiteLondon in 1660 was a pretty gross place. Refuse and worse clogged the streets. Buildings were thrown together haphazardly, structurally unsound, leaning on each other for support. Medical science was worse than useless. Much of the city was as much a warren as a modern urban center.  The Big One, plague-wise, did major damage in 1665, and The Great Fire  laid waste to massive swaths of the city a year later. from Wikimedia One might expect that such unpleasantness would cause or at least reinforce a plunge into an even darker age. But among the ashes a few hardy sprouts were bursting forth. The Royal Society of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge, (not to be confused with another well known Royal Society) a group of scholars who had begun meeting in the 1640s, was officially founded in November 1660. Science would rise from the massive destruction of this era to revolutionize the world. Such seminal notions as the makeup of light, the significance of infinity, peering into the microscope to discern layers of life previously unsuspected, gazing through the telescope to further the explorations begun elsewhere, calculating a new kind of mathematics in order to understand and predict motion, figuring out the dynamics of the motion of the planets, stars, sun and the Earth, realizing the existence of gravity, establishing experimentation as central to what we know as the scientific method, and establishing the necessity of peer review to substantiate experimental claims were among the many changes this group of men wrought. Not too shabby. The Author, the one not licking his nose – from his siteIn the immortal words of Butch Cassidy, “Who are those guys?” Edward Dolnick not only gives us a nice overview of the times but offers a look at some of the larger personalities who propelled humanity into the modern age. The focus is definitely on the Royal Society chaps, Newton most particularly, but there are plenty of non-British scientists Dolnick examines with his literary microscope. Galileo did a lot more than look up and see moons of other planets. Other luminaries are given some attention as well, Leeuwenhoek, Copernicus, Descartes, and Kepler, for example. Gottfried Leibniz is hardly a household name, but certainly should be. He did as much as Newton to create Calculus and the language he used to explain the subject is the one we use today. Dolnick looks at the significance of Calculus. Existing math was fine for objects, but inadequate to cope with motion. Calculus fit the bill nicely. The universe they saw was as regular as clockwork, and the clock was designed by the Great Mathematician. Calculus was not only a key to understanding how things worked, but a passage to the very mind of God.It is pretty amazing that this revolution in human understanding came at a time when a radical and hugely popular religious tract, Day of Doom, was published, (50 Shades of Hell?) providing the fuel for many a fire-and-brimstone sermon. It was a time when the sundry miseries of the world were seen as a manifestation of Divine displeasure. Geez, cranky, isn’t He? The Society members were not atheists. But they craved a different kind of buzz. They saw their work as ferreting out the mechanisms employed by the creator. 
…all the early scientists shared a mental landscape. They all lived precariously between two worlds, the medieval one they had grown up in and a new one they had only glimpsed. These were brilliant, ambitious, confused, conflicted men. They believed in angels and alchemy and the devil, and they believed that the universe followed precise, mathematical laws.
 Christopher Wren not only designed many of the great buildings of the time, most famously St Paul’s, but was one of the founders of the Society, serving for a time at its president. He also advanced the science of meteorology, and specialization in medicine. Robert Boyle, a Society member, is considered the first modern chemist. But if you start using experimentation as a means of discerning truth, that presents rather a direct challenge to the powers that be, who had accumulated a monopoly on revealed truth, well, their interpretation of revelation anyway. Not only could the extremely well-to-do fiddle about with things scientific, but raising up the individual as a possible source of truth on par with that of ancient institutions was rather a big deal. One might imagine that these radical ideas were about as welcome as a Metallica solo on The 700 Club. Science in public was a new notion, as experiments were conducted with audiences. Results were peer-reviewed as well, the beginning of a core scientific practice. They even changed how science was communicated, moving toward plain language instead of the flowery mode of the time. Even the notion of progress was new, as most saw the world as existing in an ever-descending spiral since the eviction of Adam and Eve from the Garden.  Clockwise from top left, Robert Boyle, Christopher Wren, Gottfried Leibnitz and Robert Hooke – all images from WikimediaIt is unfortunate that some of the great minds in human history could do such ground-breaking work and remain such monumental schmucks. Newton stands out as a leader of his generation for more than just his genius.
Anyone dealing with Newton needed the delicate touch and elaborate caution of a man trying to disarm a bomb. Until he picked up the Principia from the printer and delivered the first copies to Newton, Halley [yes, that Halley] never dared even for a moment to relax his guard.
 After engaging in decades of petty battles with Royal Society member Robert Hooke, Newton had the last laugh when Society quarters were moved. The only member portrait that somehow, mysteriously, did not make the trip was that or Mr. Hooke. (No relation to the captain) When Gottfried Leibniz, the other creator of Calculus, foolishly submitted his claim to the Royal Society for recognition of his accomplishment, expecting a fair hearing, he did not count on the venom of the Society head, one Isaac Newton’s willingness to press his thumb on the scale. One must wonder if the apocryphal apple that landed on Mr. Newton’s head was gently released by an overhanging branch or lobbed by one of his associates in a perfect parabola. It will come as no shock that when Newton died at age 84, he remained a virgin, establishing a cruel precedent for future generations of nerds. (One might say for generations of nerds to come, but I wouldn’t, no, never.) No, not the inventor of the fig newtonEdward Dolnick has a breezy style, informative without feeling too formal, and the book is rich with fascinating detail. The root of the word disaster is explained, for example, and he lets us in on how many contemporary phrases, such as  for whom the bell tolls  originate in the 17th century. Dolnick has written on a diversity of subjects. Art forgery, the theft of Munch’s painting, The Scream, a disarming story of John Wesley Powell’s exploration of the Colorado River, a dreamy book on Freud, and a glittering book on the gold rush. His writing is fluid in form and fun in content.So, big egos, big change, much silliness, but in the end a pretty damned big deal. I have been present at a few births. Messy affairs, wet, sticky, lots of foul language and screaming, exceptional volumes of human liquids and mucous. But the results, once you scrape off the goo, wipe here and there, do some stitching up, swear that this is the last time, and cover the primary result in a soft blanket, can be pretty amazing. There are some, even in the modern world, who cannot seem to get past their irate 17th century establishment predecessors, favoring revelation over intellectual revolution. These are people for whom no change, no growth, no earthly knowledge is welcome. But a new vision was indeed brought into the world. Messy, bloody, halting, vulnerable, but ultimately destined to grow into the most powerful force humanity had seen since the invention of agriculture. It is very much worth your time to poke your nose into the delivery room and see what the ruckus was all about. Tick, tock. Review posted 1/24/14 =============================EXTRA STUFFEven though I had read the book a few years back, I had only written a partial review and had relegated it to the missed-opportunities stack. Credit must be given here to GR pal,  Traveller, whose gentle encouragement helped midwife this review into being. Without that little push, the review would have remained unwritten.

1,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1242652-cari,4,"While browsing the bookstore and idly picking up anything that looked vaguely interesting, I found The Clockwork Universe, which caught my admittedly somewhat eccentric, wide-ranging curiosity. Within a few hours I had a line of people calling dibs on reading it next (my mother, an ex, a geeky friend, a not-so-geeky drinking buddy) and only one dear friend (a pretentious robot on occasion) rolling his eyes before wandering off to the rest of my bookshelves. I found this burst of enthusiasm (or cheeky, unimpressed snark) amusing and dismissed it with a wave of my battered bookmark...But then I started reading. The division of opinion proved to be a telltale sign of what I was getting into: the casual reader with loosely-rooted curiosity and a basic familiarity with the major players (Newton, Halley (you know, the comet), Galileo, Tycho, Descartes, Kepler) will enjoy this, while the mathematicians, physicists, and other scientifically-minded could easily and without regret give it a pass as child's play.The Clockwork Universe is an enthralling, easy read (considering the subject matter) that is geared towards the casual reader, not the hardcore science buff, and Dolnick does a great job at weaving together a lot of different historical strands to create a solid presentation. He doesn't get bogged down in the technical aspects, remembering throughout that this is a group biography, a book of history and not science, and he keeps his focus. The main thread is, of course, the impact of Isaac Newton's work, but the author also presents a rather thorough picture of the entire Royal Society scene as it applies to ""the birth of the modern world.""Other reviewers have gone into more detail regarding specifics of the science, the revelations, the colossal impact, etc. that the author explores, so I'll spare you my nonsensical ramblings on that. Instead, I'll end with this:There are a couple chapters where Dolnick explains some basic concepts of calculus in order to help the reader understand later points in Newton's history. Between his down-to-earth, step-by-step explanations and the supporting graphs and pictorial depictions, I now understand more geometry and calculus than I ever did in high school. Not saying much, I know, but simply being aware of the importance of things like slopes, parabolas, and ellipses in regards to time, speed, velocity, and the like is more than all my struggles with inscrutable textbooks ever managed to do.Well done, sir. Well done."
2,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,4,"The book takes place in the 1600 hundreds in Europe. Superstition and belief in the supernatural were common place. To this background Dolnick tells us the stories of Isaacs Newton, Galileo, Kepler, Copernicus, Descartes, and Leibniz. These men discovered and described the forces that kept the earth, moon and all the planets spinning in their orbits, thereby ushering in the modern era. At the beginning of the book the author discusses the plague and life in the 1600s; he also discusses diarist Samuel Pepys and satirist Jonathan Swift. Dolnick provides a brief history of the Royal Society founded in London in 1660 to promote scientific inquiry. The last part of the book Dolnick reviews Isaac Newton’s “Principia.”The book is well written and researched. Dolnick uses simple language and short chapters to explain complex ideas in math and physics. Dolnick is a journalist with the Boston Globe and the investigative techniques of the journalist come through in his writing. I am amazed how vividly he portrayed living conditions of the time. This is a great book that triggers the reader to want to read the biographies of these early scientist.I read this as an audiobook downloaded from Audible. Alan Sktar narrated the book. Sktar is an actor and voiceover artist and an award winning audiobook narrator."
3,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5714705-angela,3,"Old-timey science! It’s not just dudes in powdered wigs! Naw, it's about their ecstatic sense of wonder, grueling focus, and sometimes batshit craziness! Dolnick is an incredible spinner of yarns. He builds a narrative with humor and panache, whether it’s something inspiring like Newton’s drive to study the infinite, or something just weird, like Leeuwenhoek looking at his own sperm through a microscope. Also, hurray for delicious, bite-sized chapters! However, Dolnick is a better science writer than a historian. The first part of the book, establishing the time period, is vividly entertaining with plagues and fire galore, but seems determined to portray 1600‘s England as a simplistically superstitious and disgusting place before the advent of SCIENCE!, like an over-the-top Monty Python skit. That famous “Bring out your dead!” line even appears once. Dolnick directly describes their world as “medieval,” (pg. 6) as if the Renaissance of the previous hundred-plus years had never happened. In the biggest example of misleading overgeneralization, Dolnick writes, ""God, who knew all the details of how the future would unroll, had decided already who would be saved and who punished."" (pg. 10) But wait, doesn't the Church of England not believe in predestination? Hm. Dolnick then quotes grisly children's poetry and Jonathan Edwards, the fire-and-brimstone preacher, both sources from Puritan New England. ""This was standard doctrine,"" Dolnick says. Standard doctrine? Those examples come from a religious group that left for an entirely new continent precisely because of conflict with standard doctrine. This isn't, er... rocket history. You learn that about the Pilgrims in elementary school.It makes me wonder what else I didn't catch.Also, Dolnick spends a LOT of time about calculus, which can drag. Despite not being a math person, I find the concepts behind calculus really exciting, but it gets really dragged out here. Dolnick’s overall approach is to avoid being all math-y, but this backfires as he takes multiple chapters to explain where he could’ve easily used a few diagrams.I did love the parts about astronomy. The sheer amount of thought that was once put into seemingly basic, modern concepts, was mind-blowing. Like what causes planets to keep moving? Why don’t they fall? What does it mean for a planet to have weight, if planets are massive like Earth, not ethereal wandering stars? Why do planets orbit in an ellipse, not a circle? How can a vacuum, which is nothing, exist, if to exist means to be? "
4,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6682163-jason,4,"The best passage of this book is in the conclusion of chapter 9:Scientists tend to have little interest in history, even the history of their own subject. They turn to the past only to pluck out the discoveries and insights that turned out to be fruitful—Boyle, for instance, is known today for “Boyle’s law,” relating pressure and volume in gases—and they toss the rest aside.In fields where the notion of progress is indisputable, such disdain for the past is common. The explanation is not so much anti-intellectualism as impatience. Why study ancient errors? So scientists ignore most of their forebears or dismiss them as silly codgers. They make exceptions for a tiny number of geniuses whom they treat as time travelers from the present day, thinkers just like us who somehow found themselves decked out in powdered wigs. But they were not like us.This was following the observation that Newton likely spent more time and thought on the subjects of alchemy and the prophecies of the Bible's Book of Daniel than gravity and calculus. These scientists that found the modern world were not like us regardless of how much we would like to project ourselves onto them. Dolnick describes a world where religion is not an option but so ingrained that scientists saw themselves primarily as deciphering God's plan. A world where a mind like Renee Descartes, the father of analytical geometry, wrestled greatly with the now easy concept of negative numbers. The story of how we got from there to here reveals just how amazing it is that we got from there to here at all."
5,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3413786-ben,3,"The year 1660 was a turning point in British political, cultural and intellectual life. The restoration of King Charles II, after eleven brutal years of military dictatorship, awoke a new spirit of vibrancy and optimism in Britain. And one of the earliest yet most enduring results of the new era was the formation of the Royal Society.It was a heady time and there are heady tales to be told of it, both in history and in fiction. Among the most successful of the latter are Neal Stephenson’s three-volume Baroque Cycle, and one suspects that it is their readership whom Edward Dolnick may have had had in mind when writing The Clockwork Universe: Isaac Newton, the Royal Society, and the Birth of the Modern Universe.Dolnick’s writing style is immediately engaging; he is good-humoured, possessed of a dry wit and a pleasing turn of phrase. In his presentation of mathematical and scientific ideas, he takes great pains to render them clear to an audience not only of non-specialists but of complete novices. He writes of science like one of those inspirational teachers who can make these things make sense to the least scientific of students.The book is structured in three parts. The first sets the historical scene of 1660s London – the Restoration, the plague of 1665, the Great Fire, the early work of the Royal Society. Part Two goes back in time to discuss the work of Copernicus, Kepler and Galileo and even the ancient Greeks, to provide the scientific context for Newton’s discoveries. Part Three focuses on Newton himself, his discoveries in the fields of mathematics, physics and astronomy, and his long-running feud with Leibnitz over the “invention” (sic) of calculus. (Surely mathematical laws are discovered, not invented?) In Parts Two and Three Dolnick is clearly on home turf, writing with the easy authority of one who understands both his subject and how to communicate it. The book is badly let down, however, by Part One, the historical element – ironically entitled “Chaos”, though probably for the wrong reasons.Dolnick is a scientist; he is no historian. He is at his weakest when discussing religious belief, and unfortunately takes up a great deal of the first 100 pages with this discussion. Whilst he makes some useful points about the generality of religious belief at the time – in particular the universal belief in eternal damnation and hellfire – most of his discussion is a gross over-simplification, treating religion as something static and homogeneous, ignoring the wide spectrum of beliefs that characterised the seventeenth century, ignoring the distinction between religious belief itself (influencing what a scientist might be prepared to believe) and Church doctrine (which dictated what they would be able to teach or publish).For example, he observes (p. 98) that it “was not coincidence … that seventeenth-century England welcomed science, on the grounds that science supported religion, and thrived; and seventeenth-century Italy feared science, on the grounds that science undermined religion, and decayed”; but he fails to distinguish anywhere in his narrative between Protestantism and Catholicism (or between their respective views on scientific discovery), or even to mention the Reformation as a key factor in creating an environment for the pursuit of scientific endeavour.Equally, much of Part One is overlaid with a wide-eyed naïveté and bemusement better suited to a high-school student’s first essay on an unfamiliar subject. For example, Dolnick cannot quite get his head around the fact that Newton and his fellows, discoverers of the fundamental laws of physics, still believed in astrology, witchcraft, alchemy and quack medicine. He gazes in stupefied wonder at the fact that the Royal Society witnessed many experiments that we would now consider ridiculous. (How do we know these things are ridiculous? Because of our advanced scientific understanding – understanding gained through centuries of experiments, both groundbreaking and, well, ridiculous.) Nor does he give any serious consideration to the political and social context – to the Restoration as a major political event which provided the climate and the catalyst for a new spirit of scientific enquiry. (Indeed, King Charles II is depicted as a caricature and a buffoon, rather than as a canny ruler who re-established domestic peace and economic prosperity in his realm after decades of factionalism, brutality and civil war.) In these respects, Dolnick’s over-simplification ends up misleading the reader; ironically Neal Stephenson’s Quicksilver – for all that it is fiction – offers far more insight than Dolnick into what made these men tick.The narrative becomes more credible in Part Two, though Dolnick’s chronology becomes somewhat haphazard, jumping about from the ancient Greeks to the sixteenth century to the seventeenth to Darwin in the nineteenth, with no apparent logic or reason. His regular references to what “Galileo and Newton” would have believed (e.g. p. 124) would be extremely confusing to a reader who doesn’t already have the chronology firmly lodged in their head. (Galileo died at age 77 in the year Newton was born.) The timeline provided at the start of the book does not wholly compensate for this.The book’s subtitle is also somewhat misleading, in that the Royal Society plays only a bit part in Dolnick’s narrative; “Newton, Leibnitz and the Birth of the Modern Universe” would be a more accurate description.Another minor irritant: whilst the book is peppered with quotations in support of Dolnick’s arguments, many of the direct quotations from writers of the period are poorly referenced – the endnotes often cite only a secondary source, usually another modern-day historian’s work, rather than the primary source of the quotation.Whilst by the end of the book the reader may have a better knowledge of aspects of the seventeenth century, for a proper understanding of the period one must turn to the work of people like Lisa Jardine. Nevertheless, The Clockwork Universe - or at least its second and third parts – offer as thorough, accessible and comprehensive an overview of the science of the seventeenth century as the lay reader could hope for; and for this reason alone it belongs on the shelf of anyone with an interest in this remarkable period of scientific discovery. "
6,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41878643-anna,5,"In the 1600's when Edward Dolnick’s fascinating story sets off, Europe is a dark and dangerous place. Superstition and ignorance are the dominating forces in every area of life. People die young, the average life expectancy is about 30, with many falling offer to crime and disease, or to doctors who were more likely to kill their patients than to cure them. Those are literally dark times, long before any system of lighting was discovered, and should you in those days need to venture outside after dark, the only light that would illuminate your way would be the moon and the stars, or a flickering flame of a lantern in your hand.It was a century of plague and war, and yet, it was also, unlikely as it may seem, a moment in history when a handful of men - mathematicians and astronomers, turned their attention to the skies, in order to decipher the laws by which God, himself a great mathematician, had designed the universe. The results were to say the least unexpected.Following the past discoveries and theories of Copernicus and Galileo, the future scientific giants, Kepler, Descartes, Leibniz, and most importantly, Isaac Newton, laid stone by stone foundations for our modern science. As a result of their efforts there followed a discovery of calculus, telescope, and forces that drove the motion of moon and stars, and all, with an original intention to strengthen the glory of God.The journey that started with a desire to understand God, and his magnificent creation, set off a scientific chain reaction that led far away from its original purpose. Explanations those deeply religious men found, and the logic within it, ended up, instead of deciphering God's cosmic code, undermining the very belief that they ventured to prove. And by doing so, ironically enough, they were the ones that opened another path of reasoning, that allowed science to question if He, The Almighty, had anything to do with it, at all…. I loved listening about the discoveries, and the personalities and feuds between them, because the scientists whose names we know so well were also people of flesh and blood and oh so considerable egos…. My sincere thanks to Mr Dolnick for bringing the science closer, and painting such an accessible and enjoyable picture of the people behind the science."
7,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7609801-kevin-o-brien,4,"This was a slightly tricky book to rate. I gave it four stars out of five on the merit of the book itself, though I would recommend it mostly to people who are interested in the history of science but not heavily read in that area already. This book is not one that sets a standard for scholarship, but is a well-written introduction to a worthy topic.Isaac Newton is the primary focus of this book, though his rival Leibniz also comes in for some discussion. And Newton is valuable because he represents a transition to the modern world. Because of his invention of calculus and his laws of motion, he is regarded as one of the first modern scientists, and deservedly so. But he was equally one of the lats great medieval thinkers, drenched in religiosity, and a devoted investigator in alchemy. So he was born into a medieval world, where the great fire of London and the Plague were seen as God's judgement on a sinful people. But when he died it was a modern world, and he did a lot to make it so. so the sub-title is really quite accurate.One of the things that should get you thinking as you read between the lines, particularly in the first part of the book, is how people reacted to the Plague. With no understanding of disease, and an assumption that such things were the just visitations of a wrathful God, they had no alternative but to die in huge numbers. Now we have science and medicine that can protest us, but those very accomplishments that define the modern world are under attack right now by religious fundamentalists who would drag us back to those days. We need to be constantly vigilant to stop them."
8,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31175766-kathy,4,This book is a winner. I really enjoyed the manner in which the history of scientific research played out with many interesting stories. 
9,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"In 1600 the philosopher Bruno was burned at the stake for proclaiming that the earth was just one of many planets in solar systems throughout the universe. In 1633 Galileo was sentenced to imprisonment, subsequently commuted to house arrest, by the Roman Inquisition for saying that the planets revolved around the sun. But in 1705 for Newton’s work showing gravity held the planets in their orbits around the sun, he was knighted by Queen Anne. Two years earlier Newton had been elected President of The Royal Society. What changed in the seventeenth century to turn heresy into acknowledged wisdom? Dolnick answers this question by writing about not just the discoveries but the social and religious context in which they were made. We learn how celestial science progressed from Copernicus to Newton via Galileo, Tycho Brahe, Kepler, and Descartes. We see how one idea led to another.London in the 1660’s was a miserable place, dangerous, dirty, smelly and vermin infested. It was devastated by the plague in 1665 and fire in 1666 following decades of English chaos. In May 1660 Charles II assumed the throne following the genocidal Oliver Cromwell who had brought England to Civil War and chopped off the head of Charles I, Charles II’s father. In November 1660 Charles II founded The Royal Society which started as a showcase for oddball experiments punctuated by occasional displays of serious science. But most significant was The Royal Society’s mission, to explore new ideas, an idea itself opposed to the rigid and often apocalyptic thinking of the time. In the 1660’s most Europeans thought new ideas were bad. After all God directly controlled events and everything you needed to know was in the Bible. That hell was located in the center of the earth was more than a belief, it was accepted geography. Why waste time on telescopes when you should be preparing for eternity? It all began with Copernicus who for fear of criticism was reluctant to publish his work showing that the planets revolve around the sun. He relented on his deathbed in 1543. Oddly the Church had little reaction upon publication. It would be another 75 years before stiff Catholic opposition surfaced when Galileo also championed heliocentrism. Galileo’s contemporary was the mathematician Johannes Kepler. Kepler took a job as assistant to the Danish nobleman and astronomer Tycho Brahe. After Tycho’s death in 1601, Kepler dug deep into Tycho’s detailed records of observations. Tycho’s hybrid model held that the planets revolved around the sun, but the sun revolved around the earth. Kepler’s work showed not only that the earth too revolved around the sun but that the planet’s orbits were elliptical with the sun as one of two foci. This accounted for variances in the planets’ speeds. But it would take Newton to explain how this and Kepler’s other laws worked. Galileo had been sent a copy of Kepler’s book but never bothered to read it. Galileo always believed the orbits of the planets were circles.In 1609 Galileo built his own telescope after learning about the Dutch invention. He became a celebrity as people used it to spy ships approaching the harbor at great distances. But the telescope was far more important because it showed the moon was made of rocks with hills and valleys just like the earth. The traditional notion that the moon and cosmic objects were made of some mysterious ethereal substance was shown to be false opening the way for a more pragmatic view of the heavens. Much later In 1668 Newton built a much improved reflecting telescope that similarly served to raise his status bringing him much attention from The Royal Society. In 1674 Leeuwenhoek invented the microscope. Interestingly, the discovery of the micro world did not cause the consternation of religious authorities that the macro world did. The discovery of new tiny creatures was not perceived as threatening the role of God as designer. Galileo was the first to apply laws to the earth that Aristotle had only applied to the heavens, saying that natural forces work here as they do in the stars. Galileo was fascinated by motion. He had his own concept of relativity, noting that an observer in a closed space, aside from any outside sounds or vibrations, cannot tell he is moving. In a moving ship’s compartment something dropped lands on the floor just below where it started. Everything is moving horizontally together. A rock dropping from the top of the mast of a ship as it moved through the water would fall to the deck in the same spot relative to the bottom of the mast. His concepts explained why we didn’t fall off the earth as it moved, at the time a widely accepted argument given to prove that the earth could not be orbiting around the sun. Galileo also conducted experiments on the rate of decent of falling bodies. From these he realized that arrows shot into the air would form parabolas descending symmetrically to their ascent.Next on the scene was Descartes who supposedly developed Cartesian coordinates while trying to figure out how to track the movements of a fly on the wall. But more important than tracking flies was that Descartes provided the means to translate equations into lines and lines into equations. Now parabolas could be worked with algebra. Descartes’ system showed algebra and geometry were simply different representations of the same thing. In 1637 he published his new mathematics in the same book he famously declared, “I think therefore I am.” In 1665 the plague closed the university at Cambridge forcing Newton to the countryside where he started developing calculus using ideas from Galileo and Descartes. The following year he also began work on his particle theory of light challenging Descartes’ wave theory. Calculus was developed with the idea of approximating a limit. By measuring the average slope of a curve in ever smaller segments each closer to the target point on a curve the limit could be approximated. This derivative was the slope of a line tangent to the curve at that point. This new math enabled the measure of the rate of change of the rate of change, for example acceleration, the rate of change in speed. Calculus would be critical to Newton’s theory of universal gravitation. Galileo had realized that vertical motion and horizontal motion were independent of each other. Newton went a step further. Newton pictured a cannon ball fired horizontal to the earth. If a cannon ball was dropped in place at the same instant the other was fired both would hit the ground at the same time. What if the cannon shot the ball so fast that the curvature of the earth caused the ground to drop off before the cannonball could fall to the ground? What if the rate of fall equaled the rate of drop off? What if the cannonball was fired above the atmosphere? It would be in orbit. Newton’s great conceptual breakthrough was realizing that the moon behaved just like that cannon ball. The moon was falling and moving just fast enough to maintain its orbit. The force that made rocks fall on earth was exactly the same as the force that made the moon fall. The same force, gravity, pervaded earth and all the heavens.Newton published his masterpiece, Principia, explaining universal gravitation in 1687. His book was written to be accessible by only the most gifted mathematicians. His ideas would only gain wider currency in subsequent books by others using simpler language. Newton, who hated controversy, had been reluctant to publish his mathematical model of the universe. It took the constant prodding and financial help of a young diplomatic Edmund Halley of comet fame to convince him to publish Principia in 1687. Leibniz had also discovered calculus independently of Newton. Unfortunately each felt the other stole his ideas and a bitter feud ensued. Important to both were the works of Galileo and Descartes. Both were brilliant but had entirely different personalities. Newton was withdrawn, secretive and difficult. Leibniz was worldly, engaged, outgoing. Characteristically, Newton’s notation of calculus was arcane. Leibniz’s notation was more accessible and is what we use today. But the most important difference between Leibniz and Newton was that Newton used his calculus to change our understanding of the universe. Newton saw his work as describing God’s design not challenging it. He felt he had been selected by God to make his discoveries. However, Newton’s description of gravity would cause a backlash from those who saw it leaving no place for God. Although Newton believed that the wobble of some planets would require God to intervene occasionally to keep everything in order. Newton was perhaps the greatest scientist of all time. His Principia perhaps the greatest work. He was an enigmatic character whose achievement was the culmination of a century of groundbreaking discoveries. He brought the earth, the planets and stars together in a single system forever changing the way people saw their world and their place in it. Still some scientists objected. Even though gravity explained the motion of everything from forks falling off the kitchen table to the appearance of comets, what explained gravity? That would take another couple of centuries and another equally profound genius, Einstein.From the seventeenth century forward science increasingly challenged conventional beliefs. Dolnick does a wonderful job in showing us how it all began. His portrayal is for the most part not highly technical and he provides painstaking explanations for difficult concepts. His book is full of personal details about the discoverers and the tenor of the times so that even readers not fond of math may enjoy it. It should be a highly pleasurable read for anyone interested in the history of science."

In other terms this book explores the rise of calculus and its repercussions on the world. My expectations of the book were different than what it delivered. The publisher's summary stated very succinctly, ""The Clockwork Universe is the fascinating and compelling story of the bewildered geniuses of the Royal Society, the men who made the modern world."" This is maybe less than half of the book. In fact the depth of biography and place setting was very superficial at best, a mere tangent on the surface as one might say having read this book. I must admit that I came into this book having read Neal Stephenson's enormous ""Baroque Cycle"". What amazed me was that ""The Clockwork Universe"" confirmed plot point after plot point of fictionalized events in Stephenson's series. However, ""The Baroque Cycle"" painted a beautiful and elaborate portrait while ""The Clockwork Universe"" merely pointed out those plot points. On top of these points, nearly a third of the book dealt with Galileo, Tycho Brahe, and Kepler's work. Again, I enjoyed the detour, but it felt a little off from the way the book was sold.Those quibbles aside, Edward Dolnick delivered a very easy to read look into the rise of calculus and classical physics. I took high school and college level calculus, but I never got a good sense of what it was good for. Dolnick describes in very easy terms why these tools were (and are) extremely important to modern society. I feel like I have a much better understanding of the subjects I had studied back in school, and I am appreciative of my newfound understanding. It was very nice seeing the cultural setting that these ideas sprung from, and how it led to an age that Isaac Newton probably would have abhorred.In conclusion this novel was a good read on science and math, but too superficial on painting an in-depth portrait of the times. It hit a lot of interesting points, but I'll probably be re-reading ""The Baroque Cycle"" soon."
11,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/318324-kurt,4,"A very interesting and well-written history of the early days of the modern scientific age, including great descriptions of the prevailing culture, attitudes, philosophies, and standards of living that accompanied the men (sorry, but they were all men) who ushered in the science and mathematics that govern our modern world. The story of how Isaac Newton discovered calculus and how he applied it to explain so many theretofore mysteries of our universe is one of the truly great stories in the history of mankind."
12,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,3,"If you want an accessible history of early modern mathematics, this is your book. The marketing is off, as if the author changed course about a third of the way through but neglected to inform his publishers or, for that matter, alter the first third of the book. It’s presented as a history of English science in the late 17th century, and the first third focuses on fairly simplistic scene-setting. Other reviewers have rightly pointed out that the speeches of Jonathan Edwards—an 18th century New England preacher descended from people who left England due to intolerance of their extreme religious views—should not be pointed to as an articulation of “standard doctrine” in England decades earlier, and this sort of thing calls the author’s sweeping statements about religion into question.That said, eventually Dolnick tosses aside his shackles and digs into what really interests him, which is a history of math, particularly how mathematical discoveries were viewed in a religious context and why the invention/discovery of calculus was so important. This is actually quite readable and engaging, and short chapters and diagrams make the math pretty digestible for the intelligent reader who may not remember much from school. (I actually felt like it was a little bit too simplistic. My memories of high school calculus were barely jogged.) Interestingly, the math focus means that except for Newton, the people Dolnick focuses on are largely not English: Leibniz, Kepler, Galileo, and Descartes all have their turn in the spotlight. Since English-language histories of science are so Anglocentric generally, this was both great, in that I learned a little about people I hadn’t read much about, and frustrating, in that why drag us through 100 pages of English history first if this is where we’re going? Why not get the context of these other countries, presumably less familiar to most English-speaking readers, instead?But okay. It’s a readable history of math, with some pretty interesting details. I didn’t know, for instance, that Descartes invented the idea of plotting change on a graph in the 17th century or what a breakthrough this was. Or about the way credulity, at the time, was seen by thinkers as a sign of intelligence, apparently as contrasted with hidebound peasants who refused to believe anything they didn’t see with their own eyes. (Naturally, this resulted in the thinkers believing some wacky things.) It’s not the book I would recommend if you actually want to read about late 17th century science, since it barely touches anything non-mathematical, so for other subjects, try Ingenious Pursuits: Building the Scientific Revolution instead. But it’s a quick read and I don’t regret reading it."
13,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,4,"Dolnick's claim that the 17th century was the birth of modernity is tempered as the book progresses. By that time, painting had already moved from static religious iconography to application of perspective, chiaroscuro, and portraiture toward a kind of dramatic expression that appeals to the modern eye. Science in the 17th century was still, however, a mix of contradictions. Isaac Newton, the scientific genius of the era, expended considerable time and energy on experiments in alchemy. Members of the first organization for scientific investigation devoted much effort to affixing the apocalypse to a precise year. Descartes, the brilliant mathematician and philosopher, believed a corpse could catch out it's murderer by gushing blood if the perpetrator approached. Experiments often took the form of crude spectacles. In 1667 members of the Royal Society witnessed an attempt to transfuse the blood of a sheep into a mentally ill “volunteer” named Arthur Coga. Some speculated the transfusion would cure the man of his mental affliction. That part of the experiment failed, although fortunately, Coga survived and even partook of a bracing celebratory drink with the distinguished members. Intellectually, the 17th century was still partially linked to the medieval world of Aristotelian syllogisms based on assumptions about symmetry and perfection. The biological sciences would not begin to break free until the 18th century.Dolnick provides vivid portraits of the century's scientific luminaries. Johannes Kepler, Robert Hooke, Galileo, Gottfried Leibnitz, Isaac Newton and Edmond Halley all make an appearance. Newton was secretive, contentious, and imperious as well as brilliant. When he once declared he stood on the shoulders of giants, the statement was meant in part as a jibe at his contemporary Robert Hooke, a short man of slight build and stooped posture. Dolnick offers his own interpretation expressed with a subtle wit.  “When Newton declared that he stood on the shoulders of giants, he was at least partly sincere. He did genuinely admire some of his fellow scientists, particularly those who'd had the good judgment to die before he came along.” (p. 144)Dolnick's achievement lies in his careful explanation of mathematics as the key to the scientific discoveries of the century. He begins with Galileo's exploration of motion. The questions Galileo asked were concerned with metrics rather than cause: How fast, how far, how long? A series of measurements with inclined planes are far more illuminating than the the standard image of him standing atop the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Dolnick proceeds from Galileo's measurements to Descartes's graphic depiction relating time and distance. His graphs linked the intuitive information of a picture to the abstract precision of the equation.  “...Descartes' insight was a conceptual revolution....algebra and geometry were two languages that described a shared reality.” (p.193) Descartes opened the door to a solution to the problem of infinity. Again, Dolnick offers a memorable image:  “...practiced men of science glanced at infinity, saw that it could not be tamed, and booted it out the door so that they could concentrate on real life questions that preoccupied them. No sooner had they set to work than they heard a clawing at the window.” (p.208) Newton's contribution to the solution was calculus. Concepts like ratios of rates of change between variables and shrinking increments both tamed infinity and tortured generations of future math students. Dolnick's elegant narrative is almost enough to entice the curious student back to a study of calculus.This is a book written for the non-mathematician. Dolnick knows his audience. He describes Kepler's labors to quantify the differing orbital lengths of the planets as “gruesome calculations.” (p.163) He provides a lovely proof of the Pythagorean Theorem using four congruent right triangles. If the initial chapters overreach a bit, the central chapters more than compensate for this flaw. The short chapters reinforce the idea that this is a book meant for slow reading and reflection. "
14,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1684176-aeron,4,"This book is extremely well written. Dolnick makes the material seem easy to understand and relevant to a modern audience. It is primarily about Isaac Newton, and essentially makes a case that Newton was so far above and beyond any genius we've ever seen that it's hard to fathom. What Newton did for mathematics and physics is staggering. But Dolnick also points out the changing world at that time - the group of natural philosophers of the Royal Society working to figure out how the world really works, and this environment as a whole enabled the modern world to be born. But it was Newton who broke the code, so to speak. A fair bit of time and respect is accorded to Leibniz in this book, too, but at the end of the day, Dolnick concludes that Newton was more of an intellectual God, and Leibniz, while brilliant, was all too human. One of the interesting themes presented here is the interplay between religion and science. Essentially, Dolnick makes the case that Newton's breakthrough was accepted because Newton and his contemporaries could more or less fit it into the context of their religious beliefs. For Newton, discovering calculus and figuring out how gravity works was all part of reading the secrets of God's creation. Of course, give humanity a few centuries to toy with this idea of a clockwork universe and sooner rather than later a host of theological questions arise. However, in terms of biology and the breakthrough that Darwin made in understanding life on Earth, that took centuries longer because it was too much of an upset to our religious foundations. It's an interesting argument, and has more than a small dose of truth in, although it does seem somewhat simplified in this book. But I can't fault Dolnick for that. Frankly, it's the simplification of the material that makes it so accessible. Now I'm reading Neal Stephenson's Quicksilver (the first book in his Baroque Trilogy), which is a fictional tale of this same time period. It's fun having Dolnick's non-fiction version so fresh on my mind as I weave through Stephenson's creative vision. I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in math, physics, or scientific history. It would also be an excellent book to have high school and college students read, to give them the context for how our modern understanding of the world came about. "
15,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4962899-tim,3,"Overall, not a bad book and I did learn some new things. I'm definitely not a fan of the audio book reader, though. That said, I eventually got used to him and didn't mind in the end.I didn't like the first portion of the book which is basically spent describing plagues and a fire in London. That said, the author does an excellent job describing the various contributions of Copernicus, Kepler, Brahe, Descartes and Galileo. The explanations are pitched at a level for the layman and are well done so most people shouldn't have any problems following them. He even does a decent job describing calculus, although doesn't really explain how it's useful for the scientist other than for describing speed at an instant.Very little of the Royal Society (what I really was interested in) was discussed, other than how they interact with Newton. Leibniz gets a decent amount of coverage, but mainly dealing with his feud with Newton.The main focus of the book is Newton and most of the other contributions discussed in the book are there to lead to discussions of Newton's invention of calculus, gravity, and his Principia Mathematica.So, for someone who doesn't know the history leading up to Newton's math and science contributions, it does a decent job, but if you're looking for more details about Newton's contemporaries, I'd look elsewhere."

I am the original author of this essay, as well as the owner of CCLaP; it is not being reprinted illegally.)This is one of those ""NPR-worthy"" nonfiction titles I'm a fan of, in this case a concise look at the formation of Britain's Royal Society in the 1600s, essentially the very first scientific organization in human history, closely associated with Sir Isaac Newton and one of the main subjects of Neal Stephenson's stunning three-thousand-page ""Baroque Cycle"" series of historical/fantastical novels. And in fact, I don't really have a lot to say about this book other than that it's competently done and absolutely worth your time; although you should be aware that only half the book is devoted to the history of the Royal Society itself, the other half being layman explanations of the actual scientific breakthroughs being made in those years, including a dense but fascinating look at the differences between Newton's calculus and Liebnitz's, and why calculus in general has been such a profound influence on the modern world. Not really a book to seek out unless you're specifically interested in the subject, but a fine beginner's guide if you are.Out of 10: 8.7 "
17,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3870587-lucas-miller,4,"Well-written science nonfiction is a treat that I relish and this book delivers in spades. Newton is the book's main focal point but it also spends considerable time detailing the contributions of Galileo, Kepler, Leibniz, Hook, Leeuwenhoek and others. The description of calculus was clear and even, I have to admit, compelling (I have a BA rather than a BS because I refused to take calculus). The religious devotion of these pioneers was surprising and Dolnick does a nice job of pointing out the irony of the effects Newton and Leibniz' work on religion and society. I had put off purchasing this one because I disliked Alan Sklar's reading of ""Before the Dawn"" but I really liked his narration with this one. He tends to chuckle from time to time and sound a bit like a bombastic professor but that worked in a way here that it didn't in the other book. If you have an interest in the history of science, especially the early days, I can heartily recommend this book's pleasing blend of narrative and scientific explanation. "
18,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/378568-ken,5,"I picked this up after hearing the author appear on WNYC public radio. This is a superb idea for a book: not just a history of science, but a history of the scientific method. It's about the age when thinkers stopped prioritizing ""knowledge from authority"" and started developing methods for experimentation and discovery. And it's extremely well-written, evocative, fascinating. "
19,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22409011-brendan-monroe,3,"I'd definitely file this under ""light reads"" but it was entertaining nonetheless. Of course, certain parts were more entertaining than others. I absorbed with pleasure the bits about the odd little quirks of certain members of the Royal Society, but the several chapters that dealt with Newton's invention of calculus were something of a snore. The book is essentially about the various rivalries that existed between Isaac Newton and various other scientists, the main being Newton's German contemporary, Gottfried Leibniz. Unfortunately, this book is just trying to do so much that none of these rivalries is fleshed out in enough detail to warrant much interest. At one point, Dolnick compares Newton's rivalry with fellow Royal Society member Robert Hooke to that of Mozart's with Salieri. Reading that only made me wish that I were reading about those two, frankly, much more compelling figures. In the end, Dolnick is just trying to do too much. He wants to cover so much history and so many towering figures that we only get the barest glimpse at any of them. As I said, it's enjoyable reading but you're not going to get anything truly substantive out of it.The main takeaway is that European society's hopeless backwardness for so many centuries thanks to Christianity's pervasive influence. Even brilliant figures like Newton were brainwashed to the point that they never dared to consider the thought that god didn't exist at all, instead tying themselves in knots to try and work their brilliant theorems around their belief in his existence. In a time when the greatest insult was to call someone an atheist, discoveries by men like Newton were all the more impressive. "
20,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1453866-brien,3,"The book was interesting, though I lost interest here and there when things got a bit too detailed for me. I also learned two things about Isaac Newton: (1) He was clearly a genius; (2) He was clearly an asshole. "
21,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2377230-emily,4,"I've been picking at this book for several months now. For me it wasn't a book to sit and read in one setting - some of the topics are pretty heavy and I preferred to read it in sections. For anyone interested in the ideas in this book, but don't want to read it I recommend an episode of Nova that aired last month link: The Great Math Mystery which explains Newtons discoveries of gravity and why falling objects move at the same speed regardless of weight. Another awesome video by a science program on BBC shows a bowling ball and a feather being dropped in a vacuum. It's one thing to know and understand the concept, it's another thing to actually see it happen. Primarily this is a book about Newton, but also features many other great men whose names you'll recognize (even if you can't immediately pinpoint their achievements): Kepler, Descartes, Galileo, Hooke, Boyle, Leibniz. The things they discovered are bedrocks of all the modern conveniences we enjoy today. Not just big things like gravity, but something so simple as Descartes ""discovery"" of graphs. Something that elementary school kids can understand, was revolutionary at the time.Newton is particular is fascinating to read about - a petty, vain, selfish, arrogant, genius who spent more time trying to prove that alchemy was real than he spent on any other idea. He invented calculus and never told anyone about it for 30 years. Nine years after he came up with the concept another scientist named Leibniz also came up with the same math and claimed credit for it. What followed was a bitter campaign to discredit the other that could rival what we see in politics today. Newton was responsible for the ""discovering"" gravity and proved the ""how and why"" of orbits. He also did crazy things, like sticking a nail file behind his eye to see how that changed what he could see. He believed that he could turn metals into gold. One thing this book really made me think about was the history/progress of science. A few years ago, I read a book (don't remember what one) that said something like ""because of religion, we had the dark ages - 1,000 years in which all scientific discovery was thwarted. Imagine, what our world would be like today, if we hadn't lost that 1,000 years of progress"". I found that to be a staggering thought - more so after reading this book about the accomplishments of the men who birthed ""modern science"". What these men accomplished is their lifetimes is astonishing. Ideas that changed the world. I can't help but think about where we would be today, if we hadn't lost 1,000 years of scientific advancement prior to the events in this book. "
22,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3488439-daphne,3,"My favorite section was the last half. I love math, but only applied mathematics. I've always struggled with pure math for maths sake, but enjoyed it when it was involved in my other courses like chemistry and biology. The author describing the discovery of calculus and why it mattered I found fascinating. The first half was a very general overview of the time period this book is centered around. It was interesting, and if someone hasn't already read dozens of general history books about this time period - then I think they'd really get a lot out of it.I did listen to this as an audiobook, and the narrator had an absolutely splendid voice. I loved the gravitas he seemed to add to the whole thing."
23,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6059871-vicky-chijwani,5,"Ever since I read 
Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality
, I've been increasingly drawn to the scientific history genre. The Clockwork Universe is another fantastic addition on this subject. There's just something I love about immersing myself in the lives of the people in our school textbooks, how they thought, what drove them, what environments they lived in.First let's get this out of the way: yes, Newton was an unprecedented intellect. But he was also a spiteful dick, and he had no appreciation whatever for the finer things in life. Boy does that feel good to say—I like my scientists more human and less God-like.What I found most fascinating was the fact that Newton did his greatest work in an environment when apocalypse was on everyone's minds. A popular prediction for the Day of Judgment zeroed in on the year 1660, when Newton was 17. In 1664, an ominous comet traversed the skies. Newton's ""miracle years"" (1665-66), when he invented calculus and discovered the composition of white light, were a period of great turmoil in England. Starting in 1665, the plague wiped out 25% of London's population in 18 months. Then, in 1666 (an accursed number to begin with), the Great Fire consumed much of the city.Imagine living in that time and place, when religious faith was pretty much assured (Newton himself was deeply religious, spending years researching the Bible), disaster struck with increasing regularity, and therefore everyone assumed the world would end soon. Would you spare any thought to mathematical curiosities, or why objects moved the way they did in the air? These must have seemed utterly inconsequential in everyday life—of course, we 21st century folks have the unfair benefit of hindsight.It was also interesting to read about how 17th century scientists grappled with the notion of infinity and tamed it, as it was a prerequisite to calculus. The Greeks (who were held in the highest regard then) had stayed away from infinity due to the inevitable paradoxes it led to (Zeno's paradox being the most famous). That had prevented them from ever seriously analysing the movement of objects. The crucial breakthrough was to disregard the philosophical questions raised by infinity, and instead focus on the pragmatic aspects. That would let you resolve Zeno's paradox and break down a mental barrier, so you can move on to more pressing questions like how to calculate speed at a particular ""instant"".Another interesting personality is Robert Hooke, whom you may remember from Hooke's law or as the discoverer of the cell. It turns out Hooke was the one who set Newton to thinking about planetary orbits, when he wrote a letter posing the question of what curve a planet's orbit would follow if it were attracted to other bodies by a force proportional to the inverse square of the distance between them.Lastly, it was a small surprise to find out that the success of the scientific revolution had had some influence on America's founding fathers as well. I mean, it seems inevitable if you think about it, but to see the specifics of that connection is something else. The clearest evidence of this comes from Woodrow Wilson: ""The Constitution of the United States had been made under the dominion of the Newtonian Theory. You have only to read the papers of the The Federalist to see that fact written on every page. They speak of the “checks and balances” of the Constitution, and use to express their idea the simile of the organization of the universe, and particularly of the solar system,—how by the attraction of gravitation the various parts are held in their orbits; and then they proceed to represent Congress, the Judiciary, and the President as a sort of imitation of the solar system.""Here are some of the other good parts:Newton began to give serious thought to asking whether the same force that pulled an apple to the Earth also pulled the moon. But this is to downplay two feats of intellectual daring. Why should anyone have thought that the moon is falling, first of all, when it is plainly hanging placidly in the sky, far beyond our reach or the reach of anything else? And even if we did make the large concession that it is falling, why should that fall have anything in common with an apple's fall?In the history of science, abstraction was crucial. It was abstraction that made it possible to look past the chaos all around us to the order behind it. The surprise in physics, for instance, was that nearly everything was beside the point. Less detail meant more insight. A rock fell in precisely the same way whether it was a diamond or a chunk of brick, or if it fell yesterday or a hundred years ago, or in Rome or in London. The skill that physics demanded was the ability to look past particulars to universals.More than three hundred years ago, for instance, Leibniz envisioned the digital computer. He had discovered the binary language of 0s and 1s now familiar to every computer programmer, and, more remarkably, he had imagined how this two-letter alphabet could be used to write instructions for an all-purpose reasoning machine. The computer that Leibniz had in mind relied not on electrical signals—this was almost a century before Benjamin Franklin would stand outdoors with a kite in a lightning storm—but on marbles tumbling down chutes in a kind of pinball machine."
24,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/602581-bronwyn,3,"This was fine. Interesting enough. Good at explaining some of the trickier concepts easily. Very basic overview of everything, though, and a bit too pop-y - when you compare something to The DaVinci Code or posters on someone's wall... no...eta: Some of my impression of the book may have been the audiobook narrator. I didn't care for him. The book may be better on it's own, but it's definitely still pop-sciencey and not what I was expecting."

A excellent insight into Newton and the time period in which he lived, but I found that I admired Newton less the more I learned about him. I know that this is the point but it also meant the text dragged a bit. Also because I am a math and science person, I found the chapters about infinity and limits to be a bit dragging even if they were necessary for people unfamiliar with calculus. "
26,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7973110-lin,5,"I agree with other reviewers that Part 1 of this book was the weakest, but Parts 2 and 3 are so good that I can easily give this book five stars. I'm sure some of my enthusiasm comes from being a science teacher (who teaches Newton's Laws), but all of the back stories, the rivalries, and the glimpse into the past were simply engaging. This book has been on my TBR list for a long time and I'm so glad I finally read it!"
27,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1976637-jeff,5,"In a nutshell, The Clockwork Universe tells how the world progressed from 1600, when philosopher Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake by the Church for proclaiming that the earth was just one of an infinite number of planets, to 1705 when Isaac Newton was knighted by the Queen of England for his discoveries in physics, one them being how how gravity maintained planets' orbits around suns - basically proving what cost Bruno his life. In the 17th century the modern world was born. Scientists (who were mostly believers) began understanding and explaining how the the laws of the universe operated instead of using the prevailing hand-waving explanation that ""God did it"". Religious leaders and many in the general population didn't want to hear of this new knowledge as they argued that the infallible Bible contained the explanations for all things and it was an insult to God to probe for further understanding! The Church still had a stranglehold on society, even amongst its most enlightened citizens. Having visited London and Newton's grave and memorial last month, I could really relate to the setting and the reverence of Newton by the British and the rest of the world. As the title indicates, the book was primarily about Newton, one of the greatest human minds. The parts of the book about Newton's life were fascinating, and I'm looking forward to reading his biography written by Richard Westfall. Newton's life reminded me of Leonardo Da Vinci as he seemed to be operating on a level far above any of his contemporaries. The author also fully fleshes out what life was like in London in the 17th century, and for the most part it wasn't pleasant. It was a very dirty, polluted city. The plague arrived in 1665 and the city burned the year after. And people of that time were not keen on bathing as they thought sickness entered the body through the pores. Medicine was ineffective and based on nonsense. Whereas Newton was the primary focus of the book a number of other interesting people and topics were covered: the founding of The Royal Society, the life and times of Newtons' rival Gottfried Leibniz, Leeuwenhoek and his microscope, Galileo and his telescope (also persecuted by the Church), Kepler and his laws of planetary motion, and stories about Boyle, Descartes, Halley, Hooke, and a number of other notable scientists and philosophers of this century. The Royal Society promoted rivalry and cooperation amongst the greatest minds of the time. Liebniz and Newton pushed each other and argued over who invented calculus (Newton came up with it first), and Newton's disdain for Leibniz's spurred him on to write some of his greatest works. The The Clockwork Universe was an excellent listen. The narrator, Alan Sklar, had a pleasant voice and his reading added to my enjoyment of the story. I'd say it's one of the better history of science books I've read. It was riveting about 95% of the time and lost me only during he times when mathematical principals such as infinity and negative numbers were delved in to, in too much detail in my opinion, and the book got a little dry during this part. A lot of subject matter was touched on and this is not a long book, so some subjects were glossed over and not explored enough for my liking. But, like any good nonfiction book should do, this one has inspired me to read more about the characters and events contained between its covers (or within its digital file)."
28,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/680056-amy,4,"Even though I am an English teacher and deal more in parables than in parabolas, I found this to be a very interesting book despite there being SO. MUCH. MATH. Dolnick delves into how we managed to turn to the Renaissance into the modern world by demonstrating how Isaac Newton's discoveries in math and science made our universe much more understandable. To do this he goes back to the ""shoulders of giants"" Newton stood on to be able to see what he saw. This takes us back to Kepler and Galileo, who lived during times when to explain the workings of the world was to doubt God and his perfection. Kepler kept his revelations secret until he was almost dead; Galileo died under house arrest. To explain each man's discoveries, Dolnick feels it necessary to also explain the math-- of angles, inverted squares, Pythagorean thereom, mass, velocity, this formula, that formula. He does a clever job at explaining complex equations by using analogies, but analogy or no analogy, I just don't get it and was bored. The math stuff made the human stuff way more exciting. Dolnick shows how we take the modern world for granted as we know that there is a solution or an answer for everything. Plague? Fleas. Massive fire that burns down whole city? Poor city planning. Children dying in infancy? Disease or unsanitary conditions. In the 17th century, there was one answer: God. In a world where not much was understood, everyone relied on God's mercy, which he had in short supply. Galileo was imprisoned and Bruno burned at the stake because they questioned God and hence the whole socio-political order. By Isaac Newton's time and in another country, thinkers were encouraged to help explain God's plan and to show his perfection. So Newton and Hooke and Boyle and Halley and Leibniz over in Germany could pursue their whims without persecution. It was very interesting to learn how they used math to solve the mysteries of the world and put the world into perspective. Also how Newton and Leibniz's feud muddied the philosophical and religious waters as each tried to prove how each other's theories minimized God's role in the world while their own elevated him. I think we forget or do not realize how far their world is from ours today, where science is science and God based on your belief. I appreciated Dolnick's writing because he made many modern day comparisons and he is funny. Very interesting book if you can withstand the math."
29,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6790690-dave,4," This book gave me a much better appreciation for the incredible genius of Newton, as well as an appreciation for the genius (and sometimes lunacy) of many of his contemporaries and predecessors. The author also does a good job presenting the cost of Newton's one-mindedness to the exclusion of all other aspects of his life. One of the more interesting aspects of the books is the lesson in the development of the current scientific method which we all take for granted. This ""history of science"" portion is very illuminating to anyone not familiar with the reverence and deference that used to be given to the ancients. The insights into the Royal Society were also very enlightening. While long, I did not feel like the book dragged. There was some repetition/redundancy in the explanation of certain principles, but I think a lot of that was because of my familiarity with the areas discussed, and was probably warranted for the non-scientific/math reader. I also appreciated the relatively short chapters, breaking this book into numerous bite-sized pieces."

The book is a mix of Sir Isaac newton's personality and accomplishments. I always find the mathematical explanation of natural occurrences to be interesting and this book did not disappoint in that regard. For a laic explanation of what was happening in Europe during the late 1600s and early 1700s from a scientific progress standpoint, this book is an excellent introduction."

Even bigger challenge is to interpret all the discoveries through the undeniable religious principles. The book focused mainly on Galileo, Copernicus, Kepler, Newton and Leibniz (Newton being in the center while also leading the London Royal Society for a significant time period). Besides not being able to (or willing to) share or publish his discoveries in simpler words they could not be understood by most men for a very long time, Leibniz discovered similar principles in parallel but published them shortly thereafter in a form that was widely understood and taken into practical use (core principles of calculus). Both men spent very significant time trying to destroy the reputation of each other anonymously. The early scientists during Enlightenment were more like alchemists since besides achieving real scientific breakthroughs they were dealing with a lot of pseudoscience and clear nonsense in today's retrospective. The first quarter of the book created a vivid impression of the way of life on 16-17 century, living conditions in bigger cities were horrible and plague/major fires were common (Newton made his most important discoveries while hiding in his parents farm from a major plague outburst in London). “It’s always the case that history is a tale told by the victors. But the triumph of the scientific worldview has been so complete that we’ve lost more than the losing side’s version of history. We’ve lost the idea that a view different from ours is even possible. Today we take for granted that originality is a word of praise. New strikes us as nearly synonymous with improved. But for nearly all of human history, a new idea was a dangerous idea.”""Chaotic as it looked, these earliest scientists declared, the universe was in fact an intricate and perfectly regulated clockwork. This was the tail-end of Shakespeare's century, and these were brilliant, ambitious, confused, conflicted men. They believed in angels and alchemy and the devil, and they believed that the universe followed precise, mathematical laws."""
38,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19248744-patrick-ross,4,"The Clockwork Universe is the most readable book you'll ever encounter that delves deeply into geometry and calculus. (You didn't tell me there would be math on this test!) But the fact is that you don't have to pay too much attention to his explanation of the mathematics used by Newton and others to calculate how the universe really works; you can if you choose simply enjoy the stories Dolnick tells of the great minds of the 16th and 17th Centuries who changed the way we think about our world.Newton makes the subtitle, and he is the primary character. Fortunately we spend time with a lot of other great minds, because it turns out that Newton was both brilliant and, well, a bit difficult to deal with. We spend some time down in Italy with Galileo (not enough to call this a biography of him, but enough to give us perspective on Newton's accomplishment), more time than I would have expected with Kepler (and that was fascinating, so learn about a man who gained so many insights from pursuing the wrong assumptions), and many of Newton's Royal Society peers, including his bitter rival Hooke. (You know that famous line of Newton's that he was ""standing on the shoulders of giants""? That rare moment of expressed humility by Newton was actually meant as a public insult of Hooke, who was a short hunchback.)The book tells some great stories and educates the lay reader effectively. It wasn't always clear, however, what the intent of the author was in the book's organization. Netwon appears and disappears in the book, much like Shrodinger's imaginary cat. There's a lot of build-up at the beginning about the Royal Society, but that group disappears for chapters as well, and it's never really made clear exactly how central it was to this scientific revolution (frankly, it seems that for decades at a time it was just a place for learned men to slip away from their wives for a night). These are small criticisms, however. In one chapter in the middle of the book, Dolnick (for this reader, anyway) captured what the glue was that is meant to hold his book together.Aristotle's writings locked in place the approach of scientists for the next two thousand years; that approach was (and I'm paraphrasing Dolnick here) to observe the world and explain why things behaved the way they did. The scientists of Netwon's era, largely through the use of mathematics, told us what was actually happening, but didn't try to apply motives. Aristotle says a falling rock speeds to the ground because it has a longing to return to its natural place. Newton says it falls to the ground because of gravity. Dolnick does a great job of getting us to understand just how mind-boggling the changes of that period were, from accepting a Copernican universe of the Earth revolving around the sun to actually calculating that orbit and how gravity drives it, just as the moon's gravitational pull drives the tides.There's another theme that slides in and out of Dolnick's book. I think he intended it to be a primary theme, but it comes and goes (again like a relativistic cat). That theme was the piety of most scientists of this age. Newton felt his quest to explain the clockwork universe was a way to pay homage to God. His fellow calculus inventor, Gottfried Leibniz (and that is a fascinating rivalry) squared off because Leibniz believed that Newton was blaspheming God by suggesting he had nothing to do because the universe worked so well, while Newton claimed God still had to pull the levers of the universe to keep gravity working, which suggested the Almighty wasn't capable of engineering a world that didn't require regular maintenance. Dolnick points out that both would have been horrified to know that the continued advancement of science would open the door for people arguing there must not be a God.The Clockwork Universe is a great book on science and mathematics for a layman. It contains moments of wry humor and patient explanations. The chapters are short, with intriguing titles. And you'll find yourself seeking out friends to tell them all of the fascinating things you've learned."
39,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3777762-j-s,4,"Science and religion are often at odds in today's highly polarized and contentious world, each sneeringly scornful and antagonistic toward the other. Yet that relationship was very different when some of the greatest leaps of scientific understanding occurred. Edward Dolnick gives us excellent and readable biographical profiles of the greats like Galileo and Kepler, Leibniz and Newton as well others who were instrumental in the birth of modern science. He says ""Newton's intent in all his work was to make men more pious and devout, more reverent in the face of God's creation. His aim was not that men rise to their feet in freedom but that they fall to their knees in awe."" (pg 308) But this book is about much more than just the religious thoughts of some of history's greatest thinkers. It also profiles the world they lived in, from the superstitions and diseases the people faced to the unsanitary conditions that produced such maladies (and pity those who had access to the doctors!). And it humanizes them (most were pretty ill-tempered) even though they had talents we can only dream of. It also seeks to convey - in layman's terms - a basic understanding of the principles and truths discovered by these geniuses, and why they were so earth-changing. I read a significant amount of history and you get used to a certain format when opening a book, a format that conveys a certain seriousness. So I was surprised (and even a little disappointed, too) when I saw the larger and heavier font more typical of pulp fiction. But in spite of that it's a very interesting read, particularly for those of us who aren't as familiar with the history of these men or their discoveries. Actually, (as Dolnick points out) we're more familiar with them than we realize and this book excels not only in pointing out how momentous the discoveries were but also in presenting them in a way that those of us who struggled with physics in high school can follow (or almost follow, and I'll admit my head started to spin when he discussed time and distance and infinity and all those other things that sometimes made math classes unpleasant). The chapters are short and easy to read and understand, in addition to being highly interesting and hard to put down. And it's an excellent overview for those of us not intimately familiar with the science or the period. It's insightful and does it all in a way that shouldn't offend either side in today's debates. "
40,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15617900-sarah,5,"Probably my favorite non-fiction read since Devil and the White City. The Clockwork Universe tackles an ambitious amount of material and with it oversimplifies a lot in favor of saving space and selling his point, but in the end it touches on so many subjects that the overarching approach is what makes it manageable. This is a book that sets out to show the dichotomy of seventeenth century scientists who were devoted to both religion and scientific endeavors. While many may be frustrated with the lack of detail to the full religious climate of the time, this is not Dolnick’s focus, but the science itself. As a history of scientific advancement and a demonstration of the transition of science from untested theory to transformative laws and mathematical rules, this book greatly excels in capturing the importance and wonders of those transitions. Dolnick does play up the chaos of the time period, exposing quaint and extreme antidotes such as a physician who used dried human excrement to treat glaucoma. However, I don’t think that this was intended to be a representation of the period as a whole, but to point out that without the scientific method and current scientific understanding items like this were possible. These antidotes are chosen to highlight the advancement that would follow and show the full impact that these would produce. And in that they succeed.I appreciate Dolnick’s tackling such a broad subject and doing so without judgment of those involved. I share his fascination for this time period and the intrigue of those men who held such certainty in both science and religion as well as other forms of the occult. I was a little disappointed more time was not given to Newton’s enthusiasm for alchemy as it is said that he wrote more on it than any other field he studied, and I found some of his conclusions on subjects to differ from other sources, but overall he spins a tale of incredible growth, the imagination of geniuses and the somewhat tragic fate of these great minds that their desire to prove the existence of God would ultimately lead to a scientific understanding that our universe runs so perfectly on its own that a god figure is not needed. "
41,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2420980-bill,4,"Delnick provides an interesting and well written history of the development of modern science by such famous men as Galileo, Descartes, Kepler, Newton and Leibniz. These men lived in the 1600s when life was brutal. Life expectancy was 30; child mortality was rampant; garbage, including human waste, was piled high in cities; people washed, if at all, once per year; and plagues killed thousands. Men also believed that God punished people for their sins in fiery hell but He was also the creator of an orderly universe based on mathematics, a clockwork universe.Galileo developed the telescope and committed heresy by claiming the earth rotated around the sun. Church dogma was that the reverse, the sun rotated around the earth. In addition, by observing a ball rolling down a marked plane, he described acceleration. Equally importantly, he established the concept that theories could be tested by rigorous experimentation and observation.The Royal Society was founded in November, 1660 in London. Continuing Galileo’s insight, the Society believed that proof of concepts must be shown. Kepler proved that planets rotated around the sun in ellipses not circles.Isaac Newton, born in 1642 the same year of Galileo’s death, is Delnick’s principle scientist/mathematician. Many consider Newton to the greatest scientific genius of all time, including Einstein. Newton had few instruments and developed his findings through intense and unrelenting thought. Among his findings were the description of gravity (the famous but perhaps mythical apple), the development of calculus and laws of motion. Newton built upon Descartes’ graphs or Cartesian coordinates. Historians argue about whether Newton or Leibniz was the first to develop calculus. What is agreed upon is that each worked independently and each developed his use of calculus on his own. Delnick describes, at too much length the long quarrel between the two.An outstanding feature of The Clockwork Universe is the description of how calculus was developed. Historical approaches to the math may be more usefl that out and out math textbooks. "
42,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2046067-scott-killen,3,"This was a very interesting book, describing all of the factors that led to our current understanding of science and the world around us.My pleasure was somewhat stayed by the author's conclusion in the final chapter that modern scientists have proven that the modern world is no place for God. No proof is provided and, the book's presentation in prior chapters makes it clear that the laws of science are not qualified to prove or disprove the existence of God.René Descartes, the first thinker to provide a philosophical framework for modern science, attempts to arrive at a fundamental set of principles that one can know as true without any doubt. Descartes' conclusion ""cogito ergo sum"" (English: ""I think, therefore I am""), or thought cannot be separated from me, therefore, I exist, is seen as the first stepping stone to our current understanding of science...yet this viewpoint also describes the fundamental limitation of science, namely that science is limited by human senses and the boundaries of human thought.It is true that men carrying the name of Jesus murdered and tortured scientists out of ignorance and insecurity. It is true that scientists' religious beliefs often caused them to make missteps and quarrels amongst themselves. However, these facts, contrary to the book's conclusions, are not logically sound proofs against the existence of God, but instead address the fallibility of man.The limits placed on science by its base philosophy voiced by Descartes prohibit it from proving or disproving God. The only logical conclusion an honest scientist can make about the existence of God is that if he exists, he is not quantifiable by human observations and measurements, regardless of the amount of thought focused on the problem. Ironically, this is exactly what Paul says regarding God in 1 Corinthians 1:25: ""For the foolishness of God is wiser than man's wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than man's strength."" "
43,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/554479-tinav,4,"The 1600s were fascinating (the first thing I learned from this book). It's a time at which religion and alchemy began to give way to the more modern scientific methods and thinking we take for granted today.Isaac Newton was (forgive me) a Royal Pain (the second thing I learned from this book), possibly the most brilliant mathematician, physicist, and thinker in history but also a paranoid egomaniac. It's funny to read about now, how he wrote up all of his findings in hundreds of journals, in codes he invented to foil rivals, and nearly never shared with the Society of which he was eventually named president. But was hell on his colleagues and admirers.Which led to one of the most bitter feuds in all of science, because Newton and Gottfried Leibnitz separately invented calculus to explain the natural world, only the more talkative Leibnitz published his findings first. (The third thing I learned from this book.) The result was something like you'd see today on reality television; for many years, a lot of surface talk signifying admiration and respect, but underneath, snarky comments about the rival along the scientific lines, equivalent to ""your mother wears combat boots.""There are 20 more interesting things I could mention learning from this book, but I'll leave them for others to read about. Truly entertaining narrative. My only caveat would be, that you may not appreciate all of the math detailed in the book unless you recall your high school geometry and algebra fairly well, not to mention your beginning calculus. I studied math up until second level Calc in college, and was fair at it, but I don't think well in the language of mathematics and gave it up.Still, the book left me with a profound appreciation for people who DO think brilliantly in said language."
44,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5422600-kristi-thielen,5,"Concise, crystal clear look at the great scientists of the 17th century (principally Newton) and the cultural environment in which they labored.The religion devotion of the scientists and how it hemmed in even the most gifted, is fascinating. Witness Newton straining to support his belief that the ancient wisemen (Moses, Solomon, Pythagoras) all understood the science of Newton's day, including the concept of gravity, but that the wisdom had been lost to time. And when ""rediscovered"" by the Greeks or Egyptians, it was written about in coded language to keep it from the reach of ""the unworthy"".Why insist upon such a silly notion? Because it suited 17th century beliefs that the world was in a decline, leading to the day of judgment; because the idea of someone discovering something ""new"" was considered an offense to God, the creator. If Newton really didn't discover the concept of gravity - if it really was ancient wisdom - he couldn't be criticized for engaging in work that offended God. Newton's long-ranging feud with the eccentric Gottfried Leibniz is detailed, as is the role genial astronomer Edmund Halley played in shepherding Newton's masterpiece, Principia, into print. Good science and good stories! And, hey: was Newton really as unfathomable as we've been told? Dolnick says no - Newton was WAY more unfathomable than that, and then explains why. (Or does the best any human CAN to explain why.) Dolnick is an American with a fresh and witty writing style which employs modern cultural references that are unexpected, enjoyable and make his subject more accessible. Well worth reading. "
45,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1876124-bonnie,5,"Brilliant book. I am always searching for history books that read like novels, and this is one of those. Historical figures like Leibniz and Newton were like richly textured characters that I felt I knew. The history parts were brill, and certainly worth reading this book for.The only downside is that Dolnick tries to teach me math. Hahaha, no one can succeed at that! I mean, if anyone could, it would be Dolnick. He simplifies things beautifully and provides startlingly good analogies. Unfortunately, I don't understand math at a conceptual level and don't care to even try.This really is more a History of Math book than anything else. And I can understand why it isn't advertised as such; I would never have picked up a book with ""History of Math"" in the title. But, as I said, even as someone as fiercely dense about math as me can love this book. If you love math, great, read it all. If you stoutly ignored the parts of geometry where you had to write proofs to show yourself why math equations actually work (and why would I care? I will accept on blind faith that the Pythagorean Theorem works and why shouldn't I?) then just skim the math bits and concentrate on the absorbing history. "
46,006171951X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1811588-ambrosia,4,"I had some trepidation in starting this book. Straight mathematics has never been my strong suit - I'm great at applications and concepts, but the degrees of abstraction necessary for purely numerical proofs always makes my head hurt. Fortunately, however, while there's a certain amount of space dedicated to mathematics, the author does a wonderful job explaining how it ties into reality, and (especially) how the abstraction and simplification was necessary to understanding the somewhat messier real world - now that's a message I can get behind! I also loved that it spent a lot of time on the personalities behind the proofs, and how these scientists' very human natures both drove them to discover these principles on which our entire modern understanding of the universe is based, and drove them to fight with each other. (I found it particularly heartening to see how Newton and Leibniz's continual sniping over who invented calculus was every bit as vicious and prolonged as the social media battles we see today - and yet they still made great scientific progress.) Well worth the read to anyone interested in history, mathematics, or how the fundamentals of scientific thinking were formed."

Anyway, Dolnick does several things really wonderfully - he tries to put the reader into the mentality of the era, then he explores what it took the discover/invent Calculus, then covers the Newton-Leibniz wars over who invented calculus, which Newton won in the most bastardly of ways, then what it took to be Newton and come up Principia, and just how out there Newton was. There are several interesting inclusion. One conclusion summed in a quote by ""a NASA climatologist"", ""Newton may have been an ass, but the theory of gravity still works."" Another highlights how the hyper-religious & religiously-driven Newton essentially took God out of the physical universe by making God unnecessary. (And how Leibniz did too, in his own way. He was also very religious) A side note at the end is that this stuff in the scientific revolution leads to the American Revolution. I should also point out that Dolnick does not appear to use many primary sources, which is OK considering what he doing here. But, wow, his secondary sources make up an absolutely wonderful list of books published over the last 50 years."

And through reading this book I was able to relive and re-enjoy that ""Eureka!"" moment I experienced as a college student taking my first Calculus class, when suddenly I had an insight into what calculus was and why it worked the way it did that informed the entirely of the rest of my scientific/mathematical education. Those of you are are wary of math, have no fear...the concepts of great ideas are explored but there are no complex equations to sort through in this text. I very much enjoyed reading Mr. Dolnick's ideas about why some seemingly simple scientific or mathematical concepts did not occur to ancient geniuses...and why no doubt some have still not occurred to modern geniuses that future generations will marvel that we could have missed."

Dolnick sets up brilliantly the scientific world of that time, leading us on a journey to one of the greatest discoveries in science at that time. He explores physics and mathematics in a way that is never boring and is compelling to read.This is the book I wish I had read before reading Stephenson's Baroque Cycle.

Anyone who knows me knows that I am all but innumerate. I admit that much of the mathematics went over my head - but the book is so written that I was able to glean the gist of it all anyway. I am sure a knowledge of calculus would produce a deeper understanding, but that won't happen in my lifetime.Attitudes toward experimentation and observation are just another reason why I really do not worship the past. The dialectic between religion and science has not really seemed to change much, unfortunately, over the centuries.Finally, just because someone is a genius doesn't mean that he is someone I might want to know.

It was just a little hard to wade through some of it.I'm not what I would call a ""sciency"" person, but I do love ideas, and this is a great bridge for someone like me. The language is a little over the average person's head at a few points, but overall, it's very accessible. This would be a great way to interest a very bright butlanguage-centered high schooler in Newton and advanced science, I think, and it certainly broadens the understanding of history during that time.

Difficult scientic concepts are explained lucidly. Dolnick has a great sense of humor, and is quick to remind us that some of the great scientists also had some perfectly absurd ideas. He also demonstrates that the great scientists were not all crypto-atheists as many contemporary scientists would have us believe. The most memorable passage concerned someone questioning the astronomer Arthur Eddington whether there truly were just three people in the world who understood relativity theory. After a long reflective pause, Eddington replied, ""I'm trying to think of who the third person is."" "

The reclusive, Bible-thumping genius and his crossing swords with Hooke and Leibnitz, just pure theater. And in many ways, this book capitalizes on Sir Isaac's peculiarities but there's much more, such as virtual tours of the Bubonic plague and the seriously plain King George. Truthfully, I enjoyed the book, as a form of fictionalized history but in the end came away angry, as if leaving the carnival where I lost my shirt at the hoops. It crossed a line somewhere, at least the one between 3 and 5 stars.  "

I am somewhat dismayed to find that the famous Newton quote about standing on the shoulders of giants may have been a slight dig at another scientist, instead of an acknowledgement of the iterative nature of discovery.Although, I have read many books about Newton, and I have to say that the acerbic interpretation does fit a little better than a starry eyed thank you to previous scientists."

The book is rich in its description of the time and the people. They're messy, petty, and often vindictive and they believed in God. In short, this book blows the doors off of about every assumption held on the matter, and the real story turns out to be a whole lot more interesting."

[audiobook via audible.com] . . . the fascinating story of a series of lonely geniuses (e.g., Sir Isaac Newton; Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz) trying to decode ""God's creation"" . . . but the more they revealed a mathematically predicable ""clockwork universe,"" free from any deity's meddling, the more uncomfortable some of them became... a fascinating historical tale, demonstrating how truly modern thinking evolved in the 17th century."
