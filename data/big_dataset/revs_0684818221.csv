0,0684818221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1323157-keith,4,"One of the better popular-science books I've ever read, and certainly the best I've read recently. Well written, engaging, and well-referenced, it not only improved my understanding of General Relativity, but made the very concept of time—both in terms of the experience of its flow and it's scientific sense as a dimension of unified spacetime—both clearer and more diffuse: what is time after all? How can it even be defined in any meaningful way? These questions may seem ridiculous on their face, as time is measured by every clock. But what exactly is that clock measuring, and how? Once you start scratching at that surface understanding, one finds rather little substance holding it up.Naturally, I will go on to use this as a further justification of my habit of procrastination. Eventually."

If you are looking for a reference to understand the big bang theory, black holes, spacetime ...etc .. this book is a great start for you! It is such an informative book and it's formulated to be understood by non-specialists."
2,0684818221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12447371-john-dolan,4,"Anyone embarking on the task of producing a book on the nature of time aimed at the general reader, had better have (1) a sound technical grasp of his subject; and (2) the ability to communicate complex ideas in an accessible way. Fortunately, Paul Davies possesses both these skills in spades. For sure, there are some sections that require a high degree of concentration (for this dummy anyway), but that’s probably unavoidable given the subject matter. However, this didn’t stop me reading the whole book in a relatively short time (and, yes, that is an Einstein joke).It made me keen to explore not only other works by Paul Davies, but also more technical writings on time – and surely there’s no greater praise you can bestow on a popular science book than that."
3,0684818221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7915393-simon-mcleish,4,"Originally published on my blog here in January 2000.About Time is an eminently readable popular account of the current ideas about time in physics, with a short historical section examining philosophical perceptions of time from the ancient Greeks to the time of Newton. The main concerns of the book are to explain the role played by time in the keystones of modern physics, general relativity and quantum mechanics. Since much of physics is concerned with processes, time can be used as a single theme to motivate a discussion of many of the more interesting aspects of modern physics.The nature of time and its role in the cosmos also lie at the heart of some of the unsolved problems of physics, many people thinking that these issues will provide the key to the next generation of physical theories. Most prominent among these is the asymmetry of time, a major problem when underlying theories would be unchanged if time ran backward rather than forward. In slightly different areas, issues of human perception of time are briefly touched upon as well as what exactly we might be measuring with different kinds of clocks.The descriptions of relativistic and quantum effects are now the commonplace of popular physics, and the most interesting parts were those dealing with more unusual matters, such as the nature of the interior of black holes or the asymmetry in kaon decay. The device of having a second voice used as a sceptic to facilitate the discussion is slightly annoying but not a big problem."
4,0684818221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2648205-white,5,"In the spirit of Shrodinger's cat, this book talks about paradoxes in a humorous light. Taking what Davies believes is unfinished business of Einstein, he throws out endless possibilities of what doesn't make sense. Intriguing as it is, we are missing some elements in knowing things that can answer all the questions we have and can turn the paradoxes into sense.Davies tackles this with this read. It's fascinating."
5,0684818221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37756150-jenn,5,"I have never had a Physics or Astronomy course in my life nor have I previously read any other books on the subject matter. Dr. Davies made no assumptions about the background of his audience and was able to explain concepts in such a way that I was able to move through the book without back tracking and whilst retaining a good portion of the material. The flow was impeccable. I plan to reread this book in a few months. Thank you, Dr. Davies!"
6,0684818221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51664350-paul-weiss,4,"Did the universe come into existence with time or in time?Whether one addresses questions regarding the duration, the existence, the direction or the meaning of time - then, now, before, after, past, present and future - from the point of view of the mathematics of multi-dimensional differential geometry, the physics of special and general relativity or quantum mechanics, meta-physics, religion, or purely philosophy, there can be no doubt that a full and complete understanding of the nature of time is the single biggest roadblock to the development of that holy grail of science, the Theory of Everything. Indeed, even the often strained acceptance of the Big Bang Theory, which is currently the most widely (but far from universally) accepted version of orthodoxy to explain the “beginning” of the universe hinges on a grotesquely incomplete and poorly understood conceptualization of time.Paul Davies' extended essay on the current state of understanding of the meaning time is elegantly written, lucid, and, at once, head-scratching, provocative and awe-inspiring. But it’s not lightweight stuff that lends itself to scanning and high-speed reading, by any means. In fact, I had to read some sections several times in order to gather even a basic understanding. On the other hand, Davies’ explanation of special relativity’s time dilation and the weird symmetry of Twins’ Paradox, for example, was the best, the clearest and the simplest to understand of any popular physics book that I’d read in my entire life. I was also thrilled to learn of the subtlety of treating the Big Bang as a boundary to time as opposed to an event that happened IN time!If you’re a complete beginner to the ideas of cosmology and modern physics, ABOUT TIME is probably not a place for you to begin your journey. On the other hand, if you’ve got a basic grasp of the fundamental ideas of special and general relativity and quantum mechanics and you’re a fan of popular science reading (think Stephen Hawking, Michio Kaku, Neil deGrasse Tyson or Brian Greene, for example), then ABOUT TIME certainly deserves a place on your reading schedule. Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"
7,0684818221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8452002-david-olmsted,4,"Paul Davies has for a long time been one of my favorite general physics writers and he does a very good job here. I only have two minor quibbles. The first is probably due to his editor telling him not to use equations but it has to do his explanation of why space and time make an inseparable space-time. The reason is a certain quantity involving both is an invariant under any sort of change like like volume is an invariant when an object is moved. That quantity is ""ct squared - x squared"" where t is a time interval, x is a spatial distance interval and c is the velocity of light in a vacuum (this is what Minkowski discovered). Davies mentions and many have noticed that this would be the distance formula ""ct squared = x square + ? squared"" if only we know what ""?"" was. It is as if we only perceive a shadow of some ultimate invariant change reality just like an object volume will cast its shadow on a wall as it is moved.My other concern is his claim that time does not exist prior to the Big Bang. While the relativity equations show that space-time and matter are linked such that if one goes to 0 so does the other that does not preclude a more general time-like change reality. One would seem to be needed because every sudden impulse event like the Big Bang has some backwash which takes away its cause otherwise it would just keep on happening. If water breaks a dam the water flows away, if a neural threshold is crossed creating an action potential it generates an inhibitory backwash signal. Finally, physics can not yet explain every low energy phenomena as exemplified by the existence of our conscious sensations. These uncertainties should give one pause before making such broad claims that nothing exists prior to the Big Bang."
8,0684818221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1036274-rmn,3,"A perfectly good book on time using Einstein and Einstein's theory of relativity to explain how time is relative and how our perception of time is incorrect in many ways. The author, Paul Davies, seeks to illuminate questions such as whether time flows in one direction, whether time is it's own dimension, whether time existed before the big bang (or whether the big bang happened), whether time travel is possible, and whether time exists at the singularity of a black hole. Davies uses physics, quantum mechanics, and Einstein's notion of space-time among other things to explore these questions and lay out what physicists have learned and know regarding time. It is reasonably well written and fairly easy to understand for non-science people, though Davies does explain some technical quantuim mechanics. The only real issue I had with the book was that is was written in 1995 and it seems like the science has moved forward quite a bit since then. For instance, Brian Greene's The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality which was published in 2005, takes this book at least a couple of steps further. So I do find it ironic that a book about the relativity of time is a bit outdated. Oh yeah, one nit to pick. Several times in the book, Davies went off on a tangent and then wrote something like, ""if you want to learn more about this, read my book ""XYZ"""" (or whatever the book's name). I found that annoying and classless. Don't market to me in the middle of a book. You know what Einstein (or Einstein theory explainer)? If i like you're writing, I'll seek out your other books, I don't need you upselling me mid chapter.  "
9,0684818221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56337414-lora-milton,5,"Paul Davis is one of those names that people who read about time travel theory get to know well. The description says:""This is a book about the meaning of time, what it is, when it has started, how it flows and where to. It examines the consequences of Einstein's theory of relativity and offers startling suggestions about what recent research may reveal.""This about sums it up. Davies takes us through a rabbit hole of fascinating theory and current knowledge of related Physics that is easy to follow, if mind-bending in its content.He extrapolates on relativity and explores concepts of worm holes and time warps, sharing some of his own experiences of visiting research sites discussing various theories about time travel.If this is a subject you're interested in, this is one of the books you really need to read. Davies keeps it accessible for the non-Physicist and holds interest on what is a very academic subject."
10,0684818221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1218087-gabriel-joseph,4,"For those of us who couldnt grasp quantum physics or physics itself in school, this book is a joy. After I read this book I saw existence, time and my reality forever changed. "
11,0684818221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114030847-passeriform,0,"I bought this book in 1999, as I graduated from college; somehow I never quite got around to reading it until this month, over a decade later. So I've hauled it from home to home and state to state, through a Ph.D. program and childbearing and all sorts of other changes. I'm glad I finally read it.About Time is engaging and thought provoking. That Ph.D. is in English literature, so I am ill-positioned to comment on the quality of the science and analysis here (aka, is it true/correct/accurate?). And I'm sure the going knowledge about time within physics has changed a ton while that poor little paperback sat on my bookshelf and in various boxes. But what I wanted--and what I got--was a book that would raise interesting questions about how time works and about what my own experience in/of time means. (And nudge along my teensy but fascinated understanding of (post)modern physics.) The book also expresses fascination with the universe and time and their quirks, which I dig.A few annoyances: the author compulsively encourages readers to seek out his other books. Dude, that's what endnotes are for--if they're where you mention OTHER people's relevant work, that where you mention YOURS. More substantively, I was often taken aback at Davies's assumption that it's so great we exist--that we're so lucky to be here--that 'fortunately for us' such-and-such happened to make human life / sentience / etc. possible. If we weren't here, how would that be experienced as a misfortune? I like being alive as much as the next person, but that line of reasoning feels oddly human-centric and unfounded (irrational?) to me. Finally, I find it depressing to read a book whose narrative about knowledge creation is entirely about men but doesn't acknowledge that. I'm finding myself admiring women in physics and other male-dominated fields even more, though :)"
12,0684818221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20687424-dan,5,"A very pleasant science book for noon scientists.I really enjoyed it.I'm aware of latest science advance, without being a scientist myself. Meaning that i get the ideas, and i can understand new concepts if enough explained. Calculations are not for me.I do not agree with the many universe interpretations, but i still elbowed the book.There are not many books about the conceot of time. Actually this is the only one i could find. Excepting Einstein"
13,0684818221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61138703-george-eraclides,4,"A well written book on the concept of time as it has developed, with a special emphasis on Einstein's space-time and relativity theory. Another plus for this work is that it is philosophically literate - a very rare attribute for scientists who often just don't get philosophy or are so consumed by arrogance as to believe they can make it up as they go along, something they would never do in their scientific work. A very thoughtful book as has become a Paul Davies standard."
14,0684818221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55559654-eric-hollister,4,"Probably more of a 3.5. Although it is a bit dated, I found this book quite interesting, and it helped me understand Einstein's Theory of Relativity and it's relation to perceptions of time (as well as other theories and operations). I must admit, however, that the last third of the book lost me. I imagine that is more my fault than the authors."
15,0684818221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61946917-lawrence,2,"There were a few interesting parts, but I felt that it was not worth the time I spent with it. "
16,0684818221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60261117-kiridaren-jayakumar,5,An excellent book that we all should read because everyone of us are affected by time. Knowing time should be made a necessity.

19,0684818221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40590836-ami-iida,4,"the theme of the book is ""What is time?"".It's the physical and philosophy theme."
20,0684818221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12817686-onyango-makagutu,4,"Whatever time is, is really confusing. Just now, it occurred to me while reading this book that we don't have an organ for time. Is inane in us?"
21,0684818221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112384319-bill,4,This book has it all. Great read. 
22,0684818221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1410379-armand,4,"Previous to reading Paul Davies' About Time, I had seen a few documentaries (like PBS' Fabric of the Cosmos) on astrophysics and Time, so I was aware of the some of the fundamentals, but About Time really helped me get a formal grasp of the whole picture of Time (which- it turns out- might not exist at all).Davies does a nice job of building sections/ chapters around specific questions that amateurs like me might want to see addressed (like :""Is time a physical process?""; ""Can time ever run backwards?""; ""Are there particles that can move faster than light?""; ""Is time travel possible?""; or ""What was around before the Big Bang?"") Davies then does his best to give us the philosophical and scientific underpinning of current thought on the topic (and when possible- he gives us information on current experimentation). I really appreciate just how accessible Davies' writing is. His prose isn't littered with technical jargon- so it's approachable- but he also respects his layman readers and does not dumb his ideas down. And he's also not afraid of an occasional poetic turn-of-phrase.In addition to reporting on science and theory, Davies also does a nice job of studying the history of thought on Time, moving from the religious, to the mystical, to the philosophical, to (finally) the scientific. Within the context of the history of science, he further breaks down thoughts and belief into the ""Newtonian Era"", Einstein's revolutionary ideas, and post-Einstein development. His approach to history is thoughtful and respectful, and I like that he respects those with religious and mystical convictions.Personally, I don't recommend reading About Time quickly, or trying to wolf it all down in a few sittings (like you might a novel) because the book requires a certain level of concentration. Many of the passages invite you imagine that you are watching tiny, subatomic particles bouncing around in complex patterns. And while these descriptions are often accompanied by figures or charts, it still took me a while to wrap my brain around the concepts. Therefore, I recommend slow, deliberate and gentle reading, so as to give these concepts a chance to wash over you.Another great thing about this book is that it introduced me the best-named subatomic particle ever: ""the anti-strange anti-quark""!Overall, I highly recommend this book to people who have a hunger to learn more about the intricacies of time-space and relativity."
23,0684818221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66709-daniel,3,"This alternatively enlightened me, confused me, and terrified me: no mean feat for a science book. While I find the author's style to be good enough, I do feel that he doesn't always succeed in his primary mission, which is to explain the concepts in a layman's enough way. About half of what I understand was intelligible because I already have some exposure to physics and to these specific topics, but I fear would've been over the head for a more casual reader (though who knows if such a person would bother picking it up in the first place). Once it moved into certain quantum mechanical subjects and certain philosophical cum physical digressions (of which there were many toward the end), I found myself struggling to keep up.Over all, this is a fine book, but the author is neither engaging enough nor does he have a sufficiently humble notion of the non-specialist reader (at least in my opinion) to rate more highly."
24,0684818221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6934307-sam-eccleston,4,"This is an extremely interesting book. The scientific content is explained clearly and in simple terms, but when it comes to drawing philosophical conclusions from the available data the work would benefit from significantly longer discussion of what concepts like 'time' actually mean. Often, conclusions are drawn about 'time' but the concept is never adequately defined. Thus, it sometimes seems as if the author is eschewing the concept altogether, but a closer reading reveals that in fact only one aspect of time, such as 'objective periods of duration' (as opposed to 'chronological order' or 'simultaneity') is in fact being discarded. This lack of clarity about what exactly it is about time which doesn't fit in the picture provided by modern physics significantly impairs the ability of the reader to draw any useful conclusions from the work, interesting as it is."
25,0684818221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6967393-nicholas,4," The author writes in a comprehensible manner that is both engaging and informative that leaves you wanting to read more of his work.The book is mainly dedicated to the modern history of Physics with a bit of Cognitive Psychology thrown in towards the end.I found he elucidates theories very thoroughly and does not shy away from giving examples from several different viewpoints on the same process. Even though this book is a few years older than ones I had read recently in the same area,it still remains a valid treatise on the subject and not many of the factual elements are in need of revision."
26,0684818221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1165075-tim,3,"An interesting if somewhat dry read on the concept of time. Does the universe have a beginning and an end? Is time an illusion? Can we travel backward in time? Some of the passages will give you those ""I never thought of it that way"" moments; others seemed better suited for a scientific journal. But the history is enjoyable, and there are light moments. For example:There was a young lady named Brightwhose speed was far faster than light;She set out one day, in a relative way,and returned on the previous night."
27,0684818221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7220104-tyson,4,"A very interesting book that gives an overview of time as it relates to philosophy, Einstein's theory of relativity, quantum physics and human consciousness. Though many of these subjects are very complex, Davies discusses them in a manner that is understandable without oversimplifying things. I'd highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys talking about time in any context."
28,0684818221,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28609846-larry-gerovac,5,Thought provoking. You will never look at time the same... it's all relative. Love the way Paul Davies writes to his target audience. Davies explains the link between light and gravity in simple everyday terms. As he moves through history you get a glimpse of how different scientists perceived time in their own field of study. Very well written. Best of all- no math required.
