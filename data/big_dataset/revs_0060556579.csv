1,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7344787-arleen-jenson,2,"Coming out of pre-veterinary medicine and a slew of genetics classes, I can say that nothing in this book is particularly mind-blowing... except the hubris. The author has drawn up a laundry list of assumptions about all of humanity and left out a good deal of its subjects. As a scientist or, at the very least, as a lover of science... the references were interesting enough to keep me reading. But as someone with sexual awareness, a hesitancy to polarize gender and sexuality, and my own idea of what a woman might think or want... this was a very difficult book to swallow. In fact, it's akin to dry Kool-Aid.If you are satisfied with the hetero-normative, monogamous, anglo, male-dominated definitions of sex and partnership (and if you are going to read this book as popular literature rather than as complete and well-founded scientific conjecture) go right ahead. It's a fun book.But if you are someone who is easily irritated by flawed logic and narrow surveys used to prop up wobbly theorizing, skip it.The good news is: Ridley doesn't care. As all great scientists do, he spent a good deal of time throwing his name in with philosophers, sociologists, and naturalists and saying that he, too, was capable of flaws. Just like them! Moreover, he expects a lot backlash from the less-thans who can't comprehend the magnitude of his reasoning. So go ahead and say that you don't like his book. Ridley is one step ahead of you. He knows you're coming; you predictable sap. Despite that lovely manipulation, I still didn't like it. It gets two stars for all of the awesome material his book used (badly) and referenced."
2,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4582869-katja,2,"What could have shaped the human mind is an endlessly interesting subject, no question about that. Speculating about contributions of the genes, nature, nurture, culture is fun, as much as getting a new perspective on what has always seemed ""obvious"". Still, I did not like this book as much as I probably would, had it a bit less of sheer speculations. Some readers praise Ridley for objectively presenting to them so many different and often contradictory theories. When discussions are heated, it is indeed a virtue. But flaws in some of the ""theories"" are evident even before the argument is over, so why include those if a few paragraphs later Ridley admits that the theory does sound pretty wrong? An example: attractiveness of slender women nowadays supposedly signalizes their wealth because not every woman can afford a healthy diet. Furthermore, certain claims are given as well-known widely accepted facts while they may not even be true. One example is Chomsky's hypotheses about Universal Grammar and language innateness. It is far from true that all linguists agree with Chomsky. Pinker, whom Ridley cites a few times, surely does but there are more linguists in the world. Another example: neural networks have recently had a huge comeback, researchers have very big hopes for ""deep learning"". Obviously Ridley dismissed them as incapable of learning far too early. A few times I was wondering where Ridley got his facts from. For example, describing ""highly sexed emperors"" he states that the ancient civilizations we know of were all ruled exclusively by ruthless men with hundreds of wives and thousands of children (mostly sons). One of his examples is Akhenaten who in fact is known as a loving husband and father of a dozen of children. There are numerous depictions of him playing with his daughters. Also, apparently Ridley never heard of successful female pharaohs. His knowledge of the ancient civilizations seems to be based on a cartoon about an evil pharaoh and his poor slaves.Finally, what annoyed me most is the plasticity of Ridley's ""evolutionary"" arguments. If there is a trait which he states is characteristic of modern men, he simply says that it was obviously advantageous for males in the past. Usually he throws in a thought experiment or some bizarre example from the animal world and off to the next section and a new trait. But this is not what is needed to prove a hypothesis. First, the trait may be not as characteristic of men as he wants it to look like. For example, he says ""boys are better in math than girls"", or ""girls are better in linguistic tasks"" although even at his time there were studies showing that it very much depends on how boys and girls are treated at elementary school. In fact there are countries where girls are better in math (Iceland). Second, for a evolutionary argument to apply, there must be a gene, so why not name it right away? Third, why should this particular gene be gender-specific, why wouldn't it reveal its power in the other gender too? Wouldn't men benefit from better language skills (something he claims women are better at)? I doubt so. Finally, if the gene has not yet been discovered, why not show a mathematical model which would at least demonstrate that the benefit of the trait is real and would affect the reproductive success of its carrier. What happened with females who were not so eloquent? Were they and their children killed by better versed women? Surely I do see a benefit in being a good talker and I can imagine why this quality could be more important for women than men, but it still does not explain why this supposedly genetic trait should propagate. There is a big difference between ""soft skills"" and traits like ""fear the snakes"" or ""lactose tolerance"" for which reproductive advantage is obvious. To summarize, an interesting read but with far too many annoying errors, logical flaws and sloppy arguments."
3,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897899-jason,4,"Well, I had hoped to write this review closer to having read the book, but I'll write this anyway, just without some of the examples I was hoping to remember.Roughly the first 1/2 to 2/3 of the books covers the different explanations for why sex arose and the mating habits of various non-human species. One thing that is great about this book is it will relate a theory, then an insufficiency in the theory, then a counter theory, then additional findings, and back and forth and so on. If there isn't a consensus it just leaves the question open and for you to ponder yourself. For anyone interested in how science is done, numerous examples ideas blossoming, be attacked, rediscovered, etc. are recounted. Also, lots of different case studies are recounted. All the stories of different species behavior is entertaining in and of itself.In the last part of the book, humans are closely examined. As long as you repeatedly the disclaimer at the beginning of that section, that you may be able to say something about males are more X on average and females are more Y on average, but individual instances of men and women, of course, may run counter. Also, that evolution has primed certain tendencies for each sex, but tendencies are not fate and thus, again, you can only talk about averages or generalities. If you remember that, and don't get your undies in a bunch, the discussion of how human nature is/was shaped by evolution is illuminating.So I recommend this to everyone, especially those interested in how the brain works, how people work, and/or how science works."
4,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/802619-bree,1,"This was one of those books that I bought because I was sucked in by the title and the cover. Plus I thought, hey that's kinda out of my comfort zone, I'd like to push myself to read something new and possibly difficult to understand.I couldn't make it past the first chapter, so I read the end in hopes to find what his conclusion is and its we are all apes in the end. I find that rather depressing and quite hard to believe. I find it hard to swallow that we are only biological animals who are driven only by the need to find a way to better our species by sex with those chosen for their perfection. I look at all we create and imagine and I see so much more than that. He does grant that we are creative, but still underneath it all we are just creative apes. We are such a diverse species full of such hate, but also so much beauty. We can be blindingly compassionate and also completely clueless and self absorbed. There are so many variations that it is hard to explain them all through sexual Darwinism.I probably missed something there in the middle, but if his conclusion had been less crass maybe I would have been driven to read more of what drove him to that conclusion."
5,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28781546-ana,2,"This is really well written, but I just can't really wrap my head around the themes of sexuality in this book, especially as it concerns the idea of gender. Also I don't really trust men of science who can write things like ""boys are better in math than girls"" or ""girls are better at linguistic tasks"" as if they are universal truths instead of biased theories."

Some may see it as a cynical view of human nature, however I found it to be an engaging and convincing one. Â My favorite quote from this book sums up the totality of the text for me:Â ""...the choosiness in human beings in picking their mates has driven the human mind into a frenzied expansion for no reason except that wit, virtuosity,inventiveness, and individuality turn people on. It is a somewhat less uplifting perspective on the purpose of humanity than a religious one, but it is also liberating. Be different.""Â "

How much more generous it would be if, instead of writing parables about childhood wounds, psychologists were to accept that some differences between the sexes just are, that they are in the nature of the beasts, because each sex has an evolved tendency to develop that way in response to experience.
The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature is a very accessible book. It is easy to read, follow and understand. After reading this book, you will never look the same at a cheating spouse, a woman who had plastic surgery or a rich man."
8,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"Ridley throws a lot of interesting hypotheses at the question of why there is sex & why/how we indulge without ever coming to a firm conclusion & admitting such. I liked that since I didn't find a lot of the studies or statistics he referenced too convincing. This is more a book with points to ponder rather than a definitive text. He writes this at the end of the book, Half the ideas in this book are probably wrong. The history of human science [in this regard] is not encouraging. But he goes on to quote Hume & mention how far we've progressed since his day. We're just not there yet & may never be since we're so good at deceiving ourselves.It's well worth the time to read. There are some good insights into why we act the way we do & I really liked his opinions on the differences in children of different sexes. I've long been angered by the way the education system treats boys & girls the same. They're not & his point that nurture & nature shouldn't be seen as polar opposites, but as part of a process was very well made.Table of ContentsPrefaceONE: Human NatureTWO: The EnigmaTHREE: The Power of ParasitesFOUR: Genetic Mutiny and GenderFIVE: The Peacockâs TaleSIX: Polygamy and the Nature of MenSEVEN: Monogamy and the Nature of WomenEIGHT: Sexing the MindNINE: The Uses of BeautyTEN: The Intellectual Chess GameEPILOGUE: The Self-domesticated Ape"
9,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3749410-aaron-arnold,3,"I might have rated this more highly if I hadn't just come off a spate of reading very similar and slightly better works that incorporate much of its content in pithier form (Daniel Dennett's Darwin's Dangerous Idea and Steven Pinker's How the Mind Works, though those were both written afterwards), yet its central metaphor of sexual selection as arms race is compelling enough that I finished it alongside the superior Dennett and Pinker books anyway. The ""red queen"" of the title is derived from the famous character in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass who at one point tells Alice that in her world, you have to run as fast as you can just to stay in place. Life is similar, in that hard-won evolutionary advantages are obsoleted almost instantly as competitors adapt to keep up - the book is about how sexuality is used both on a macro level between species, as a gene-shuffler that can provide a leg up over parasites and asexual organisms that are forced to evolve a bit more slowly; and on a micro level within species, as males and females choose different game-theoretic strategies to maximize reproductive fitness. Obviously we're most interested in human sexuality, so the book does not disappoint in its exploration of titillating topics like adultery, incest, homosexuality, polygamy, promiscuity, age differences, dimorphism, fashion, and communication, with plenty of comparisons to analogous behavior in the animal kingdom. There's also plenty of pages on whether all this exciting behavior is due to nature or nurture, which I did not find to be as well-written as Dennett or Pinker's very similar sections in their books (strawmen start popping up in conjunction with loaded subjects like feminism, though this happened somewhat in Pinker's book as well); readers who aren't idiots will be unsurprised that Ridley falls into the sensible ""it's both, to some degree, depending on what you're talking about"" camp. I found the red queen idea to be a an illuminating metaphor and I enjoyed Ridley's take on sexual selection, even if as a work specifically on evolutionary biology it didn't rise to the level of Richard Dawkins' The Extended Phenotype, which I consider to be one of the best books existing on the subject, but since I read it right next to books that seemed to recapitulate most of its insights in fewer pages I'm not sure I would recommend it above either. It was a better-written treatise on human sexuality than your average porn, though, that's for sure."
10,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21906020-mark-colenutt,5,"Matt Ridley was educated at Oxford and is a journalistic scientist, which means he is able to translate the more complicated scientific breakthroughs and understandings to the wider public in a clear and succinct manner.Almost anything he has written, including his Guardian articles, are worthy of a reader's time. This particuar publication is a mind blowing look at evolutionary biology from the origin and end game of sex in our cultural and genetic lives.There are many books on this topic but few are as concise or lucid in description as this one. I have read it several times and my copy is smothered in annotations making it impossible for me to lend it to anyone.If you have ever questioned our bizarre mating rituals and the differing obsessions and motivations of either sex then this is the serious read that your questioning mind requires to set it at ease. However, just as one set of questions is answered you will only go on to formulate even more interrogatives but at least this time round they will be more meaninful inquisitions.This should be mandatory reading at schools for more mature students."
11,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5662520-davytron,2,"I really wanted to love this book. It was a fun and at times thorough overview of human sexuality. I do have some complaints about it, however. First, the author seemed extremely out of touch with society and came across as a very typical privileged white male in his views. It was painful to read sometimes when he'd go on about how women can do whatever they want these days with no limitations! Painful. Second, I especially disliked his lambasting of feminism as being completely wrong due to some feminists choosing to adhere to stricter ideologies than others. He never says something like ""Some feminists demand that men and women are equal"" but rather says something along the lines of ""Feminists demand that all men and women are equal."" He spoke in very finite terms even though the subject matter at hand should have been very context specific. He breaks down one extreme feminist view and then laughs from atop his phallic ivory tower without considering that feminism is kind of huge, dude. He didn't even bring up equity.Third, his chapter on sex differences (he used gender and sex interchangeably which I also didn't agree with) was a bit finite - he probably should have included the concept of degrees of difference rather than straight up black and white differences. Or maybe talk about ""in the most extreme cases, the differences may appear as follows"" kind of thing.Fourth, Ridley would get on a roll and introduce some cool ideas and then end the chapter. Sometimes the next chapter would carry on but I found myself really confused at the often abrupt halts and pauses in the discussion. It made for a choppy read at times and made it difficult to understand some concepts. Granted, not all concepts are entirely understood in science either but it still made for a difficult read. He included many basic and refuted arguments for the sake of breaking them down which often more than likely didn't need to be included. He also simplified some really complex ideas to the point that they sounded ridiculous. ""All linguists agree with Noam Chomskey"" haha nope! Nope they certainly do not. I found the book challenging because I had to disregard a lot of my ideas about culture in regards to human nature. Ridley is very keen on explaining that there is no nature without nurture (duh); but, he came across as harsh on people who leaned slightly more toward the nurture side and he didn't do it as effectively as someone like Dawkins would have. Even with my complaints, though, this was definitely an interesting read and I feel enlightened (and slightly emasculated due to the polarity of the sex/gender chapter). Check it out! (2 stars). "
12,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2422276-mag,0,"I like Matt Ridley, but Iâve read this book too late. Itâs been 15 years since its publication, and itâs too long for the science to be still groundbreaking. There is absolutely nothing in it that is new to me. Moreover, some of it feels already outdated and a bit too authoritarian on many issues which we now realize will have to be updated. Hence no rating.Ridley is intelligent enough to know it himself, too. I had to smile at his own comments on the book. âHalf the ideas in this book are probably wrong. The history of human science is not encouraging. Galtonâs eugenics, Freudâs unconscious, Durkheimâs sociology, Meadâs culture-driven anthropology, Skinnerâs behaviorism, Piagetâs early learning, and Wilsonâs sociobiology all appear in retrospect to be riddled with errors and false perspectives. No doubt the Red Queenâs approach is just another chapter in this marred tale.âHaving said so, I have to add that the book is very well written and that majority of ideas are no doubt sound."
13,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12186085-david-joseph,1,This was like being in a work release program with an educated half-wit.Very questionable reasoning throughout.
14,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3136056-juan-pablo,4,"As I was reading the first chapter, I kept thinking I was embarking on something written by a geek giggling at the word ""sex""; I don't think I was entirely wrong, but if there was any giggling from the author at the mention of sex, it was for truly fascinating reasons.I disliked the first chapter: anything titled ""Human Nature"" in this day and age seems preposterous. I kept on reading, nevertheless, hoping I'd find salvageable bits from this.I was absolutely enraptured by chapter three, at which point Ridley was on his way in the dissection of one of the most fascinating concepts I've ever encountered. The first chapter was an overture, I'll stick to saying not particularly well written, but should just be understood as such; the opera begins in chapter two.Mental experiment: Say you have four people, two of them a couple, male and female, who reproduce sexually, and the other two asexually reproducing females (it's called parthenogenesis, bear with me). They reproduce, what do you have? The couple has one offspring, the asexuals have one each for a total of two offspring. Asexual reproduction seems to be twice as efficient as sexual reproduction, so, why sex?Because it's fun, some might say, but this book, which kicks off with the sex enigma, provides far more informative analysis of the matter, which has been a mainstay in evolutionary biology. Turns out parasites have a lot to do with this evolutionary device...Remember the Red Queen from Lewis Carroll's wonderland? She runs around but never gets anywhere because the world moves along with her. Well, that's where the title of the book and the name of a fascinating concept come from. A host and a parasite are entangled in a Red Queen situation, where the faster evolving parasite succeeds as he breaks the host's defenses and the host succeeds when he prevents the parasite from doing so, thus running but never getting anywhere because of the changing situation. This may be referred to as an arms race as well in military imagery, but I feel the absurdity of Carroll's character makes Red Queen preferable.This Red Queen concept, and I'm sure wikipedia will do a much better job of explaining it than me, holds sway in many of evolution's questions and beyond. Ridley is witty and entertaining in his exposition, creating a truly eye-opening experience in this book for anyone with an interest in the ideas that shape our understanding of the world around us and ourselves. The book explores evolution via sexual selection, never missing illustrative examples along the way, and does a fair job at presenting the different views that have historically shaped how science understands sex and its consequences.Ridley used to be science editor at The Economist, which leads me to believe adds to the conciseness and clarity in his writing. Throughout the final chapters of the book, he delves into human nature, having gained much credibility from the writing that preceded them. His treatment of such a debated subject is incredibly illustrative of the many forces usually ignored by the disciplines that usually deal with such a subject, and provides us with an extensive look at how evolution and the Red Queen can inform.I think I'll be coming back to this book many times from now on in my thought and in my understanding of everything around me."
15,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51454575-nick-davies,4,"This was an interesting exploration of the reasons for sexual reproduction in many organisms, as well as then discussing the science with relation to human sexuality and sociology. Ridley makes good thorough use of a broad range of research findings in the area, discussing these with (mainly) even-handedness and a breadth of illustrative examples. The central theme relates to the importance of sexual reproduction in protection from disease and in best perpetuating our genes. It's an educational and readable book, full of useful facts and insights - I would recommend it to anyone interested in the subject.Unfortunately for me, I found some of it hard going because much of the science was stuff I already knew about from my college and university education, and previous books I've read on the subject. I've read other Matt Ridley books before, and he seems to have honed his skills in later books - at times this got slightly bogged down and lacked pace and direction in the slower sections where I thought too many examples were given."
16,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"I learned a lot from this book.The thesis is that much of human intelligence is a result of a sex-selection arms race.As a background, we are asked basic questions like, ""why sex""?Ridley does a good job quantifying this question and providing an honest, if uncertain answer.The short answer is, the perpetual arms races with viruses and parasites makes sex worth the cost.That cost can be as large as the Peacock's tail feathers, or the giant human brain.In the case of the human brain, the battle of the sexes has resulted in an organ that is also directly useful for survival.Language and logic, according to Ridley, are byproducts of a brain suited for outwitting the opposite sex.There is much ado about cuckoldry, cheating, harems, etc.All this is actually quite disturbing, even for a dispassionate scientist like myself.But Ridley does a commendable job of disclaiming any moral interpretation of the science."
17,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/122235--uht,5,"My God, I loved this book. Extremely accessible, yet very substantial. I don't think I can ever think about sex or human nature the same way. I feel that this is one of those seminal books that a person can't go back from.And it certainly does make it strange to go to a party and watch all the humans hooking up."
18,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7133444-sandra,5,"Excellent review of science (theories and methodologies for determining causes) of sexual reproduction, that passes the test of time (originally published in 1993!). Highly recommend. I will likely re-read this again.This book is far superior to Sex at Dawn: The Prehistoric Origins of Modern Sexuality. They are often paired and compared, even though they are not, and should not be considered to be, in the same category: The Red Queen is how proper science is done, while Sex at Dawn is a theoretical piece that provokes attention and satisfies readers' interest for reasons that are not purely scientific. It is important to maintain that distinction."
19,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/697412-jessica,2,"This is Evo Psych masquerading as hard science. It is sometimes dense and technical, sometimes defensive and condescending. There is some well-researched science, some reasonable observations, and some logical conclusions, but they are so inextricably tangled with sweeping generalizations, correlations misinterpreted as causations, and ambiguous data presented as certainty as to render the whole mess too annoying to read. I gave up with about 70 pages to go. Life is too short, and surely there is some more recent and more thoughtful writing on this topic by now. "
20,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/910324-trina,5,"an exposition of the basic idea that 'man is a self-domesticated animal', only far more interesting and accessible than that sounds. matt ridley tackles the question of why human beings reproduce sexually- you'd think the answer'd be 'because it's fun!', but you'd be wrong- when in the race for genes to reproduce themselves in mass quantities, asexual reproduction is more efficient and a more certain success, numbers-wise. the general answer has to do with parasites, and with the idea that like alice in wonderland's red queen, who is always running but staying in the same place because her surroundings are constantly moving too, creatures are locked into an evolutionary arms race where the sooner you evolve a defense, the sooner your enemies evolve a method to crack that defense, etc. etc. we have only to read the thousands of horrifying recent articles about new strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria cropping up everywhere to understand intimately that this red queen hypothesis makes sense and what it means for us.from establishing the red queen as the basis for sexual reproduction, ridley goes on to attempt to explain the existence of a universal human nature through the lens of the effects of sexual selection on evolution. we think our lives and natures are determined by our free wills, but what if free will itself is an evolutionary ploy? or, what if evolution, instead of pitting species against species for resources and survival, is actually a vicious competition between members of the same species- like between men and women, for example? he discusses everything from why men universally prefer young women, to the standards of beauty that govern young women's lives, to why monogamy- and subsequently, adultery (as well as the strictures against it)- is the preferred organization of sexual couples the world over. he also covers the long and colored history of polygamy in humans, and compares the way we organize our lives with how our closest relatives the apes organize theirs, as well as flies, pheasants, mice, and all manner of distantly related beasties.i'm not doing justice to the beautiful complexity of this book, but i enjoyed it a lot and felt that i learned quite a bit too. it is well paced to ensure the understanding of even the most scientifically-deficient reader, i think, and he establishes his hypotheses so well that each chapter feels very common-sense and revelatory. also, being somewhat of an amazon at times, i got a lot of laughs from his constant assertion that males are not useless, and in fact they serve such and such service which he would then elaborate upon. he assumes- and assumes that we assume- that males are an aberration, or a waste of genetic space, because they well, kind of are? genetically speaking, that is, and without factoring in the usefulness of sex and genders according to the red queen hypothesis. good stuff. i also appreciated being exposed to the idea that, contrary to what our moralizing society would like us to believe, many of the things that make us well adapted to survival and reproduction are not things that make us good or even basically decent people. and i liked that he makes that clear while also making it clear that just because something is 'natural' does not mean it is right or inevitable, and that our laws, which have evolved along with us like anything else, can be upheld and followed even in the face of our own natural impulses- towards violence or sexual injustice, for example. the idea of 'change without progress' is one that flies in the face of our onward and upward modern mentality, but all it takes is a quick look around at our complicated lives and the manifold ways we've fucked everything up or failed to properly understand anything in all the years we've been 'making progress' to intuitively know that while the red queen may not be the entire explanation for why we are the way we are, it goes a long way towards an answer, one untainted by our 'reason' or morals or politics."
21,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7075573-shellie,4,"The Red Queen theory stems from the Queen in Alice in Wonderland who runs and runs but stays in the same place. She never gets any further because the world is moving with her. Genes change their locks to combat parasites and parasites make new keys. They prey is always one step faster that the predator. âSex, according to the Red Queen theory, has nothing to do with adapting to the inanimate worldâbecoming bigger or better camouflaged or more tolerant of cold or better at flyingâbut is all about combatting the enemy that fights back.âGenes are programmed (by who?) to replicate and mutate, so Ridley calls them âselfish.â And he talks about gene crossovers and then genes that are able to shield themselves from crossover, but more and more Iâm thinking that this just proves even more that the genes arenât what is thinking or strategizing. Yes, much of it is trial and error-- make enough keys and youâll eventually fit one in a lock. So keep making different keys, but somebody is writing this key-making program.Ridley concludes that if genes are selfish and their top goal is to reproduce and ensure the survival of their strand, then why is there even the need for a male of a species?Now we get to the sex part. Many plants are hermaphrodite or multi-gender and some of these hermaphroditesâ genes âtry to destroy their male parts. Male-killer genes have been found in more than 140 species of plants.â And so to prevent this runaway train full of âselfish genesâ from derailing, some really smart overseer gene (Creator?) starts creating nuclear fertility restorer genes. Cool.And did you know that quite a few organisms out there have virgin births? And that bacterium can determine the gender? That not all animals have sex chromosomes and that lemmings have three sex chromosomes?âThe Red Queen is at work. Far from settling down to a fair and reasonable way of determining gender, nature has to face an infinite series of rebellions.âAs one who believes in a Creator, I took this book on to learn more about sexual selection. I did not pick it up to get into a creation debate. Funny, then, that I found the facts provided to be further evidence for my belief in God.I do believe in adaptation, survival of the fittest and genetic mutations and I appreciated the numerous studies about parasites, fungi and humans. However, when the author quotes Richard Hawkins in passages like this, âAs life emerged from the primeval soup several billion years ago, the molecules that caused themselves to be replicated at the expense of others became more numerous.â CAUSED THEMSELVES? Okay, okay, they replicated, but where did the primeval soup come from? How did it cause itself? Anyway.. âThen some of those molecules discovered the virtues of cooperation and specialization, so they began to assemble in groups called chromosomes to run machines called cells that could replicate these chromosomes efficientlyâ and so onââthe chromosomes then discovered that several kinds of cells could merge to form a supercell, just as villages began to group together as tribes. This was the invention of the modern cell from a team of different bacteria. The cells then grouped together to make animals and plants and fungiââ WAIT, WHAT!?!

NOW, THAT IS A STRETCH THAT I CANNOT BELIEVE!

22,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1241339-clif,4,"I didn't give five stars because I found this book something of a slog in the beginning.To make his case, it's necessary for Ridley to give an account of what has been found true of animal behavior before moving on to relate it to the most familiar animal, man. These accounts of the sex lives of birds and mammals and so on are rather dull to me.But stick with it! The book gets more interesting until it becomes absolutely fascinating with the chapter ""Sexing the Mind"". From that point on I was hanging on almost every sentence. The conclusions the author reaches are surprising, enlightening, exciting, because they are so reasonable in view of the evidence for them.The idea that prompts the title is drawn from the Red Queen, a character in Carroll's Through the Looking Glass, who must keep running faster all the time just to keep up. Evolution demands the same.The natural environment puts demands on every living thing. The most demanding thing for animals that have separate sexes, is for each sex to keep up with what the other wants - sexual selection.We can't reproduce by ourselves, so we must be able to come together with at least one member of the opposite sex to provide a future for our genes. The success of the individual in doing this determines his/her influence on future generations - what they will be like, how attractive they will be. Thus, each sex is in a contest with others of it own sex in being the most attractive to the opposite sex. It's a race that never ends.The parallels between other animals and man are remarkable. Just as remarkable are the unique characteristics of man. Why do we have such huge brains for our body size and so intelligent? Whey are we so accomplished in music and the arts and even sense of humor? Why do we have such a highly developed consciousness? Why do we have two sexes when other forms of life may have many more, or no sex, or both sexes on the same individual? Why are we monogamous and are we necessarily so?The book is driven by the question - ""what is human nature?"" - what is it that defines us, that we have in common with each other regardless of our individual differences?The Red Queen is going straight to my bookshelf because I know I will want to read it again. I just wish it were available on the Kindle so I could use the wonderful note-taking feature of that gadget.I shouldn't forget a warning - Ridley is no fan of the social sciences. If you think culture makes us what we are, you won't find any support for it here. He's got no time for Margaret Mead or B.F. Skinner and Freud, though he had some good insights, was off to outer space with his theory of the unconscious oedipal drive. For Ridley, evolution is in the driver's seat."
23,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6468380-taylor-pearson,4,"An interesting book about human evolution, and the sciences around it. I read it for the first time maybe ten years ago and found it just as thought-provoking the second time around.Evolution is a process of survival and reproduction, but most evolutionary theory focuses on the survival side of things. The Red Queen argues that, in fact, the action is on the reproduction side of things.This book offers a take on how sex, not survival, has been the primary driver of evolution, and more importantly, what drives sex. It's well written, with a bit of humor and lots of great stories."
24,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"This was an absolutely fantastic book. I love this author! The questions posed in the work are terribly to the point. Why do we have two sexes? Why not perform Asexual reproduction as many plant species do? What are the genetic, and social functions of sex from an evolutionary standpoint? I remember wondering about this very thing when studying botany in college. How did we evolve to be a diplontic species? (I want to be a dikaryotic fungus by the way... yes I did go there). Basically if you love biology and genetics this book is going to be a rollarcoaster of fun. "
25,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,The payoff in this book is in the last 1/3rd of the book. The beginning is really really dry and academic. The theories are fascinating and some were mind-blowing. Ridley himself admits that they are just theories and probably half of them are wrong. But it's just a fascinating way to view human behavior through sexual selection and evolutionary advantage.
26,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4176715-mckinley,1,Since this is a science book it is troubling that this doesn't follow the scientific method. Frequently topics are not developed logically leading to confusing and odd sentences. Some interesting propositions -- read for a lark.

29,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1033111-liz,2,"This was the July selection for my bookclub, and came highly recommended at a talk that one of the members went to. However, I really didn't like it and it set off my ""wishful thinking"" meter throughout. There is very little hard data about genetics included in the book. While there are interesting studies referenced about the mating habits of different birds, we don't have many studies done on the evolutionary mating habits of people. That is called evolutionary psychology, and most theories included in that area are not widely accepted and considered to be highly speculative. The author seems to choose theories that fit his viewpoint, and ignores others. I'm not an expert in many areas that the book covers, but I have taken many courses in language development and linguistics. The chapter on language development is occasionally just plain wrong, and facts are blatantly misinterpreted. The author marvels at how when an infant first labels a cup, they ""instinctively know"" that all different kinds of cups are cups, and they don't have to be told. Completely ignoring the fact that 1) before a child starts saying a word, they have heard it 1000's of times and 2) a child who has a dog in the house will call ALL furry animals ""doggy"" until corrected. The cup over-generalization is not corrected by the parents, but the doggy one is. You can't use the cup example and ignore that the same things happen in areas where the child is wrong.Also, the author uses Chomsky's 1950's theory of a ""language organ"" in the brain that is used for language development regardless of language, and reports that the theory ""is widely accepted by linguists."" This is just wrong. Not only is the theory of a ""language organ"" not widely accepted, Chomsky himself has revised the theory. The author referenced a 1957 book by Chomsky and ignores a later work from the 1970's. The book was in 2003, and I don't really feel there is a good excuse for only finding older work by an author.While I recognize that it is not really possible to be an expert in all areas, you can get chapters proofread by people in those fields. Also, when he is wrong, either in error or deliberately, in an area that I know very well, it's hard to accept anything that he says is true. He put facts in about language development and linguistics and they were selective, not analyzed and are not accepted by experts in the field. How am I to know that he didn't do it else where?"
30,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,4,"Would you like to more thoroughly understand why people are the way they are and why they do the crazy shit they do? If so, this book would be a great place to start. It's one of those ridiculously insight inducing reads. It's also one of those books that you absolutely can not judge by its cover. Or by its first and last chapters. Curious? Than by all means read on. One of the things that put me off of the book (before I actually read it) was the title The Red Queen. I'm dreadfully embarrassed to admit that I assumed it had something to do with menstruation. Not that there's anything wrong with menstruation. I just wasn't particularly motivated to commit a decent chunk of my ""one wild life"" to a long form exploration of that particular subject.When I actually read the book, I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't about menstruation at all. The title is actually a clever reference to Lewis Carroll's Red Queen from Through the Looking-Glass, a character who has to keep running to stay in the same place. Matt Ridley's hypothesis is that sex is essentially an organisms strategy for outwitting its constantly mutating internal predators (e.g. parasites, viruses etc.), a process he likens to an arms race. The point being, that in any sort of arms race, both sides work their asses off just to maintain their relative positions against the other. Essentially running in place. Hence ""The Red Queen"" analogy. Another reason I was reluctant to read the book, before a I actually read the book, was that I was sort of convinced that sexual selection (as opposed to natural selection all red in tooth and claw) was the lesser feature of Darwin's dangerous idea. After actually reading the book, I have essentially experienced a 180 degree change in perspective. I now view sexual selection as possessing awesome explanatory power. The Red Queen bravely attempts to address dozens of difficult questions regarding the otherwise mysterious workings of human nature and culture. Far form perfect. Provisional and dated. But nevertheless less brilliantly written and entertaining as all get out. The Red Queen offers an extraordinarily generative approach for interpreting the human condition and how it has evolved.I highly recommend actually reading this book."
31,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This book one star deducted because of the long-winded introduction. I almost added it at the end though, because that was so brilliant. This is a lucid, immensely readable book about the evolutinary foundation of human nature. It starts out with animals and covers much the same ground as ""the Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins that I read not long ago. However, it as soon as it moves into the deeper waters of human nature it becomes vastly more interesting.Humang beings are just another animal species. We're not very special - other species have culture and language too, although not as finely honed as humans'. We run on instinct too, as learning is costly and dangerous. Language learning and a fear of snakes, for example, are hard-wired in our brains. Speaking of brains, why are ours so big? Matt Ridley presents the thoughs of Miller, who thinks it's selected for. Human beings are very keen on wit and humour (come think of it, so am I) and this has been sexually selected for. To keep ahead in the ferocious inter-species competition, men had to be ever smarter and this lead to an ever-increasing brain size for both genders. We live on gossip and deception and the most succesful of us tend to be the best ""mindreaders"". ""The choosines of human beings in picking their mates has driven the human mind into a history of frenzied expansion for no reason except that wit, virtuosity, inventiveness and individuality turn other people on"". It's an interesting theory at any rate! Anyone interested in human nature and why we are as we are should read this book. Fascinating! This works well as an introduction to both human nature and evolution."
32,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1641357-alexa,4,"I was wrong: Upon completion I'd say this. This started out so dry that I almost gave up, but I ended up really liking it. Very scientific review of why humans have 2 genders and aren't hermaphrodides, what advantages procreating through sex rather than one of the many other ways has etc. Once you get past the first 1/3 it becomes much more understandable and interesting. Rule 1 for all humans, ""success in life equals having grandchildren survive to adulthood"" (read - pass on your genes). Approach for men, that translates into the quantity of sexual partners Approach for women, that translates into quality of sexual partners. And the rest are fascinating deductions from that rule and those approaches. Just jump over the first chapters. Reminds me of one of my all time favorites. That is ""Brain Sex"" which surely has a better name, but is no more intersteing in the end."
33,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,4,"Sex and evolution -- always fun topics and even more fun when you throw them together. I must becoming centrist in my old age, because I found Ridley's approach to strike just the right tone between authoritative and skeptical. Nothing is certain, but certain theories seem to hold more sway. Ridley's narrative also makes it clear that the answer is probably in the middle of conflicting theories, human nature being as complex as it is.My two favorite takeaways from the book: 1) Sex is most probably an evolutionary response to dealing with disease. 2) The human mind is the equivalent of the peacock tail -- a quirk of human-ness that evolved to attract mates. Now I know why creativity is so sexual."
34,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6601778-parker-f,4,"A fascinating book on my favorite topic. The author refreshingly acknowledges that half of the theories he espouses in the book are likely to be wrong; for instance, I am highly skeptical of Ridley's theory that human large-brainedness arose from runaway sexual selection favoring cute, disproportionately large heads. Nonetheless, I have no good reason to doubt this, and, as Ridley notes, all arguments of runaway sexual selection involve somewhat circular reasoning. I was fond of Ridley's literary allusions to illustrate the primalness of our evolutionarily-shaped motivations. Finally, this book is highly motivational with regards to my life's goal of acquiring a large harem. "
35,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32369480-loki,3,"Thought provoking, but less than entirely convincing, look at how genetics effect psychology. The author is quick to clarify, but often writes in a style that seems to deliberately generate an overlarge need to clarify - this is a book of meandering thoughts for the most part. Ridley strives to sound neutral, but always gives the impression of having an agenda (although if it's any more developed than 'hey, use my cool metaphor', I missed it). Still, it raises some interesting questions, for all that it pretends to greater certainty than is really warranted in such a rapidly evolving field of study."
36,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1037357-angela-juline,1,"SOOO glad to be done with this book! I don't understand how it has such a high rating. My uncle sent it to my daughter, so I wanted to read it first. I'd let her read it, but I don't know why she would want to. He states a theory, and then loves to say, but, wait, in the black tailed, orange-rimmed sage grouse, the opposite happens. It's annoying how he picks out a totally obscure animal/insect/bacteria to prove the theory has flaws. Clearly, he has done an amazing amount of research - but to what end? I'm going to need to read some 4 & 5 star reviews to see what the point of this book is. "
37,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7506759-anthony-bello,2,"The author attempts to avoid heteronormativity and sexism and fails outright. Only the first half of the book is worth reading; I got to learn about all different strategies that nature uses for sexual and asexual reproduction and different biological applications of game theory. Past that, the rest merely reeks of essentializing Victorianism. The first half of the book will endure; the second half is already dated."

41,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2775247-alexander-tomislav,5,"This book sets a case that sexual selection is the reason, as for the peacock's tail, so for the human intelligence as well. The title comes from Lewis Carroll's ""Alice through the Looking Glass"" character of Red Queen, who, the faster she goes, the more she stays in place. This is related to the evolutionary phenomenon of ""locked"" development, such as between parasites and hosts. The more parasites adapt to hosts' defenses, the more defenses will be evolved in the hosts.Drawing on many a research, the author starts with examples from the animal world, examining clues and evidence from a geneticist's, evolutionist's and ecological points of view. Biggest clue is how many features of animals (long tail feathers and bright colors in some birds, for example) serve more for the organism to breed, than to survive. Indeed, driven by the genes' impetus to replicate, it's more ""Breeding of the fittest"" than survival.One of the biggest problems that evolutionary science faces is the attitude, common in humanistic sciences, that male and female brains are identical. Not so, claims the author, and the reasoning is compelling and sound - just as different environmental pressures caused male and female bodies to be different, it did the same to our brains. No amount of wishful thinking or political correctness can make that different. However, he's quick to point out ""Give men an inch of inequality and they will claim a mile of bias."". The human body blueprint is female, and only through two testosterone bursts (in womb and at the start of puberty) does it become masculine. Environment plays a big role in gene expression and the author demonstrates in multiple places how nature and nurture aren't opposites, but work together. As a reason for explosive development of the human brain, the author shows how the competition between members of the same species drove that development. We didn't become smarter to make tools, or to hunt, or to develop language and society. Many animals hunt, have complicated social dynamics, use tools and rudimentary communication. We evolved big brains to outwit each other.Until humanity accepts what it is, instead of vainly focusing on what it should be, we can't advance as a species. Selected quotes:""Human nature is a product of culture, but culture is also a product of human nature, and both are the products of evolution."" [pg 6.]""Humanity is, of course, morally free to make and remake itself infinitely, but we do not do so. We stick to the same monotonously human pattern of organizing our affairs. If we were more adventurous, there would be societies without love, without ambition, without sexual desire, without marriage, without art, without grammar, without music, without smilesâ and with as many unimaginable novelties as are in that list. There would be societies in which women killed each other more often than men, in which old people were considered more beautiful than twenty-year-olds, in which wealth did not purchase power over others, in which people did not discriminate in favor of their own friends and against strangers, in which parents did not love their own children."" [pg. 7]""Evolution is something that happens to organisms. It is a directionless process that sometimes makes an animalâs descendants more complicated, sometimes simpler, and sometimes changes them not at all. We are so steeped in notions of progress and self-improvement that we find it strangely hard to accept this."" [pg. 31]""Nicholas Humphrey, a Cambridge psychologist, was the first to see clearly the solution to this puzzle. We use our intellects not to solve practical problems but to outwit each other. Deceiving people, detecting deceit, understanding peopleâs motives, manipulating peopleâ these are what the intellect is used for. So what matters is not how clever and crafty you are but how much more clever and craftier you are than other people. The value of intellect is infinite. Selection within the species is always going to be more important than selection between the species."" [pg. 34]""Sex is about disease. It is used to combat the threat from parasites. Organisms need sex to keep their genes one step ahead of their parasites. Men are not redundant after all; they are womanâs insurance policy against her children being wiped out by influenza and smallpox..."" [pg. 86]""The goal for every female animal is to find a mate with sufficient genetic quality to make a good husband, a good father, or a good sire. The goal for every male animal is often to find as many wives as possible and sometimes to find good mothers and dams, only rarely to find good wives. In 1972, Robert Trivers noticed the reason for this asymmetry, which runs right through the animal kingdom; the rare exceptions to his rule prove why it generally holds. The sex that invests most in rearing the youngâ by carrying a fetus for nine months in its belly, for exampleâ is the sex that makes the least profit from an extra mating. The sex that invests the least has time to spare to seek other mates. Therefore, broadly speaking, males invest less and seek quantity of mates, while females invest more and seek quality of mates."" [pg. 132]""Murder is ânaturalâ in the sense that our ape relatives commit it regularly, as apparently did our human ancestors. Prejudice, hate, violence, crueltyâ all are more or less part of our nature, and all can be effectively countered by the right kind of nurture. Nature is not inflexible but malleable."" [pg. 181]""Lesbians, free of constraints imposed by male nature, do not suddenly indulge in sexual promiscuity; on the contrary, they are remarkably monogamous. None of this is surprising: Female animals gain little from sexual opportunism, for their reproductive ability is limited not by how many males they mate with but how long it takes to bear offspring. In this respect men and women are very different."" [pg. 218]""[...]the ban on polygamous marriage does not prevent the males from seeking polygamous matings. Adultery is common. It is most common between high-ranking males and females of all ranks. To prevent it males try to guard their wives, are extremely violent toward their wivesâ lovers, and copulate with their wives frequently, not just when they are fertile."" [pg. 234]""The noble savage, far from living in contented sexual equanimity, was paranoid about becoming, and intent on making his neighbor into, a cuckold[...] Cuckoldry paranoia is deep-seated in men. The use of veils, chaperones, purdah, female circumcision, and chastity belts all bear witness to a widespread male fear of being cuckolded and a widespread suspicion that wives, as well as their potential lovers, are the ones to distrust[...] Jealousy is a âhuman universal,â and no culture lacks it. Despite the best efforts of anthropologists to find a society with no jealousy and so prove that it is an emotion introduced by pernicious social pressure or pathology, sexual jealousy seems to be an unavoidable part of being a human being."" [pg. 235]""There has been no genetic change since we were hunter-gatherers, but deep in the mind of the modern man is a simple male hunter-gatherer rule: Strive to acquire power and use it to lure women who will bear heirs; strive to acquire wealth and use it to buy other menâs wives who will bear bastards. It began with a man who shared a piece of prized fish or honey with an attractive neighborâs wife in exchange for a brief affair and continues with a pop star ushering a model into his Mercedes. From fish to Mercedes, the history is unbroken: via skins and beads, plows and cattle, swords and castles. Wealth and power are means to women; women are means to genetic eternity."" [pg. 244]""Testosterone is an ancient chemical, found in much the same form throughout the vertebrates. Its concentration determines aggressiveness so exactly that in birds with reversed sex roles, such as phalaropes and in female-dominated hyena clans, it is the females that have higher levels of testosterone in the blood. Testosterone masculinizes the body; without it, the body remains female, whatever its genes. It also masculinizes the brain."" [pg. 254]""Baby girls are more interested in smiling, communicating, and in people, boys in action and things. Shown cluttered pictures, boys select objects, girls people. Boys are instantly obsessed with dismantling, assembling, destroying, possessing, and coveting things. Girls are fascinated by people and treat their toys as surrogate people. Hence, to suit their mentalities, we have invented toys that suit each sex. We give boys tractors and girls dolls. We are reinforcing the stereotypical obsessions that they already have, but we are not creating them."" [pg. 256]""The Israeli kibbutz system has proved to be a large natural experiment in the persistence of sex roles. Men and women were initially encouraged to drop all sex roles in kibbutzim: Haircuts and clothes were unisex; boys were encouraged to be peaceful and sensitive, while girls were treated like tomboys; men did household chores and women went out to work. Yet three generations later, the attempt has largely been abandoned, and kibbutz life is actually more sexist than life in the rest of Israel. People have returned to stereotypes. Men politick, while women tend the home; boys study physics and become engineers, while girls study sociology and become teachers and nurses. Women manage the morale, health, and education of the kibbutz, while men manage the finances, security, and business.[...] Women clean house in a kibbutz because, like women everywhere, they complain that men would not do it properly. Men do not clean house in a kibbutz because, like men everywhere, they complain that if they did, their wives would say it had not been done properly."" [pg. 260]""The bizarre thing about this assertion of different natures is that it is a thoroughly feminist assertion. There is a contradiction at the heart of feminism, one that few feminists have acknowledged. You cannot say, first, that men and women are equally capable of all jobs and, second, that if jobs were done by women, they would be done differently. So feminism itself is anything but egalitarian. Feminists argue explicitly that if more women were in charge, more caring values would prevail. They begin from the presumption that women are by nature different beings. If women ran the world, there would be no war. When women run companies, cooperation, not competition, is the watchword. These are all explicit and firm assertions of sexism: that the personalities and natures of women are different from men. If womenâs personalities are different, is it not likely that they will prove better or worse at certain jobs than men? Differences cannot be appealed to when they suit and denied when they do not."" [pg. 261]""The assertion that âcultureâ explains human variation will be taken seriously when there are reports of women war parties raiding villages to capture men as husbands, or of parents cloistering their sons but not their daughters to protect their sonsâ virtue, or when cultural distributions for preferences concerning physical attractiveness, earning power, relative age, and so on show as many cultures with bias in one direction as in the other."" [pg. 275]""Somewhere in our education we unthinkingly absorb the idea that nature (genes) and nurture (environment) are opposites and that we must make a choice between them. If we choose environmentalism, then we are espousing a universal human nature that is as blank as a sheet of paper awaiting cultureâs pen, that humans are therefore perfectible and born equal. If we choose genes, then we espouse irreversible genetic differences between races and between individuals. We are fatalists and elitists. Who would not hope with all her heart that the geneticists were wrong?"" [pg. 317]""If you want to understand human motives, read Proust or Trollope or Tom Wolfe, not Freud or Piaget or Skinner. We are obsessed with one anotherâs minds. âOur intuitive commonsense psychology far surpasses any scientific psychology in scope and accuracy,â wrote Don Symons. 39 Horace Barlow points out that great literary minds are, almost by definition, great mind-reading minds."" [pg. 333]""Robert Trivers has argued that to deceive others well, an animal must deceive itself, and that self-deceptionâs hallmark is a biased system of transfer from the conscious to the unconscious mind. Deception is therefore the reason for the invention of the subconscious."" [pg.335]""Mankind is a self-domesticated animal; a mammal; an ape; a social ape; an ape in which the male takes the iniative in courtship and females usually leave the society of their birth; an ape in which men are predators, women herbivorous foragers; an ape in which males are relatively hierarchical, females relatively egalitarian; an ape in which males contribute unusually large amounts of investment in the upbringing of their offspring by provisioning their mates and their children with food, protection, and company; an ape in which monogamous pair bonds are the rule but many males have affairs and occasional males achieve polygamy; an ape in which females mated to low-ranking males often cuckold their husbands in order to gain access to the genes of higher-ranking males; an ape that has been subject to unusually intense mutual sexual selection so that many of the features of the female body (lips, breasts, waists) and the mind of both sexes (songs, competitive ambition, status seeking) are designed for use in competition for mates; an ape that has developed an extraordinary range of new instincts to learn by association, to communicate by speech, and to pass on traditions. But still an ape.""[pg.348]"
42,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3355789-mark,4,"In a frenetic effort to stay interesting, Matt Ridley unconsciously finishes his book with a terrific built-in summary by introducing Robin Dunbar's ""Scherazade Effect"" which is the frenetic effort to stay interesting, with sex and hence reproduction and life itself at stake.The book's a little like that: Matt's a consummate researcher and very good at explaining, and he's scraped together a mountain of anecdotes in support of his thesis which is, what exactly? It's kind of a little bit lost in all the stories but basically looking for the reason we are people instead of ordinary animals, he finds sexual selection and the need to be attractive as causal in the case of neoteny, big brains, language, tools, dominant men and sexy women, everything you want.There are a million uncomfortable moments wherein simple circular dynamics diverge in unstable fashion to a new set point, like a peacock's feathers or human brains or a whale's (two ton!) gonads. Like Ridley, I couldn't resist a teaser there, but the  point  is that like so many, Ridley has a hard time wrapping his brain around recursive iterative dynamics. Since that's my JOB, I'm ok with it, but remember being frustrated and tied in a mental knot by the chicken / egg / chicken problem of feedback in physical systems. I do feel the analogy's apt though. There doesn't have to be a driving reason for everything, if a tiny nudge can suffice to loose an avalanche of consequent evolution. I find that believable.One thing he might have missed, in trying to explain us (humans) in an area cosmologists have long since overcome, which is the ""we're not special"" or ""duh, because WE're here"" explanation as to why the sun is just the right temperature or the boltzman constant just so: the reason is that the people in that potential universe or on that potential planet just arent. They aren't there, they entirely aint. I'm doing a horrible job explaining that, but basically SOMEBODY had to be on the top of the food chain and I'm personally glad to be lucky enough that it's me. Why am  I  thinking about evolution? My answer? ""Because if I were an ant I couldn't."" I think Ridley misses that he doesn't have to go searching for some reason why WE in particular are special. We're just lucky that way; ~ somebody had to be.Ahh, never mind all that. In summary, it's hard to dislike a guy who calls both Freud and Skinner misguided. This is a fun book and certainly has a lot of truth in it. Ridley wants a main theme and maybe hasn't got one, but he doesn't need it anyway. Bravo.-------------------------------Here's a long postscript on why there's a 50:50 ratio of the sexes.Gina asked why males aren't rare, since it wouldn't seem so many are necessary. I re-read a whole chapter & wrote this reply...The answer, in the Red Queen, lies around page 100. It's long and complex and, in case you want to cut to the chase, finally an unsatisfying answer.First I think I noted that male and female as different genders are an idea organized around using organelles (mitochondria) from just ONE parent. Apparently otherwise competition between them within the cell is destructive, so it's better to just pick one parent from which to get 'em. (It's the female: the sperm is stripped of all but its nucleus in the catharsis of fertilization.)Why not hermaphrodites came up next and the answer was that in a hermaphroditic population, there would be instabilities, for example a tendency to kill off your male parts would make more resources available to the female nature, which would be thereby advantaged. Ultrafemmes would outperform hermaphrodites as mothers, and in so doing, make sperm scarce. Female killer genes could also then prosper, these making a new offspring hypermale. So an instability is encouraged by the basic idea of commitment: by being ""all in"" in one's choice of sex, you have a better chance of success than playing both sides & thereby hedging two bets badly.So far we still don't have any reason why the numbers should be so easily balanced. There are plenty of creatures where that's not the case, and there are ""driving"" genes that cause sex ratio distortion. Ritter he documents one human family wherein only girls were born. Why wouldn't such a thing, this parthenogenesis, catch on, at least in some proportion? All these different causes seem like tendencies that ought to swing towards some optimal ratio which would (obviously?) benefit from a male percentage << 50%. ...and that's your question, still unanswered. Lemmings actually solve it with a third sex chromosome that biases the odds towards females, a seemingly better system. Are we just unlucky vs lemmings?He delves briefly into other systems, as when unfertilized eggs become male (a clearly stable situation) or my favorite, when ALL the fish in the school are female, save the biggest, who changes teams to fulfill his duties. I guess the point is, there are plenty of exceptions to the rule. Ridley delights in these digressions.Then there were many more anecdotes, sort of diffusing away into a fog of confusion, doubtless why I forgot this next point. ""Munching a burrito"" with some scientist, he notes that dominant women & monkeys (& cows and chickens) have more sons, that female hormones not genetics tend most (and there are many factors) to bias the sex ratios, and a shortage of men makes for dominant females. It doesn't seem to ""tend"" towards exactly 50:50 or even be strongly supported, certainly not convincingly so in the face of the profligate polygamous male hypothesis. So the question goes down as being self corrected by mysterious and non genetic means. Unsatisfying. More theories then follow, but many of these have to do with social criteria pertinent only to humans (you can always marry a beautiful daughter up-caste, but not a son) but these theories do not answer as to why farmers have failed to breed female only lines of cattle, however hard they try. That last observation was a quote from Dawkins, and seemingly his last word. I have to suspect Ridley should have accepted this as unknown and ended the chapter there.At least, I will."
43,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature by Matt RidleyâThe Red Queen"" is the very interesting book about how human nature evolved as a result of sex. According to the author, human beings were âdesignedâ to reproduce and that without understanding competitive reproduction we will not be able to comprehend the human psyche and nature. Well known journalist, scientist and educator; Matt Ridley, brings us a well-rounded science book that deals with many fascinating topics involving sexual evolution. The first third of book or so starts off a little dense and may put off some readers but once it picks up it really takes off and rewards readers with invaluable knowledge. This 416-page book is composed of the following ten chapters: 1. Human Nature, 2. The Enigma, 3. The Power of Parasites, 4. Genetic Mutiny and Gender, 5. The Peacockâs Tale, 6. Polygamy and the Nature of Men, 7. Monogamy and the Nature of Women, 8. Sexing the Mind, 9. The Uses of Beauty, and 10. The Intellectual Chess Game. Positives:1.	A well-written and well-researched book. 2.	The fascinating topic of sexual evolution in the hands of a master.3.	The book was originally published in 1993 but it holds up generally well and itâs still worth reading.4.	Good use of the best that science had to offer at that time.5.	Thought-provoking and refreshingly honest and witty approach.6.	Provides compelling arguments in support of a universal human nature.7.	Explains the reasoning behind the title which is a metaphor in evolution for âthe faster you run, the more the world moves with you and the less you make progressâ.8.	Some great analogies, âThe fashion in evolutionary science now is to scoff at progress; evolution is a treadmill, not a ladderâ.9.	What sex is. A look from three different kinds of scientists. Great stuff.10.	The unbelievable world of sex in both the animal and plant kingdom.11.	Some great facts and perspectives, âThe âgreat warâ of 1914-18 killed 25 million people in four years. The influenza epidemic that followed killed 25 million in four monthsâ.12.	What drive the evolution of sex.13.	Understanding what evolution is in a practical sense.14.	How science works to address a problem.15.	Understanding gender in terms of âgenetic lotteryâ. Or leave it to the environment.16.	Some great anecdotes, âAnaxagoraâs belief that lying on the right side during sex would produce a boy was so influential that centuries later some French aristocrats had their left testicles amputatedâ. Ouch!17.	The nature of âchoosyâ females.18.	The two warring factions in sexual selection: âFisherâ and âGood-genesâ.19.	Testosterone and its relation to disease.20.	What men find attractive in women.21.	The impact of human culture.22.	An honest look at the roles of the sexes.23.	An understanding about homosexual behavior.24.	Game theory and how it plays out between males and females. Always interesting.25.	Human evolution always fascinating.26.	The growth of our brains.27.	Understanding the evil practice of female infanticide.28.	Power as a tool for sexual success. Itâs good being the king.29.	Marriage, understanding the institution of.30.	Adultery and how it shaped human society.31.	Fascinating look at what societies favor daughters over sons and vice versa.32.	The differences of mental features between the sexes.33.	A look at social statuses.34.	The innate instinct of learning language.35.	The evidence for neoteny.36.	Links to notes worked great! Negatives:1.	The first third or so of the book was a bit dense and may have put off some readers.2.	Despite holding up generally well (book was published in 1993), some topics are outdated. For instance, free will is an illusion. I will provide a list of suggestion that offers more up to date information.3.	Animal altruism is not a myth.4.	Some topics are fairly logical. We all have a basic grasp of sexual selection.5.	Some topics may irk feminists. Let me leave it at that.6.	The author purposely sidesteps the issue of morality and the little that is here is inadequate.7.	âDeception is therefore the reason for the invention of the subconscious.â â Trivers Really?In summary, I wished I had read this book when it first came out in 1993. The book started off a little dry but once it gets going I wasnât able to put it down. Many topics of popular interest in the hands of an accomplished author make for good reading. In spite of its age, I learned some new things and have a much better grasp of why human nature evolved as a result of sex. If you have the patience to make it through the early chapters the book will reward you with wisdom, worth reading! Further recommendations: ""Humanâ and âWhoâs In Charge?â by Michael S.

The experience is much more amusing if you pause and reflect - and try to devise your own explanations - before reading the main theories.That's why it gets a 5/5.OBS: In order to better enjoy the book, I recommend reading ""The Selfish Gene"" first."
47,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13334219-ralph-hermansen,4,"""The Red Queen"" by Matt Ridley. A review by Ralph Hermansen.I would buy Matt Ridley's next book without hesitation, no matter what the topic. He is one of the few authors who thoroughly researches his subject and understands the science underlying it. He then delivers the information to you in an interesting way. You certainly get your money's worth in his books.""The Red Queen"" is about the evolutionary forces which has shaped us as human beings. The significance of Lewis Carroll's Red Queen from the book, ""Alice in Wonderland"", is that we have to run just to stand still. So it is with evolution. We have to improve our survival skills over the generations to keep pace with the other plants and animals which are also advancing in their survival skills.Much of what we are as humans has to do with sexual selection. Charles Darwin introduced the concept of natural selection in his book, ""Origin of the Species"", but he devoted an even greater deal of space to his concept of sexual selection in his book, ""The Descent of Man"". No matter how superior you are in survival abilities, it is all for naught if you do not pass those traits on to your offspring. Therefore mating is vitally important. You must be attractive to the opposite sex and this manifests itself in diverse ways amongst the animals. Moreover, sexual selection may create traits that seem to work against survivability. The peacock would certainly be better served with a smaller, less ornate tail, which makes him a more obvious target for predators.Ridley picks up where Darwin left off and explores the sexuality of humans as they have evolved from apes and gradually became a big brained animal over millions of years of evolution. He has incorporated most of the ideas of modern scientists related to this subject. Men are attracted to beauty and women are attracted to powerful men, who can provide for them. In the animal kingdom, the female selects the male with the best traits and the males are willing to mate with most any female in heat. The case has become different for modern humans because human babies are helpless far longer than in normal in the animal kingdom. This is a consequence of out massive brain, which must continue developing outside the womb.One part of the book did leave me surprised. Ridley got so caught up in his analysis of what women would do in selecting men that he surmised that women would rarely engage in opportunistic sex as it is against their self interest. Mr. Ridley, if you had been single and dating in California in the 1970's, you would soon realize how very mistaken you are. Many women had decided that they were now equal to men and could enjoy the same pleasures and they did. A few years later, fear of AIDS put an end to this libertine period. Alas!Aside from that mistaken projection, the Red Queen book is excellent and I think you will enjoy reading it. Ralph Hermansen 10/04/08 "
48,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47841182-myrto-smyrilioy-zerva,5,"This is a book targeted at biologists and not, alike. It consists of a, not completely unbiased review of our knowledge on the subjects of a human evolution and inherent nature beautifully stated by a superfluous pen with a deep understanding and fiery passion on the subject. It is an educational read but the wit and humor is not secrificed in the altar of scientific accuracy or logical argument. I found this book both stimulating, informative and entertaining. This is also helped by a fantastic audio."
49,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1052384-nicholas,3,"I feel like I really missed out on what this book had to offer. I don't think that I had the requisite background for it at the time. Reread.This book is about the effect of parasites on sex and culture. Sex is the caused by the need to fight off parasites that have a much faster generational cycle than we do. Our culture is a product in large part of this sexual dynamic.Quotes:""Evolution is a treadmill not a ladder.""""Evolution is something that happens to organisms. It is a directionless process that sometimes makes an animal's decedents more complicated, sometimes simpler, and sometimes changes them not at all. We are so steeped in notions of progress and self-improvement that we find it strangely hard to accept this.""""Parasites are in constant battle with hosts, a battle that is fought by switching from one resistance gene to another; hence the battery of different versions of genes. None of this would work without sex.""""If the goal is to have the sexist son in the next generation, then one way of doing that is to mate with the sexiest male; a second way is to prevent other females from mating with the sexiest male.""""We are designed for a system of monogamy plagued by adultery.""""What caused the sudden and spectacular expansion of that one ape's head, from which so much else flowed? Why did it happen to one ape and not another? What can account for the astonishing speed, and the accelerating speed of the change? These questions may seem to have nothing to do with the subject of this book, but the answer may lie with sex. If new theories are right, the evolution of man's big head was the result of a Red Queen sexual contest between individuals of the same gender.""""Half the ideas in this book are probably wrong."""
50,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1251066-andy,3,"I've been meaning to read this for years, after an old flat-mate told me about it while studying for his BSc in the psychology of attraction. Finally found it in a charity shop in Tunbridge Wells and decided to finish of the year with some evolutionary pondering.Matt Ridley freely states that the first third may not be as interesting to some as he details the background of evolutionary theory in relation to sexual activity and behaviour in animals. Dry perhaps, may be a better term. It's the later parts of the book though where things get interesting, looking at how human nature (if indeed humans can be said to have a specific 'nature') may (or may not) have been shaped by evolutionary pressures. There are many fascinating examples and case studies, compiled expertly by Ridley. As he again mentions, he has compiled these mostly from the work of others, trying to tie a lot of individual theories and evidence together. Generally he manages a good job and it's eminently readable.Whether or not you agree or believe is entirely another matter and really, books such as this should be read to educate and promote discussion. He doesn't (and shouldn't) attempt to claim a definitive conclusion and many avenues are left open to debate. I personally found it compelling. My biggest issue is how out of date much of the evidence (and some occasional clumsy discussions, particularly around homosexuality) is now, having been written almost 20 years ago. I would certainly be interested in reading a more up to date discussion of the state of the field.Still, a well recognised and deserved text, worth reading."
51,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361083-erwin,5,"Excellent book. Definitely worth reading for everyone, particularly followers of any religion.Summary is that Human Intelligence, just like a peacocks feathers, are the result of Sexual Selection. The more intelligent, the more able to outsmart other humans, and the more able to mate --- this especially applies to men.Few aspects of human nature can be understood apart from sex, since human nature is a product of evolution, and evolution in our case is driven specifically by sexual replication.The book begins with an evolutionary account of sex itself, defending the theory that sex flourishes, despite its energetic costs, primarily because a sexually mixed heritage confers to offspring a defensive ""head start"" against parasites received from and originally adapted to the maternal host environment.Human intelligence is largely a result of sexual selection. Human intelligence far outstrips any survivalist demands that would have been placed on our hominid ancestors, and analogizes human intelligence to the peacock's tail, a trait widely believed to be the result of sexual selection. Human intelligence is used primarily to attract mates through prodigious displays of wit, charm, inventiveness, and individuality.Next I should read The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature."
52,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5619806-veronica,2,"Okay, so the good points of the book: when the author discusses the up to date and relevant research of scientists, he does so respectfully, succinctly, and accurately. He does not both too much with alternative perspectives, but for the most part, while sometimes unpalatable information, I tend to agree with the information. The worse points of the book: his own opinion is often absurd. His methods of making the information relatable is, in my opinion, stupid. He lacks the creativity to make a compelling story out of facts, and frankly, the theories are often so elegant and beautiful, it's unnecessary anyway. Finally, in his final depressing notes, he not just criticizes, but attempts to entirely discredit pioneers in many different fields, none of which he is an expert in. Even if some of the theories are no longer considered accurate or represent our world model, they paved the path for future endeavours which have enhanced our knowledge of the natural world and our place within it. Finally, several of the individuals he attempted to discredit are still at the forefront of their fields and are still considered accurate and representative of present day findings. Following this, he gives us his own uneducated opinions on where he thinks the future will take us. The only reason he got two stars at all was because of the research he did present and do justice to. I'm shocked this book has such high reviews. I was so looking forward to reading it. "
53,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5205758-mario-garc-a,5,"An amazing book on when and how things started developing for us in a way which serves no big purpose but keeping our social cohesion.By us I mean the human species as a subspecies of African ape, by when I mean historically and then, how, biologically.But categorizing that way is unfair to the acute reader. Matt Ridley manages to handle the subject with such an elegance, concision and property quite difficult to find among ""entrepreneurial"" scholars nowadays. This book is really informative and not just another idiot trying to make some extra-money by spreading pseudo-science.A must read if you want to get acquainted with the ways of modern Biology and Human Sciences in general; yet, you will find a lot of ingenious answers to common misconceptions and useful knowledge to understand the wonderful intricacies of social interaction at an animal level.And yes, it is an easy replacement for bad literature; for you see, It'll make you feel better with yourself, get you laid more often or just serve as a good excuse to keep your fidelity."
54,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/689670-joanna,1,"My review of this book can be summed up in a quote from the very end of the book, ""Half the ideas in this book are probably wrong."" That's probably a generous estimate on the author's part! I would also add ""sexist"" to ""wrong."" If only I'd read the end first, I could've saved myself a lot of frustration.A sampling:""The best [men] can hope for now is a good-looking younger mistress and a devoted wife who is traded in every decade or so. We're back to square one."" ""Inject all pregnant women with the right dose of hormones, and the result would be men and women with normal bodies but identical female brains. War, rape, boxing, car racing, pornography, and hamburgers and beer would soon be distant memories.""Then he talks about how women with Turner's syndrome are born without ovaries. ""They are exaggeratedly feminine in their behavior, with typically a special interest in babies, clothes, housekeeping, and romantic stories.""This book is bad science based in sexist stereotypes. Ironically, I read it for my feminist book club!"
55,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22176981-olivera,2,"Even though Matt Ridley said in his epilogue to this book that he doesn't regret including animals in this book I found it to be a flaw that can't necessarily be overcome. This isn't a book you will enjoy unless you are a fan of biology and the behavior of animals (which I in fact am not).I went into this expecting exactly what the title promised: the evolution of human nature, yet there was more talk about birds, insects, apes and snails than there actually was about humans. While I do understand that giving a kind of background for this topic is necessary, to me it seemed like it was overdone. Only in the last third did it actually focus on the theme it was supposed to focus on, but the 200+ pages that took me to get there weren't really worth it. There were some very interesting theories here, but I found a few facts being repeated over and over again. I don't really know what to say. I'm just pretty disappointed in The Red Queen and I'll be hesitant to pick up anything regarding this subject in the future, even though I am interested in it."
56,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4948409-samantha-sean,4,"In The Red Queen, Matt Ridley asserts that sexual selection is more prominent a factor of survival of a species than natural selection in its general form. Ridley cites Darwin, multiple fascinating biological studies, and psychological experiments. The findings of all his data verify his assertion well, though somehow I feel jilted. There is so much more to life than reproduction and procreation of the species. Attraction is not as simple a matter as genetic predilection and instinct, or generalizations in psychology. Ridley covers deviations very little, and explains why they exist (as byproducts or mutations). Overall, I vastly understand the world of sexual selection as a major contributor to our present customs and inclinations as a species. The rant on evolution at the end felt out of place, but the conclusion was concise. The value of the Red Queen is its compilation of data to support the relevance of sex in our evolution. "
57,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8739994-darrel,4,"Matt Ridley is a consistently good science writer and he does not disappoint in The Red Queen. The research and writing are solid. I should have read it many years ago when it first came out. My main criticism is that it is somewhat dated. It appears that he wrote nothing of the Bonobos in the original edition then threw in a few paragraphs in the later edition. Unfortunately, the information about Bonobo sexuality is important and should have informed his conclusions more. I do recommend it, but read with the knowledge that the original was written over 10 years ago and new information and research has emerged which is not taken into consideration. I don't think his conclusions would be radically changed, but certainly would be better nuanced.Dr. Darrel Ray, author of Sex and God: How Religion Distorts Sexuality, and The God Virus."
58,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75567-nils-samuels,3,"Consolidates ideas from anthropology and biology, arguing most interestingly for significant evolutionary differences between males and females, applied first to other animals and then to humans. First half of the book sets up the more homocentric second half. The summary: men are naturally polygamous, women naturally monogamous. Men like youth and beauty. Women like wealth and power. Civilization works for the greatest good when monogamy rules, since polygamy favors a select few and leaves many others partnerless. Otherwise the rich men in their sports cars would steal all the thunder and the lightning as well. And many more men would kill each other for beauty, literally not just metaphorically. "
59,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2296903-jana,4,"It's important to understand that evolution is not a process of improvement. Natural selection simply asserts that species change as they adapt to ever-changing environments. Evolution is not a process by which human beings or societies become better. Those organisms best able to survive in a challenging, shifting environment live to reproduce. The environment can change at any moment, thus neutralizing any advantage of any species.Sex provides the necessary variation that keeps evolution going, and without constant evolution, competitors and environmental change would lead to extinction of all species.

60,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,4,"Would you like to more thoroughly understand why people are the way they are and why they do the crazy shit they do? If so, this book would be a great place to start. It's one of those ridiculously insight inducing reads. It's also one of those books that you absolutely can not judge by its cover. Or by its first and last chapters. Curious? Than by all means read on. One of the things that put me off of the book (before I actually read it) was the title The Red Queen. I'm dreadfully embarrassed to admit that I assumed it had something to do with menstruation. Not that there's anything wrong with menstruation. I just wasn't particularly motivated to commit a decent chunk of my ""one wild life"" to a long form exploration of that particular subject.When I actually read the book, I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't about menstruation at all. The title is actually a clever reference to Lewis Carroll's Red Queen from Through the Looking-Glass, a character who has to keep running to stay in the same place. Matt Ridley's hypothesis is that sex is essentially an organisms strategy for outwitting its constantly mutating internal predators (e.g. parasites, viruses etc.), a process he likens to an arms race. The point being, that in any sort of arms race, both sides work their asses off just to maintain their relative positions against the other. Essentially running in place. Hence ""The Red Queen"" analogy. Another reason I was reluctant to read the book, before a I actually read the book, was that I was sort of convinced that sexual selection (as opposed to natural selection all red in tooth and claw) was the lesser feature of Darwin's dangerous idea. After actually reading the book, I have essentially experienced a 180 degree change in perspective. I now view sexual selection as possessing awesome explanatory power. The Red Queen bravely attempts to address dozens of difficult questions regarding the otherwise mysterious workings of human nature and culture. Far form perfect. Provisional and dated. But nevertheless less brilliantly written and entertaining as all get out. The Red Queen offers an extraordinarily generative approach for interpreting the human condition and how it has evolved.I highly recommend actually reading this book."
61,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This book one star deducted because of the long-winded introduction. I almost added it at the end though, because that was so brilliant. This is a lucid, immensely readable book about the evolutinary foundation of human nature. It starts out with animals and covers much the same ground as ""the Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins that I read not long ago. However, it as soon as it moves into the deeper waters of human nature it becomes vastly more interesting.Humang beings are just another animal species. We're not very special - other species have culture and language too, although not as finely honed as humans'. We run on instinct too, as learning is costly and dangerous. Language learning and a fear of snakes, for example, are hard-wired in our brains. Speaking of brains, why are ours so big? Matt Ridley presents the thoughs of Miller, who thinks it's selected for. Human beings are very keen on wit and humour (come think of it, so am I) and this has been sexually selected for. To keep ahead in the ferocious inter-species competition, men had to be ever smarter and this lead to an ever-increasing brain size for both genders. We live on gossip and deception and the most succesful of us tend to be the best ""mindreaders"". ""The choosines of human beings in picking their mates has driven the human mind into a history of frenzied expansion for no reason except that wit, virtuosity, inventiveness and individuality turn other people on"". It's an interesting theory at any rate! Anyone interested in human nature and why we are as we are should read this book. Fascinating! This works well as an introduction to both human nature and evolution."
62,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1641357-alexa,4,"I was wrong: Upon completion I'd say this. This started out so dry that I almost gave up, but I ended up really liking it. Very scientific review of why humans have 2 genders and aren't hermaphrodides, what advantages procreating through sex rather than one of the many other ways has etc. Once you get past the first 1/3 it becomes much more understandable and interesting. Rule 1 for all humans, ""success in life equals having grandchildren survive to adulthood"" (read - pass on your genes). Approach for men, that translates into the quantity of sexual partners Approach for women, that translates into quality of sexual partners. And the rest are fascinating deductions from that rule and those approaches. Just jump over the first chapters. Reminds me of one of my all time favorites. That is ""Brain Sex"" which surely has a better name, but is no more intersteing in the end."
63,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,4,"Sex and evolution -- always fun topics and even more fun when you throw them together. I must becoming centrist in my old age, because I found Ridley's approach to strike just the right tone between authoritative and skeptical. Nothing is certain, but certain theories seem to hold more sway. Ridley's narrative also makes it clear that the answer is probably in the middle of conflicting theories, human nature being as complex as it is.My two favorite takeaways from the book: 1) Sex is most probably an evolutionary response to dealing with disease. 2) The human mind is the equivalent of the peacock tail -- a quirk of human-ness that evolved to attract mates. Now I know why creativity is so sexual."
64,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6601778-parker-f,4,"A fascinating book on my favorite topic. The author refreshingly acknowledges that half of the theories he espouses in the book are likely to be wrong; for instance, I am highly skeptical of Ridley's theory that human large-brainedness arose from runaway sexual selection favoring cute, disproportionately large heads. Nonetheless, I have no good reason to doubt this, and, as Ridley notes, all arguments of runaway sexual selection involve somewhat circular reasoning. I was fond of Ridley's literary allusions to illustrate the primalness of our evolutionarily-shaped motivations. Finally, this book is highly motivational with regards to my life's goal of acquiring a large harem. "

The author is quick to clarify, but often writes in a style that seems to deliberately generate an overlarge need to clarify - this is a book of meandering thoughts for the most part. Ridley strives to sound neutral, but always gives the impression of having an agenda (although if it's any more developed than 'hey, use my cool metaphor', I missed it). Still, it raises some interesting questions, for all that it pretends to greater certainty than is really warranted in such a rapidly evolving field of study."

My uncle sent it to my daughter, so I wanted to read it first. I'd let her read it, but I don't know why she would want to. He states a theory, and then loves to say, but, wait, in the black tailed, orange-rimmed sage grouse, the opposite happens. It's annoying how he picks out a totally obscure animal/insect/bacteria to prove the theory has flaws. Clearly, he has done an amazing amount of research - but to what end? I'm going to need to read some 4 & 5 star reviews to see what the point of this book is. "

71,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2775247-alexander-tomislav,5,"This book sets a case that sexual selection is the reason, as for the peacock's tail, so for the human intelligence as well. The title comes from Lewis Carroll's ""Alice through the Looking Glass"" character of Red Queen, who, the faster she goes, the more she stays in place. This is related to the evolutionary phenomenon of ""locked"" development, such as between parasites and hosts. The more parasites adapt to hosts' defenses, the more defenses will be evolved in the hosts.Drawing on many a research, the author starts with examples from the animal world, examining clues and evidence from a geneticist's, evolutionist's and ecological points of view. Biggest clue is how many features of animals (long tail feathers and bright colors in some birds, for example) serve more for the organism to breed, than to survive. Indeed, driven by the genes' impetus to replicate, it's more ""Breeding of the fittest"" than survival.One of the biggest problems that evolutionary science faces is the attitude, common in humanistic sciences, that male and female brains are identical. Not so, claims the author, and the reasoning is compelling and sound - just as different environmental pressures caused male and female bodies to be different, it did the same to our brains. No amount of wishful thinking or political correctness can make that different. However, he's quick to point out ""Give men an inch of inequality and they will claim a mile of bias."". The human body blueprint is female, and only through two testosterone bursts (in womb and at the start of puberty) does it become masculine. Environment plays a big role in gene expression and the author demonstrates in multiple places how nature and nurture aren't opposites, but work together. As a reason for explosive development of the human brain, the author shows how the competition between members of the same species drove that development. We didn't become smarter to make tools, or to hunt, or to develop language and society. Many animals hunt, have complicated social dynamics, use tools and rudimentary communication. We evolved big brains to outwit each other.Until humanity accepts what it is, instead of vainly focusing on what it should be, we can't advance as a species. Selected quotes:""Human nature is a product of culture, but culture is also a product of human nature, and both are the products of evolution."" [pg 6.]""Humanity is, of course, morally free to make and remake itself infinitely, but we do not do so. We stick to the same monotonously human pattern of organizing our affairs. If we were more adventurous, there would be societies without love, without ambition, without sexual desire, without marriage, without art, without grammar, without music, without smilesâ and with as many unimaginable novelties as are in that list. There would be societies in which women killed each other more often than men, in which old people were considered more beautiful than twenty-year-olds, in which wealth did not purchase power over others, in which people did not discriminate in favor of their own friends and against strangers, in which parents did not love their own children."" [pg. 7]""Evolution is something that happens to organisms. It is a directionless process that sometimes makes an animalâs descendants more complicated, sometimes simpler, and sometimes changes them not at all. We are so steeped in notions of progress and self-improvement that we find it strangely hard to accept this."" [pg. 31]""Nicholas Humphrey, a Cambridge psychologist, was the first to see clearly the solution to this puzzle. We use our intellects not to solve practical problems but to outwit each other. Deceiving people, detecting deceit, understanding peopleâs motives, manipulating peopleâ these are what the intellect is used for. So what matters is not how clever and crafty you are but how much more clever and craftier you are than other people. The value of intellect is infinite. Selection within the species is always going to be more important than selection between the species."" [pg. 34]""Sex is about disease. It is used to combat the threat from parasites. Organisms need sex to keep their genes one step ahead of their parasites. Men are not redundant after all; they are womanâs insurance policy against her children being wiped out by influenza and smallpox..."" [pg. 86]""The goal for every female animal is to find a mate with sufficient genetic quality to make a good husband, a good father, or a good sire. The goal for every male animal is often to find as many wives as possible and sometimes to find good mothers and dams, only rarely to find good wives. In 1972, Robert Trivers noticed the reason for this asymmetry, which runs right through the animal kingdom; the rare exceptions to his rule prove why it generally holds. The sex that invests most in rearing the youngâ by carrying a fetus for nine months in its belly, for exampleâ is the sex that makes the least profit from an extra mating. The sex that invests the least has time to spare to seek other mates. Therefore, broadly speaking, males invest less and seek quantity of mates, while females invest more and seek quality of mates."" [pg. 132]""Murder is ânaturalâ in the sense that our ape relatives commit it regularly, as apparently did our human ancestors. Prejudice, hate, violence, crueltyâ all are more or less part of our nature, and all can be effectively countered by the right kind of nurture. Nature is not inflexible but malleable."" [pg. 181]""Lesbians, free of constraints imposed by male nature, do not suddenly indulge in sexual promiscuity; on the contrary, they are remarkably monogamous. None of this is surprising: Female animals gain little from sexual opportunism, for their reproductive ability is limited not by how many males they mate with but how long it takes to bear offspring. In this respect men and women are very different."" [pg. 218]""[...]the ban on polygamous marriage does not prevent the males from seeking polygamous matings. Adultery is common. It is most common between high-ranking males and females of all ranks. To prevent it males try to guard their wives, are extremely violent toward their wivesâ lovers, and copulate with their wives frequently, not just when they are fertile."" [pg. 234]""The noble savage, far from living in contented sexual equanimity, was paranoid about becoming, and intent on making his neighbor into, a cuckold[...] Cuckoldry paranoia is deep-seated in men. The use of veils, chaperones, purdah, female circumcision, and chastity belts all bear witness to a widespread male fear of being cuckolded and a widespread suspicion that wives, as well as their potential lovers, are the ones to distrust[...] Jealousy is a âhuman universal,â and no culture lacks it. Despite the best efforts of anthropologists to find a society with no jealousy and so prove that it is an emotion introduced by pernicious social pressure or pathology, sexual jealousy seems to be an unavoidable part of being a human being."" [pg. 235]""There has been no genetic change since we were hunter-gatherers, but deep in the mind of the modern man is a simple male hunter-gatherer rule: Strive to acquire power and use it to lure women who will bear heirs; strive to acquire wealth and use it to buy other menâs wives who will bear bastards. It began with a man who shared a piece of prized fish or honey with an attractive neighborâs wife in exchange for a brief affair and continues with a pop star ushering a model into his Mercedes. From fish to Mercedes, the history is unbroken: via skins and beads, plows and cattle, swords and castles. Wealth and power are means to women; women are means to genetic eternity."" [pg. 244]""Testosterone is an ancient chemical, found in much the same form throughout the vertebrates. Its concentration determines aggressiveness so exactly that in birds with reversed sex roles, such as phalaropes and in female-dominated hyena clans, it is the females that have higher levels of testosterone in the blood. Testosterone masculinizes the body; without it, the body remains female, whatever its genes. It also masculinizes the brain."" [pg. 254]""Baby girls are more interested in smiling, communicating, and in people, boys in action and things. Shown cluttered pictures, boys select objects, girls people. Boys are instantly obsessed with dismantling, assembling, destroying, possessing, and coveting things. Girls are fascinated by people and treat their toys as surrogate people. Hence, to suit their mentalities, we have invented toys that suit each sex. We give boys tractors and girls dolls. We are reinforcing the stereotypical obsessions that they already have, but we are not creating them."" [pg. 256]""The Israeli kibbutz system has proved to be a large natural experiment in the persistence of sex roles. Men and women were initially encouraged to drop all sex roles in kibbutzim: Haircuts and clothes were unisex; boys were encouraged to be peaceful and sensitive, while girls were treated like tomboys; men did household chores and women went out to work. Yet three generations later, the attempt has largely been abandoned, and kibbutz life is actually more sexist than life in the rest of Israel. People have returned to stereotypes. Men politick, while women tend the home; boys study physics and become engineers, while girls study sociology and become teachers and nurses. Women manage the morale, health, and education of the kibbutz, while men manage the finances, security, and business.[...] Women clean house in a kibbutz because, like women everywhere, they complain that men would not do it properly. Men do not clean house in a kibbutz because, like men everywhere, they complain that if they did, their wives would say it had not been done properly."" [pg. 260]""The bizarre thing about this assertion of different natures is that it is a thoroughly feminist assertion. There is a contradiction at the heart of feminism, one that few feminists have acknowledged. You cannot say, first, that men and women are equally capable of all jobs and, second, that if jobs were done by women, they would be done differently. So feminism itself is anything but egalitarian. Feminists argue explicitly that if more women were in charge, more caring values would prevail. They begin from the presumption that women are by nature different beings. If women ran the world, there would be no war. When women run companies, cooperation, not competition, is the watchword. These are all explicit and firm assertions of sexism: that the personalities and natures of women are different from men. If womenâs personalities are different, is it not likely that they will prove better or worse at certain jobs than men? Differences cannot be appealed to when they suit and denied when they do not."" [pg. 261]""The assertion that âcultureâ explains human variation will be taken seriously when there are reports of women war parties raiding villages to capture men as husbands, or of parents cloistering their sons but not their daughters to protect their sonsâ virtue, or when cultural distributions for preferences concerning physical attractiveness, earning power, relative age, and so on show as many cultures with bias in one direction as in the other."" [pg. 275]""Somewhere in our education we unthinkingly absorb the idea that nature (genes) and nurture (environment) are opposites and that we must make a choice between them. If we choose environmentalism, then we are espousing a universal human nature that is as blank as a sheet of paper awaiting cultureâs pen, that humans are therefore perfectible and born equal. If we choose genes, then we espouse irreversible genetic differences between races and between individuals. We are fatalists and elitists. Who would not hope with all her heart that the geneticists were wrong?"" [pg. 317]""If you want to understand human motives, read Proust or Trollope or Tom Wolfe, not Freud or Piaget or Skinner. We are obsessed with one anotherâs minds. âOur intuitive commonsense psychology far surpasses any scientific psychology in scope and accuracy,â wrote Don Symons. 39 Horace Barlow points out that great literary minds are, almost by definition, great mind-reading minds."" [pg. 333]""Robert Trivers has argued that to deceive others well, an animal must deceive itself, and that self-deceptionâs hallmark is a biased system of transfer from the conscious to the unconscious mind. Deception is therefore the reason for the invention of the subconscious."" [pg.335]""Mankind is a self-domesticated animal; a mammal; an ape; a social ape; an ape in which the male takes the iniative in courtship and females usually leave the society of their birth; an ape in which men are predators, women herbivorous foragers; an ape in which males are relatively hierarchical, females relatively egalitarian; an ape in which males contribute unusually large amounts of investment in the upbringing of their offspring by provisioning their mates and their children with food, protection, and company; an ape in which monogamous pair bonds are the rule but many males have affairs and occasional males achieve polygamy; an ape in which females mated to low-ranking males often cuckold their husbands in order to gain access to the genes of higher-ranking males; an ape that has been subject to unusually intense mutual sexual selection so that many of the features of the female body (lips, breasts, waists) and the mind of both sexes (songs, competitive ambition, status seeking) are designed for use in competition for mates; an ape that has developed an extraordinary range of new instincts to learn by association, to communicate by speech, and to pass on traditions. But still an ape.""[pg.348]"
72,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3355789-mark,4,"In a frenetic effort to stay interesting, Matt Ridley unconsciously finishes his book with a terrific built-in summary by introducing Robin Dunbar's ""Scherazade Effect"" which is the frenetic effort to stay interesting, with sex and hence reproduction and life itself at stake.The book's a little like that: Matt's a consummate researcher and very good at explaining, and he's scraped together a mountain of anecdotes in support of his thesis which is, what exactly? It's kind of a little bit lost in all the stories but basically looking for the reason we are people instead of ordinary animals, he finds sexual selection and the need to be attractive as causal in the case of neoteny, big brains, language, tools, dominant men and sexy women, everything you want.There are a million uncomfortable moments wherein simple circular dynamics diverge in unstable fashion to a new set point, like a peacock's feathers or human brains or a whale's (two ton!) gonads. Like Ridley, I couldn't resist a teaser there, but the  point  is that like so many, Ridley has a hard time wrapping his brain around recursive iterative dynamics. Since that's my JOB, I'm ok with it, but remember being frustrated and tied in a mental knot by the chicken / egg / chicken problem of feedback in physical systems. I do feel the analogy's apt though. There doesn't have to be a driving reason for everything, if a tiny nudge can suffice to loose an avalanche of consequent evolution. I find that believable.One thing he might have missed, in trying to explain us (humans) in an area cosmologists have long since overcome, which is the ""we're not special"" or ""duh, because WE're here"" explanation as to why the sun is just the right temperature or the boltzman constant just so: the reason is that the people in that potential universe or on that potential planet just arent. They aren't there, they entirely aint. I'm doing a horrible job explaining that, but basically SOMEBODY had to be on the top of the food chain and I'm personally glad to be lucky enough that it's me. Why am  I  thinking about evolution? My answer? ""Because if I were an ant I couldn't."" I think Ridley misses that he doesn't have to go searching for some reason why WE in particular are special. We're just lucky that way; ~ somebody had to be.Ahh, never mind all that. In summary, it's hard to dislike a guy who calls both Freud and Skinner misguided. This is a fun book and certainly has a lot of truth in it. Ridley wants a main theme and maybe hasn't got one, but he doesn't need it anyway. Bravo.-------------------------------Here's a long postscript on why there's a 50:50 ratio of the sexes.Gina asked why males aren't rare, since it wouldn't seem so many are necessary. I re-read a whole chapter & wrote this reply...The answer, in the Red Queen, lies around page 100. It's long and complex and, in case you want to cut to the chase, finally an unsatisfying answer.First I think I noted that male and female as different genders are an idea organized around using organelles (mitochondria) from just ONE parent. Apparently otherwise competition between them within the cell is destructive, so it's better to just pick one parent from which to get 'em. (It's the female: the sperm is stripped of all but its nucleus in the catharsis of fertilization.)Why not hermaphrodites came up next and the answer was that in a hermaphroditic population, there would be instabilities, for example a tendency to kill off your male parts would make more resources available to the female nature, which would be thereby advantaged. Ultrafemmes would outperform hermaphrodites as mothers, and in so doing, make sperm scarce. Female killer genes could also then prosper, these making a new offspring hypermale. So an instability is encouraged by the basic idea of commitment: by being ""all in"" in one's choice of sex, you have a better chance of success than playing both sides & thereby hedging two bets badly.So far we still don't have any reason why the numbers should be so easily balanced. There are plenty of creatures where that's not the case, and there are ""driving"" genes that cause sex ratio distortion. Ritter he documents one human family wherein only girls were born. Why wouldn't such a thing, this parthenogenesis, catch on, at least in some proportion? All these different causes seem like tendencies that ought to swing towards some optimal ratio which would (obviously?) benefit from a male percentage << 50%. ...and that's your question, still unanswered. Lemmings actually solve it with a third sex chromosome that biases the odds towards females, a seemingly better system. Are we just unlucky vs lemmings?He delves briefly into other systems, as when unfertilized eggs become male (a clearly stable situation) or my favorite, when ALL the fish in the school are female, save the biggest, who changes teams to fulfill his duties. I guess the point is, there are plenty of exceptions to the rule. Ridley delights in these digressions.Then there were many more anecdotes, sort of diffusing away into a fog of confusion, doubtless why I forgot this next point. ""Munching a burrito"" with some scientist, he notes that dominant women & monkeys (& cows and chickens) have more sons, that female hormones not genetics tend most (and there are many factors) to bias the sex ratios, and a shortage of men makes for dominant females. It doesn't seem to ""tend"" towards exactly 50:50 or even be strongly supported, certainly not convincingly so in the face of the profligate polygamous male hypothesis. So the question goes down as being self corrected by mysterious and non genetic means. Unsatisfying. More theories then follow, but many of these have to do with social criteria pertinent only to humans (you can always marry a beautiful daughter up-caste, but not a son) but these theories do not answer as to why farmers have failed to breed female only lines of cattle, however hard they try. That last observation was a quote from Dawkins, and seemingly his last word. I have to suspect Ridley should have accepted this as unknown and ended the chapter there.At least, I will."
73,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature by Matt RidleyâThe Red Queen"" is the very interesting book about how human nature evolved as a result of sex. According to the author, human beings were âdesignedâ to reproduce and that without understanding competitive reproduction we will not be able to comprehend the human psyche and nature. Well known journalist, scientist and educator; Matt Ridley, brings us a well-rounded science book that deals with many fascinating topics involving sexual evolution. The first third of book or so starts off a little dense and may put off some readers but once it picks up it really takes off and rewards readers with invaluable knowledge. This 416-page book is composed of the following ten chapters: 1. Human Nature, 2. The Enigma, 3. The Power of Parasites, 4. Genetic Mutiny and Gender, 5. The Peacockâs Tale, 6. Polygamy and the Nature of Men, 7. Monogamy and the Nature of Women, 8. Sexing the Mind, 9. The Uses of Beauty, and 10. The Intellectual Chess Game. Positives:1.	A well-written and well-researched book. 2.	The fascinating topic of sexual evolution in the hands of a master.3.	The book was originally published in 1993 but it holds up generally well and itâs still worth reading.4.	Good use of the best that science had to offer at that time.5.	Thought-provoking and refreshingly honest and witty approach.6.	Provides compelling arguments in support of a universal human nature.7.	Explains the reasoning behind the title which is a metaphor in evolution for âthe faster you run, the more the world moves with you and the less you make progressâ.8.	Some great analogies, âThe fashion in evolutionary science now is to scoff at progress; evolution is a treadmill, not a ladderâ.9.	What sex is. A look from three different kinds of scientists. Great stuff.10.	The unbelievable world of sex in both the animal and plant kingdom.11.	Some great facts and perspectives, âThe âgreat warâ of 1914-18 killed 25 million people in four years. The influenza epidemic that followed killed 25 million in four monthsâ.12.	What drive the evolution of sex.13.	Understanding what evolution is in a practical sense.14.	How science works to address a problem.15.	Understanding gender in terms of âgenetic lotteryâ. Or leave it to the environment.16.	Some great anecdotes, âAnaxagoraâs belief that lying on the right side during sex would produce a boy was so influential that centuries later some French aristocrats had their left testicles amputatedâ. Ouch!17.	The nature of âchoosyâ females.18.	The two warring factions in sexual selection: âFisherâ and âGood-genesâ.19.	Testosterone and its relation to disease.20.	What men find attractive in women.21.	The impact of human culture.22.	An honest look at the roles of the sexes.23.	An understanding about homosexual behavior.24.	Game theory and how it plays out between males and females. Always interesting.25.	Human evolution always fascinating.26.	The growth of our brains.27.	Understanding the evil practice of female infanticide.28.	Power as a tool for sexual success. Itâs good being the king.29.	Marriage, understanding the institution of.30.	Adultery and how it shaped human society.31.	Fascinating look at what societies favor daughters over sons and vice versa.32.	The differences of mental features between the sexes.33.	A look at social statuses.34.	The innate instinct of learning language.35.	The evidence for neoteny.36.	Links to notes worked great! Negatives:1.	The first third or so of the book was a bit dense and may have put off some readers.2.	Despite holding up generally well (book was published in 1993), some topics are outdated. For instance, free will is an illusion. I will provide a list of suggestion that offers more up to date information.3.	Animal altruism is not a myth.4.	Some topics are fairly logical. We all have a basic grasp of sexual selection.5.	Some topics may irk feminists. Let me leave it at that.6.	The author purposely sidesteps the issue of morality and the little that is here is inadequate.7.	âDeception is therefore the reason for the invention of the subconscious.â â Trivers Really?In summary, I wished I had read this book when it first came out in 1993. The book started off a little dry but once it gets going I wasnât able to put it down. Many topics of popular interest in the hands of an accomplished author make for good reading. In spite of its age, I learned some new things and have a much better grasp of why human nature evolved as a result of sex. If you have the patience to make it through the early chapters the book will reward you with wisdom, worth reading! Further recommendations: ""Humanâ and âWhoâs In Charge?â by Michael S.

A review by Ralph Hermansen.I would buy Matt Ridley's next book without hesitation, no matter what the topic. He is one of the few authors who thoroughly researches his subject and understands the science underlying it. He then delivers the information to you in an interesting way. You certainly get your money's worth in his books.""The Red Queen"" is about the evolutionary forces which has shaped us as human beings. The significance of Lewis Carroll's Red Queen from the book, ""Alice in Wonderland"", is that we have to run just to stand still. So it is with evolution. We have to improve our survival skills over the generations to keep pace with the other plants and animals which are also advancing in their survival skills.Much of what we are as humans has to do with sexual selection. Charles Darwin introduced the concept of natural selection in his book, ""Origin of the Species"", but he devoted an even greater deal of space to his concept of sexual selection in his book, ""The Descent of Man"". No matter how superior you are in survival abilities, it is all for naught if you do not pass those traits on to your offspring. Therefore mating is vitally important. You must be attractive to the opposite sex and this manifests itself in diverse ways amongst the animals. Moreover, sexual selection may create traits that seem to work against survivability. The peacock would certainly be better served with a smaller, less ornate tail, which makes him a more obvious target for predators.Ridley picks up where Darwin left off and explores the sexuality of humans as they have evolved from apes and gradually became a big brained animal over millions of years of evolution. He has incorporated most of the ideas of modern scientists related to this subject. Men are attracted to beauty and women are attracted to powerful men, who can provide for them. In the animal kingdom, the female selects the male with the best traits and the males are willing to mate with most any female in heat. The case has become different for modern humans because human babies are helpless far longer than in normal in the animal kingdom. This is a consequence of out massive brain, which must continue developing outside the womb.One part of the book did leave me surprised. Ridley got so caught up in his analysis of what women would do in selecting men that he surmised that women would rarely engage in opportunistic sex as it is against their self interest. Mr. Ridley, if you had been single and dating in California in the 1970's, you would soon realize how very mistaken you are. Many women had decided that they were now equal to men and could enjoy the same pleasures and they did. A few years later, fear of AIDS put an end to this libertine period. Alas!Aside from that mistaken projection, the Red Queen book is excellent and I think you will enjoy reading it. Ralph Hermansen 10/04/08 "

It consists of a, not completely unbiased review of our knowledge on the subjects of a human evolution and inherent nature beautifully stated by a superfluous pen with a deep understanding and fiery passion on the subject.

Why did it happen to one ape and not another? What can account for the astonishing speed, and the accelerating speed of the change?

80,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1251066-andy,3,"I've been meaning to read this for years, after an old flat-mate told me about it while studying for his BSc in the psychology of attraction. Finally found it in a charity shop in Tunbridge Wells and decided to finish of the year with some evolutionary pondering.Matt Ridley freely states that the first third may not be as interesting to some as he details the background of evolutionary theory in relation to sexual activity and behaviour in animals. Dry perhaps, may be a better term. It's the later parts of the book though where things get interesting, looking at how human nature (if indeed humans can be said to have a specific 'nature') may (or may not) have been shaped by evolutionary pressures. There are many fascinating examples and case studies, compiled expertly by Ridley. As he again mentions, he has compiled these mostly from the work of others, trying to tie a lot of individual theories and evidence together. Generally he manages a good job and it's eminently readable.Whether or not you agree or believe is entirely another matter and really, books such as this should be read to educate and promote discussion. He doesn't (and shouldn't) attempt to claim a definitive conclusion and many avenues are left open to debate. I personally found it compelling. My biggest issue is how out of date much of the evidence (and some occasional clumsy discussions, particularly around homosexuality) is now, having been written almost 20 years ago. I would certainly be interested in reading a more up to date discussion of the state of the field.Still, a well recognised and deserved text, worth reading."
81,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361083-erwin,5,"Excellent book. Definitely worth reading for everyone, particularly followers of any religion.Summary is that Human Intelligence, just like a peacocks feathers, are the result of Sexual Selection. The more intelligent, the more able to outsmart other humans, and the more able to mate --- this especially applies to men.Few aspects of human nature can be understood apart from sex, since human nature is a product of evolution, and evolution in our case is driven specifically by sexual replication.The book begins with an evolutionary account of sex itself, defending the theory that sex flourishes, despite its energetic costs, primarily because a sexually mixed heritage confers to offspring a defensive ""head start"" against parasites received from and originally adapted to the maternal host environment.Human intelligence is largely a result of sexual selection. Human intelligence far outstrips any survivalist demands that would have been placed on our hominid ancestors, and analogizes human intelligence to the peacock's tail, a trait widely believed to be the result of sexual selection. Human intelligence is used primarily to attract mates through prodigious displays of wit, charm, inventiveness, and individuality.Next I should read The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature."
82,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5619806-veronica,2,"Okay, so the good points of the book: when the author discusses the up to date and relevant research of scientists, he does so respectfully, succinctly, and accurately. He does not both too much with alternative perspectives, but for the most part, while sometimes unpalatable information, I tend to agree with the information. The worse points of the book: his own opinion is often absurd. His methods of making the information relatable is, in my opinion, stupid. He lacks the creativity to make a compelling story out of facts, and frankly, the theories are often so elegant and beautiful, it's unnecessary anyway. Finally, in his final depressing notes, he not just criticizes, but attempts to entirely discredit pioneers in many different fields, none of which he is an expert in. Even if some of the theories are no longer considered accurate or represent our world model, they paved the path for future endeavours which have enhanced our knowledge of the natural world and our place within it. Finally, several of the individuals he attempted to discredit are still at the forefront of their fields and are still considered accurate and representative of present day findings. Following this, he gives us his own uneducated opinions on where he thinks the future will take us. The only reason he got two stars at all was because of the research he did present and do justice to. I'm shocked this book has such high reviews. I was so looking forward to reading it. "

Matt Ridley manages to handle the subject with such an elegance, concision and property quite difficult to find among ""entrepreneurial"" scholars nowadays. This book is really informative and not just another idiot trying to make some extra-money by spreading pseudo-science.A must read if you want to get acquainted with the ways of modern Biology and Human Sciences in general; yet, you will find a lot of ingenious answers to common misconceptions and useful knowledge to understand the wonderful intricacies of social interaction at an animal level.And yes, it is an easy replacement for bad literature; for you see, It'll make you feel better with yourself, get you laid more often or just serve as a good excuse to keep your fidelity."
84,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/689670-joanna,1,"My review of this book can be summed up in a quote from the very end of the book, ""Half the ideas in this book are probably wrong."" That's probably a generous estimate on the author's part! I would also add ""sexist"" to ""wrong."" If only I'd read the end first, I could've saved myself a lot of frustration.A sampling:""The best [men] can hope for now is a good-looking younger mistress and a devoted wife who is traded in every decade or so. We're back to square one."" ""Inject all pregnant women with the right dose of hormones, and the result would be men and women with normal bodies but identical female brains. War, rape, boxing, car racing, pornography, and hamburgers and beer would soon be distant memories.""Then he talks about how women with Turner's syndrome are born without ovaries. ""They are exaggeratedly feminine in their behavior, with typically a special interest in babies, clothes, housekeeping, and romantic stories.""This book is bad science based in sexist stereotypes. Ironically, I read it for my feminist book club!"
85,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22176981-olivera,2,"Even though Matt Ridley said in his epilogue to this book that he doesn't regret including animals in this book I found it to be a flaw that can't necessarily be overcome. This isn't a book you will enjoy unless you are a fan of biology and the behavior of animals (which I in fact am not).I went into this expecting exactly what the title promised: the evolution of human nature, yet there was more talk about birds, insects, apes and snails than there actually was about humans. While I do understand that giving a kind of background for this topic is necessary, to me it seemed like it was overdone. Only in the last third did it actually focus on the theme it was supposed to focus on, but the 200+ pages that took me to get there weren't really worth it. There were some very interesting theories here, but I found a few facts being repeated over and over again. I don't really know what to say. I'm just pretty disappointed in The Red Queen and I'll be hesitant to pick up anything regarding this subject in the future, even though I am interested in it."

Ridley cites Darwin, multiple fascinating biological studies, and psychological experiments. The findings of all his data verify his assertion well, though somehow I feel jilted. There is so much more to life than reproduction and procreation of the species. Attraction is not as simple a matter as genetic predilection and instinct, or generalizations in psychology. Ridley covers deviations very little, and explains why they exist (as byproducts or mutations). Overall, I vastly understand the world of sexual selection as a major contributor to our present customs and inclinations as a species. The rant on evolution at the end felt out of place, but the conclusion was concise. The value of the Red Queen is its compilation of data to support the relevance of sex in our evolution. "
87,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8739994-darrel,4,"Matt Ridley is a consistently good science writer and he does not disappoint in The Red Queen. The research and writing are solid. I should have read it many years ago when it first came out. My main criticism is that it is somewhat dated. It appears that he wrote nothing of the Bonobos in the original edition then threw in a few paragraphs in the later edition. Unfortunately, the information about Bonobo sexuality is important and should have informed his conclusions more. I do recommend it, but read with the knowledge that the original was written over 10 years ago and new information and research has emerged which is not taken into consideration. I don't think his conclusions would be radically changed, but certainly would be better nuanced.Dr. Darrel Ray, author of Sex and God: How Religion Distorts Sexuality, and The God Virus."

First half of the book sets up the more homocentric second half. The summary: men are naturally polygamous, women naturally monogamous. Men like youth and beauty. Women like wealth and power. Civilization works for the greatest good when monogamy rules, since polygamy favors a select few and leaves many others partnerless. Otherwise the rich men in their sports cars would steal all the thunder and the lightning as well. And many more men would kill each other for beauty, literally not just metaphorically. "
89,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2296903-jana,4,"It's important to understand that evolution is not a process of improvement. Natural selection simply asserts that species change as they adapt to ever-changing environments. Evolution is not a process by which human beings or societies become better. Those organisms best able to survive in a challenging, shifting environment live to reproduce. The environment can change at any moment, thus neutralizing any advantage of any species.Sex provides the necessary variation that keeps evolution going, and without constant evolution, competitors and environmental change would lead to extinction of all species.

If so, this book would be a great place to start. It's one of those ridiculously insight inducing reads. It's also one of those books that you absolutely can not judge by its cover. Or by its first and last chapters. Curious? Than by all means read on. One of the things that put me off of the book (before I actually read it) was the title The Red Queen. I'm dreadfully embarrassed to admit that I assumed it had something to do with menstruation. Not that there's anything wrong with menstruation. I just wasn't particularly motivated to commit a decent chunk of my ""one wild life"" to a long form exploration of that particular subject.When I actually read the book, I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't about menstruation at all. The title is actually a clever reference to Lewis Carroll's Red Queen from Through the Looking-Glass, a character who has to keep running to stay in the same place. Matt Ridley's hypothesis is that sex is essentially an organisms strategy for outwitting its constantly mutating internal predators (e.g. parasites, viruses etc.), a process he likens to an arms race. The point being, that in any sort of arms race, both sides work their asses off just to maintain their relative positions against the other. Essentially running in place. Hence ""The Red Queen"" analogy. Another reason I was reluctant to read the book, before a I actually read the book, was that I was sort of convinced that sexual selection (as opposed to natural selection all red in tooth and claw) was the lesser feature of Darwin's dangerous idea. After actually reading the book, I have essentially experienced a 180 degree change in perspective. I now view sexual selection as possessing awesome explanatory power. The Red Queen bravely attempts to address dozens of difficult questions regarding the otherwise mysterious workings of human nature and culture. Far form perfect. Provisional and dated. But nevertheless less brilliantly written and entertaining as all get out. The Red Queen offers an extraordinarily generative approach for interpreting the human condition and how it has evolved.I highly recommend actually reading this book."
91,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This book one star deducted because of the long-winded introduction. I almost added it at the end though, because that was so brilliant. This is a lucid, immensely readable book about the evolutinary foundation of human nature. It starts out with animals and covers much the same ground as ""the Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins that I read not long ago. However, it as soon as it moves into the deeper waters of human nature it becomes vastly more interesting.Humang beings are just another animal species. We're not very special - other species have culture and language too, although not as finely honed as humans'. We run on instinct too, as learning is costly and dangerous. Language learning and a fear of snakes, for example, are hard-wired in our brains. Speaking of brains, why are ours so big? Matt Ridley presents the thoughs of Miller, who thinks it's selected for. Human beings are very keen on wit and humour (come think of it, so am I) and this has been sexually selected for. To keep ahead in the ferocious inter-species competition, men had to be ever smarter and this lead to an ever-increasing brain size for both genders. We live on gossip and deception and the most succesful of us tend to be the best ""mindreaders"". ""The choosines of human beings in picking their mates has driven the human mind into a history of frenzied expansion for no reason except that wit, virtuosity, inventiveness and individuality turn other people on"". It's an interesting theory at any rate! Anyone interested in human nature and why we are as we are should read this book. Fascinating! This works well as an introduction to both human nature and evolution."

Very scientific review of why humans have 2 genders and aren't hermaphrodides, what advantages procreating through sex rather than one of the many other ways has etc. Once you get past the first 1/3 it becomes much more understandable and interesting. Rule 1 for all humans, ""success in life equals having grandchildren survive to adulthood"" (read - pass on your genes). Approach for men, that translates into the quantity of sexual partners Approach for women, that translates into quality of sexual partners. And the rest are fascinating deductions from that rule and those approaches. Just jump over the first chapters. Reminds me of one of my all time favorites. That is ""Brain Sex"" which surely has a better name, but is no more intersteing in the end."

I must becoming centrist in my old age, because I found Ridley's approach to strike just the right tone between authoritative and skeptical. Nothing is certain, but certain theories seem to hold more sway. Ridley's narrative also makes it clear that the answer is probably in the middle of conflicting theories, human nature being as complex as it is.My two favorite takeaways from the book: 1) Sex is most probably an evolutionary response to dealing with disease. 2) The human mind is the equivalent of the peacock tail -- a quirk of human-ness that evolved to attract mates. Now I know why creativity is so sexual."

The author refreshingly acknowledges that half of the theories he espouses in the book are likely to be wrong; for instance, I am highly skeptical of Ridley's theory that human large-brainedness arose from runaway sexual selection favoring cute, disproportionately large heads. Nonetheless, I have no good reason to doubt this, and, as Ridley notes, all arguments of runaway sexual selection involve somewhat circular reasoning. I was fond of Ridley's literary allusions to illustrate the primalness of our evolutionarily-shaped motivations. Finally, this book is highly motivational with regards to my life's goal of acquiring a large harem. "

The author is quick to clarify, but often writes in a style that seems to deliberately generate an overlarge need to clarify - this is a book of meandering thoughts for the most part. Ridley strives to sound neutral, but always gives the impression of having an agenda (although if it's any more developed than 'hey, use my cool metaphor', I missed it). Still, it raises some interesting questions, for all that it pretends to greater certainty than is really warranted in such a rapidly evolving field of study."

My uncle sent it to my daughter, so I wanted to read it first. I'd let her read it, but I don't know why she would want to. He states a theory, and then loves to say, but, wait, in the black tailed, orange-rimmed sage grouse, the opposite happens. It's annoying how he picks out a totally obscure animal/insect/bacteria to prove the theory has flaws. Clearly, he has done an amazing amount of research - but to what end?

101,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2775247-alexander-tomislav,5,"This book sets a case that sexual selection is the reason, as for the peacock's tail, so for the human intelligence as well. The title comes from Lewis Carroll's ""Alice through the Looking Glass"" character of Red Queen, who, the faster she goes, the more she stays in place. This is related to the evolutionary phenomenon of ""locked"" development, such as between parasites and hosts. The more parasites adapt to hosts' defenses, the more defenses will be evolved in the hosts.Drawing on many a research, the author starts with examples from the animal world, examining clues and evidence from a geneticist's, evolutionist's and ecological points of view. Biggest clue is how many features of animals (long tail feathers and bright colors in some birds, for example) serve more for the organism to breed, than to survive. Indeed, driven by the genes' impetus to replicate, it's more ""Breeding of the fittest"" than survival.One of the biggest problems that evolutionary science faces is the attitude, common in humanistic sciences, that male and female brains are identical. Not so, claims the author, and the reasoning is compelling and sound - just as different environmental pressures caused male and female bodies to be different, it did the same to our brains. No amount of wishful thinking or political correctness can make that different. However, he's quick to point out ""Give men an inch of inequality and they will claim a mile of bias."". The human body blueprint is female, and only through two testosterone bursts (in womb and at the start of puberty) does it become masculine. Environment plays a big role in gene expression and the author demonstrates in multiple places how nature and nurture aren't opposites, but work together. As a reason for explosive development of the human brain, the author shows how the competition between members of the same species drove that development. We didn't become smarter to make tools, or to hunt, or to develop language and society. Many animals hunt, have complicated social dynamics, use tools and rudimentary communication. We evolved big brains to outwit each other.Until humanity accepts what it is, instead of vainly focusing on what it should be, we can't advance as a species. Selected quotes:""Human nature is a product of culture, but culture is also a product of human nature, and both are the products of evolution."" [pg 6.]""Humanity is, of course, morally free to make and remake itself infinitely, but we do not do so. We stick to the same monotonously human pattern of organizing our affairs. If we were more adventurous, there would be societies without love, without ambition, without sexual desire, without marriage, without art, without grammar, without music, without smilesâ and with as many unimaginable novelties as are in that list. There would be societies in which women killed each other more often than men, in which old people were considered more beautiful than twenty-year-olds, in which wealth did not purchase power over others, in which people did not discriminate in favor of their own friends and against strangers, in which parents did not love their own children."" [pg. 7]""Evolution is something that happens to organisms. It is a directionless process that sometimes makes an animalâs descendants more complicated, sometimes simpler, and sometimes changes them not at all. We are so steeped in notions of progress and self-improvement that we find it strangely hard to accept this."" [pg. 31]""Nicholas Humphrey, a Cambridge psychologist, was the first to see clearly the solution to this puzzle. We use our intellects not to solve practical problems but to outwit each other. Deceiving people, detecting deceit, understanding peopleâs motives, manipulating peopleâ these are what the intellect is used for. So what matters is not how clever and crafty you are but how much more clever and craftier you are than other people. The value of intellect is infinite. Selection within the species is always going to be more important than selection between the species."" [pg. 34]""Sex is about disease. It is used to combat the threat from parasites. Organisms need sex to keep their genes one step ahead of their parasites. Men are not redundant after all; they are womanâs insurance policy against her children being wiped out by influenza and smallpox..."" [pg. 86]""The goal for every female animal is to find a mate with sufficient genetic quality to make a good husband, a good father, or a good sire. The goal for every male animal is often to find as many wives as possible and sometimes to find good mothers and dams, only rarely to find good wives. In 1972, Robert Trivers noticed the reason for this asymmetry, which runs right through the animal kingdom; the rare exceptions to his rule prove why it generally holds. The sex that invests most in rearing the youngâ by carrying a fetus for nine months in its belly, for exampleâ is the sex that makes the least profit from an extra mating. The sex that invests the least has time to spare to seek other mates. Therefore, broadly speaking, males invest less and seek quantity of mates, while females invest more and seek quality of mates."" [pg. 132]""Murder is ânaturalâ in the sense that our ape relatives commit it regularly, as apparently did our human ancestors. Prejudice, hate, violence, crueltyâ all are more or less part of our nature, and all can be effectively countered by the right kind of nurture. Nature is not inflexible but malleable."" [pg. 181]""Lesbians, free of constraints imposed by male nature, do not suddenly indulge in sexual promiscuity; on the contrary, they are remarkably monogamous. None of this is surprising: Female animals gain little from sexual opportunism, for their reproductive ability is limited not by how many males they mate with but how long it takes to bear offspring. In this respect men and women are very different."" [pg. 218]""[...]the ban on polygamous marriage does not prevent the males from seeking polygamous matings. Adultery is common. It is most common between high-ranking males and females of all ranks. To prevent it males try to guard their wives, are extremely violent toward their wivesâ lovers, and copulate with their wives frequently, not just when they are fertile."" [pg. 234]""The noble savage, far from living in contented sexual equanimity, was paranoid about becoming, and intent on making his neighbor into, a cuckold[...] Cuckoldry paranoia is deep-seated in men. The use of veils, chaperones, purdah, female circumcision, and chastity belts all bear witness to a widespread male fear of being cuckolded and a widespread suspicion that wives, as well as their potential lovers, are the ones to distrust[...] Jealousy is a âhuman universal,â and no culture lacks it. Despite the best efforts of anthropologists to find a society with no jealousy and so prove that it is an emotion introduced by pernicious social pressure or pathology, sexual jealousy seems to be an unavoidable part of being a human being."" [pg. 235]""There has been no genetic change since we were hunter-gatherers, but deep in the mind of the modern man is a simple male hunter-gatherer rule: Strive to acquire power and use it to lure women who will bear heirs; strive to acquire wealth and use it to buy other menâs wives who will bear bastards. It began with a man who shared a piece of prized fish or honey with an attractive neighborâs wife in exchange for a brief affair and continues with a pop star ushering a model into his Mercedes. From fish to Mercedes, the history is unbroken: via skins and beads, plows and cattle, swords and castles. Wealth and power are means to women; women are means to genetic eternity."" [pg. 244]""Testosterone is an ancient chemical, found in much the same form throughout the vertebrates. Its concentration determines aggressiveness so exactly that in birds with reversed sex roles, such as phalaropes and in female-dominated hyena clans, it is the females that have higher levels of testosterone in the blood. Testosterone masculinizes the body; without it, the body remains female, whatever its genes. It also masculinizes the brain."" [pg. 254]""Baby girls are more interested in smiling, communicating, and in people, boys in action and things. Shown cluttered pictures, boys select objects, girls people. Boys are instantly obsessed with dismantling, assembling, destroying, possessing, and coveting things. Girls are fascinated by people and treat their toys as surrogate people. Hence, to suit their mentalities, we have invented toys that suit each sex. We give boys tractors and girls dolls. We are reinforcing the stereotypical obsessions that they already have, but we are not creating them."" [pg. 256]""The Israeli kibbutz system has proved to be a large natural experiment in the persistence of sex roles. Men and women were initially encouraged to drop all sex roles in kibbutzim: Haircuts and clothes were unisex; boys were encouraged to be peaceful and sensitive, while girls were treated like tomboys; men did household chores and women went out to work. Yet three generations later, the attempt has largely been abandoned, and kibbutz life is actually more sexist than life in the rest of Israel. People have returned to stereotypes. Men politick, while women tend the home; boys study physics and become engineers, while girls study sociology and become teachers and nurses. Women manage the morale, health, and education of the kibbutz, while men manage the finances, security, and business.[...] Women clean house in a kibbutz because, like women everywhere, they complain that men would not do it properly. Men do not clean house in a kibbutz because, like men everywhere, they complain that if they did, their wives would say it had not been done properly."" [pg. 260]""The bizarre thing about this assertion of different natures is that it is a thoroughly feminist assertion. There is a contradiction at the heart of feminism, one that few feminists have acknowledged. You cannot say, first, that men and women are equally capable of all jobs and, second, that if jobs were done by women, they would be done differently. So feminism itself is anything but egalitarian. Feminists argue explicitly that if more women were in charge, more caring values would prevail. They begin from the presumption that women are by nature different beings. If women ran the world, there would be no war. When women run companies, cooperation, not competition, is the watchword. These are all explicit and firm assertions of sexism: that the personalities and natures of women are different from men. If womenâs personalities are different, is it not likely that they will prove better or worse at certain jobs than men? Differences cannot be appealed to when they suit and denied when they do not."" [pg. 261]""The assertion that âcultureâ explains human variation will be taken seriously when there are reports of women war parties raiding villages to capture men as husbands, or of parents cloistering their sons but not their daughters to protect their sonsâ virtue, or when cultural distributions for preferences concerning physical attractiveness, earning power, relative age, and so on show as many cultures with bias in one direction as in the other."" [pg. 275]""Somewhere in our education we unthinkingly absorb the idea that nature (genes) and nurture (environment) are opposites and that we must make a choice between them. If we choose environmentalism, then we are espousing a universal human nature that is as blank as a sheet of paper awaiting cultureâs pen, that humans are therefore perfectible and born equal. If we choose genes, then we espouse irreversible genetic differences between races and between individuals. We are fatalists and elitists. Who would not hope with all her heart that the geneticists were wrong?"" [pg. 317]""If you want to understand human motives, read Proust or Trollope or Tom Wolfe, not Freud or Piaget or Skinner.

102,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3355789-mark,4,"In a frenetic effort to stay interesting, Matt Ridley unconsciously finishes his book with a terrific built-in summary by introducing Robin Dunbar's ""Scherazade Effect"" which is the frenetic effort to stay interesting, with sex and hence reproduction and life itself at stake.The book's a little like that: Matt's a consummate researcher and very good at explaining, and he's scraped together a mountain of anecdotes in support of his thesis which is, what exactly? It's kind of a little bit lost in all the stories but basically looking for the reason we are people instead of ordinary animals, he finds sexual selection and the need to be attractive as causal in the case of neoteny, big brains, language, tools, dominant men and sexy women, everything you want.There are a million uncomfortable moments wherein simple circular dynamics diverge in unstable fashion to a new set point, like a peacock's feathers or human brains or a whale's (two ton!) gonads. Like Ridley, I couldn't resist a teaser there, but the  point  is that like so many, Ridley has a hard time wrapping his brain around recursive iterative dynamics. Since that's my JOB, I'm ok with it, but remember being frustrated and tied in a mental knot by the chicken / egg / chicken problem of feedback in physical systems. I do feel the analogy's apt though. There doesn't have to be a driving reason for everything, if a tiny nudge can suffice to loose an avalanche of consequent evolution. I find that believable.One thing he might have missed, in trying to explain us (humans) in an area cosmologists have long since overcome, which is the ""we're not special"" or ""duh, because WE're here"" explanation as to why the sun is just the right temperature or the boltzman constant just so: the reason is that the people in that potential universe or on that potential planet just arent. They aren't there, they entirely aint. I'm doing a horrible job explaining that, but basically SOMEBODY had to be on the top of the food chain and I'm personally glad to be lucky enough that it's me. Why am  I  thinking about evolution? My answer? ""Because if I were an ant I couldn't."" I think Ridley misses that he doesn't have to go searching for some reason why WE in particular are special. We're just lucky that way; ~ somebody had to be.Ahh, never mind all that. In summary, it's hard to dislike a guy who calls both Freud and Skinner misguided. This is a fun book and certainly has a lot of truth in it. Ridley wants a main theme and maybe hasn't got one, but he doesn't need it anyway. Bravo.-------------------------------Here's a long postscript on why there's a 50:50 ratio of the sexes.Gina asked why males aren't rare, since it wouldn't seem so many are necessary. I re-read a whole chapter & wrote this reply...The answer, in the Red Queen, lies around page 100. It's long and complex and, in case you want to cut to the chase, finally an unsatisfying answer.First I think I noted that male and female as different genders are an idea organized around using organelles (mitochondria) from just ONE parent. Apparently otherwise competition between them within the cell is destructive, so it's better to just pick one parent from which to get 'em. (It's the female: the sperm is stripped of all but its nucleus in the catharsis of fertilization.)Why not hermaphrodites came up next and the answer was that in a hermaphroditic population, there would be instabilities, for example a tendency to kill off your male parts would make more resources available to the female nature, which would be thereby advantaged. Ultrafemmes would outperform hermaphrodites as mothers, and in so doing, make sperm scarce. Female killer genes could also then prosper, these making a new offspring hypermale. So an instability is encouraged by the basic idea of commitment: by being ""all in"" in one's choice of sex, you have a better chance of success than playing both sides & thereby hedging two bets badly.So far we still don't have any reason why the numbers should be so easily balanced. There are plenty of creatures where that's not the case, and there are ""driving"" genes that cause sex ratio distortion. Ritter he documents one human family wherein only girls were born. Why wouldn't such a thing, this parthenogenesis, catch on, at least in some proportion? All these different causes seem like tendencies that ought to swing towards some optimal ratio which would (obviously?) benefit from a male percentage << 50%. ...and that's your question, still unanswered. Lemmings actually solve it with a third sex chromosome that biases the odds towards females, a seemingly better system. Are we just unlucky vs lemmings?He delves briefly into other systems, as when unfertilized eggs become male (a clearly stable situation) or my favorite, when ALL the fish in the school are female, save the biggest, who changes teams to fulfill his duties. I guess the point is, there are plenty of exceptions to the rule. Ridley delights in these digressions.Then there were many more anecdotes, sort of diffusing away into a fog of confusion, doubtless why I forgot this next point. ""Munching a burrito"" with some scientist, he notes that dominant women & monkeys (& cows and chickens) have more sons, that female hormones not genetics tend most (and there are many factors) to bias the sex ratios, and a shortage of men makes for dominant females. It doesn't seem to ""tend"" towards exactly 50:50 or even be strongly supported, certainly not convincingly so in the face of the profligate polygamous male hypothesis. So the question goes down as being self corrected by mysterious and non genetic means. Unsatisfying. More theories then follow, but many of these have to do with social criteria pertinent only to humans (you can always marry a beautiful daughter up-caste, but not a son) but these theories do not answer as to why farmers have failed to breed female only lines of cattle, however hard they try. That last observation was a quote from Dawkins, and seemingly his last word. I have to suspect Ridley should have accepted this as unknown and ended the chapter there.At least, I will."

According to the author, human beings were âdesignedâ to reproduce and that without understanding competitive reproduction we will not be able to comprehend the human psyche and nature. Well known journalist, scientist and educator; Matt Ridley, brings us a well-rounded science book that deals with many fascinating topics involving sexual evolution. The first third of book or so starts off a little dense and may put off some readers but once it picks up it really takes off and rewards readers with invaluable knowledge. This 416-page book is composed of the following ten chapters: 1. Human Nature, 2. The Enigma, 3. The Power of Parasites, 4. Genetic Mutiny and Gender, 5. The Peacockâs Tale, 6. Polygamy and the Nature of Men, 7. Monogamy and the Nature of Women, 8. Sexing the Mind, 9. The Uses of Beauty, and 10. The Intellectual Chess Game. Positives:1.	A well-written and well-researched book. 2.	The fascinating topic of sexual evolution in the hands of a master.3.	The book was originally published in 1993 but it holds up generally well and itâs still worth reading.4.	Good use of the best that science had to offer at that time.5.	Thought-provoking and refreshingly honest and witty approach.6.	Provides compelling arguments in support of a universal human nature.7.	Explains the reasoning behind the title which is a metaphor in evolution for âthe faster you run, the more the world moves with you and the less you make progressâ.8.	Some great analogies, âThe fashion in evolutionary science now is to scoff at progress; evolution is a treadmill, not a ladderâ.9.	What sex is. A look from three different kinds of scientists. Great stuff.10.	The unbelievable world of sex in both the animal and plant kingdom.11.	Some great facts and perspectives, âThe âgreat warâ of 1914-18 killed 25 million people in four years. The influenza epidemic that followed killed 25 million in four monthsâ.12.	What drive the evolution of sex.13.	Understanding what evolution is in a practical sense.14.	How science works to address a problem.15.	Understanding gender in terms of âgenetic lotteryâ. Or leave it to the environment.16.	Some great anecdotes, âAnaxagoraâs belief that lying on the right side during sex would produce a boy was so influential that centuries later some French aristocrats had their left testicles amputatedâ. Ouch!17.	The nature of âchoosyâ females.18.	The two warring factions in sexual selection: âFisherâ and âGood-genesâ.19.	Testosterone and its relation to disease.20.	What men find attractive in women.21.	The impact of human culture.22.	An honest look at the roles of the sexes.23.	An understanding about homosexual behavior.24.

Understanding the evil practice of female infanticide.28.	Power as a tool for sexual success. Itâs good being the king.29.	Marriage, understanding the institution of.30.	Adultery and how it shaped human society.31.	Fascinating look at what societies favor daughters over sons and vice versa.32.	The differences of mental features between the sexes.33.	A look at social statuses.34.	The innate instinct of learning language.35.	The evidence for neoteny.36.	Links to notes worked great! Negatives:1.	The first third or so of the book was a bit dense and may have put off some readers.2.	Despite holding up generally well (book was published in 1993), some topics are outdated. For instance, free will is an illusion. I will provide a list of suggestion that offers more up to date information.3.	Animal altruism is not a myth.4.	Some topics are fairly logical. We all have a basic grasp of sexual selection.5.	Some topics may irk feminists. Let me leave it at that.6.	The author purposely sidesteps the issue of morality and the little that is here is inadequate.7.	âDeception is therefore the reason for the invention of the subconscious.â â Trivers Really?In summary, I wished I had read this book when it first came out in 1993. The book started off a little dry but once it gets going I wasnât able to put it down. Many topics of popular interest in the hands of an accomplished author make for good reading. In spite of its age, I learned some new things and have a much better grasp of why human nature evolved as a result of sex. If you have the patience to make it through the early chapters the book will reward you with wisdom, worth reading! Further recommendations: ""Humanâ and âWhoâs In Charge?â by Michael S.

The experience is much more amusing if you pause and reflect - and try to devise your own explanations - before reading the main theories.That's why it gets a 5/5.OBS: In order to better enjoy the book, I recommend reading ""The Selfish Gene"" first."
107,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13334219-ralph-hermansen,4,"""The Red Queen"" by Matt Ridley. A review by Ralph Hermansen.I would buy Matt Ridley's next book without hesitation, no matter what the topic. He is one of the few authors who thoroughly researches his subject and understands the science underlying it. He then delivers the information to you in an interesting way. You certainly get your money's worth in his books.""The Red Queen"" is about the evolutionary forces which has shaped us as human beings. The significance of Lewis Carroll's Red Queen from the book, ""Alice in Wonderland"", is that we have to run just to stand still. So it is with evolution. We have to improve our survival skills over the generations to keep pace with the other plants and animals which are also advancing in their survival skills.Much of what we are as humans has to do with sexual selection. Charles Darwin introduced the concept of natural selection in his book, ""Origin of the Species"", but he devoted an even greater deal of space to his concept of sexual selection in his book, ""The Descent of Man"". No matter how superior you are in survival abilities, it is all for naught if you do not pass those traits on to your offspring. Therefore mating is vitally important. You must be attractive to the opposite sex and this manifests itself in diverse ways amongst the animals. Moreover, sexual selection may create traits that seem to work against survivability. The peacock would certainly be better served with a smaller, less ornate tail, which makes him a more obvious target for predators.Ridley picks up where Darwin left off and explores the sexuality of humans as they have evolved from apes and gradually became a big brained animal over millions of years of evolution. He has incorporated most of the ideas of modern scientists related to this subject. Men are attracted to beauty and women are attracted to powerful men, who can provide for them. In the animal kingdom, the female selects the male with the best traits and the males are willing to mate with most any female in heat. The case has become different for modern humans because human babies are helpless far longer than in normal in the animal kingdom. This is a consequence of out massive brain, which must continue developing outside the womb.One part of the book did leave me surprised. Ridley got so caught up in his analysis of what women would do in selecting men that he surmised that women would rarely engage in opportunistic sex as it is against their self interest. Mr. Ridley, if you had been single and dating in California in the 1970's, you would soon realize how very mistaken you are. Many women had decided that they were now equal to men and could enjoy the same pleasures and they did. A few years later, fear of AIDS put an end to this libertine period. Alas!Aside from that mistaken projection, the Red Queen book is excellent and I think you will enjoy reading it. Ralph Hermansen 10/04/08 "
108,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47841182-myrto-smyrilioy-zerva,5,"This is a book targeted at biologists and not, alike. It consists of a, not completely unbiased review of our knowledge on the subjects of a human evolution and inherent nature beautifully stated by a superfluous pen with a deep understanding and fiery passion on the subject. It is an educational read but the wit and humor is not secrificed in the altar of scientific accuracy or logical argument. I found this book both stimulating, informative and entertaining. This is also helped by a fantastic audio."
109,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1052384-nicholas,3,"I feel like I really missed out on what this book had to offer. I don't think that I had the requisite background for it at the time. Reread.This book is about the effect of parasites on sex and culture. Sex is the caused by the need to fight off parasites that have a much faster generational cycle than we do. Our culture is a product in large part of this sexual dynamic.Quotes:""Evolution is a treadmill not a ladder.""""Evolution is something that happens to organisms. It is a directionless process that sometimes makes an animal's decedents more complicated, sometimes simpler, and sometimes changes them not at all. We are so steeped in notions of progress and self-improvement that we find it strangely hard to accept this.""""Parasites are in constant battle with hosts, a battle that is fought by switching from one resistance gene to another; hence the battery of different versions of genes. None of this would work without sex.""""If the goal is to have the sexist son in the next generation, then one way of doing that is to mate with the sexiest male; a second way is to prevent other females from mating with the sexiest male.""""We are designed for a system of monogamy plagued by adultery.""""What caused the sudden and spectacular expansion of that one ape's head, from which so much else flowed? Why did it happen to one ape and not another? What can account for the astonishing speed, and the accelerating speed of the change? These questions may seem to have nothing to do with the subject of this book, but the answer may lie with sex. If new theories are right, the evolution of man's big head was the result of a Red Queen sexual contest between individuals of the same gender.""""Half the ideas in this book are probably wrong."""
110,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1251066-andy,3,"I've been meaning to read this for years, after an old flat-mate told me about it while studying for his BSc in the psychology of attraction. Finally found it in a charity shop in Tunbridge Wells and decided to finish of the year with some evolutionary pondering.Matt Ridley freely states that the first third may not be as interesting to some as he details the background of evolutionary theory in relation to sexual activity and behaviour in animals. Dry perhaps, may be a better term. It's the later parts of the book though where things get interesting, looking at how human nature (if indeed humans can be said to have a specific 'nature') may (or may not) have been shaped by evolutionary pressures. There are many fascinating examples and case studies, compiled expertly by Ridley. As he again mentions, he has compiled these mostly from the work of others, trying to tie a lot of individual theories and evidence together. Generally he manages a good job and it's eminently readable.Whether or not you agree or believe is entirely another matter and really, books such as this should be read to educate and promote discussion. He doesn't (and shouldn't) attempt to claim a definitive conclusion and many avenues are left open to debate. I personally found it compelling. My biggest issue is how out of date much of the evidence (and some occasional clumsy discussions, particularly around homosexuality) is now, having been written almost 20 years ago. I would certainly be interested in reading a more up to date discussion of the state of the field.Still, a well recognised and deserved text, worth reading."
111,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361083-erwin,5,"Excellent book. Definitely worth reading for everyone, particularly followers of any religion.Summary is that Human Intelligence, just like a peacocks feathers, are the result of Sexual Selection. The more intelligent, the more able to outsmart other humans, and the more able to mate --- this especially applies to men.Few aspects of human nature can be understood apart from sex, since human nature is a product of evolution, and evolution in our case is driven specifically by sexual replication.The book begins with an evolutionary account of sex itself, defending the theory that sex flourishes, despite its energetic costs, primarily because a sexually mixed heritage confers to offspring a defensive ""head start"" against parasites received from and originally adapted to the maternal host environment.Human intelligence is largely a result of sexual selection. Human intelligence far outstrips any survivalist demands that would have been placed on our hominid ancestors, and analogizes human intelligence to the peacock's tail, a trait widely believed to be the result of sexual selection. Human intelligence is used primarily to attract mates through prodigious displays of wit, charm, inventiveness, and individuality.Next I should read The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature."
112,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5619806-veronica,2,"Okay, so the good points of the book: when the author discusses the up to date and relevant research of scientists, he does so respectfully, succinctly, and accurately. He does not both too much with alternative perspectives, but for the most part, while sometimes unpalatable information, I tend to agree with the information. The worse points of the book: his own opinion is often absurd. His methods of making the information relatable is, in my opinion, stupid. He lacks the creativity to make a compelling story out of facts, and frankly, the theories are often so elegant and beautiful, it's unnecessary anyway. Finally, in his final depressing notes, he not just criticizes, but attempts to entirely discredit pioneers in many different fields, none of which he is an expert in. Even if some of the theories are no longer considered accurate or represent our world model, they paved the path for future endeavours which have enhanced our knowledge of the natural world and our place within it. Finally, several of the individuals he attempted to discredit are still at the forefront of their fields and are still considered accurate and representative of present day findings. Following this, he gives us his own uneducated opinions on where he thinks the future will take us. The only reason he got two stars at all was because of the research he did present and do justice to. I'm shocked this book has such high reviews. I was so looking forward to reading it. "

Matt Ridley manages to handle the subject with such an elegance, concision and property quite difficult to find among ""entrepreneurial"" scholars nowadays. This book is really informative and not just another idiot trying to make some extra-money by spreading pseudo-science.A must read if you want to get acquainted with the ways of modern Biology and Human Sciences in general; yet, you will find a lot of ingenious answers to common misconceptions and useful knowledge to understand the wonderful intricacies of social interaction at an animal level.And yes, it is an easy replacement for bad literature; for you see, It'll make you feel better with yourself, get you laid more often or just serve as a good excuse to keep your fidelity."
114,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/689670-joanna,1,"My review of this book can be summed up in a quote from the very end of the book, ""Half the ideas in this book are probably wrong."" That's probably a generous estimate on the author's part! I would also add ""sexist"" to ""wrong."" If only I'd read the end first, I could've saved myself a lot of frustration.A sampling:""The best [men] can hope for now is a good-looking younger mistress and a devoted wife who is traded in every decade or so. We're back to square one."" ""Inject all pregnant women with the right dose of hormones, and the result would be men and women with normal bodies but identical female brains. War, rape, boxing, car racing, pornography, and hamburgers and beer would soon be distant memories.""Then he talks about how women with Turner's syndrome are born without ovaries. ""They are exaggeratedly feminine in their behavior, with typically a special interest in babies, clothes, housekeeping, and romantic stories.""This book is bad science based in sexist stereotypes. Ironically, I read it for my feminist book club!"
115,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22176981-olivera,2,"Even though Matt Ridley said in his epilogue to this book that he doesn't regret including animals in this book I found it to be a flaw that can't necessarily be overcome. This isn't a book you will enjoy unless you are a fan of biology and the behavior of animals (which I in fact am not).I went into this expecting exactly what the title promised: the evolution of human nature, yet there was more talk about birds, insects, apes and snails than there actually was about humans. While I do understand that giving a kind of background for this topic is necessary, to me it seemed like it was overdone. Only in the last third did it actually focus on the theme it was supposed to focus on, but the 200+ pages that took me to get there weren't really worth it. There were some very interesting theories here, but I found a few facts being repeated over and over again. I don't really know what to say. I'm just pretty disappointed in The Red Queen and I'll be hesitant to pick up anything regarding this subject in the future, even though I am interested in it."
116,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4948409-samantha-sean,4,"In The Red Queen, Matt Ridley asserts that sexual selection is more prominent a factor of survival of a species than natural selection in its general form. Ridley cites Darwin, multiple fascinating biological studies, and psychological experiments. The findings of all his data verify his assertion well, though somehow I feel jilted. There is so much more to life than reproduction and procreation of the species. Attraction is not as simple a matter as genetic predilection and instinct, or generalizations in psychology. Ridley covers deviations very little, and explains why they exist (as byproducts or mutations). Overall, I vastly understand the world of sexual selection as a major contributor to our present customs and inclinations as a species. The rant on evolution at the end felt out of place, but the conclusion was concise. The value of the Red Queen is its compilation of data to support the relevance of sex in our evolution. "
117,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8739994-darrel,4,"Matt Ridley is a consistently good science writer and he does not disappoint in The Red Queen. The research and writing are solid. I should have read it many years ago when it first came out. My main criticism is that it is somewhat dated. It appears that he wrote nothing of the Bonobos in the original edition then threw in a few paragraphs in the later edition. Unfortunately, the information about Bonobo sexuality is important and should have informed his conclusions more. I do recommend it, but read with the knowledge that the original was written over 10 years ago and new information and research has emerged which is not taken into consideration. I don't think his conclusions would be radically changed, but certainly would be better nuanced.Dr. Darrel Ray, author of Sex and God: How Religion Distorts Sexuality, and The God Virus."

First half of the book sets up the more homocentric second half. The summary: men are naturally polygamous, women naturally monogamous. Men like youth and beauty. Women like wealth and power. Civilization works for the greatest good when monogamy rules, since polygamy favors a select few and leaves many others partnerless. Otherwise the rich men in their sports cars would steal all the thunder and the lightning as well. And many more men would kill each other for beauty, literally not just metaphorically. "
119,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2296903-jana,4,"It's important to understand that evolution is not a process of improvement. Natural selection simply asserts that species change as they adapt to ever-changing environments. Evolution is not a process by which human beings or societies become better. Those organisms best able to survive in a challenging, shifting environment live to reproduce. The environment can change at any moment, thus neutralizing any advantage of any species.Sex provides the necessary variation that keeps evolution going, and without constant evolution, competitors and environmental change would lead to extinction of all species.

120,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,4,"Would you like to more thoroughly understand why people are the way they are and why they do the crazy shit they do? If so, this book would be a great place to start. It's one of those ridiculously insight inducing reads. It's also one of those books that you absolutely can not judge by its cover. Or by its first and last chapters. Curious? Than by all means read on. One of the things that put me off of the book (before I actually read it) was the title The Red Queen. I'm dreadfully embarrassed to admit that I assumed it had something to do with menstruation. Not that there's anything wrong with menstruation. I just wasn't particularly motivated to commit a decent chunk of my ""one wild life"" to a long form exploration of that particular subject.When I actually read the book, I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't about menstruation at all. The title is actually a clever reference to Lewis Carroll's Red Queen from Through the Looking-Glass, a character who has to keep running to stay in the same place. Matt Ridley's hypothesis is that sex is essentially an organisms strategy for outwitting its constantly mutating internal predators (e.g. parasites, viruses etc.), a process he likens to an arms race. The point being, that in any sort of arms race, both sides work their asses off just to maintain their relative positions against the other. Essentially running in place. Hence ""The Red Queen"" analogy. Another reason I was reluctant to read the book, before a I actually read the book, was that I was sort of convinced that sexual selection (as opposed to natural selection all red in tooth and claw) was the lesser feature of Darwin's dangerous idea. After actually reading the book, I have essentially experienced a 180 degree change in perspective. I now view sexual selection as possessing awesome explanatory power. The Red Queen bravely attempts to address dozens of difficult questions regarding the otherwise mysterious workings of human nature and culture. Far form perfect. Provisional and dated. But nevertheless less brilliantly written and entertaining as all get out. The Red Queen offers an extraordinarily generative approach for interpreting the human condition and how it has evolved.I highly recommend actually reading this book."
121,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This book one star deducted because of the long-winded introduction. I almost added it at the end though, because that was so brilliant. This is a lucid, immensely readable book about the evolutinary foundation of human nature. It starts out with animals and covers much the same ground as ""the Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins that I read not long ago. However, it as soon as it moves into the deeper waters of human nature it becomes vastly more interesting.Humang beings are just another animal species. We're not very special - other species have culture and language too, although not as finely honed as humans'. We run on instinct too, as learning is costly and dangerous. Language learning and a fear of snakes, for example, are hard-wired in our brains. Speaking of brains, why are ours so big? Matt Ridley presents the thoughs of Miller, who thinks it's selected for. Human beings are very keen on wit and humour (come think of it, so am I) and this has been sexually selected for. To keep ahead in the ferocious inter-species competition, men had to be ever smarter and this lead to an ever-increasing brain size for both genders. We live on gossip and deception and the most succesful of us tend to be the best ""mindreaders"". ""The choosines of human beings in picking their mates has driven the human mind into a history of frenzied expansion for no reason except that wit, virtuosity, inventiveness and individuality turn other people on"". It's an interesting theory at any rate! Anyone interested in human nature and why we are as we are should read this book. Fascinating! This works well as an introduction to both human nature and evolution."

Very scientific review of why humans have 2 genders and aren't hermaphrodides, what advantages procreating through sex rather than one of the many other ways has etc. Once you get past the first 1/3 it becomes much more understandable and interesting. Rule 1 for all humans, ""success in life equals having grandchildren survive to adulthood"" (read - pass on your genes). Approach for men, that translates into the quantity of sexual partners Approach for women, that translates into quality of sexual partners. And the rest are fascinating deductions from that rule and those approaches. Just jump over the first chapters. Reminds me of one of my all time favorites. That is ""Brain Sex"" which surely has a better name, but is no more intersteing in the end."

I must becoming centrist in my old age, because I found Ridley's approach to strike just the right tone between authoritative and skeptical. Nothing is certain, but certain theories seem to hold more sway. Ridley's narrative also makes it clear that the answer is probably in the middle of conflicting theories, human nature being as complex as it is.My two favorite takeaways from the book: 1) Sex is most probably an evolutionary response to dealing with disease. 2) The human mind is the equivalent of the peacock tail -- a quirk of human-ness that evolved to attract mates. Now I know why creativity is so sexual."
124,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6601778-parker-f,4,"A fascinating book on my favorite topic. The author refreshingly acknowledges that half of the theories he espouses in the book are likely to be wrong; for instance, I am highly skeptical of Ridley's theory that human large-brainedness arose from runaway sexual selection favoring cute, disproportionately large heads. Nonetheless, I have no good reason to doubt this, and, as Ridley notes, all arguments of runaway sexual selection involve somewhat circular reasoning. I was fond of Ridley's literary allusions to illustrate the primalness of our evolutionarily-shaped motivations. Finally, this book is highly motivational with regards to my life's goal of acquiring a large harem. "

The author is quick to clarify, but often writes in a style that seems to deliberately generate an overlarge need to clarify - this is a book of meandering thoughts for the most part. Ridley strives to sound neutral, but always gives the impression of having an agenda (although if it's any more developed than 'hey, use my cool metaphor', I missed it). Still, it raises some interesting questions, for all that it pretends to greater certainty than is really warranted in such a rapidly evolving field of study."

It's annoying how he picks out a totally obscure animal/insect/bacteria to prove the theory has flaws. Clearly, he has done an amazing amount of research - but to what end?

131,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2775247-alexander-tomislav,5,"This book sets a case that sexual selection is the reason, as for the peacock's tail, so for the human intelligence as well. The title comes from Lewis Carroll's ""Alice through the Looking Glass"" character of Red Queen, who, the faster she goes, the more she stays in place. This is related to the evolutionary phenomenon of ""locked"" development, such as between parasites and hosts. The more parasites adapt to hosts' defenses, the more defenses will be evolved in the hosts.Drawing on many a research, the author starts with examples from the animal world, examining clues and evidence from a geneticist's, evolutionist's and ecological points of view. Biggest clue is how many features of animals (long tail feathers and bright colors in some birds, for example) serve more for the organism to breed, than to survive. Indeed, driven by the genes' impetus to replicate, it's more ""Breeding of the fittest"" than survival.One of the biggest problems that evolutionary science faces is the attitude, common in humanistic sciences, that male and female brains are identical. Not so, claims the author, and the reasoning is compelling and sound - just as different environmental pressures caused male and female bodies to be different, it did the same to our brains. No amount of wishful thinking or political correctness can make that different. However, he's quick to point out ""Give men an inch of inequality and they will claim a mile of bias."". The human body blueprint is female, and only through two testosterone bursts (in womb and at the start of puberty) does it become masculine. Environment plays a big role in gene expression and the author demonstrates in multiple places how nature and nurture aren't opposites, but work together. As a reason for explosive development of the human brain, the author shows how the competition between members of the same species drove that development. We didn't become smarter to make tools, or to hunt, or to develop language and society. Many animals hunt, have complicated social dynamics, use tools and rudimentary communication. We evolved big brains to outwit each other.Until humanity accepts what it is, instead of vainly focusing on what it should be, we can't advance as a species. Selected quotes:""Human nature is a product of culture, but culture is also a product of human nature, and both are the products of evolution."" [pg 6.]""Humanity is, of course, morally free to make and remake itself infinitely, but we do not do so. We stick to the same monotonously human pattern of organizing our affairs. If we were more adventurous, there would be societies without love, without ambition, without sexual desire, without marriage, without art, without grammar, without music, without smilesâ and with as many unimaginable novelties as are in that list. There would be societies in which women killed each other more often than men, in which old people were considered more beautiful than twenty-year-olds, in which wealth did not purchase power over others, in which people did not discriminate in favor of their own friends and against strangers, in which parents did not love their own children."" [pg. 7]""Evolution is something that happens to organisms. It is a directionless process that sometimes makes an animalâs descendants more complicated, sometimes simpler, and sometimes changes them not at all. We are so steeped in notions of progress and self-improvement that we find it strangely hard to accept this."" [pg. 31]""Nicholas Humphrey, a Cambridge psychologist, was the first to see clearly the solution to this puzzle. We use our intellects not to solve practical problems but to outwit each other. Deceiving people, detecting deceit, understanding peopleâs motives, manipulating peopleâ these are what the intellect is used for. So what matters is not how clever and crafty you are but how much more clever and craftier you are than other people. The value of intellect is infinite. Selection within the species is always going to be more important than selection between the species."" [pg. 34]""Sex is about disease. It is used to combat the threat from parasites. Organisms need sex to keep their genes one step ahead of their parasites. Men are not redundant after all; they are womanâs insurance policy against her children being wiped out by influenza and smallpox..."" [pg. 86]""The goal for every female animal is to find a mate with sufficient genetic quality to make a good husband, a good father, or a good sire. The goal for every male animal is often to find as many wives as possible and sometimes to find good mothers and dams, only rarely to find good wives. In 1972, Robert Trivers noticed the reason for this asymmetry, which runs right through the animal kingdom; the rare exceptions to his rule prove why it generally holds. The sex that invests most in rearing the youngâ by carrying a fetus for nine months in its belly, for exampleâ is the sex that makes the least profit from an extra mating. The sex that invests the least has time to spare to seek other mates. Therefore, broadly speaking, males invest less and seek quantity of mates, while females invest more and seek quality of mates."" [pg. 132]""Murder is ânaturalâ in the sense that our ape relatives commit it regularly, as apparently did our human ancestors. Prejudice, hate, violence, crueltyâ all are more or less part of our nature, and all can be effectively countered by the right kind of nurture. Nature is not inflexible but malleable."" [pg. 181]""Lesbians, free of constraints imposed by male nature, do not suddenly indulge in sexual promiscuity; on the contrary, they are remarkably monogamous. None of this is surprising: Female animals gain little from sexual opportunism, for their reproductive ability is limited not by how many males they mate with but how long it takes to bear offspring. In this respect men and women are very different."" [pg. 218]""[...]the ban on polygamous marriage does not prevent the males from seeking polygamous matings. Adultery is common. It is most common between high-ranking males and females of all ranks. To prevent it males try to guard their wives, are extremely violent toward their wivesâ lovers, and copulate with their wives frequently, not just when they are fertile."" [pg. 234]""The noble savage, far from living in contented sexual equanimity, was paranoid about becoming, and intent on making his neighbor into, a cuckold[...] Cuckoldry paranoia is deep-seated in men. The use of veils, chaperones, purdah, female circumcision, and chastity belts all bear witness to a widespread male fear of being cuckolded and a widespread suspicion that wives, as well as their potential lovers, are the ones to distrust[...] Jealousy is a âhuman universal,â and no culture lacks it. Despite the best efforts of anthropologists to find a society with no jealousy and so prove that it is an emotion introduced by pernicious social pressure or pathology, sexual jealousy seems to be an unavoidable part of being a human being."" [pg. 235]""There has been no genetic change since we were hunter-gatherers, but deep in the mind of the modern man is a simple male hunter-gatherer rule: Strive to acquire power and use it to lure women who will bear heirs; strive to acquire wealth and use it to buy other menâs wives who will bear bastards. It began with a man who shared a piece of prized fish or honey with an attractive neighborâs wife in exchange for a brief affair and continues with a pop star ushering a model into his Mercedes. From fish to Mercedes, the history is unbroken: via skins and beads, plows and cattle, swords and castles. Wealth and power are means to women; women are means to genetic eternity."" [pg. 244]""Testosterone is an ancient chemical, found in much the same form throughout the vertebrates. Its concentration determines aggressiveness so exactly that in birds with reversed sex roles, such as phalaropes and in female-dominated hyena clans, it is the females that have higher levels of testosterone in the blood. Testosterone masculinizes the body; without it, the body remains female, whatever its genes. It also masculinizes the brain."" [pg. 254]""Baby girls are more interested in smiling, communicating, and in people, boys in action and things. Shown cluttered pictures, boys select objects, girls people. Boys are instantly obsessed with dismantling, assembling, destroying, possessing, and coveting things. Girls are fascinated by people and treat their toys as surrogate people. Hence, to suit their mentalities, we have invented toys that suit each sex. We give boys tractors and girls dolls. We are reinforcing the stereotypical obsessions that they already have, but we are not creating them."" [pg. 256]""The Israeli kibbutz system has proved to be a large natural experiment in the persistence of sex roles. Men and women were initially encouraged to drop all sex roles in kibbutzim: Haircuts and clothes were unisex; boys were encouraged to be peaceful and sensitive, while girls were treated like tomboys; men did household chores and women went out to work. Yet three generations later, the attempt has largely been abandoned, and kibbutz life is actually more sexist than life in the rest of Israel. People have returned to stereotypes. Men politick, while women tend the home; boys study physics and become engineers, while girls study sociology and become teachers and nurses. Women manage the morale, health, and education of the kibbutz, while men manage the finances, security, and business.[...] Women clean house in a kibbutz because, like women everywhere, they complain that men would not do it properly. Men do not clean house in a kibbutz because, like men everywhere, they complain that if they did, their wives would say it had not been done properly."" [pg. 260]""The bizarre thing about this assertion of different natures is that it is a thoroughly feminist assertion. There is a contradiction at the heart of feminism, one that few feminists have acknowledged. You cannot say, first, that men and women are equally capable of all jobs and, second, that if jobs were done by women, they would be done differently. So feminism itself is anything but egalitarian. Feminists argue explicitly that if more women were in charge, more caring values would prevail. They begin from the presumption that women are by nature different beings. If women ran the world, there would be no war. When women run companies, cooperation, not competition, is the watchword. These are all explicit and firm assertions of sexism: that the personalities and natures of women are different from men. If womenâs personalities are different, is it not likely that they will prove better or worse at certain jobs than men? Differences cannot be appealed to when they suit and denied when they do not."" [pg. 261]""The assertion that âcultureâ explains human variation will be taken seriously when there are reports of women war parties raiding villages to capture men as husbands, or of parents cloistering their sons but not their daughters to protect their sonsâ virtue, or when cultural distributions for preferences concerning physical attractiveness, earning power, relative age, and so on show as many cultures with bias in one direction as in the other."" [pg. 275]""Somewhere in our education we unthinkingly absorb the idea that nature (genes) and nurture (environment) are opposites and that we must make a choice between them. If we choose environmentalism, then we are espousing a universal human nature that is as blank as a sheet of paper awaiting cultureâs pen, that humans are therefore perfectible and born equal. If we choose genes, then we espouse irreversible genetic differences between races and between individuals. We are fatalists and elitists. Who would not hope with all her heart that the geneticists were wrong?"" [pg. 317]""If you want to understand human motives, read Proust or Trollope or Tom Wolfe, not Freud or Piaget or Skinner. We are obsessed with one anotherâs minds. âOur intuitive commonsense psychology far surpasses any scientific psychology in scope and accuracy,â wrote Don Symons. 39 Horace Barlow points out that great literary minds are, almost by definition, great mind-reading minds."" [pg. 333]""Robert Trivers has argued that to deceive others well, an animal must deceive itself, and that self-deceptionâs hallmark is a biased system of transfer from the conscious to the unconscious mind. Deception is therefore the reason for the invention of the subconscious."" [pg.335]""Mankind is a self-domesticated animal; a mammal; an ape; a social ape; an ape in which the male takes the iniative in courtship and females usually leave the society of their birth; an ape in which men are predators, women herbivorous foragers; an ape in which males are relatively hierarchical, females relatively egalitarian; an ape in which males contribute unusually large amounts of investment in the upbringing of their offspring by provisioning their mates and their children with food, protection, and company; an ape in which monogamous pair bonds are the rule but many males have affairs and occasional males achieve polygamy; an ape in which females mated to low-ranking males often cuckold their husbands in order to gain access to the genes of higher-ranking males; an ape that has been subject to unusually intense mutual sexual selection so that many of the features of the female body (lips, breasts, waists) and the mind of both sexes (songs, competitive ambition, status seeking) are designed for use in competition for mates; an ape that has developed an extraordinary range of new instincts to learn by association, to communicate by speech, and to pass on traditions. But still an ape.""[pg.348]"
132,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3355789-mark,4,"In a frenetic effort to stay interesting, Matt Ridley unconsciously finishes his book with a terrific built-in summary by introducing Robin Dunbar's ""Scherazade Effect"" which is the frenetic effort to stay interesting, with sex and hence reproduction and life itself at stake.The book's a little like that: Matt's a consummate researcher and very good at explaining, and he's scraped together a mountain of anecdotes in support of his thesis which is, what exactly? It's kind of a little bit lost in all the stories but basically looking for the reason we are people instead of ordinary animals, he finds sexual selection and the need to be attractive as causal in the case of neoteny, big brains, language, tools, dominant men and sexy women, everything you want.There are a million uncomfortable moments wherein simple circular dynamics diverge in unstable fashion to a new set point, like a peacock's feathers or human brains or a whale's (two ton!) gonads. Like Ridley, I couldn't resist a teaser there, but the  point  is that like so many, Ridley has a hard time wrapping his brain around recursive iterative dynamics. Since that's my JOB, I'm ok with it, but remember being frustrated and tied in a mental knot by the chicken / egg / chicken problem of feedback in physical systems. I do feel the analogy's apt though. There doesn't have to be a driving reason for everything, if a tiny nudge can suffice to loose an avalanche of consequent evolution. I find that believable.One thing he might have missed, in trying to explain us (humans) in an area cosmologists have long since overcome, which is the ""we're not special"" or ""duh, because WE're here"" explanation as to why the sun is just the right temperature or the boltzman constant just so: the reason is that the people in that potential universe or on that potential planet just arent. They aren't there, they entirely aint. I'm doing a horrible job explaining that, but basically SOMEBODY had to be on the top of the food chain and I'm personally glad to be lucky enough that it's me. Why am  I  thinking about evolution? My answer? ""Because if I were an ant I couldn't."" I think Ridley misses that he doesn't have to go searching for some reason why WE in particular are special. We're just lucky that way; ~ somebody had to be.Ahh, never mind all that. In summary, it's hard to dislike a guy who calls both Freud and Skinner misguided. This is a fun book and certainly has a lot of truth in it. Ridley wants a main theme and maybe hasn't got one, but he doesn't need it anyway. Bravo.-------------------------------Here's a long postscript on why there's a 50:50 ratio of the sexes.Gina asked why males aren't rare, since it wouldn't seem so many are necessary. I re-read a whole chapter & wrote this reply...The answer, in the Red Queen, lies around page 100. It's long and complex and, in case you want to cut to the chase, finally an unsatisfying answer.First I think I noted that male and female as different genders are an idea organized around using organelles (mitochondria) from just ONE parent. Apparently otherwise competition between them within the cell is destructive, so it's better to just pick one parent from which to get 'em. (It's the female: the sperm is stripped of all but its nucleus in the catharsis of fertilization.)Why not hermaphrodites came up next and the answer was that in a hermaphroditic population, there would be instabilities, for example a tendency to kill off your male parts would make more resources available to the female nature, which would be thereby advantaged. Ultrafemmes would outperform hermaphrodites as mothers, and in so doing, make sperm scarce. Female killer genes could also then prosper, these making a new offspring hypermale. So an instability is encouraged by the basic idea of commitment: by being ""all in"" in one's choice of sex, you have a better chance of success than playing both sides & thereby hedging two bets badly.So far we still don't have any reason why the numbers should be so easily balanced. There are plenty of creatures where that's not the case, and there are ""driving"" genes that cause sex ratio distortion. Ritter he documents one human family wherein only girls were born. Why wouldn't such a thing, this parthenogenesis, catch on, at least in some proportion? All these different causes seem like tendencies that ought to swing towards some optimal ratio which would (obviously?) benefit from a male percentage << 50%. ...and that's your question, still unanswered. Lemmings actually solve it with a third sex chromosome that biases the odds towards females, a seemingly better system. Are we just unlucky vs lemmings?He delves briefly into other systems, as when unfertilized eggs become male (a clearly stable situation) or my favorite, when ALL the fish in the school are female, save the biggest, who changes teams to fulfill his duties. I guess the point is, there are plenty of exceptions to the rule. Ridley delights in these digressions.Then there were many more anecdotes, sort of diffusing away into a fog of confusion, doubtless why I forgot this next point. ""Munching a burrito"" with some scientist, he notes that dominant women & monkeys (& cows and chickens) have more sons, that female hormones not genetics tend most (and there are many factors) to bias the sex ratios, and a shortage of men makes for dominant females. It doesn't seem to ""tend"" towards exactly 50:50 or even be strongly supported, certainly not convincingly so in the face of the profligate polygamous male hypothesis. So the question goes down as being self corrected by mysterious and non genetic means. Unsatisfying. More theories then follow, but many of these have to do with social criteria pertinent only to humans (you can always marry a beautiful daughter up-caste, but not a son) but these theories do not answer as to why farmers have failed to breed female only lines of cattle, however hard they try. That last observation was a quote from Dawkins, and seemingly his last word. I have to suspect Ridley should have accepted this as unknown and ended the chapter there.At least, I will."
133,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature by Matt RidleyâThe Red Queen"" is the very interesting book about how human nature evolved as a result of sex. According to the author, human beings were âdesignedâ to reproduce and that without understanding competitive reproduction we will not be able to comprehend the human psyche and nature. Well known journalist, scientist and educator; Matt Ridley, brings us a well-rounded science book that deals with many fascinating topics involving sexual evolution. The first third of book or so starts off a little dense and may put off some readers but once it picks up it really takes off and rewards readers with invaluable knowledge. This 416-page book is composed of the following ten chapters: 1. Human Nature, 2. The Enigma, 3. The Power of Parasites, 4. Genetic Mutiny and Gender, 5. The Peacockâs Tale, 6. Polygamy and the Nature of Men, 7. Monogamy and the Nature of Women, 8. Sexing the Mind, 9. The Uses of Beauty, and 10. The Intellectual Chess Game. Positives:1.	A well-written and well-researched book. 2.	The fascinating topic of sexual evolution in the hands of a master.3.	The book was originally published in 1993 but it holds up generally well and itâs still worth reading.4.	Good use of the best that science had to offer at that time.5.	Thought-provoking and refreshingly honest and witty approach.6.	Provides compelling arguments in support of a universal human nature.7.	Explains the reasoning behind the title which is a metaphor in evolution for âthe faster you run, the more the world moves with you and the less you make progressâ.8.	Some great analogies, âThe fashion in evolutionary science now is to scoff at progress; evolution is a treadmill, not a ladderâ.9.	What sex is. A look from three different kinds of scientists. Great stuff.10.	The unbelievable world of sex in both the animal and plant kingdom.11.	Some great facts and perspectives, âThe âgreat warâ of 1914-18 killed 25 million people in four years. The influenza epidemic that followed killed 25 million in four monthsâ.12.	What drive the evolution of sex.13.	Understanding what evolution is in a practical sense.14.	How science works to address a problem.15.	Understanding gender in terms of âgenetic lotteryâ. Or leave it to the environment.16.	Some great anecdotes, âAnaxagoraâs belief that lying on the right side during sex would produce a boy was so influential that centuries later some French aristocrats had their left testicles amputatedâ. Ouch!17.	The nature of âchoosyâ females.18.	The two warring factions in sexual selection: âFisherâ and âGood-genesâ.19.	Testosterone and its relation to disease.20.	What men find attractive in women.21.	The impact of human culture.22.	An honest look at the roles of the sexes.23.	An understanding about homosexual behavior.24.	Game theory and how it plays out between males and females. Always interesting.25.	Human evolution always fascinating.26.	The growth of our brains.27.	Understanding the evil practice of female infanticide.28.	Power as a tool for sexual success. Itâs good being the king.29.	Marriage, understanding the institution of.30.	Adultery and how it shaped human society.31.	Fascinating look at what societies favor daughters over sons and vice versa.32.	The differences of mental features between the sexes.33.	A look at social statuses.34.	The innate instinct of learning language.35.	The evidence for neoteny.36.	Links to notes worked great! Negatives:1.	The first third or so of the book was a bit dense and may have put off some readers.2.	Despite holding up generally well (book was published in 1993), some topics are outdated. For instance, free will is an illusion. I will provide a list of suggestion that offers more up to date information.3.	Animal altruism is not a myth.4.	Some topics are fairly logical. We all have a basic grasp of sexual selection.5.	Some topics may irk feminists. Let me leave it at that.6.	The author purposely sidesteps the issue of morality and the little that is here is inadequate.7.	âDeception is therefore the reason for the invention of the subconscious.â â Trivers Really?In summary, I wished I had read this book when it first came out in 1993. The book started off a little dry but once it gets going I wasnât able to put it down. Many topics of popular interest in the hands of an accomplished author make for good reading. In spite of its age, I learned some new things and have a much better grasp of why human nature evolved as a result of sex. If you have the patience to make it through the early chapters the book will reward you with wisdom, worth reading! Further recommendations: ""Humanâ and âWhoâs In Charge?â by Michael S.

The significance of Lewis Carroll's Red Queen from the book, ""Alice in Wonderland"", is that we have to run just to stand still. So it is with evolution. We have to improve our survival skills over the generations to keep pace with the other plants and animals which are also advancing in their survival skills.Much of what we are as humans has to do with sexual selection. Charles Darwin introduced the concept of natural selection in his book, ""Origin of the Species"", but he devoted an even greater deal of space to his concept of sexual selection in his book, ""The Descent of Man"". No matter how superior you are in survival abilities, it is all for naught if you do not pass those traits on to your offspring. Therefore mating is vitally important. You must be attractive to the opposite sex and this manifests itself in diverse ways amongst the animals. Moreover, sexual selection may create traits that seem to work against survivability. The peacock would certainly be better served with a smaller, less ornate tail, which makes him a more obvious target for predators.Ridley picks up where Darwin left off and explores the sexuality of humans as they have evolved from apes and gradually became a big brained animal over millions of years of evolution. He has incorporated most of the ideas of modern scientists related to this subject. Men are attracted to beauty and women are attracted to powerful men, who can provide for them. In the animal kingdom, the female selects the male with the best traits and the males are willing to mate with most any female in heat. The case has become different for modern humans because human babies are helpless far longer than in normal in the animal kingdom. This is a consequence of out massive brain, which must continue developing outside the womb.One part of the book did leave me surprised. Ridley got so caught up in his analysis of what women would do in selecting men that he surmised that women would rarely engage in opportunistic sex as it is against their self interest. Mr. Ridley, if you had been single and dating in California in the 1970's, you would soon realize how very mistaken you are. Many women had decided that they were now equal to men and could enjoy the same pleasures and they did. A few years later, fear of AIDS put an end to this libertine period. Alas!Aside from that mistaken projection, the Red Queen book is excellent and I think you will enjoy reading it. Ralph Hermansen 10/04/08 "

It consists of a, not completely unbiased review of our knowledge on the subjects of a human evolution and inherent nature beautifully stated by a superfluous pen with a deep understanding and fiery passion on the subject. It is an educational read but the wit and humor is not secrificed in the altar of scientific accuracy or logical argument. I found this book both stimulating, informative and entertaining. This is also helped by a fantastic audio."

Reread.This book is about the effect of parasites on sex and culture. Sex is the caused by the need to fight off parasites that have a much faster generational cycle than we do. Our culture is a product in large part of this sexual dynamic.Quotes:""Evolution is a treadmill not a ladder.""""Evolution is something that happens to organisms. It is a directionless process that sometimes makes an animal's decedents more complicated, sometimes simpler, and sometimes changes them not at all. We are so steeped in notions of progress and self-improvement that we find it strangely hard to accept this.""""Parasites are in constant battle with hosts, a battle that is fought by switching from one resistance gene to another; hence the battery of different versions of genes. None of this would work without sex.""""If the goal is to have the sexist son in the next generation, then one way of doing that is to mate with the sexiest male; a second way is to prevent other females from mating with the sexiest male.""""We are designed for a system of monogamy plagued by adultery.""""What caused the sudden and spectacular expansion of that one ape's head, from which so much else flowed? Why did it happen to one ape and not another? What can account for the astonishing speed, and the accelerating speed of the change? These questions may seem to have nothing to do with the subject of this book, but the answer may lie with sex. If new theories are right, the evolution of man's big head was the result of a Red Queen sexual contest between individuals of the same gender.""""Half the ideas in this book are probably wrong."""
140,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1251066-andy,3,"I've been meaning to read this for years, after an old flat-mate told me about it while studying for his BSc in the psychology of attraction. Finally found it in a charity shop in Tunbridge Wells and decided to finish of the year with some evolutionary pondering.Matt Ridley freely states that the first third may not be as interesting to some as he details the background of evolutionary theory in relation to sexual activity and behaviour in animals. Dry perhaps, may be a better term. It's the later parts of the book though where things get interesting, looking at how human nature (if indeed humans can be said to have a specific 'nature') may (or may not) have been shaped by evolutionary pressures. There are many fascinating examples and case studies, compiled expertly by Ridley. As he again mentions, he has compiled these mostly from the work of others, trying to tie a lot of individual theories and evidence together. Generally he manages a good job and it's eminently readable.Whether or not you agree or believe is entirely another matter and really, books such as this should be read to educate and promote discussion. He doesn't (and shouldn't) attempt to claim a definitive conclusion and many avenues are left open to debate. I personally found it compelling. My biggest issue is how out of date much of the evidence (and some occasional clumsy discussions, particularly around homosexuality) is now, having been written almost 20 years ago. I would certainly be interested in reading a more up to date discussion of the state of the field.Still, a well recognised and deserved text, worth reading."
141,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361083-erwin,5,"Excellent book. Definitely worth reading for everyone, particularly followers of any religion.Summary is that Human Intelligence, just like a peacocks feathers, are the result of Sexual Selection. The more intelligent, the more able to outsmart other humans, and the more able to mate --- this especially applies to men.Few aspects of human nature can be understood apart from sex, since human nature is a product of evolution, and evolution in our case is driven specifically by sexual replication.The book begins with an evolutionary account of sex itself, defending the theory that sex flourishes, despite its energetic costs, primarily because a sexually mixed heritage confers to offspring a defensive ""head start"" against parasites received from and originally adapted to the maternal host environment.Human intelligence is largely a result of sexual selection. Human intelligence far outstrips any survivalist demands that would have been placed on our hominid ancestors, and analogizes human intelligence to the peacock's tail, a trait widely believed to be the result of sexual selection. Human intelligence is used primarily to attract mates through prodigious displays of wit, charm, inventiveness, and individuality.Next I should read The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature."

He does not both too much with alternative perspectives, but for the most part, while sometimes unpalatable information, I tend to agree with the information. The worse points of the book: his own opinion is often absurd. His methods of making the information relatable is, in my opinion, stupid. He lacks the creativity to make a compelling story out of facts, and frankly, the theories are often so elegant and beautiful, it's unnecessary anyway. Finally, in his final depressing notes, he not just criticizes, but attempts to entirely discredit pioneers in many different fields, none of which he is an expert in. Even if some of the theories are no longer considered accurate or represent our world model, they paved the path for future endeavours which have enhanced our knowledge of the natural world and our place within it. Finally, several of the individuals he attempted to discredit are still at the forefront of their fields and are still considered accurate and representative of present day findings. Following this, he gives us his own uneducated opinions on where he thinks the future will take us. The only reason he got two stars at all was because of the research he did present and do justice to. I'm shocked this book has such high reviews. I was so looking forward to reading it. "

Matt Ridley manages to handle the subject with such an elegance, concision and property quite difficult to find among ""entrepreneurial"" scholars nowadays. This book is really informative and not just another idiot trying to make some extra-money by spreading pseudo-science.A must read if you want to get acquainted with the ways of modern Biology and Human Sciences in general; yet, you will find a lot of ingenious answers to common misconceptions and useful knowledge to understand the wonderful intricacies of social interaction at an animal level.And yes, it is an easy replacement for bad literature; for you see, It'll make you feel better with yourself, get you laid more often or just serve as a good excuse to keep your fidelity."

That's probably a generous estimate on the author's part! I would also add ""sexist"" to ""wrong."" If only I'd read the end first, I could've saved myself a lot of frustration.A sampling:""The best [men] can hope for now is a good-looking younger mistress and a devoted wife who is traded in every decade or so. We're back to square one."" ""Inject all pregnant women with the right dose of hormones, and the result would be men and women with normal bodies but identical female brains. War, rape, boxing, car racing, pornography, and hamburgers and beer would soon be distant memories.""Then he talks about how women with Turner's syndrome are born without ovaries. ""They are exaggeratedly feminine in their behavior, with typically a special interest in babies, clothes, housekeeping, and romantic stories.""This book is bad science based in sexist stereotypes.

This isn't a book you will enjoy unless you are a fan of biology and the behavior of animals (which I in fact am not).I went into this expecting exactly what the title promised: the evolution of human nature, yet there was more talk about birds, insects, apes and snails than there actually was about humans. While I do understand that giving a kind of background for this topic is necessary, to me it seemed like it was overdone. Only in the last third did it actually focus on the theme it was supposed to focus on, but the 200+ pages that took me to get there weren't really worth it. There were some very interesting theories here, but I found a few facts being repeated over and over again. I don't really know what to say. I'm just pretty disappointed in The Red Queen and I'll be hesitant to pick up anything regarding this subject in the future, even though I am interested in it."

Ridley cites Darwin, multiple fascinating biological studies, and psychological experiments. The findings of all his data verify his assertion well, though somehow I feel jilted. There is so much more to life than reproduction and procreation of the species. Attraction is not as simple a matter as genetic predilection and instinct, or generalizations in psychology. Ridley covers deviations very little, and explains why they exist (as byproducts or mutations). Overall, I vastly understand the world of sexual selection as a major contributor to our present customs and inclinations as a species. The rant on evolution at the end felt out of place, but the conclusion was concise. The value of the Red Queen is its compilation of data to support the relevance of sex in our evolution. "

I should have read it many years ago when it first came out. My main criticism is that it is somewhat dated. It appears that he wrote nothing of the Bonobos in the original edition then threw in a few paragraphs in the later edition. Unfortunately, the information about Bonobo sexuality is important and should have informed his conclusions more. I do recommend it, but read with the knowledge that the original was written over 10 years ago and new information and research has emerged which is not taken into consideration. I don't think his conclusions would be radically changed, but certainly would be better nuanced.Dr. Darrel Ray, author of Sex and God: How Religion Distorts Sexuality, and The God Virus."

First half of the book sets up the more homocentric second half. The summary: men are naturally polygamous, women naturally monogamous. Men like youth and beauty. Women like wealth and power. Civilization works for the greatest good when monogamy rules, since polygamy favors a select few and leaves many others partnerless. Otherwise the rich men in their sports cars would steal all the thunder and the lightning as well. And many more men would kill each other for beauty, literally not just metaphorically. "

Natural selection simply asserts that species change as they adapt to ever-changing environments. Evolution is not a process by which human beings or societies become better. Those organisms best able to survive in a challenging, shifting environment live to reproduce. The environment can change at any moment, thus neutralizing any advantage of any species.Sex provides the necessary variation that keeps evolution going, and without constant evolution, competitors and environmental change would lead to extinction of all species.

If so, this book would be a great place to start. It's one of those ridiculously insight inducing reads. It's also one of those books that you absolutely can not judge by its cover. Or by its first and last chapters. Curious? Than by all means read on. One of the things that put me off of the book (before I actually read it) was the title The Red Queen. I'm dreadfully embarrassed to admit that I assumed it had something to do with menstruation. Not that there's anything wrong with menstruation. I just wasn't particularly motivated to commit a decent chunk of my ""one wild life"" to a long form exploration of that particular subject.When I actually read the book, I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't about menstruation at all. The title is actually a clever reference to Lewis Carroll's Red Queen from Through the Looking-Glass, a character who has to keep running to stay in the same place. Matt Ridley's hypothesis is that sex is essentially an organisms strategy for outwitting its constantly mutating internal predators (e.g. parasites, viruses etc.), a process he likens to an arms race. The point being, that in any sort of arms race, both sides work their asses off just to maintain their relative positions against the other. Essentially running in place. Hence ""The Red Queen"" analogy. Another reason I was reluctant to read the book, before a I actually read the book, was that I was sort of convinced that sexual selection (as opposed to natural selection all red in tooth and claw) was the lesser feature of Darwin's dangerous idea. After actually reading the book, I have essentially experienced a 180 degree change in perspective. I now view sexual selection as possessing awesome explanatory power. The Red Queen bravely attempts to address dozens of difficult questions regarding the otherwise mysterious workings of human nature and culture. Far form perfect. Provisional and dated. But nevertheless less brilliantly written and entertaining as all get out. The Red Queen offers an extraordinarily generative approach for interpreting the human condition and how it has evolved.I highly recommend actually reading this book."
151,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This book one star deducted because of the long-winded introduction. I almost added it at the end though, because that was so brilliant. This is a lucid, immensely readable book about the evolutinary foundation of human nature. It starts out with animals and covers much the same ground as ""the Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins that I read not long ago. However, it as soon as it moves into the deeper waters of human nature it becomes vastly more interesting.Humang beings are just another animal species. We're not very special - other species have culture and language too, although not as finely honed as humans'. We run on instinct too, as learning is costly and dangerous. Language learning and a fear of snakes, for example, are hard-wired in our brains. Speaking of brains, why are ours so big? Matt Ridley presents the thoughs of Miller, who thinks it's selected for. Human beings are very keen on wit and humour (come think of it, so am I) and this has been sexually selected for. To keep ahead in the ferocious inter-species competition, men had to be ever smarter and this lead to an ever-increasing brain size for both genders. We live on gossip and deception and the most succesful of us tend to be the best ""mindreaders"". ""The choosines of human beings in picking their mates has driven the human mind into a history of frenzied expansion for no reason except that wit, virtuosity, inventiveness and individuality turn other people on"". It's an interesting theory at any rate! Anyone interested in human nature and why we are as we are should read this book. Fascinating! This works well as an introduction to both human nature and evolution."

Very scientific review of why humans have 2 genders and aren't hermaphrodides, what advantages procreating through sex rather than one of the many other ways has etc. Once you get past the first 1/3 it becomes much more understandable and interesting. Rule 1 for all humans, ""success in life equals having grandchildren survive to adulthood"" (read - pass on your genes). Approach for men, that translates into the quantity of sexual partners Approach for women, that translates into quality of sexual partners. And the rest are fascinating deductions from that rule and those approaches. Just jump over the first chapters. Reminds me of one of my all time favorites. That is ""Brain Sex"" which surely has a better name, but is no more intersteing in the end."

I must becoming centrist in my old age, because I found Ridley's approach to strike just the right tone between authoritative and skeptical. Nothing is certain, but certain theories seem to hold more sway. Ridley's narrative also makes it clear that the answer is probably in the middle of conflicting theories, human nature being as complex as it is.My two favorite takeaways from the book: 1) Sex is most probably an evolutionary response to dealing with disease. 2) The human mind is the equivalent of the peacock tail -- a quirk of human-ness that evolved to attract mates. Now I know why creativity is so sexual."

The author refreshingly acknowledges that half of the theories he espouses in the book are likely to be wrong; for instance, I am highly skeptical of Ridley's theory that human large-brainedness arose from runaway sexual selection favoring cute, disproportionately large heads. Nonetheless, I have no good reason to doubt this, and, as Ridley notes, all arguments of runaway sexual selection involve somewhat circular reasoning. I was fond of Ridley's literary allusions to illustrate the primalness of our evolutionarily-shaped motivations. Finally, this book is highly motivational with regards to my life's goal of acquiring a large harem. "

The author is quick to clarify, but often writes in a style that seems to deliberately generate an overlarge need to clarify - this is a book of meandering thoughts for the most part. Ridley strives to sound neutral, but always gives the impression of having an agenda (although if it's any more developed than 'hey, use my cool metaphor', I missed it). Still, it raises some interesting questions, for all that it pretends to greater certainty than is really warranted in such a rapidly evolving field of study."

He states a theory, and then loves to say, but, wait, in the black tailed, orange-rimmed sage grouse, the opposite happens. It's annoying how he picks out a totally obscure animal/insect/bacteria to prove the theory has flaws. Clearly, he has done an amazing amount of research - but to what end?

161,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2775247-alexander-tomislav,5,"This book sets a case that sexual selection is the reason, as for the peacock's tail, so for the human intelligence as well. The title comes from Lewis Carroll's ""Alice through the Looking Glass"" character of Red Queen, who, the faster she goes, the more she stays in place. This is related to the evolutionary phenomenon of ""locked"" development, such as between parasites and hosts. The more parasites adapt to hosts' defenses, the more defenses will be evolved in the hosts.Drawing on many a research, the author starts with examples from the animal world, examining clues and evidence from a geneticist's, evolutionist's and ecological points of view. Biggest clue is how many features of animals (long tail feathers and bright colors in some birds, for example) serve more for the organism to breed, than to survive. Indeed, driven by the genes' impetus to replicate, it's more ""Breeding of the fittest"" than survival.One of the biggest problems that evolutionary science faces is the attitude, common in humanistic sciences, that male and female brains are identical. Not so, claims the author, and the reasoning is compelling and sound - just as different environmental pressures caused male and female bodies to be different, it did the same to our brains. No amount of wishful thinking or political correctness can make that different. However, he's quick to point out ""Give men an inch of inequality and they will claim a mile of bias."". The human body blueprint is female, and only through two testosterone bursts (in womb and at the start of puberty) does it become masculine. Environment plays a big role in gene expression and the author demonstrates in multiple places how nature and nurture aren't opposites, but work together. As a reason for explosive development of the human brain, the author shows how the competition between members of the same species drove that development. We didn't become smarter to make tools, or to hunt, or to develop language and society. Many animals hunt, have complicated social dynamics, use tools and rudimentary communication. We evolved big brains to outwit each other.Until humanity accepts what it is, instead of vainly focusing on what it should be, we can't advance as a species. Selected quotes:""Human nature is a product of culture, but culture is also a product of human nature, and both are the products of evolution."" [pg 6.]""Humanity is, of course, morally free to make and remake itself infinitely, but we do not do so. We stick to the same monotonously human pattern of organizing our affairs. If we were more adventurous, there would be societies without love, without ambition, without sexual desire, without marriage, without art, without grammar, without music, without smilesâ and with as many unimaginable novelties as are in that list. There would be societies in which women killed each other more often than men, in which old people were considered more beautiful than twenty-year-olds, in which wealth did not purchase power over others, in which people did not discriminate in favor of their own friends and against strangers, in which parents did not love their own children."" [pg. 7]""Evolution is something that happens to organisms. It is a directionless process that sometimes makes an animalâs descendants more complicated, sometimes simpler, and sometimes changes them not at all. We are so steeped in notions of progress and self-improvement that we find it strangely hard to accept this."" [pg. 31]""Nicholas Humphrey, a Cambridge psychologist, was the first to see clearly the solution to this puzzle. We use our intellects not to solve practical problems but to outwit each other. Deceiving people, detecting deceit, understanding peopleâs motives, manipulating peopleâ these are what the intellect is used for. So what matters is not how clever and crafty you are but how much more clever and craftier you are than other people. The value of intellect is infinite. Selection within the species is always going to be more important than selection between the species."" [pg. 34]""Sex is about disease. It is used to combat the threat from parasites. Organisms need sex to keep their genes one step ahead of their parasites. Men are not redundant after all; they are womanâs insurance policy against her children being wiped out by influenza and smallpox..."" [pg. 86]""The goal for every female animal is to find a mate with sufficient genetic quality to make a good husband, a good father, or a good sire. The goal for every male animal is often to find as many wives as possible and sometimes to find good mothers and dams, only rarely to find good wives. In 1972, Robert Trivers noticed the reason for this asymmetry, which runs right through the animal kingdom; the rare exceptions to his rule prove why it generally holds. The sex that invests most in rearing the youngâ by carrying a fetus for nine months in its belly, for exampleâ is the sex that makes the least profit from an extra mating. The sex that invests the least has time to spare to seek other mates. Therefore, broadly speaking, males invest less and seek quantity of mates, while females invest more and seek quality of mates."" [pg. 132]""Murder is ânaturalâ in the sense that our ape relatives commit it regularly, as apparently did our human ancestors. Prejudice, hate, violence, crueltyâ all are more or less part of our nature, and all can be effectively countered by the right kind of nurture. Nature is not inflexible but malleable."" [pg. 181]""Lesbians, free of constraints imposed by male nature, do not suddenly indulge in sexual promiscuity; on the contrary, they are remarkably monogamous. None of this is surprising: Female animals gain little from sexual opportunism, for their reproductive ability is limited not by how many males they mate with but how long it takes to bear offspring. In this respect men and women are very different."" [pg. 218]""[...]the ban on polygamous marriage does not prevent the males from seeking polygamous matings. Adultery is common. It is most common between high-ranking males and females of all ranks. To prevent it males try to guard their wives, are extremely violent toward their wivesâ lovers, and copulate with their wives frequently, not just when they are fertile."" [pg. 234]""The noble savage, far from living in contented sexual equanimity, was paranoid about becoming, and intent on making his neighbor into, a cuckold[...] Cuckoldry paranoia is deep-seated in men. The use of veils, chaperones, purdah, female circumcision, and chastity belts all bear witness to a widespread male fear of being cuckolded and a widespread suspicion that wives, as well as their potential lovers, are the ones to distrust[...] Jealousy is a âhuman universal,â and no culture lacks it. Despite the best efforts of anthropologists to find a society with no jealousy and so prove that it is an emotion introduced by pernicious social pressure or pathology, sexual jealousy seems to be an unavoidable part of being a human being."" [pg. 235]""There has been no genetic change since we were hunter-gatherers, but deep in the mind of the modern man is a simple male hunter-gatherer rule: Strive to acquire power and use it to lure women who will bear heirs; strive to acquire wealth and use it to buy other menâs wives who will bear bastards. It began with a man who shared a piece of prized fish or honey with an attractive neighborâs wife in exchange for a brief affair and continues with a pop star ushering a model into his Mercedes. From fish to Mercedes, the history is unbroken: via skins and beads, plows and cattle, swords and castles. Wealth and power are means to women; women are means to genetic eternity."" [pg. 244]""Testosterone is an ancient chemical, found in much the same form throughout the vertebrates. Its concentration determines aggressiveness so exactly that in birds with reversed sex roles, such as phalaropes and in female-dominated hyena clans, it is the females that have higher levels of testosterone in the blood. Testosterone masculinizes the body; without it, the body remains female, whatever its genes. It also masculinizes the brain."" [pg. 254]""Baby girls are more interested in smiling, communicating, and in people, boys in action and things. Shown cluttered pictures, boys select objects, girls people. Boys are instantly obsessed with dismantling, assembling, destroying, possessing, and coveting things. Girls are fascinated by people and treat their toys as surrogate people. Hence, to suit their mentalities, we have invented toys that suit each sex. We give boys tractors and girls dolls. We are reinforcing the stereotypical obsessions that they already have, but we are not creating them.""

Men and women were initially encouraged to drop all sex roles in kibbutzim: Haircuts and clothes were unisex; boys were encouraged to be peaceful and sensitive, while girls were treated like tomboys; men did household chores and women went out to work. Yet three generations later, the attempt has largely been abandoned, and kibbutz life is actually more sexist than life in the rest of Israel. People have returned to stereotypes. Men politick, while women tend the home; boys study physics and become engineers, while girls study sociology and become teachers and nurses. Women manage the morale, health, and education of the kibbutz, while men manage the finances, security, and business.[...] Women clean house in a kibbutz because, like women everywhere, they complain that men would not do it properly. Men do not clean house in a kibbutz because, like men everywhere, they complain that if they did, their wives would say it had not been done properly."" [pg. 260]""The bizarre thing about this assertion of different natures is that it is a thoroughly feminist assertion. There is a contradiction at the heart of feminism, one that few feminists have acknowledged. You cannot say, first, that men and women are equally capable of all jobs and, second, that if jobs were done by women, they would be done differently. So feminism itself is anything but egalitarian. Feminists argue explicitly that if more women were in charge, more caring values would prevail. They begin from the presumption that women are by nature different beings. If women ran the world, there would be no war. When women run companies, cooperation, not competition, is the watchword. These are all explicit and firm assertions of sexism: that the personalities and natures of women are different from men. If womenâs personalities are different, is it not likely that they will prove better or worse at certain jobs than men? Differences cannot be appealed to when they suit and denied when they do not."" [pg. 261]""The assertion that âcultureâ explains human variation will be taken seriously when there are reports of women war parties raiding villages to capture men as husbands, or of parents cloistering their sons but not their daughters to protect their sonsâ virtue, or when cultural distributions for preferences concerning physical attractiveness, earning power, relative age, and so on show as many cultures with bias in one direction as in the other."" [pg. 275]""Somewhere in our education we unthinkingly absorb the idea that nature (genes) and nurture (environment) are opposites and that we must make a choice between them. If we choose environmentalism, then we are espousing a universal human nature that is as blank as a sheet of paper awaiting cultureâs pen, that humans are therefore perfectible and born equal. If we choose genes, then we espouse irreversible genetic differences between races and between individuals. We are fatalists and elitists. Who would not hope with all her heart that the geneticists were wrong?"" [pg. 317]""If you want to understand human motives, read Proust or Trollope or Tom Wolfe, not Freud or Piaget or Skinner. We are obsessed with one anotherâs minds. âOur intuitive commonsense psychology far surpasses any scientific psychology in scope and accuracy,â wrote Don Symons. 39 Horace Barlow points out that great literary minds are, almost by definition, great mind-reading minds."" [pg. 333]""Robert Trivers has argued that to deceive others well, an animal must deceive itself, and that self-deceptionâs hallmark is a biased system of transfer from the conscious to the unconscious mind. Deception is therefore the reason for the invention of the subconscious."" [pg.335]""Mankind is a self-domesticated animal; a mammal; an ape; a social ape; an ape in which the male takes the iniative in courtship and females usually leave the society of their birth; an ape in which men are predators, women herbivorous foragers; an ape in which males are relatively hierarchical, females relatively egalitarian; an ape in which males contribute unusually large amounts of investment in the upbringing of their offspring by provisioning their mates and their children with food, protection, and company; an ape in which monogamous pair bonds are the rule but many males have affairs and occasional males achieve polygamy; an ape in which females mated to low-ranking males often cuckold their husbands in order to gain access to the genes of higher-ranking males; an ape that has been subject to unusually intense mutual sexual selection so that many of the features of the female body (lips, breasts, waists) and the mind of both sexes (songs, competitive ambition, status seeking) are designed for use in competition for mates; an ape that has developed an extraordinary range of new instincts to learn by association, to communicate by speech, and to pass on traditions. But still an ape.""[pg.348]"
162,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3355789-mark,4,"In a frenetic effort to stay interesting, Matt Ridley unconsciously finishes his book with a terrific built-in summary by introducing Robin Dunbar's ""Scherazade Effect"" which is the frenetic effort to stay interesting, with sex and hence reproduction and life itself at stake.The book's a little like that: Matt's a consummate researcher and very good at explaining, and he's scraped together a mountain of anecdotes in support of his thesis which is, what exactly? It's kind of a little bit lost in all the stories but basically looking for the reason we are people instead of ordinary animals, he finds sexual selection and the need to be attractive as causal in the case of neoteny, big brains, language, tools, dominant men and sexy women, everything you want.There are a million uncomfortable moments wherein simple circular dynamics diverge in unstable fashion to a new set point, like a peacock's feathers or human brains or a whale's (two ton!) gonads. Like Ridley, I couldn't resist a teaser there, but the  point  is that like so many, Ridley has a hard time wrapping his brain around recursive iterative dynamics. Since that's my JOB, I'm ok with it, but remember being frustrated and tied in a mental knot by the chicken / egg / chicken problem of feedback in physical systems. I do feel the analogy's apt though. There doesn't have to be a driving reason for everything, if a tiny nudge can suffice to loose an avalanche of consequent evolution. I find that believable.One thing he might have missed, in trying to explain us (humans) in an area cosmologists have long since overcome, which is the ""we're not special"" or ""duh, because WE're here"" explanation as to why the sun is just the right temperature or the boltzman constant just so: the reason is that the people in that potential universe or on that potential planet just arent. They aren't there, they entirely aint. I'm doing a horrible job explaining that, but basically SOMEBODY had to be on the top of the food chain and I'm personally glad to be lucky enough that it's me. Why am  I  thinking about evolution? My answer? ""Because if I were an ant I couldn't."" I think Ridley misses that he doesn't have to go searching for some reason why WE in particular are special. We're just lucky that way; ~ somebody had to be.Ahh, never mind all that. In summary, it's hard to dislike a guy who calls both Freud and Skinner misguided. This is a fun book and certainly has a lot of truth in it. Ridley wants a main theme and maybe hasn't got one, but he doesn't need it anyway. Bravo.-------------------------------Here's a long postscript on why there's a 50:50 ratio of the sexes.Gina asked why males aren't rare, since it wouldn't seem so many are necessary. I re-read a whole chapter & wrote this reply...The answer, in the Red Queen, lies around page 100. It's long and complex and, in case you want to cut to the chase, finally an unsatisfying answer.First I think I noted that male and female as different genders are an idea organized around using organelles (mitochondria) from just ONE parent. Apparently otherwise competition between them within the cell is destructive, so it's better to just pick one parent from which to get 'em. (It's the female: the sperm is stripped of all but its nucleus in the catharsis of fertilization.)Why not hermaphrodites came up next and the answer was that in a hermaphroditic population, there would be instabilities, for example a tendency to kill off your male parts would make more resources available to the female nature, which would be thereby advantaged. Ultrafemmes would outperform hermaphrodites as mothers, and in so doing, make sperm scarce. Female killer genes could also then prosper, these making a new offspring hypermale. So an instability is encouraged by the basic idea of commitment: by being ""all in"" in one's choice of sex, you have a better chance of success than playing both sides & thereby hedging two bets badly.So far we still don't have any reason why the numbers should be so easily balanced. There are plenty of creatures where that's not the case, and there are ""driving"" genes that cause sex ratio distortion. Ritter he documents one human family wherein only girls were born. Why wouldn't such a thing, this parthenogenesis, catch on, at least in some proportion? All these different causes seem like tendencies that ought to swing towards some optimal ratio which would (obviously?) benefit from a male percentage << 50%. ...and that's your question, still unanswered. Lemmings actually solve it with a third sex chromosome that biases the odds towards females, a seemingly better system. Are we just unlucky vs lemmings?He delves briefly into other systems, as when unfertilized eggs become male (a clearly stable situation) or my favorite, when ALL the fish in the school are female, save the biggest, who changes teams to fulfill his duties. I guess the point is, there are plenty of exceptions to the rule. Ridley delights in these digressions.Then there were many more anecdotes, sort of diffusing away into a fog of confusion, doubtless why I forgot this next point. ""Munching a burrito"" with some scientist, he notes that dominant women & monkeys (& cows and chickens) have more sons, that female hormones not genetics tend most (and there are many factors) to bias the sex ratios, and a shortage of men makes for dominant females. It doesn't seem to ""tend"" towards exactly 50:50 or even be strongly supported, certainly not convincingly so in the face of the profligate polygamous male hypothesis. So the question goes down as being self corrected by mysterious and non genetic means. Unsatisfying. More theories then follow, but many of these have to do with social criteria pertinent only to humans (you can always marry a beautiful daughter up-caste, but not a son) but these theories do not answer as to why farmers have failed to breed female only lines of cattle, however hard they try. That last observation was a quote from Dawkins, and seemingly his last word. I have to suspect Ridley should have accepted this as unknown and ended the chapter there.At least, I will."

According to the author, human beings were âdesignedâ to reproduce and that without understanding competitive reproduction we will not be able to comprehend the human psyche and nature. Well known journalist, scientist and educator; Matt Ridley, brings us a well-rounded science book that deals with many fascinating topics involving sexual evolution. The first third of book or so starts off a little dense and may put off some readers but once it picks up it really takes off and rewards readers with invaluable knowledge. This 416-page book is composed of the following ten chapters: 1. Human Nature, 2. The Enigma, 3. The Power of Parasites, 4. Genetic Mutiny and Gender, 5. The Peacockâs Tale, 6. Polygamy and the Nature of Men, 7. Monogamy and the Nature of Women, 8. Sexing the Mind, 9. The Uses of Beauty, and 10. The Intellectual Chess Game. Positives:1.	A well-written and well-researched book. 2.	The fascinating topic of sexual evolution in the hands of a master.3.	The book was originally published in 1993 but it holds up generally well and itâs still worth reading.4.	Good use of the best that science had to offer at that time.5.	Thought-provoking and refreshingly honest and witty approach.6.	Provides compelling arguments in support of a universal human nature.7.	Explains the reasoning behind the title which is a metaphor in evolution for âthe faster you run, the more the world moves with you and the less you make progressâ.8.	Some great analogies, âThe fashion in evolutionary science now is to scoff at progress; evolution is a treadmill, not a ladderâ.9.	What sex is. A look from three different kinds of scientists. Great stuff.10.	The unbelievable world of sex in both the animal and plant kingdom.11.	Some great facts and perspectives, âThe âgreat warâ of 1914-18 killed 25 million people in four years. The influenza epidemic that followed killed 25 million in four monthsâ.12.	What drive the evolution of sex.13.	Understanding what evolution is in a practical sense.14.	How science works to address a problem.15.	Understanding gender in terms of âgenetic lotteryâ. Or leave it to the environment.16.	Some great anecdotes, âAnaxagoraâs belief that lying on the right side during sex would produce a boy was so influential that centuries later some French aristocrats had their left testicles amputatedâ. Ouch!17.	The nature of âchoosyâ females.18.	The two warring factions in sexual selection: âFisherâ and âGood-genesâ.19.	Testosterone and its relation to disease.20.	What men find attractive in women.21.	The impact of human culture.22.	An honest look at the roles of the sexes.23.	An understanding about homosexual behavior.24.	Game theory and how it plays out between males and females. Always interesting.25.	Human evolution always fascinating.26.	The growth of our brains.27.	Understanding the evil practice of female infanticide.28.	Power as a tool for sexual success. Itâs good being the king.29.	Marriage, understanding the institution of.30.	Adultery and how it shaped human society.31.	Fascinating look at what societies favor daughters over sons and vice versa.32.	The differences of mental features between the sexes.33.	A look at social statuses.34.	The innate instinct of learning language.35.	The evidence for neoteny.36.	Links to notes worked great! Negatives:1.	The first third or so of the book was a bit dense and may have put off some readers.2.	Despite holding up generally well (book was published in 1993), some topics are outdated. For instance, free will is an illusion. I will provide a list of suggestion that offers more up to date information.3.	Animal altruism is not a myth.4.	Some topics are fairly logical. We all have a basic grasp of sexual selection.5.	Some topics may irk feminists. Let me leave it at that.6.	The author purposely sidesteps the issue of morality and the little that is here is inadequate.7.	âDeception is therefore the reason for the invention of the subconscious.â â Trivers Really?In summary, I wished I had read this book when it first came out in 1993. The book started off a little dry but once it gets going I wasnât able to put it down. Many topics of popular interest in the hands of an accomplished author make for good reading. In spite of its age, I learned some new things and have a much better grasp of why human nature evolved as a result of sex. If you have the patience to make it through the early chapters the book will reward you with wisdom, worth reading! Further recommendations: ""Humanâ and âWhoâs In Charge?â by Michael S.

The experience is much more amusing if you pause and reflect - and try to devise your own explanations - before reading the main theories.That's why it gets a 5/5.OBS: In order to better enjoy the book, I recommend reading ""The Selfish Gene"" first."
167,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13334219-ralph-hermansen,4,"""The Red Queen"" by Matt Ridley. A review by Ralph Hermansen.I would buy Matt Ridley's next book without hesitation, no matter what the topic. He is one of the few authors who thoroughly researches his subject and understands the science underlying it. He then delivers the information to you in an interesting way. You certainly get your money's worth in his books.""The Red Queen"" is about the evolutionary forces which has shaped us as human beings. The significance of Lewis Carroll's Red Queen from the book, ""Alice in Wonderland"", is that we have to run just to stand still. So it is with evolution. We have to improve our survival skills over the generations to keep pace with the other plants and animals which are also advancing in their survival skills.Much of what we are as humans has to do with sexual selection. Charles Darwin introduced the concept of natural selection in his book, ""Origin of the Species"", but he devoted an even greater deal of space to his concept of sexual selection in his book, ""The Descent of Man"". No matter how superior you are in survival abilities, it is all for naught if you do not pass those traits on to your offspring. Therefore mating is vitally important. You must be attractive to the opposite sex and this manifests itself in diverse ways amongst the animals. Moreover, sexual selection may create traits that seem to work against survivability. The peacock would certainly be better served with a smaller, less ornate tail, which makes him a more obvious target for predators.Ridley picks up where Darwin left off and explores the sexuality of humans as they have evolved from apes and gradually became a big brained animal over millions of years of evolution. He has incorporated most of the ideas of modern scientists related to this subject. Men are attracted to beauty and women are attracted to powerful men, who can provide for them. In the animal kingdom, the female selects the male with the best traits and the males are willing to mate with most any female in heat. The case has become different for modern humans because human babies are helpless far longer than in normal in the animal kingdom. This is a consequence of out massive brain, which must continue developing outside the womb.One part of the book did leave me surprised. Ridley got so caught up in his analysis of what women would do in selecting men that he surmised that women would rarely engage in opportunistic sex as it is against their self interest. Mr. Ridley, if you had been single and dating in California in the 1970's, you would soon realize how very mistaken you are. Many women had decided that they were now equal to men and could enjoy the same pleasures and they did. A few years later, fear of AIDS put an end to this libertine period. Alas!Aside from that mistaken projection, the Red Queen book is excellent and I think you will enjoy reading it. Ralph Hermansen 10/04/08 "
168,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47841182-myrto-smyrilioy-zerva,5,"This is a book targeted at biologists and not, alike. It consists of a, not completely unbiased review of our knowledge on the subjects of a human evolution and inherent nature beautifully stated by a superfluous pen with a deep understanding and fiery passion on the subject. It is an educational read but the wit and humor is not secrificed in the altar of scientific accuracy or logical argument. I found this book both stimulating, informative and entertaining. This is also helped by a fantastic audio."

Reread.This book is about the effect of parasites on sex and culture. Sex is the caused by the need to fight off parasites that have a much faster generational cycle than we do. Our culture is a product in large part of this sexual dynamic.Quotes:""Evolution is a treadmill not a ladder.""""Evolution is something that happens to organisms. It is a directionless process that sometimes makes an animal's decedents more complicated, sometimes simpler, and sometimes changes them not at all. We are so steeped in notions of progress and self-improvement that we find it strangely hard to accept this.""""Parasites are in constant battle with hosts, a battle that is fought by switching from one resistance gene to another; hence the battery of different versions of genes. None of this would work without sex.""""If the goal is to have the sexist son in the next generation, then one way of doing that is to mate with the sexiest male; a second way is to prevent other females from mating with the sexiest male.""""We are designed for a system of monogamy plagued by adultery.""""What caused the sudden and spectacular expansion of that one ape's head, from which so much else flowed? Why did it happen to one ape and not another? What can account for the astonishing speed, and the accelerating speed of the change? These questions may seem to have nothing to do with the subject of this book, but the answer may lie with sex. If new theories are right, the evolution of man's big head was the result of a Red Queen sexual contest between individuals of the same gender.""""Half the ideas in this book are probably wrong."""
170,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1251066-andy,3,"I've been meaning to read this for years, after an old flat-mate told me about it while studying for his BSc in the psychology of attraction. Finally found it in a charity shop in Tunbridge Wells and decided to finish of the year with some evolutionary pondering.Matt Ridley freely states that the first third may not be as interesting to some as he details the background of evolutionary theory in relation to sexual activity and behaviour in animals. Dry perhaps, may be a better term. It's the later parts of the book though where things get interesting, looking at how human nature (if indeed humans can be said to have a specific 'nature') may (or may not) have been shaped by evolutionary pressures. There are many fascinating examples and case studies, compiled expertly by Ridley. As he again mentions, he has compiled these mostly from the work of others, trying to tie a lot of individual theories and evidence together. Generally he manages a good job and it's eminently readable.Whether or not you agree or believe is entirely another matter and really, books such as this should be read to educate and promote discussion. He doesn't (and shouldn't) attempt to claim a definitive conclusion and many avenues are left open to debate. I personally found it compelling. My biggest issue is how out of date much of the evidence (and some occasional clumsy discussions, particularly around homosexuality) is now, having been written almost 20 years ago. I would certainly be interested in reading a more up to date discussion of the state of the field.Still, a well recognised and deserved text, worth reading."
171,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361083-erwin,5,"Excellent book. Definitely worth reading for everyone, particularly followers of any religion.Summary is that Human Intelligence, just like a peacocks feathers, are the result of Sexual Selection. The more intelligent, the more able to outsmart other humans, and the more able to mate --- this especially applies to men.Few aspects of human nature can be understood apart from sex, since human nature is a product of evolution, and evolution in our case is driven specifically by sexual replication.The book begins with an evolutionary account of sex itself, defending the theory that sex flourishes, despite its energetic costs, primarily because a sexually mixed heritage confers to offspring a defensive ""head start"" against parasites received from and originally adapted to the maternal host environment.Human intelligence is largely a result of sexual selection. Human intelligence far outstrips any survivalist demands that would have been placed on our hominid ancestors, and analogizes human intelligence to the peacock's tail, a trait widely believed to be the result of sexual selection. Human intelligence is used primarily to attract mates through prodigious displays of wit, charm, inventiveness, and individuality.Next I should read The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature."
172,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5619806-veronica,2,"Okay, so the good points of the book: when the author discusses the up to date and relevant research of scientists, he does so respectfully, succinctly, and accurately. He does not both too much with alternative perspectives, but for the most part, while sometimes unpalatable information, I tend to agree with the information. The worse points of the book: his own opinion is often absurd. His methods of making the information relatable is, in my opinion, stupid. He lacks the creativity to make a compelling story out of facts, and frankly, the theories are often so elegant and beautiful, it's unnecessary anyway. Finally, in his final depressing notes, he not just criticizes, but attempts to entirely discredit pioneers in many different fields, none of which he is an expert in. Even if some of the theories are no longer considered accurate or represent our world model, they paved the path for future endeavours which have enhanced our knowledge of the natural world and our place within it. Finally, several of the individuals he attempted to discredit are still at the forefront of their fields and are still considered accurate and representative of present day findings. Following this, he gives us his own uneducated opinions on where he thinks the future will take us. The only reason he got two stars at all was because of the research he did present and do justice to. I'm shocked this book has such high reviews. I was so looking forward to reading it. "

Matt Ridley manages to handle the subject with such an elegance, concision and property quite difficult to find among ""entrepreneurial"" scholars nowadays. This book is really informative and not just another idiot trying to make some extra-money by spreading pseudo-science.A must read if you want to get acquainted with the ways of modern Biology and Human Sciences in general; yet, you will find a lot of ingenious answers to common misconceptions and useful knowledge to understand the wonderful intricacies of social interaction at an animal level.And yes, it is an easy replacement for bad literature; for you see, It'll make you feel better with yourself, get you laid more often or just serve as a good excuse to keep your fidelity."

That's probably a generous estimate on the author's part! I would also add ""sexist"" to ""wrong.""

We're back to square one."" ""Inject all pregnant women with the right dose of hormones, and the result would be men and women with normal bodies but identical female brains. War, rape, boxing, car racing, pornography, and hamburgers and beer would soon be distant memories.""Then he talks about how women with Turner's syndrome are born without ovaries.

This isn't a book you will enjoy unless you are a fan of biology and the behavior of animals (which I in fact am not).I went into this expecting exactly what the title promised: the evolution of human nature, yet there was more talk about birds, insects, apes and snails than there actually was about humans. While I do understand that giving a kind of background for this topic is necessary, to me it seemed like it was overdone. Only in the last third did it actually focus on the theme it was supposed to focus on, but the 200+ pages that took me to get there weren't really worth it. There were some very interesting theories here, but I found a few facts being repeated over and over again. I don't really know what to say. I'm just pretty disappointed in The Red Queen and I'll be hesitant to pick up anything regarding this subject in the future, even though I am interested in it."

Ridley cites Darwin, multiple fascinating biological studies, and psychological experiments. The findings of all his data verify his assertion well, though somehow I feel jilted. There is so much more to life than reproduction and procreation of the species. Attraction is not as simple a matter as genetic predilection and instinct, or generalizations in psychology. Ridley covers deviations very little, and explains why they exist (as byproducts or mutations). Overall, I vastly understand the world of sexual selection as a major contributor to our present customs and inclinations as a species. The rant on evolution at the end felt out of place, but the conclusion was concise. The value of the Red Queen is its compilation of data to support the relevance of sex in our evolution. "

I should have read it many years ago when it first came out. My main criticism is that it is somewhat dated. It appears that he wrote nothing of the Bonobos in the original edition then threw in a few paragraphs in the later edition. Unfortunately, the information about Bonobo sexuality is important and should have informed his conclusions more. I do recommend it, but read with the knowledge that the original was written over 10 years ago and new information and research has emerged which is not taken into consideration. I don't think his conclusions would be radically changed, but certainly would be better nuanced.Dr. Darrel Ray, author of Sex and God: How Religion Distorts Sexuality, and The God Virus."

First half of the book sets up the more homocentric second half. The summary: men are naturally polygamous, women naturally monogamous. Men like youth and beauty. Women like wealth and power. Civilization works for the greatest good when monogamy rules, since polygamy favors a select few and leaves many others partnerless. Otherwise the rich men in their sports cars would steal all the thunder and the lightning as well. And many more men would kill each other for beauty, literally not just metaphorically. "
179,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2296903-jana,4,"It's important to understand that evolution is not a process of improvement. Natural selection simply asserts that species change as they adapt to ever-changing environments. Evolution is not a process by which human beings or societies become better. Those organisms best able to survive in a challenging, shifting environment live to reproduce. The environment can change at any moment, thus neutralizing any advantage of any species.Sex provides the necessary variation that keeps evolution going, and without constant evolution, competitors and environmental change would lead to extinction of all species.

If so, this book would be a great place to start. It's one of those ridiculously insight inducing reads. It's also one of those books that you absolutely can not judge by its cover. Or by its first and last chapters. Curious? Than by all means read on. One of the things that put me off of the book (before I actually read it) was the title The Red Queen. I'm dreadfully embarrassed to admit that I assumed it had something to do with menstruation. Not that there's anything wrong with menstruation. I just wasn't particularly motivated to commit a decent chunk of my ""one wild life"" to a long form exploration of that particular subject.When I actually read the book, I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't about menstruation at all. The title is actually a clever reference to Lewis Carroll's Red Queen from Through the Looking-Glass, a character who has to keep running to stay in the same place. Matt Ridley's hypothesis is that sex is essentially an organisms strategy for outwitting its constantly mutating internal predators (e.g. parasites, viruses etc.), a process he likens to an arms race. The point being, that in any sort of arms race, both sides work their asses off just to maintain their relative positions against the other. Essentially running in place. Hence ""The Red Queen"" analogy. Another reason I was reluctant to read the book, before a I actually read the book, was that I was sort of convinced that sexual selection (as opposed to natural selection all red in tooth and claw) was the lesser feature of Darwin's dangerous idea. After actually reading the book, I have essentially experienced a 180 degree change in perspective. I now view sexual selection as possessing awesome explanatory power. The Red Queen bravely attempts to address dozens of difficult questions regarding the otherwise mysterious workings of human nature and culture. Far form perfect. Provisional and dated. But nevertheless less brilliantly written and entertaining as all get out. The Red Queen offers an extraordinarily generative approach for interpreting the human condition and how it has evolved.I highly recommend actually reading this book."
181,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This book one star deducted because of the long-winded introduction. I almost added it at the end though, because that was so brilliant. This is a lucid, immensely readable book about the evolutinary foundation of human nature. It starts out with animals and covers much the same ground as ""the Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins that I read not long ago. However, it as soon as it moves into the deeper waters of human nature it becomes vastly more interesting.Humang beings are just another animal species. We're not very special - other species have culture and language too, although not as finely honed as humans'. We run on instinct too, as learning is costly and dangerous. Language learning and a fear of snakes, for example, are hard-wired in our brains. Speaking of brains, why are ours so big? Matt Ridley presents the thoughs of Miller, who thinks it's selected for. Human beings are very keen on wit and humour (come think of it, so am I) and this has been sexually selected for. To keep ahead in the ferocious inter-species competition, men had to be ever smarter and this lead to an ever-increasing brain size for both genders. We live on gossip and deception and the most succesful of us tend to be the best ""mindreaders"". ""The choosines of human beings in picking their mates has driven the human mind into a history of frenzied expansion for no reason except that wit, virtuosity, inventiveness and individuality turn other people on"". It's an interesting theory at any rate! Anyone interested in human nature and why we are as we are should read this book. Fascinating! This works well as an introduction to both human nature and evolution."

Very scientific review of why humans have 2 genders and aren't hermaphrodides, what advantages procreating through sex rather than one of the many other ways has etc. Once you get past the first 1/3 it becomes much more understandable and interesting. Rule 1 for all humans, ""success in life equals having grandchildren survive to adulthood"" (read - pass on your genes). Approach for men, that translates into the quantity of sexual partners Approach for women, that translates into quality of sexual partners. And the rest are fascinating deductions from that rule and those approaches. Just jump over the first chapters. Reminds me of one of my all time favorites. That is ""Brain Sex"" which surely has a better name, but is no more intersteing in the end."
183,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,4,"Sex and evolution -- always fun topics and even more fun when you throw them together. I must becoming centrist in my old age, because I found Ridley's approach to strike just the right tone between authoritative and skeptical. Nothing is certain, but certain theories seem to hold more sway. Ridley's narrative also makes it clear that the answer is probably in the middle of conflicting theories, human nature being as complex as it is.My two favorite takeaways from the book: 1) Sex is most probably an evolutionary response to dealing with disease. 2) The human mind is the equivalent of the peacock tail -- a quirk of human-ness that evolved to attract mates. Now I know why creativity is so sexual."
184,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6601778-parker-f,4,"A fascinating book on my favorite topic. The author refreshingly acknowledges that half of the theories he espouses in the book are likely to be wrong; for instance, I am highly skeptical of Ridley's theory that human large-brainedness arose from runaway sexual selection favoring cute, disproportionately large heads. Nonetheless, I have no good reason to doubt this, and, as Ridley notes, all arguments of runaway sexual selection involve somewhat circular reasoning. I was fond of Ridley's literary allusions to illustrate the primalness of our evolutionarily-shaped motivations. Finally, this book is highly motivational with regards to my life's goal of acquiring a large harem. "
185,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32369480-loki,3,"Thought provoking, but less than entirely convincing, look at how genetics effect psychology. The author is quick to clarify, but often writes in a style that seems to deliberately generate an overlarge need to clarify - this is a book of meandering thoughts for the most part. Ridley strives to sound neutral, but always gives the impression of having an agenda (although if it's any more developed than 'hey, use my cool metaphor', I missed it). Still, it raises some interesting questions, for all that it pretends to greater certainty than is really warranted in such a rapidly evolving field of study."

My uncle sent it to my daughter, so I wanted to read it first. I'd let her read it, but I don't know why she would want to. He states a theory, and then loves to say, but, wait, in the black tailed, orange-rimmed sage grouse, the opposite happens. It's annoying how he picks out a totally obscure animal/insect/bacteria to prove the theory has flaws. Clearly, he has done an amazing amount of research - but to what end? I'm going to need to read some 4 & 5 star reviews to see what the point of this book is. "

Only the first half of the book is worth reading; I got to learn about all different strategies that nature uses for sexual and asexual reproduction and different biological applications of game theory.

191,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2775247-alexander-tomislav,5,"This book sets a case that sexual selection is the reason, as for the peacock's tail, so for the human intelligence as well. The title comes from Lewis Carroll's ""Alice through the Looking Glass"" character of Red Queen, who, the faster she goes, the more she stays in place. This is related to the evolutionary phenomenon of ""locked"" development, such as between parasites and hosts. The more parasites adapt to hosts' defenses, the more defenses will be evolved in the hosts.Drawing on many a research, the author starts with examples from the animal world, examining clues and evidence from a geneticist's, evolutionist's and ecological points of view. Biggest clue is how many features of animals (long tail feathers and bright colors in some birds, for example) serve more for the organism to breed, than to survive. Indeed, driven by the genes' impetus to replicate, it's more ""Breeding of the fittest"" than survival.One of the biggest problems that evolutionary science faces is the attitude, common in humanistic sciences, that male and female brains are identical. Not so, claims the author, and the reasoning is compelling and sound - just as different environmental pressures caused male and female bodies to be different, it did the same to our brains. No amount of wishful thinking or political correctness can make that different. However, he's quick to point out ""Give men an inch of inequality and they will claim a mile of bias."". The human body blueprint is female, and only through two testosterone bursts (in womb and at the start of puberty) does it become masculine. Environment plays a big role in gene expression and the author demonstrates in multiple places how nature and nurture aren't opposites, but work together. As a reason for explosive development of the human brain, the author shows how the competition between members of the same species drove that development. We didn't become smarter to make tools, or to hunt, or to develop language and society. Many animals hunt, have complicated social dynamics, use tools and rudimentary communication. We evolved big brains to outwit each other.Until humanity accepts what it is, instead of vainly focusing on what it should be, we can't advance as a species. Selected quotes:""Human nature is a product of culture, but culture is also a product of human nature, and both are the products of evolution."" [pg 6.]""Humanity is, of course, morally free to make and remake itself infinitely, but we do not do so. We stick to the same monotonously human pattern of organizing our affairs. If we were more adventurous, there would be societies without love, without ambition, without sexual desire, without marriage, without art, without grammar, without music, without smilesâ and with as many unimaginable novelties as are in that list. There would be societies in which women killed each other more often than men, in which old people were considered more beautiful than twenty-year-olds, in which wealth did not purchase power over others, in which people did not discriminate in favor of their own friends and against strangers, in which parents did not love their own children."" [pg. 7]""Evolution is something that happens to organisms. It is a directionless process that sometimes makes an animalâs descendants more complicated, sometimes simpler, and sometimes changes them not at all. We are so steeped in notions of progress and self-improvement that we find it strangely hard to accept this."" [pg. 31]""Nicholas Humphrey, a Cambridge psychologist, was the first to see clearly the solution to this puzzle. We use our intellects not to solve practical problems but to outwit each other. Deceiving people, detecting deceit, understanding peopleâs motives, manipulating peopleâ these are what the intellect is used for. So what matters is not how clever and crafty you are but how much more clever and craftier you are than other people. The value of intellect is infinite. Selection within the species is always going to be more important than selection between the species."" [pg. 34]""Sex is about disease. It is used to combat the threat from parasites. Organisms need sex to keep their genes one step ahead of their parasites. Men are not redundant after all; they are womanâs insurance policy against her children being wiped out by influenza and smallpox..."" [pg. 86]""The goal for every female animal is to find a mate with sufficient genetic quality to make a good husband, a good father, or a good sire. The goal for every male animal is often to find as many wives as possible and sometimes to find good mothers and dams, only rarely to find good wives. In 1972, Robert Trivers noticed the reason for this asymmetry, which runs right through the animal kingdom; the rare exceptions to his rule prove why it generally holds. The sex that invests most in rearing the youngâ by carrying a fetus for nine months in its belly, for exampleâ is the sex that makes the least profit from an extra mating. The sex that invests the least has time to spare to seek other mates. Therefore, broadly speaking, males invest less and seek quantity of mates, while females invest more and seek quality of mates."" [pg. 132]""Murder is ânaturalâ in the sense that our ape relatives commit it regularly, as apparently did our human ancestors. Prejudice, hate, violence, crueltyâ all are more or less part of our nature, and all can be effectively countered by the right kind of nurture. Nature is not inflexible but malleable."" [pg. 181]""Lesbians, free of constraints imposed by male nature, do not suddenly indulge in sexual promiscuity; on the contrary, they are remarkably monogamous. None of this is surprising: Female animals gain little from sexual opportunism, for their reproductive ability is limited not by how many males they mate with but how long it takes to bear offspring. In this respect men and women are very different."" [pg. 218]""[...]the ban on polygamous marriage does not prevent the males from seeking polygamous matings. Adultery is common. It is most common between high-ranking males and females of all ranks. To prevent it males try to guard their wives, are extremely violent toward their wivesâ lovers, and copulate with their wives frequently, not just when they are fertile."" [pg. 234]""The noble savage, far from living in contented sexual equanimity, was paranoid about becoming, and intent on making his neighbor into, a cuckold[...] Cuckoldry paranoia is deep-seated in men. The use of veils, chaperones, purdah, female circumcision, and chastity belts all bear witness to a widespread male fear of being cuckolded and a widespread suspicion that wives, as well as their potential lovers, are the ones to distrust[...] Jealousy is a âhuman universal,â and no culture lacks it. Despite the best efforts of anthropologists to find a society with no jealousy and so prove that it is an emotion introduced by pernicious social pressure or pathology, sexual jealousy seems to be an unavoidable part of being a human being."" [pg. 235]""There has been no genetic change since we were hunter-gatherers, but deep in the mind of the modern man is a simple male hunter-gatherer rule: Strive to acquire power and use it to lure women who will bear heirs; strive to acquire wealth and use it to buy other menâs wives who will bear bastards. It began with a man who shared a piece of prized fish or honey with an attractive neighborâs wife in exchange for a brief affair and continues with a pop star ushering a model into his Mercedes. From fish to Mercedes, the history is unbroken: via skins and beads, plows and cattle, swords and castles. Wealth and power are means to women; women are means to genetic eternity."" [pg. 244]""Testosterone is an ancient chemical, found in much the same form throughout the vertebrates. Its concentration determines aggressiveness so exactly that in birds with reversed sex roles, such as phalaropes and in female-dominated hyena clans, it is the females that have higher levels of testosterone in the blood. Testosterone masculinizes the body; without it, the body remains female, whatever its genes. It also masculinizes the brain."" [pg. 254]""Baby girls are more interested in smiling, communicating, and in people, boys in action and things. Shown cluttered pictures, boys select objects, girls people. Boys are instantly obsessed with dismantling, assembling, destroying, possessing, and coveting things. Girls are fascinated by people and treat their toys as surrogate people. Hence, to suit their mentalities, we have invented toys that suit each sex. We give boys tractors and girls dolls. We are reinforcing the stereotypical obsessions that they already have, but we are not creating them."" [pg. 256]""The Israeli kibbutz system has proved to be a large natural experiment in the persistence of sex roles. Men and women were initially encouraged to drop all sex roles in kibbutzim: Haircuts and clothes were unisex; boys were encouraged to be peaceful and sensitive, while girls were treated like tomboys; men did household chores and women went out to work. Yet three generations later, the attempt has largely been abandoned, and kibbutz life is actually more sexist than life in the rest of Israel. People have returned to stereotypes. Men politick, while women tend the home; boys study physics and become engineers, while girls study sociology and become teachers and nurses. Women manage the morale, health, and education of the kibbutz, while men manage the finances, security, and business.[...] Women clean house in a kibbutz because, like women everywhere, they complain that men would not do it properly. Men do not clean house in a kibbutz because, like men everywhere, they complain that if they did, their wives would say it had not been done properly."" [pg. 260]""The bizarre thing about this assertion of different natures is that it is a thoroughly feminist assertion. There is a contradiction at the heart of feminism, one that few feminists have acknowledged. You cannot say, first, that men and women are equally capable of all jobs and, second, that if jobs were done by women, they would be done differently. So feminism itself is anything but egalitarian. Feminists argue explicitly that if more women were in charge, more caring values would prevail. They begin from the presumption that women are by nature different beings. If women ran the world, there would be no war. When women run companies, cooperation, not competition, is the watchword. These are all explicit and firm assertions of sexism: that the personalities and natures of women are different from men. If womenâs personalities are different, is it not likely that they will prove better or worse at certain jobs than men? Differences cannot be appealed to when they suit and denied when they do not."" [pg. 261]""The assertion that âcultureâ explains human variation will be taken seriously when there are reports of women war parties raiding villages to capture men as husbands, or of parents cloistering their sons but not their daughters to protect their sonsâ virtue, or when cultural distributions for preferences concerning physical attractiveness, earning power, relative age, and so on show as many cultures with bias in one direction as in the other."" [pg. 275]""Somewhere in our education we unthinkingly absorb the idea that nature (genes) and nurture (environment) are opposites and that we must make a choice between them. If we choose environmentalism, then we are espousing a universal human nature that is as blank as a sheet of paper awaiting cultureâs pen, that humans are therefore perfectible and born equal. If we choose genes, then we espouse irreversible genetic differences between races and between individuals. We are fatalists and elitists. Who would not hope with all her heart that the geneticists were wrong?"" [pg. 317]""If you want to understand human motives, read Proust or Trollope or Tom Wolfe, not Freud or Piaget or Skinner. We are obsessed with one anotherâs minds. âOur intuitive commonsense psychology far surpasses any scientific psychology in scope and accuracy,â wrote Don Symons. 39 Horace Barlow points out that great literary minds are, almost by definition, great mind-reading minds."" [pg. 333]""Robert Trivers has argued that to deceive others well, an animal must deceive itself, and that self-deceptionâs hallmark is a biased system of transfer from the conscious to the unconscious mind. Deception is therefore the reason for the invention of the subconscious."" [pg.335]""Mankind is a self-domesticated animal; a mammal; an ape; a social ape; an ape in which the male takes the iniative in courtship and females usually leave the society of their birth; an ape in which men are predators, women herbivorous foragers; an ape in which males are relatively hierarchical, females relatively egalitarian; an ape in which males contribute unusually large amounts of investment in the upbringing of their offspring by provisioning their mates and their children with food, protection, and company; an ape in which monogamous pair bonds are the rule but many males have affairs and occasional males achieve polygamy; an ape in which females mated to low-ranking males often cuckold their husbands in order to gain access to the genes of higher-ranking males; an ape that has been subject to unusually intense mutual sexual selection so that many of the features of the female body (lips, breasts, waists) and the mind of both sexes (songs, competitive ambition, status seeking) are designed for use in competition for mates; an ape that has developed an extraordinary range of new instincts to learn by association, to communicate by speech, and to pass on traditions. But still an ape.""[pg.348]"
192,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3355789-mark,4,"In a frenetic effort to stay interesting, Matt Ridley unconsciously finishes his book with a terrific built-in summary by introducing Robin Dunbar's ""Scherazade Effect"" which is the frenetic effort to stay interesting, with sex and hence reproduction and life itself at stake.The book's a little like that: Matt's a consummate researcher and very good at explaining, and he's scraped together a mountain of anecdotes in support of his thesis which is, what exactly? It's kind of a little bit lost in all the stories but basically looking for the reason we are people instead of ordinary animals, he finds sexual selection and the need to be attractive as causal in the case of neoteny, big brains, language, tools, dominant men and sexy women, everything you want.There are a million uncomfortable moments wherein simple circular dynamics diverge in unstable fashion to a new set point, like a peacock's feathers or human brains or a whale's (two ton!) gonads. Like Ridley, I couldn't resist a teaser there, but the  point  is that like so many, Ridley has a hard time wrapping his brain around recursive iterative dynamics. Since that's my JOB, I'm ok with it, but remember being frustrated and tied in a mental knot by the chicken / egg / chicken problem of feedback in physical systems. I do feel the analogy's apt though. There doesn't have to be a driving reason for everything, if a tiny nudge can suffice to loose an avalanche of consequent evolution. I find that believable.One thing he might have missed, in trying to explain us (humans) in an area cosmologists have long since overcome, which is the ""we're not special"" or ""duh, because WE're here"" explanation as to why the sun is just the right temperature or the boltzman constant just so: the reason is that the people in that potential universe or on that potential planet just arent. They aren't there, they entirely aint. I'm doing a horrible job explaining that, but basically SOMEBODY had to be on the top of the food chain and I'm personally glad to be lucky enough that it's me. Why am  I  thinking about evolution? My answer? ""Because if I were an ant I couldn't."" I think Ridley misses that he doesn't have to go searching for some reason why WE in particular are special. We're just lucky that way; ~ somebody had to be.Ahh, never mind all that. In summary, it's hard to dislike a guy who calls both Freud and Skinner misguided. This is a fun book and certainly has a lot of truth in it. Ridley wants a main theme and maybe hasn't got one, but he doesn't need it anyway. Bravo.-------------------------------Here's a long postscript on why there's a 50:50 ratio of the sexes.Gina asked why males aren't rare, since it wouldn't seem so many are necessary. I re-read a whole chapter & wrote this reply...The answer, in the Red Queen, lies around page 100. It's long and complex and, in case you want to cut to the chase, finally an unsatisfying answer.First I think I noted that male and female as different genders are an idea organized around using organelles (mitochondria) from just ONE parent. Apparently otherwise competition between them within the cell is destructive, so it's better to just pick one parent from which to get 'em. (It's the female: the sperm is stripped of all but its nucleus in the catharsis of fertilization.)Why not hermaphrodites came up next and the answer was that in a hermaphroditic population, there would be instabilities, for example a tendency to kill off your male parts would make more resources available to the female nature, which would be thereby advantaged. Ultrafemmes would outperform hermaphrodites as mothers, and in so doing, make sperm scarce. Female killer genes could also then prosper, these making a new offspring hypermale. So an instability is encouraged by the basic idea of commitment: by being ""all in"" in one's choice of sex, you have a better chance of success than playing both sides & thereby hedging two bets badly.So far we still don't have any reason why the numbers should be so easily balanced. There are plenty of creatures where that's not the case, and there are ""driving"" genes that cause sex ratio distortion. Ritter he documents one human family wherein only girls were born. Why wouldn't such a thing, this parthenogenesis, catch on, at least in some proportion? All these different causes seem like tendencies that ought to swing towards some optimal ratio which would (obviously?) benefit from a male percentage << 50%. ...and that's your question, still unanswered. Lemmings actually solve it with a third sex chromosome that biases the odds towards females, a seemingly better system. Are we just unlucky vs lemmings?He delves briefly into other systems, as when unfertilized eggs become male (a clearly stable situation) or my favorite, when ALL the fish in the school are female, save the biggest, who changes teams to fulfill his duties. I guess the point is, there are plenty of exceptions to the rule. Ridley delights in these digressions.Then there were many more anecdotes, sort of diffusing away into a fog of confusion, doubtless why I forgot this next point. ""Munching a burrito"" with some scientist, he notes that dominant women & monkeys (& cows and chickens) have more sons, that female hormones not genetics tend most (and there are many factors) to bias the sex ratios, and a shortage of men makes for dominant females. It doesn't seem to ""tend"" towards exactly 50:50 or even be strongly supported, certainly not convincingly so in the face of the profligate polygamous male hypothesis. So the question goes down as being self corrected by mysterious and non genetic means. Unsatisfying. More theories then follow, but many of these have to do with social criteria pertinent only to humans (you can always marry a beautiful daughter up-caste, but not a son) but these theories do not answer as to why farmers have failed to breed female only lines of cattle, however hard they try. That last observation was a quote from Dawkins, and seemingly his last word. I have to suspect Ridley should have accepted this as unknown and ended the chapter there.At least, I will."

According to the author, human beings were âdesignedâ to reproduce and that without understanding competitive reproduction we will not be able to comprehend the human psyche and nature. Well known journalist, scientist and educator; Matt Ridley, brings us a well-rounded science book that deals with many fascinating topics involving sexual evolution. The first third of book or so starts off a little dense and may put off some readers but once it picks up it really takes off and rewards readers with invaluable knowledge. This 416-page book is composed of the following ten chapters: 1. Human Nature, 2. The Enigma, 3. The Power of Parasites, 4. Genetic Mutiny and Gender, 5. The Peacockâs Tale, 6. Polygamy and the Nature of Men, 7. Monogamy and the Nature of Women, 8. Sexing the Mind, 9. The Uses of Beauty, and 10. The Intellectual Chess Game. Positives:1.	A well-written and well-researched book. 2.	The fascinating topic of sexual evolution in the hands of a master.3.	The book was originally published in 1993 but it holds up generally well and itâs still worth reading.4.	Good use of the best that science had to offer at that time.5.	Thought-provoking and refreshingly honest and witty approach.6.	Provides compelling arguments in support of a universal human nature.7.	Explains the reasoning behind the title which is a metaphor in evolution for âthe faster you run, the more the world moves with you and the less you make progressâ.8.	Some great analogies, âThe fashion in evolutionary science now is to scoff at progress; evolution is a treadmill, not a ladderâ.9.	What sex is. A look from three different kinds of scientists. Great stuff.10.	The unbelievable world of sex in both the animal and plant kingdom.11.	Some great facts and perspectives, âThe âgreat warâ of 1914-18 killed 25 million people in four years. The influenza epidemic that followed killed 25 million in four monthsâ.12.	What drive the evolution of sex.13.	Understanding what evolution is in a practical sense.14.	How science works to address a problem.15.	Understanding gender in terms of âgenetic lotteryâ. Or leave it to the environment.16.	Some great anecdotes, âAnaxagoraâs belief that lying on the right side during sex would produce a boy was so influential that centuries later some French aristocrats had their left testicles amputatedâ. Ouch!17.	The nature of âchoosyâ females.18.	The two warring factions in sexual selection: âFisherâ and âGood-genesâ.19.	Testosterone and its relation to disease.20.

A look at social statuses.34.	The innate instinct of learning language.35.	The evidence for neoteny.36.	Links to notes worked great! Negatives:1.	The first third or so of the book was a bit dense and may have put off some readers.2.	Despite holding up generally well (book was published in 1993), some topics are outdated. For instance, free will is an illusion. I will provide a list of suggestion that offers more up to date information.3.	Animal altruism is not a myth.4.	Some topics are fairly logical. We all have a basic grasp of sexual selection.5.	Some topics may irk feminists. Let me leave it at that.6.

The book started off a little dry but once it gets going I wasnât able to put it down. Many topics of popular interest in the hands of an accomplished author make for good reading. In spite of its age, I learned some new things and have a much better grasp of why human nature evolved as a result of sex. If you have the patience to make it through the early chapters the book will reward you with wisdom, worth reading! Further recommendations: ""Humanâ and âWhoâs In Charge?â by Michael S.

The experience is much more amusing if you pause and reflect - and try to devise your own explanations - before reading the main theories.That's why it gets a 5/5.OBS: In order to better enjoy the book, I recommend reading ""The Selfish Gene"" first."

A review by Ralph Hermansen.I would buy Matt Ridley's next book without hesitation, no matter what the topic. He is one of the few authors who thoroughly researches his subject and understands the science underlying it. He then delivers the information to you in an interesting way. You certainly get your money's worth in his books.""The Red Queen"" is about the evolutionary forces which has shaped us as human beings. The significance of Lewis Carroll's Red Queen from the book, ""Alice in Wonderland"", is that we have to run just to stand still. So it is with evolution. We have to improve our survival skills over the generations to keep pace with the other plants and animals which are also advancing in their survival skills.Much of what we are as humans has to do with sexual selection. Charles Darwin introduced the concept of natural selection in his book, ""Origin of the Species"", but he devoted an even greater deal of space to his concept of sexual selection in his book, ""The Descent of Man"". No matter how superior you are in survival abilities, it is all for naught if you do not pass those traits on to your offspring. Therefore mating is vitally important. You must be attractive to the opposite sex and this manifests itself in diverse ways amongst the animals. Moreover, sexual selection may create traits that seem to work against survivability. The peacock would certainly be better served with a smaller, less ornate tail, which makes him a more obvious target for predators.Ridley picks up where Darwin left off and explores the sexuality of humans as they have evolved from apes and gradually became a big brained animal over millions of years of evolution. He has incorporated most of the ideas of modern scientists related to this subject. Men are attracted to beauty and women are attracted to powerful men, who can provide for them. In the animal kingdom, the female selects the male with the best traits and the males are willing to mate with most any female in heat. The case has become different for modern humans because human babies are helpless far longer than in normal in the animal kingdom. This is a consequence of out massive brain, which must continue developing outside the womb.One part of the book did leave me surprised. Ridley got so caught up in his analysis of what women would do in selecting men that he surmised that women would rarely engage in opportunistic sex as it is against their self interest. Mr. Ridley, if you had been single and dating in California in the 1970's, you would soon realize how very mistaken you are. Many women had decided that they were now equal to men and could enjoy the same pleasures and they did. A few years later, fear of AIDS put an end to this libertine period. Alas!Aside from that mistaken projection, the Red Queen book is excellent and I think you will enjoy reading it. Ralph Hermansen 10/04/08 "
198,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47841182-myrto-smyrilioy-zerva,5,"This is a book targeted at biologists and not, alike. It consists of a, not completely unbiased review of our knowledge on the subjects of a human evolution and inherent nature beautifully stated by a superfluous pen with a deep understanding and fiery passion on the subject. It is an educational read but the wit and humor is not secrificed in the altar of scientific accuracy or logical argument. I found this book both stimulating, informative and entertaining. This is also helped by a fantastic audio."
199,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1052384-nicholas,3,"I feel like I really missed out on what this book had to offer. I don't think that I had the requisite background for it at the time. Reread.This book is about the effect of parasites on sex and culture. Sex is the caused by the need to fight off parasites that have a much faster generational cycle than we do. Our culture is a product in large part of this sexual dynamic.Quotes:""Evolution is a treadmill not a ladder.""""Evolution is something that happens to organisms. It is a directionless process that sometimes makes an animal's decedents more complicated, sometimes simpler, and sometimes changes them not at all. We are so steeped in notions of progress and self-improvement that we find it strangely hard to accept this.""""Parasites are in constant battle with hosts, a battle that is fought by switching from one resistance gene to another; hence the battery of different versions of genes. None of this would work without sex.""""If the goal is to have the sexist son in the next generation, then one way of doing that is to mate with the sexiest male; a second way is to prevent other females from mating with the sexiest male.""""We are designed for a system of monogamy plagued by adultery.""""What caused the sudden and spectacular expansion of that one ape's head, from which so much else flowed? Why did it happen to one ape and not another? What can account for the astonishing speed, and the accelerating speed of the change? These questions may seem to have nothing to do with the subject of this book, but the answer may lie with sex. If new theories are right, the evolution of man's big head was the result of a Red Queen sexual contest between individuals of the same gender.""""Half the ideas in this book are probably wrong."""
200,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1251066-andy,3,"I've been meaning to read this for years, after an old flat-mate told me about it while studying for his BSc in the psychology of attraction. Finally found it in a charity shop in Tunbridge Wells and decided to finish of the year with some evolutionary pondering.Matt Ridley freely states that the first third may not be as interesting to some as he details the background of evolutionary theory in relation to sexual activity and behaviour in animals. Dry perhaps, may be a better term. It's the later parts of the book though where things get interesting, looking at how human nature (if indeed humans can be said to have a specific 'nature') may (or may not) have been shaped by evolutionary pressures. There are many fascinating examples and case studies, compiled expertly by Ridley. As he again mentions, he has compiled these mostly from the work of others, trying to tie a lot of individual theories and evidence together. Generally he manages a good job and it's eminently readable.Whether or not you agree or believe is entirely another matter and really, books such as this should be read to educate and promote discussion. He doesn't (and shouldn't) attempt to claim a definitive conclusion and many avenues are left open to debate. I personally found it compelling. My biggest issue is how out of date much of the evidence (and some occasional clumsy discussions, particularly around homosexuality) is now, having been written almost 20 years ago. I would certainly be interested in reading a more up to date discussion of the state of the field.Still, a well recognised and deserved text, worth reading."
201,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361083-erwin,5,"Excellent book. Definitely worth reading for everyone, particularly followers of any religion.Summary is that Human Intelligence, just like a peacocks feathers, are the result of Sexual Selection. The more intelligent, the more able to outsmart other humans, and the more able to mate --- this especially applies to men.Few aspects of human nature can be understood apart from sex, since human nature is a product of evolution, and evolution in our case is driven specifically by sexual replication.The book begins with an evolutionary account of sex itself, defending the theory that sex flourishes, despite its energetic costs, primarily because a sexually mixed heritage confers to offspring a defensive ""head start"" against parasites received from and originally adapted to the maternal host environment.Human intelligence is largely a result of sexual selection. Human intelligence far outstrips any survivalist demands that would have been placed on our hominid ancestors, and analogizes human intelligence to the peacock's tail, a trait widely believed to be the result of sexual selection. Human intelligence is used primarily to attract mates through prodigious displays of wit, charm, inventiveness, and individuality.Next I should read The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature."
202,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5619806-veronica,2,"Okay, so the good points of the book: when the author discusses the up to date and relevant research of scientists, he does so respectfully, succinctly, and accurately. He does not both too much with alternative perspectives, but for the most part, while sometimes unpalatable information, I tend to agree with the information. The worse points of the book: his own opinion is often absurd. His methods of making the information relatable is, in my opinion, stupid. He lacks the creativity to make a compelling story out of facts, and frankly, the theories are often so elegant and beautiful, it's unnecessary anyway. Finally, in his final depressing notes, he not just criticizes, but attempts to entirely discredit pioneers in many different fields, none of which he is an expert in. Even if some of the theories are no longer considered accurate or represent our world model, they paved the path for future endeavours which have enhanced our knowledge of the natural world and our place within it. Finally, several of the individuals he attempted to discredit are still at the forefront of their fields and are still considered accurate and representative of present day findings. Following this, he gives us his own uneducated opinions on where he thinks the future will take us. The only reason he got two stars at all was because of the research he did present and do justice to. I'm shocked this book has such high reviews. I was so looking forward to reading it. "
203,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5205758-mario-garc-a,5,"An amazing book on when and how things started developing for us in a way which serves no big purpose but keeping our social cohesion.By us I mean the human species as a subspecies of African ape, by when I mean historically and then, how, biologically.But categorizing that way is unfair to the acute reader. Matt Ridley manages to handle the subject with such an elegance, concision and property quite difficult to find among ""entrepreneurial"" scholars nowadays. This book is really informative and not just another idiot trying to make some extra-money by spreading pseudo-science.A must read if you want to get acquainted with the ways of modern Biology and Human Sciences in general; yet, you will find a lot of ingenious answers to common misconceptions and useful knowledge to understand the wonderful intricacies of social interaction at an animal level.And yes, it is an easy replacement for bad literature; for you see, It'll make you feel better with yourself, get you laid more often or just serve as a good excuse to keep your fidelity."
204,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/689670-joanna,1,"My review of this book can be summed up in a quote from the very end of the book, ""Half the ideas in this book are probably wrong."" That's probably a generous estimate on the author's part! I would also add ""sexist"" to ""wrong."" If only I'd read the end first, I could've saved myself a lot of frustration.A sampling:""The best [men] can hope for now is a good-looking younger mistress and a devoted wife who is traded in every decade or so. We're back to square one."" ""Inject all pregnant women with the right dose of hormones, and the result would be men and women with normal bodies but identical female brains. War, rape, boxing, car racing, pornography, and hamburgers and beer would soon be distant memories.""Then he talks about how women with Turner's syndrome are born without ovaries. ""They are exaggeratedly feminine in their behavior, with typically a special interest in babies, clothes, housekeeping, and romantic stories.""This book is bad science based in sexist stereotypes. Ironically, I read it for my feminist book club!"
205,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22176981-olivera,2,"Even though Matt Ridley said in his epilogue to this book that he doesn't regret including animals in this book I found it to be a flaw that can't necessarily be overcome. This isn't a book you will enjoy unless you are a fan of biology and the behavior of animals (which I in fact am not).I went into this expecting exactly what the title promised: the evolution of human nature, yet there was more talk about birds, insects, apes and snails than there actually was about humans. While I do understand that giving a kind of background for this topic is necessary, to me it seemed like it was overdone. Only in the last third did it actually focus on the theme it was supposed to focus on, but the 200+ pages that took me to get there weren't really worth it. There were some very interesting theories here, but I found a few facts being repeated over and over again. I don't really know what to say. I'm just pretty disappointed in The Red Queen and I'll be hesitant to pick up anything regarding this subject in the future, even though I am interested in it."
206,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4948409-samantha-sean,4,"In The Red Queen, Matt Ridley asserts that sexual selection is more prominent a factor of survival of a species than natural selection in its general form. Ridley cites Darwin, multiple fascinating biological studies, and psychological experiments. The findings of all his data verify his assertion well, though somehow I feel jilted. There is so much more to life than reproduction and procreation of the species. Attraction is not as simple a matter as genetic predilection and instinct, or generalizations in psychology. Ridley covers deviations very little, and explains why they exist (as byproducts or mutations). Overall, I vastly understand the world of sexual selection as a major contributor to our present customs and inclinations as a species. The rant on evolution at the end felt out of place, but the conclusion was concise. The value of the Red Queen is its compilation of data to support the relevance of sex in our evolution. "
207,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8739994-darrel,4,"Matt Ridley is a consistently good science writer and he does not disappoint in The Red Queen. The research and writing are solid. I should have read it many years ago when it first came out. My main criticism is that it is somewhat dated. It appears that he wrote nothing of the Bonobos in the original edition then threw in a few paragraphs in the later edition. Unfortunately, the information about Bonobo sexuality is important and should have informed his conclusions more. I do recommend it, but read with the knowledge that the original was written over 10 years ago and new information and research has emerged which is not taken into consideration. I don't think his conclusions would be radically changed, but certainly would be better nuanced.Dr. Darrel Ray, author of Sex and God: How Religion Distorts Sexuality, and The God Virus."
208,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75567-nils-samuels,3,"Consolidates ideas from anthropology and biology, arguing most interestingly for significant evolutionary differences between males and females, applied first to other animals and then to humans. First half of the book sets up the more homocentric second half. The summary: men are naturally polygamous, women naturally monogamous. Men like youth and beauty. Women like wealth and power. Civilization works for the greatest good when monogamy rules, since polygamy favors a select few and leaves many others partnerless. Otherwise the rich men in their sports cars would steal all the thunder and the lightning as well. And many more men would kill each other for beauty, literally not just metaphorically. "
209,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2296903-jana,4,"It's important to understand that evolution is not a process of improvement. Natural selection simply asserts that species change as they adapt to ever-changing environments. Evolution is not a process by which human beings or societies become better. Those organisms best able to survive in a challenging, shifting environment live to reproduce. The environment can change at any moment, thus neutralizing any advantage of any species.Sex provides the necessary variation that keeps evolution going, and without constant evolution, competitors and environmental change would lead to extinction of all species.

210,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,4,"Would you like to more thoroughly understand why people are the way they are and why they do the crazy shit they do? If so, this book would be a great place to start. It's one of those ridiculously insight inducing reads. It's also one of those books that you absolutely can not judge by its cover. Or by its first and last chapters. Curious? Than by all means read on. One of the things that put me off of the book (before I actually read it) was the title The Red Queen. I'm dreadfully embarrassed to admit that I assumed it had something to do with menstruation. Not that there's anything wrong with menstruation. I just wasn't particularly motivated to commit a decent chunk of my ""one wild life"" to a long form exploration of that particular subject.When I actually read the book, I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't about menstruation at all. The title is actually a clever reference to Lewis Carroll's Red Queen from Through the Looking-Glass, a character who has to keep running to stay in the same place. Matt Ridley's hypothesis is that sex is essentially an organisms strategy for outwitting its constantly mutating internal predators (e.g. parasites, viruses etc.), a process he likens to an arms race. The point being, that in any sort of arms race, both sides work their asses off just to maintain their relative positions against the other. Essentially running in place. Hence ""The Red Queen"" analogy. Another reason I was reluctant to read the book, before a I actually read the book, was that I was sort of convinced that sexual selection (as opposed to natural selection all red in tooth and claw) was the lesser feature of Darwin's dangerous idea. After actually reading the book, I have essentially experienced a 180 degree change in perspective. I now view sexual selection as possessing awesome explanatory power. The Red Queen bravely attempts to address dozens of difficult questions regarding the otherwise mysterious workings of human nature and culture. Far form perfect. Provisional and dated. But nevertheless less brilliantly written and entertaining as all get out. The Red Queen offers an extraordinarily generative approach for interpreting the human condition and how it has evolved.I highly recommend actually reading this book."
211,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This book one star deducted because of the long-winded introduction. I almost added it at the end though, because that was so brilliant. This is a lucid, immensely readable book about the evolutinary foundation of human nature. It starts out with animals and covers much the same ground as ""the Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins that I read not long ago. However, it as soon as it moves into the deeper waters of human nature it becomes vastly more interesting.Humang beings are just another animal species. We're not very special - other species have culture and language too, although not as finely honed as humans'. We run on instinct too, as learning is costly and dangerous. Language learning and a fear of snakes, for example, are hard-wired in our brains. Speaking of brains, why are ours so big? Matt Ridley presents the thoughs of Miller, who thinks it's selected for. Human beings are very keen on wit and humour (come think of it, so am I) and this has been sexually selected for. To keep ahead in the ferocious inter-species competition, men had to be ever smarter and this lead to an ever-increasing brain size for both genders. We live on gossip and deception and the most succesful of us tend to be the best ""mindreaders"". ""The choosines of human beings in picking their mates has driven the human mind into a history of frenzied expansion for no reason except that wit, virtuosity, inventiveness and individuality turn other people on"". It's an interesting theory at any rate! Anyone interested in human nature and why we are as we are should read this book. Fascinating! This works well as an introduction to both human nature and evolution."
212,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1641357-alexa,4,"I was wrong: Upon completion I'd say this. This started out so dry that I almost gave up, but I ended up really liking it. Very scientific review of why humans have 2 genders and aren't hermaphrodides, what advantages procreating through sex rather than one of the many other ways has etc. Once you get past the first 1/3 it becomes much more understandable and interesting. Rule 1 for all humans, ""success in life equals having grandchildren survive to adulthood"" (read - pass on your genes). Approach for men, that translates into the quantity of sexual partners Approach for women, that translates into quality of sexual partners. And the rest are fascinating deductions from that rule and those approaches. Just jump over the first chapters. Reminds me of one of my all time favorites. That is ""Brain Sex"" which surely has a better name, but is no more intersteing in the end."

I must becoming centrist in my old age, because I found Ridley's approach to strike just the right tone between authoritative and skeptical. Nothing is certain, but certain theories seem to hold more sway. Ridley's narrative also makes it clear that the answer is probably in the middle of conflicting theories, human nature being as complex as it is.My two favorite takeaways from the book: 1) Sex is most probably an evolutionary response to dealing with disease. 2) The human mind is the equivalent of the peacock tail -- a quirk of human-ness that evolved to attract mates. Now I know why creativity is so sexual."
214,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6601778-parker-f,4,"A fascinating book on my favorite topic. The author refreshingly acknowledges that half of the theories he espouses in the book are likely to be wrong; for instance, I am highly skeptical of Ridley's theory that human large-brainedness arose from runaway sexual selection favoring cute, disproportionately large heads. Nonetheless, I have no good reason to doubt this, and, as Ridley notes, all arguments of runaway sexual selection involve somewhat circular reasoning. I was fond of Ridley's literary allusions to illustrate the primalness of our evolutionarily-shaped motivations. Finally, this book is highly motivational with regards to my life's goal of acquiring a large harem. "
215,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32369480-loki,3,"Thought provoking, but less than entirely convincing, look at how genetics effect psychology. The author is quick to clarify, but often writes in a style that seems to deliberately generate an overlarge need to clarify - this is a book of meandering thoughts for the most part. Ridley strives to sound neutral, but always gives the impression of having an agenda (although if it's any more developed than 'hey, use my cool metaphor', I missed it). Still, it raises some interesting questions, for all that it pretends to greater certainty than is really warranted in such a rapidly evolving field of study."

My uncle sent it to my daughter, so I wanted to read it first. I'd let her read it, but I don't know why she would want to. He states a theory, and then loves to say, but, wait, in the black tailed, orange-rimmed sage grouse, the opposite happens. It's annoying how he picks out a totally obscure animal/insect/bacteria to prove the theory has flaws. Clearly, he has done an amazing amount of research - but to what end?

221,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2775247-alexander-tomislav,5,"This book sets a case that sexual selection is the reason, as for the peacock's tail, so for the human intelligence as well. The title comes from Lewis Carroll's ""Alice through the Looking Glass"" character of Red Queen, who, the faster she goes, the more she stays in place. This is related to the evolutionary phenomenon of ""locked"" development, such as between parasites and hosts. The more parasites adapt to hosts' defenses, the more defenses will be evolved in the hosts.Drawing on many a research, the author starts with examples from the animal world, examining clues and evidence from a geneticist's, evolutionist's and ecological points of view. Biggest clue is how many features of animals (long tail feathers and bright colors in some birds, for example) serve more for the organism to breed, than to survive. Indeed, driven by the genes' impetus to replicate, it's more ""Breeding of the fittest"" than survival.One of the biggest problems that evolutionary science faces is the attitude, common in humanistic sciences, that male and female brains are identical. Not so, claims the author, and the reasoning is compelling and sound - just as different environmental pressures caused male and female bodies to be different, it did the same to our brains. No amount of wishful thinking or political correctness can make that different. However, he's quick to point out ""Give men an inch of inequality and they will claim a mile of bias."". The human body blueprint is female, and only through two testosterone bursts (in womb and at the start of puberty) does it become masculine. Environment plays a big role in gene expression and the author demonstrates in multiple places how nature and nurture aren't opposites, but work together. As a reason for explosive development of the human brain, the author shows how the competition between members of the same species drove that development. We didn't become smarter to make tools, or to hunt, or to develop language and society. Many animals hunt, have complicated social dynamics, use tools and rudimentary communication. We evolved big brains to outwit each other.Until humanity accepts what it is, instead of vainly focusing on what it should be, we can't advance as a species. Selected quotes:""Human nature is a product of culture, but culture is also a product of human nature, and both are the products of evolution."" [pg 6.]""Humanity is, of course, morally free to make and remake itself infinitely, but we do not do so. We stick to the same monotonously human pattern of organizing our affairs. If we were more adventurous, there would be societies without love, without ambition, without sexual desire, without marriage, without art, without grammar, without music, without smilesâ and with as many unimaginable novelties as are in that list. There would be societies in which women killed each other more often than men, in which old people were considered more beautiful than twenty-year-olds, in which wealth did not purchase power over others, in which people did not discriminate in favor of their own friends and against strangers, in which parents did not love their own children."" [pg. 7]""Evolution is something that happens to organisms. It is a directionless process that sometimes makes an animalâs descendants more complicated, sometimes simpler, and sometimes changes them not at all. We are so steeped in notions of progress and self-improvement that we find it strangely hard to accept this."" [pg. 31]""Nicholas Humphrey, a Cambridge psychologist, was the first to see clearly the solution to this puzzle. We use our intellects not to solve practical problems but to outwit each other. Deceiving people, detecting deceit, understanding peopleâs motives, manipulating peopleâ these are what the intellect is used for. So what matters is not how clever and crafty you are but how much more clever and craftier you are than other people. The value of intellect is infinite. Selection within the species is always going to be more important than selection between the species."" [pg. 34]""Sex is about disease. It is used to combat the threat from parasites. Organisms need sex to keep their genes one step ahead of their parasites. Men are not redundant after all; they are womanâs insurance policy against her children being wiped out by influenza and smallpox..."" [pg. 86]""The goal for every female animal is to find a mate with sufficient genetic quality to make a good husband, a good father, or a good sire. The goal for every male animal is often to find as many wives as possible and sometimes to find good mothers and dams, only rarely to find good wives. In 1972, Robert Trivers noticed the reason for this asymmetry, which runs right through the animal kingdom; the rare exceptions to his rule prove why it generally holds. The sex that invests most in rearing the youngâ by carrying a fetus for nine months in its belly, for exampleâ is the sex that makes the least profit from an extra mating. The sex that invests the least has time to spare to seek other mates. Therefore, broadly speaking, males invest less and seek quantity of mates, while females invest more and seek quality of mates."" [pg. 132]""Murder is ânaturalâ in the sense that our ape relatives commit it regularly, as apparently did our human ancestors. Prejudice, hate, violence, crueltyâ all are more or less part of our nature, and all can be effectively countered by the right kind of nurture. Nature is not inflexible but malleable."" [pg. 181]""Lesbians, free of constraints imposed by male nature, do not suddenly indulge in sexual promiscuity; on the contrary, they are remarkably monogamous. None of this is surprising: Female animals gain little from sexual opportunism, for their reproductive ability is limited not by how many males they mate with but how long it takes to bear offspring. In this respect men and women are very different."" [pg. 218]""[...]the ban on polygamous marriage does not prevent the males from seeking polygamous matings. Adultery is common. It is most common between high-ranking males and females of all ranks. To prevent it males try to guard their wives, are extremely violent toward their wivesâ lovers, and copulate with their wives frequently, not just when they are fertile."" [pg. 234]""The noble savage, far from living in contented sexual equanimity, was paranoid about becoming, and intent on making his neighbor into, a cuckold[...] Cuckoldry paranoia is deep-seated in men. The use of veils, chaperones, purdah, female circumcision, and chastity belts all bear witness to a widespread male fear of being cuckolded and a widespread suspicion that wives, as well as their potential lovers, are the ones to distrust[...] Jealousy is a âhuman universal,â and no culture lacks it. Despite the best efforts of anthropologists to find a society with no jealousy and so prove that it is an emotion introduced by pernicious social pressure or pathology, sexual jealousy seems to be an unavoidable part of being a human being."" [pg. 235]""There has been no genetic change since we were hunter-gatherers, but deep in the mind of the modern man is a simple male hunter-gatherer rule: Strive to acquire power and use it to lure women who will bear heirs; strive to acquire wealth and use it to buy other menâs wives who will bear bastards. It began with a man who shared a piece of prized fish or honey with an attractive neighborâs wife in exchange for a brief affair and continues with a pop star ushering a model into his Mercedes. From fish to Mercedes, the history is unbroken: via skins and beads, plows and cattle, swords and castles. Wealth and power are means to women; women are means to genetic eternity."" [pg. 244]""Testosterone is an ancient chemical, found in much the same form throughout the vertebrates. Its concentration determines aggressiveness so exactly that in birds with reversed sex roles, such as phalaropes and in female-dominated hyena clans, it is the females that have higher levels of testosterone in the blood. Testosterone masculinizes the body; without it, the body remains female, whatever its genes. It also masculinizes the brain."" [pg. 254]""Baby girls are more interested in smiling, communicating, and in people, boys in action and things. Shown cluttered pictures, boys select objects, girls people. Boys are instantly obsessed with dismantling, assembling, destroying, possessing, and coveting things. Girls are fascinated by people and treat their toys as surrogate people. Hence, to suit their mentalities, we have invented toys that suit each sex. We give boys tractors and girls dolls. We are reinforcing the stereotypical obsessions that they already have, but we are not creating them."" [pg. 256]""The Israeli kibbutz system has proved to be a large natural experiment in the persistence of sex roles. Men and women were initially encouraged to drop all sex roles in kibbutzim: Haircuts and clothes were unisex; boys were encouraged to be peaceful and sensitive, while girls were treated like tomboys; men did household chores and women went out to work. Yet three generations later, the attempt has largely been abandoned, and kibbutz life is actually more sexist than life in the rest of Israel. People have returned to stereotypes. Men politick, while women tend the home; boys study physics and become engineers, while girls study sociology and become teachers and nurses. Women manage the morale, health, and education of the kibbutz, while men manage the finances, security, and business.[...] Women clean house in a kibbutz because, like women everywhere, they complain that men would not do it properly. Men do not clean house in a kibbutz because, like men everywhere, they complain that if they did, their wives would say it had not been done properly."" [pg. 260]""The bizarre thing about this assertion of different natures is that it is a thoroughly feminist assertion. There is a contradiction at the heart of feminism, one that few feminists have acknowledged. You cannot say, first, that men and women are equally capable of all jobs and, second, that if jobs were done by women, they would be done differently. So feminism itself is anything but egalitarian. Feminists argue explicitly that if more women were in charge, more caring values would prevail. They begin from the presumption that women are by nature different beings. If women ran the world, there would be no war. When women run companies, cooperation, not competition, is the watchword. These are all explicit and firm assertions of sexism: that the personalities and natures of women are different from men. If womenâs personalities are different, is it not likely that they will prove better or worse at certain jobs than men? Differences cannot be appealed to when they suit and denied when they do not."" [pg. 261]""The assertion that âcultureâ explains human variation will be taken seriously when there are reports of women war parties raiding villages to capture men as husbands, or of parents cloistering their sons but not their daughters to protect their sonsâ virtue, or when cultural distributions for preferences concerning physical attractiveness, earning power, relative age, and so on show as many cultures with bias in one direction as in the other."" [pg. 275]""Somewhere in our education we unthinkingly absorb the idea that nature (genes) and nurture (environment) are opposites and that we must make a choice between them. If we choose environmentalism, then we are espousing a universal human nature that is as blank as a sheet of paper awaiting cultureâs pen, that humans are therefore perfectible and born equal. If we choose genes, then we espouse irreversible genetic differences between races and between individuals. We are fatalists and elitists. Who would not hope with all her heart that the geneticists were wrong?"" [pg. 317]""If you want to understand human motives, read Proust or Trollope or Tom Wolfe, not Freud or Piaget or Skinner. We are obsessed with one anotherâs minds. âOur intuitive commonsense psychology far surpasses any scientific psychology in scope and accuracy,â wrote Don Symons. 39 Horace Barlow points out that great literary minds are, almost by definition, great mind-reading minds."" [pg. 333]""Robert Trivers has argued that to deceive others well, an animal must deceive itself, and that self-deceptionâs hallmark is a biased system of transfer from the conscious to the unconscious mind. Deception is therefore the reason for the invention of the subconscious."" [pg.335]""Mankind is a self-domesticated animal; a mammal; an ape; a social ape; an ape in which the male takes the iniative in courtship and females usually leave the society of their birth; an ape in which men are predators, women herbivorous foragers; an ape in which males are relatively hierarchical, females relatively egalitarian; an ape in which males contribute unusually large amounts of investment in the upbringing of their offspring by provisioning their mates and their children with food, protection, and company; an ape in which monogamous pair bonds are the rule but many males have affairs and occasional males achieve polygamy; an ape in which females mated to low-ranking males often cuckold their husbands in order to gain access to the genes of higher-ranking males; an ape that has been subject to unusually intense mutual sexual selection so that many of the features of the female body (lips, breasts, waists) and the mind of both sexes (songs, competitive ambition, status seeking) are designed for use in competition for mates; an ape that has developed an extraordinary range of new instincts to learn by association, to communicate by speech, and to pass on traditions. But still an ape.""[pg.348]"
222,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3355789-mark,4,"In a frenetic effort to stay interesting, Matt Ridley unconsciously finishes his book with a terrific built-in summary by introducing Robin Dunbar's ""Scherazade Effect"" which is the frenetic effort to stay interesting, with sex and hence reproduction and life itself at stake.The book's a little like that: Matt's a consummate researcher and very good at explaining, and he's scraped together a mountain of anecdotes in support of his thesis which is, what exactly? It's kind of a little bit lost in all the stories but basically looking for the reason we are people instead of ordinary animals, he finds sexual selection and the need to be attractive as causal in the case of neoteny, big brains, language, tools, dominant men and sexy women, everything you want.There are a million uncomfortable moments wherein simple circular dynamics diverge in unstable fashion to a new set point, like a peacock's feathers or human brains or a whale's (two ton!) gonads. Like Ridley, I couldn't resist a teaser there, but the  point  is that like so many, Ridley has a hard time wrapping his brain around recursive iterative dynamics. Since that's my JOB, I'm ok with it, but remember being frustrated and tied in a mental knot by the chicken / egg / chicken problem of feedback in physical systems. I do feel the analogy's apt though. There doesn't have to be a driving reason for everything, if a tiny nudge can suffice to loose an avalanche of consequent evolution. I find that believable.One thing he might have missed, in trying to explain us (humans) in an area cosmologists have long since overcome, which is the ""we're not special"" or ""duh, because WE're here"" explanation as to why the sun is just the right temperature or the boltzman constant just so: the reason is that the people in that potential universe or on that potential planet just arent. They aren't there, they entirely aint. I'm doing a horrible job explaining that, but basically SOMEBODY had to be on the top of the food chain and I'm personally glad to be lucky enough that it's me. Why am  I  thinking about evolution? My answer? ""Because if I were an ant I couldn't."" I think Ridley misses that he doesn't have to go searching for some reason why WE in particular are special. We're just lucky that way; ~ somebody had to be.Ahh, never mind all that. In summary, it's hard to dislike a guy who calls both Freud and Skinner misguided. This is a fun book and certainly has a lot of truth in it. Ridley wants a main theme and maybe hasn't got one, but he doesn't need it anyway. Bravo.-------------------------------Here's a long postscript on why there's a 50:50 ratio of the sexes.Gina asked why males aren't rare, since it wouldn't seem so many are necessary. I re-read a whole chapter & wrote this reply...The answer, in the Red Queen, lies around page 100. It's long and complex and, in case you want to cut to the chase, finally an unsatisfying answer.First I think I noted that male and female as different genders are an idea organized around using organelles (mitochondria) from just ONE parent. Apparently otherwise competition between them within the cell is destructive, so it's better to just pick one parent from which to get 'em. (It's the female: the sperm is stripped of all but its nucleus in the catharsis of fertilization.)Why not hermaphrodites came up next and the answer was that in a hermaphroditic population, there would be instabilities, for example a tendency to kill off your male parts would make more resources available to the female nature, which would be thereby advantaged. Ultrafemmes would outperform hermaphrodites as mothers, and in so doing, make sperm scarce. Female killer genes could also then prosper, these making a new offspring hypermale. So an instability is encouraged by the basic idea of commitment: by being ""all in"" in one's choice of sex, you have a better chance of success than playing both sides & thereby hedging two bets badly.So far we still don't have any reason why the numbers should be so easily balanced. There are plenty of creatures where that's not the case, and there are ""driving"" genes that cause sex ratio distortion. Ritter he documents one human family wherein only girls were born. Why wouldn't such a thing, this parthenogenesis, catch on, at least in some proportion? All these different causes seem like tendencies that ought to swing towards some optimal ratio which would (obviously?) benefit from a male percentage << 50%. ...and that's your question, still unanswered. Lemmings actually solve it with a third sex chromosome that biases the odds towards females, a seemingly better system. Are we just unlucky vs lemmings?He delves briefly into other systems, as when unfertilized eggs become male (a clearly stable situation) or my favorite, when ALL the fish in the school are female, save the biggest, who changes teams to fulfill his duties. I guess the point is, there are plenty of exceptions to the rule. Ridley delights in these digressions.Then there were many more anecdotes, sort of diffusing away into a fog of confusion, doubtless why I forgot this next point. ""Munching a burrito"" with some scientist, he notes that dominant women & monkeys (& cows and chickens) have more sons, that female hormones not genetics tend most (and there are many factors) to bias the sex ratios, and a shortage of men makes for dominant females. It doesn't seem to ""tend"" towards exactly 50:50 or even be strongly supported, certainly not convincingly so in the face of the profligate polygamous male hypothesis. So the question goes down as being self corrected by mysterious and non genetic means. Unsatisfying. More theories then follow, but many of these have to do with social criteria pertinent only to humans (you can always marry a beautiful daughter up-caste, but not a son) but these theories do not answer as to why farmers have failed to breed female only lines of cattle, however hard they try. That last observation was a quote from Dawkins, and seemingly his last word. I have to suspect Ridley should have accepted this as unknown and ended the chapter there.At least, I will."
223,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature by Matt RidleyâThe Red Queen"" is the very interesting book about how human nature evolved as a result of sex. According to the author, human beings were âdesignedâ to reproduce and that without understanding competitive reproduction we will not be able to comprehend the human psyche and nature. Well known journalist, scientist and educator; Matt Ridley, brings us a well-rounded science book that deals with many fascinating topics involving sexual evolution. The first third of book or so starts off a little dense and may put off some readers but once it picks up it really takes off and rewards readers with invaluable knowledge. This 416-page book is composed of the following ten chapters: 1. Human Nature, 2. The Enigma, 3. The Power of Parasites, 4. Genetic Mutiny and Gender, 5. The Peacockâs Tale, 6. Polygamy and the Nature of Men, 7. Monogamy and the Nature of Women, 8. Sexing the Mind, 9. The Uses of Beauty, and 10. The Intellectual Chess Game. Positives:1.	A well-written and well-researched book. 2.	The fascinating topic of sexual evolution in the hands of a master.3.	The book was originally published in 1993 but it holds up generally well and itâs still worth reading.4.	Good use of the best that science had to offer at that time.5.	Thought-provoking and refreshingly honest and witty approach.6.	Provides compelling arguments in support of a universal human nature.7.	Explains the reasoning behind the title which is a metaphor in evolution for âthe faster you run, the more the world moves with you and the less you make progressâ.8.	Some great analogies, âThe fashion in evolutionary science now is to scoff at progress; evolution is a treadmill, not a ladderâ.9.	What sex is. A look from three different kinds of scientists. Great stuff.10.	The unbelievable world of sex in both the animal and plant kingdom.11.	Some great facts and perspectives, âThe âgreat warâ of 1914-18 killed 25 million people in four years. The influenza epidemic that followed killed 25 million in four monthsâ.12.	What drive the evolution of sex.13.	Understanding what evolution is in a practical sense.14.	How science works to address a problem.15.	Understanding gender in terms of âgenetic lotteryâ. Or leave it to the environment.16.	Some great anecdotes, âAnaxagoraâs belief that lying on the right side during sex would produce a boy was so influential that centuries later some French aristocrats had their left testicles amputatedâ. Ouch!17.	The nature of âchoosyâ females.18.	The two warring factions in sexual selection: âFisherâ and âGood-genesâ.19.	Testosterone and its relation to disease.20.	What men find attractive in women.21.	The impact of human culture.22.	An honest look at the roles of the sexes.23.	An understanding about homosexual behavior.24.	Game theory and how it plays out between males and females. Always interesting.25.	Human evolution always fascinating.26.	The growth of our brains.27.	Understanding the evil practice of female infanticide.28.	Power as a tool for sexual success. Itâs good being the king.29.	Marriage, understanding the institution of.30.	Adultery and how it shaped human society.31.	Fascinating look at what societies favor daughters over sons and vice versa.32.	The differences of mental features between the sexes.33.	A look at social statuses.34.	The innate instinct of learning language.35.	The evidence for neoteny.36.	Links to notes worked great! Negatives:1.	The first third or so of the book was a bit dense and may have put off some readers.2.	Despite holding up generally well (book was published in 1993), some topics are outdated. For instance, free will is an illusion. I will provide a list of suggestion that offers more up to date information.3.	Animal altruism is not a myth.4.	Some topics are fairly logical. We all have a basic grasp of sexual selection.5.	Some topics may irk feminists. Let me leave it at that.6.	The author purposely sidesteps the issue of morality and the little that is here is inadequate.7.	âDeception is therefore the reason for the invention of the subconscious.â â Trivers Really?In summary, I wished I had read this book when it first came out in 1993. The book started off a little dry but once it gets going I wasnât able to put it down. Many topics of popular interest in the hands of an accomplished author make for good reading. In spite of its age, I learned some new things and have a much better grasp of why human nature evolved as a result of sex. If you have the patience to make it through the early chapters the book will reward you with wisdom, worth reading! Further recommendations: ""Humanâ and âWhoâs In Charge?â by Michael S.

The experience is much more amusing if you pause and reflect - and try to devise your own explanations - before reading the main theories.That's why it gets a 5/5.OBS: In order to better enjoy the book, I recommend reading ""The Selfish Gene"" first."
227,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13334219-ralph-hermansen,4,"""The Red Queen"" by Matt Ridley. A review by Ralph Hermansen.I would buy Matt Ridley's next book without hesitation, no matter what the topic. He is one of the few authors who thoroughly researches his subject and understands the science underlying it. He then delivers the information to you in an interesting way. You certainly get your money's worth in his books.""The Red Queen"" is about the evolutionary forces which has shaped us as human beings. The significance of Lewis Carroll's Red Queen from the book, ""Alice in Wonderland"", is that we have to run just to stand still. So it is with evolution. We have to improve our survival skills over the generations to keep pace with the other plants and animals which are also advancing in their survival skills.Much of what we are as humans has to do with sexual selection. Charles Darwin introduced the concept of natural selection in his book, ""Origin of the Species"", but he devoted an even greater deal of space to his concept of sexual selection in his book, ""The Descent of Man"". No matter how superior you are in survival abilities, it is all for naught if you do not pass those traits on to your offspring. Therefore mating is vitally important. You must be attractive to the opposite sex and this manifests itself in diverse ways amongst the animals. Moreover, sexual selection may create traits that seem to work against survivability. The peacock would certainly be better served with a smaller, less ornate tail, which makes him a more obvious target for predators.Ridley picks up where Darwin left off and explores the sexuality of humans as they have evolved from apes and gradually became a big brained animal over millions of years of evolution. He has incorporated most of the ideas of modern scientists related to this subject. Men are attracted to beauty and women are attracted to powerful men, who can provide for them. In the animal kingdom, the female selects the male with the best traits and the males are willing to mate with most any female in heat. The case has become different for modern humans because human babies are helpless far longer than in normal in the animal kingdom. This is a consequence of out massive brain, which must continue developing outside the womb.One part of the book did leave me surprised. Ridley got so caught up in his analysis of what women would do in selecting men that he surmised that women would rarely engage in opportunistic sex as it is against their self interest. Mr. Ridley, if you had been single and dating in California in the 1970's, you would soon realize how very mistaken you are. Many women had decided that they were now equal to men and could enjoy the same pleasures and they did. A few years later, fear of AIDS put an end to this libertine period. Alas!Aside from that mistaken projection, the Red Queen book is excellent and I think you will enjoy reading it. Ralph Hermansen 10/04/08 "
228,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47841182-myrto-smyrilioy-zerva,5,"This is a book targeted at biologists and not, alike. It consists of a, not completely unbiased review of our knowledge on the subjects of a human evolution and inherent nature beautifully stated by a superfluous pen with a deep understanding and fiery passion on the subject. It is an educational read but the wit and humor is not secrificed in the altar of scientific accuracy or logical argument. I found this book both stimulating, informative and entertaining. This is also helped by a fantastic audio."

Reread.This book is about the effect of parasites on sex and culture. Sex is the caused by the need to fight off parasites that have a much faster generational cycle than we do. Our culture is a product in large part of this sexual dynamic.Quotes:""Evolution is a treadmill not a ladder.""""Evolution is something that happens to organisms. It is a directionless process that sometimes makes an animal's decedents more complicated, sometimes simpler, and sometimes changes them not at all. We are so steeped in notions of progress and self-improvement that we find it strangely hard to accept this.""""Parasites are in constant battle with hosts, a battle that is fought by switching from one resistance gene to another; hence the battery of different versions of genes. None of this would work without sex.""""If the goal is to have the sexist son in the next generation, then one way of doing that is to mate with the sexiest male; a second way is to prevent other females from mating with the sexiest male.""""We are designed for a system of monogamy plagued by adultery.""""What caused the sudden and spectacular expansion of that one ape's head, from which so much else flowed? Why did it happen to one ape and not another? What can account for the astonishing speed, and the accelerating speed of the change? These questions may seem to have nothing to do with the subject of this book, but the answer may lie with sex. If new theories are right, the evolution of man's big head was the result of a Red Queen sexual contest between individuals of the same gender.""""Half the ideas in this book are probably wrong."""
230,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1251066-andy,3,"I've been meaning to read this for years, after an old flat-mate told me about it while studying for his BSc in the psychology of attraction. Finally found it in a charity shop in Tunbridge Wells and decided to finish of the year with some evolutionary pondering.Matt Ridley freely states that the first third may not be as interesting to some as he details the background of evolutionary theory in relation to sexual activity and behaviour in animals. Dry perhaps, may be a better term. It's the later parts of the book though where things get interesting, looking at how human nature (if indeed humans can be said to have a specific 'nature') may (or may not) have been shaped by evolutionary pressures. There are many fascinating examples and case studies, compiled expertly by Ridley. As he again mentions, he has compiled these mostly from the work of others, trying to tie a lot of individual theories and evidence together. Generally he manages a good job and it's eminently readable.Whether or not you agree or believe is entirely another matter and really, books such as this should be read to educate and promote discussion. He doesn't (and shouldn't) attempt to claim a definitive conclusion and many avenues are left open to debate. I personally found it compelling. My biggest issue is how out of date much of the evidence (and some occasional clumsy discussions, particularly around homosexuality) is now, having been written almost 20 years ago. I would certainly be interested in reading a more up to date discussion of the state of the field.Still, a well recognised and deserved text, worth reading."
231,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361083-erwin,5,"Excellent book. Definitely worth reading for everyone, particularly followers of any religion.Summary is that Human Intelligence, just like a peacocks feathers, are the result of Sexual Selection. The more intelligent, the more able to outsmart other humans, and the more able to mate --- this especially applies to men.Few aspects of human nature can be understood apart from sex, since human nature is a product of evolution, and evolution in our case is driven specifically by sexual replication.The book begins with an evolutionary account of sex itself, defending the theory that sex flourishes, despite its energetic costs, primarily because a sexually mixed heritage confers to offspring a defensive ""head start"" against parasites received from and originally adapted to the maternal host environment.Human intelligence is largely a result of sexual selection. Human intelligence far outstrips any survivalist demands that would have been placed on our hominid ancestors, and analogizes human intelligence to the peacock's tail, a trait widely believed to be the result of sexual selection. Human intelligence is used primarily to attract mates through prodigious displays of wit, charm, inventiveness, and individuality.Next I should read The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature."
232,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5619806-veronica,2,"Okay, so the good points of the book: when the author discusses the up to date and relevant research of scientists, he does so respectfully, succinctly, and accurately. He does not both too much with alternative perspectives, but for the most part, while sometimes unpalatable information, I tend to agree with the information. The worse points of the book: his own opinion is often absurd. His methods of making the information relatable is, in my opinion, stupid. He lacks the creativity to make a compelling story out of facts, and frankly, the theories are often so elegant and beautiful, it's unnecessary anyway. Finally, in his final depressing notes, he not just criticizes, but attempts to entirely discredit pioneers in many different fields, none of which he is an expert in. Even if some of the theories are no longer considered accurate or represent our world model, they paved the path for future endeavours which have enhanced our knowledge of the natural world and our place within it. Finally, several of the individuals he attempted to discredit are still at the forefront of their fields and are still considered accurate and representative of present day findings. Following this, he gives us his own uneducated opinions on where he thinks the future will take us. The only reason he got two stars at all was because of the research he did present and do justice to. I'm shocked this book has such high reviews. I was so looking forward to reading it. "

Matt Ridley manages to handle the subject with such an elegance, concision and property quite difficult to find among ""entrepreneurial"" scholars nowadays. This book is really informative and not just another idiot trying to make some extra-money by spreading pseudo-science.A must read if you want to get acquainted with the ways of modern Biology and Human Sciences in general; yet, you will find a lot of ingenious answers to common misconceptions and useful knowledge to understand the wonderful intricacies of social interaction at an animal level.And yes, it is an easy replacement for bad literature; for you see, It'll make you feel better with yourself, get you laid more often or just serve as a good excuse to keep your fidelity."

This isn't a book you will enjoy unless you are a fan of biology and the behavior of animals (which I in fact am not).I went into this expecting exactly what the title promised: the evolution of human nature, yet there was more talk about birds, insects, apes and snails than there actually was about humans. While I do understand that giving a kind of background for this topic is necessary, to me it seemed like it was overdone. Only in the last third did it actually focus on the theme it was supposed to focus on, but the 200+ pages that took me to get there weren't really worth it. There were some very interesting theories here, but I found a few facts being repeated over and over again. I don't really know what to say. I'm just pretty disappointed in The Red Queen and I'll be hesitant to pick up anything regarding this subject in the future, even though I am interested in it."
236,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4948409-samantha-sean,4,"In The Red Queen, Matt Ridley asserts that sexual selection is more prominent a factor of survival of a species than natural selection in its general form. Ridley cites Darwin, multiple fascinating biological studies, and psychological experiments. The findings of all his data verify his assertion well, though somehow I feel jilted. There is so much more to life than reproduction and procreation of the species. Attraction is not as simple a matter as genetic predilection and instinct, or generalizations in psychology. Ridley covers deviations very little, and explains why they exist (as byproducts or mutations). Overall, I vastly understand the world of sexual selection as a major contributor to our present customs and inclinations as a species. The rant on evolution at the end felt out of place, but the conclusion was concise. The value of the Red Queen is its compilation of data to support the relevance of sex in our evolution. "
237,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8739994-darrel,4,"Matt Ridley is a consistently good science writer and he does not disappoint in The Red Queen. The research and writing are solid. I should have read it many years ago when it first came out. My main criticism is that it is somewhat dated. It appears that he wrote nothing of the Bonobos in the original edition then threw in a few paragraphs in the later edition. Unfortunately, the information about Bonobo sexuality is important and should have informed his conclusions more. I do recommend it, but read with the knowledge that the original was written over 10 years ago and new information and research has emerged which is not taken into consideration. I don't think his conclusions would be radically changed, but certainly would be better nuanced.Dr. Darrel Ray, author of Sex and God: How Religion Distorts Sexuality, and The God Virus."

First half of the book sets up the more homocentric second half. The summary: men are naturally polygamous, women naturally monogamous. Men like youth and beauty. Women like wealth and power. Civilization works for the greatest good when monogamy rules, since polygamy favors a select few and leaves many others partnerless. Otherwise the rich men in their sports cars would steal all the thunder and the lightning as well. And many more men would kill each other for beauty, literally not just metaphorically. "
239,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2296903-jana,4,"It's important to understand that evolution is not a process of improvement. Natural selection simply asserts that species change as they adapt to ever-changing environments. Evolution is not a process by which human beings or societies become better. Those organisms best able to survive in a challenging, shifting environment live to reproduce. The environment can change at any moment, thus neutralizing any advantage of any species.Sex provides the necessary variation that keeps evolution going, and without constant evolution, competitors and environmental change would lead to extinction of all species.

If so, this book would be a great place to start. It's one of those ridiculously insight inducing reads. It's also one of those books that you absolutely can not judge by its cover. Or by its first and last chapters. Curious? Than by all means read on. One of the things that put me off of the book (before I actually read it) was the title The Red Queen. I'm dreadfully embarrassed to admit that I assumed it had something to do with menstruation. Not that there's anything wrong with menstruation. I just wasn't particularly motivated to commit a decent chunk of my ""one wild life"" to a long form exploration of that particular subject.When I actually read the book, I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't about menstruation at all. The title is actually a clever reference to Lewis Carroll's Red Queen from Through the Looking-Glass, a character who has to keep running to stay in the same place. Matt Ridley's hypothesis is that sex is essentially an organisms strategy for outwitting its constantly mutating internal predators (e.g. parasites, viruses etc.), a process he likens to an arms race. The point being, that in any sort of arms race, both sides work their asses off just to maintain their relative positions against the other. Essentially running in place. Hence ""The Red Queen"" analogy. Another reason I was reluctant to read the book, before a I actually read the book, was that I was sort of convinced that sexual selection (as opposed to natural selection all red in tooth and claw) was the lesser feature of Darwin's dangerous idea. After actually reading the book, I have essentially experienced a 180 degree change in perspective. I now view sexual selection as possessing awesome explanatory power. The Red Queen bravely attempts to address dozens of difficult questions regarding the otherwise mysterious workings of human nature and culture. Far form perfect. Provisional and dated. But nevertheless less brilliantly written and entertaining as all get out. The Red Queen offers an extraordinarily generative approach for interpreting the human condition and how it has evolved.I highly recommend actually reading this book."
241,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This book one star deducted because of the long-winded introduction. I almost added it at the end though, because that was so brilliant. This is a lucid, immensely readable book about the evolutinary foundation of human nature. It starts out with animals and covers much the same ground as ""the Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins that I read not long ago. However, it as soon as it moves into the deeper waters of human nature it becomes vastly more interesting.Humang beings are just another animal species. We're not very special - other species have culture and language too, although not as finely honed as humans'. We run on instinct too, as learning is costly and dangerous. Language learning and a fear of snakes, for example, are hard-wired in our brains. Speaking of brains, why are ours so big? Matt Ridley presents the thoughs of Miller, who thinks it's selected for. Human beings are very keen on wit and humour (come think of it, so am I) and this has been sexually selected for. To keep ahead in the ferocious inter-species competition, men had to be ever smarter and this lead to an ever-increasing brain size for both genders. We live on gossip and deception and the most succesful of us tend to be the best ""mindreaders"". ""The choosines of human beings in picking their mates has driven the human mind into a history of frenzied expansion for no reason except that wit, virtuosity, inventiveness and individuality turn other people on"". It's an interesting theory at any rate! Anyone interested in human nature and why we are as we are should read this book. Fascinating! This works well as an introduction to both human nature and evolution."
242,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1641357-alexa,4,"I was wrong: Upon completion I'd say this. This started out so dry that I almost gave up, but I ended up really liking it. Very scientific review of why humans have 2 genders and aren't hermaphrodides, what advantages procreating through sex rather than one of the many other ways has etc. Once you get past the first 1/3 it becomes much more understandable and interesting. Rule 1 for all humans, ""success in life equals having grandchildren survive to adulthood"" (read - pass on your genes). Approach for men, that translates into the quantity of sexual partners Approach for women, that translates into quality of sexual partners. And the rest are fascinating deductions from that rule and those approaches. Just jump over the first chapters. Reminds me of one of my all time favorites. That is ""Brain Sex"" which surely has a better name, but is no more intersteing in the end."

I must becoming centrist in my old age, because I found Ridley's approach to strike just the right tone between authoritative and skeptical. Nothing is certain, but certain theories seem to hold more sway. Ridley's narrative also makes it clear that the answer is probably in the middle of conflicting theories, human nature being as complex as it is.My two favorite takeaways from the book: 1) Sex is most probably an evolutionary response to dealing with disease. 2) The human mind is the equivalent of the peacock tail -- a quirk of human-ness that evolved to attract mates. Now I know why creativity is so sexual."
244,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6601778-parker-f,4,"A fascinating book on my favorite topic. The author refreshingly acknowledges that half of the theories he espouses in the book are likely to be wrong; for instance, I am highly skeptical of Ridley's theory that human large-brainedness arose from runaway sexual selection favoring cute, disproportionately large heads. Nonetheless, I have no good reason to doubt this, and, as Ridley notes, all arguments of runaway sexual selection involve somewhat circular reasoning. I was fond of Ridley's literary allusions to illustrate the primalness of our evolutionarily-shaped motivations. Finally, this book is highly motivational with regards to my life's goal of acquiring a large harem. "
245,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32369480-loki,3,"Thought provoking, but less than entirely convincing, look at how genetics effect psychology. The author is quick to clarify, but often writes in a style that seems to deliberately generate an overlarge need to clarify - this is a book of meandering thoughts for the most part. Ridley strives to sound neutral, but always gives the impression of having an agenda (although if it's any more developed than 'hey, use my cool metaphor', I missed it). Still, it raises some interesting questions, for all that it pretends to greater certainty than is really warranted in such a rapidly evolving field of study."

My uncle sent it to my daughter, so I wanted to read it first. I'd let her read it, but I don't know why she would want to. He states a theory, and then loves to say, but, wait, in the black tailed, orange-rimmed sage grouse, the opposite happens. It's annoying how he picks out a totally obscure animal/insect/bacteria to prove the theory has flaws. Clearly, he has done an amazing amount of research - but to what end? I'm going to need to read some 4 & 5 star reviews to see what the point of this book is. "

Only the first half of the book is worth reading; I got to learn about all different strategies that nature uses for sexual and asexual reproduction and different biological applications of game theory. Past that, the rest merely reeks of essentializing Victorianism. The first half of the book will endure; the second half is already dated."

251,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2775247-alexander-tomislav,5,"This book sets a case that sexual selection is the reason, as for the peacock's tail, so for the human intelligence as well. The title comes from Lewis Carroll's ""Alice through the Looking Glass"" character of Red Queen, who, the faster she goes, the more she stays in place. This is related to the evolutionary phenomenon of ""locked"" development, such as between parasites and hosts. The more parasites adapt to hosts' defenses, the more defenses will be evolved in the hosts.Drawing on many a research, the author starts with examples from the animal world, examining clues and evidence from a geneticist's, evolutionist's and ecological points of view. Biggest clue is how many features of animals (long tail feathers and bright colors in some birds, for example) serve more for the organism to breed, than to survive. Indeed, driven by the genes' impetus to replicate, it's more ""Breeding of the fittest"" than survival.One of the biggest problems that evolutionary science faces is the attitude, common in humanistic sciences, that male and female brains are identical. Not so, claims the author, and the reasoning is compelling and sound - just as different environmental pressures caused male and female bodies to be different, it did the same to our brains. No amount of wishful thinking or political correctness can make that different. However, he's quick to point out ""Give men an inch of inequality and they will claim a mile of bias."". The human body blueprint is female, and only through two testosterone bursts (in womb and at the start of puberty) does it become masculine. Environment plays a big role in gene expression and the author demonstrates in multiple places how nature and nurture aren't opposites, but work together. As a reason for explosive development of the human brain, the author shows how the competition between members of the same species drove that development. We didn't become smarter to make tools, or to hunt, or to develop language and society. Many animals hunt, have complicated social dynamics, use tools and rudimentary communication. We evolved big brains to outwit each other.Until humanity accepts what it is, instead of vainly focusing on what it should be, we can't advance as a species. Selected quotes:""Human nature is a product of culture, but culture is also a product of human nature, and both are the products of evolution."" [pg 6.]""Humanity is, of course, morally free to make and remake itself infinitely, but we do not do so. We stick to the same monotonously human pattern of organizing our affairs. If we were more adventurous, there would be societies without love, without ambition, without sexual desire, without marriage, without art, without grammar, without music, without smilesâ and with as many unimaginable novelties as are in that list. There would be societies in which women killed each other more often than men, in which old people were considered more beautiful than twenty-year-olds, in which wealth did not purchase power over others, in which people did not discriminate in favor of their own friends and against strangers, in which parents did not love their own children."" [pg. 7]""Evolution is something that happens to organisms. It is a directionless process that sometimes makes an animalâs descendants more complicated, sometimes simpler, and sometimes changes them not at all. We are so steeped in notions of progress and self-improvement that we find it strangely hard to accept this."" [pg. 31]""Nicholas Humphrey, a Cambridge psychologist, was the first to see clearly the solution to this puzzle. We use our intellects not to solve practical problems but to outwit each other. Deceiving people, detecting deceit, understanding peopleâs motives, manipulating peopleâ these are what the intellect is used for. So what matters is not how clever and crafty you are but how much more clever and craftier you are than other people. The value of intellect is infinite. Selection within the species is always going to be more important than selection between the species."" [pg. 34]""Sex is about disease. It is used to combat the threat from parasites. Organisms need sex to keep their genes one step ahead of their parasites. Men are not redundant after all; they are womanâs insurance policy against her children being wiped out by influenza and smallpox..."" [pg. 86]""The goal for every female animal is to find a mate with sufficient genetic quality to make a good husband, a good father, or a good sire. The goal for every male animal is often to find as many wives as possible and sometimes to find good mothers and dams, only rarely to find good wives. In 1972, Robert Trivers noticed the reason for this asymmetry, which runs right through the animal kingdom; the rare exceptions to his rule prove why it generally holds. The sex that invests most in rearing the youngâ by carrying a fetus for nine months in its belly, for exampleâ is the sex that makes the least profit from an extra mating. The sex that invests the least has time to spare to seek other mates. Therefore, broadly speaking, males invest less and seek quantity of mates, while females invest more and seek quality of mates."" [pg. 132]""Murder is ânaturalâ in the sense that our ape relatives commit it regularly, as apparently did our human ancestors. Prejudice, hate, violence, crueltyâ all are more or less part of our nature, and all can be effectively countered by the right kind of nurture. Nature is not inflexible but malleable."" [pg. 181]""Lesbians, free of constraints imposed by male nature, do not suddenly indulge in sexual promiscuity; on the contrary, they are remarkably monogamous. None of this is surprising: Female animals gain little from sexual opportunism, for their reproductive ability is limited not by how many males they mate with but how long it takes to bear offspring. In this respect men and women are very different."" [pg. 218]""[...]the ban on polygamous marriage does not prevent the males from seeking polygamous matings. Adultery is common. It is most common between high-ranking males and females of all ranks. To prevent it males try to guard their wives, are extremely violent toward their wivesâ lovers, and copulate with their wives frequently, not just when they are fertile."" [pg. 234]""The noble savage, far from living in contented sexual equanimity, was paranoid about becoming, and intent on making his neighbor into, a cuckold[...] Cuckoldry paranoia is deep-seated in men. The use of veils, chaperones, purdah, female circumcision, and chastity belts all bear witness to a widespread male fear of being cuckolded and a widespread suspicion that wives, as well as their potential lovers, are the ones to distrust[...] Jealousy is a âhuman universal,â and no culture lacks it. Despite the best efforts of anthropologists to find a society with no jealousy and so prove that it is an emotion introduced by pernicious social pressure or pathology, sexual jealousy seems to be an unavoidable part of being a human being."" [pg. 235]""There has been no genetic change since we were hunter-gatherers, but deep in the mind of the modern man is a simple male hunter-gatherer rule: Strive to acquire power and use it to lure women who will bear heirs; strive to acquire wealth and use it to buy other menâs wives who will bear bastards. It began with a man who shared a piece of prized fish or honey with an attractive neighborâs wife in exchange for a brief affair and continues with a pop star ushering a model into his Mercedes. From fish to Mercedes, the history is unbroken: via skins and beads, plows and cattle, swords and castles. Wealth and power are means to women; women are means to genetic eternity."" [pg. 244]""Testosterone is an ancient chemical, found in much the same form throughout the vertebrates. Its concentration determines aggressiveness so exactly that in birds with reversed sex roles, such as phalaropes and in female-dominated hyena clans, it is the females that have higher levels of testosterone in the blood. Testosterone masculinizes the body; without it, the body remains female, whatever its genes. It also masculinizes the brain."" [pg. 254]""Baby girls are more interested in smiling, communicating, and in people, boys in action and things. Shown cluttered pictures, boys select objects, girls people. Boys are instantly obsessed with dismantling, assembling, destroying, possessing, and coveting things. Girls are fascinated by people and treat their toys as surrogate people. Hence, to suit their mentalities, we have invented toys that suit each sex. We give boys tractors and girls dolls. We are reinforcing the stereotypical obsessions that they already have, but we are not creating them."" [pg. 256]""The Israeli kibbutz system has proved to be a large natural experiment in the persistence of sex roles. Men and women were initially encouraged to drop all sex roles in kibbutzim: Haircuts and clothes were unisex; boys were encouraged to be peaceful and sensitive, while girls were treated like tomboys; men did household chores and women went out to work. Yet three generations later, the attempt has largely been abandoned, and kibbutz life is actually more sexist than life in the rest of Israel. People have returned to stereotypes. Men politick, while women tend the home; boys study physics and become engineers, while girls study sociology and become teachers and nurses. Women manage the morale, health, and education of the kibbutz, while men manage the finances, security, and business.[...] Women clean house in a kibbutz because, like women everywhere, they complain that men would not do it properly. Men do not clean house in a kibbutz because, like men everywhere, they complain that if they did, their wives would say it had not been done properly."" [pg. 260]""The bizarre thing about this assertion of different natures is that it is a thoroughly feminist assertion. There is a contradiction at the heart of feminism, one that few feminists have acknowledged. You cannot say, first, that men and women are equally capable of all jobs and, second, that if jobs were done by women, they would be done differently. So feminism itself is anything but egalitarian. Feminists argue explicitly that if more women were in charge, more caring values would prevail. They begin from the presumption that women are by nature different beings. If women ran the world, there would be no war. When women run companies, cooperation, not competition, is the watchword. These are all explicit and firm assertions of sexism: that the personalities and natures of women are different from men. If womenâs personalities are different, is it not likely that they will prove better or worse at certain jobs than men? Differences cannot be appealed to when they suit and denied when they do not."" [pg. 261]""The assertion that âcultureâ explains human variation will be taken seriously when there are reports of women war parties raiding villages to capture men as husbands, or of parents cloistering their sons but not their daughters to protect their sonsâ virtue, or when cultural distributions for preferences concerning physical attractiveness, earning power, relative age, and so on show as many cultures with bias in one direction as in the other."" [pg. 275]""Somewhere in our education we unthinkingly absorb the idea that nature (genes) and nurture (environment) are opposites and that we must make a choice between them. If we choose environmentalism, then we are espousing a universal human nature that is as blank as a sheet of paper awaiting cultureâs pen, that humans are therefore perfectible and born equal. If we choose genes, then we espouse irreversible genetic differences between races and between individuals. We are fatalists and elitists. Who would not hope with all her heart that the geneticists were wrong?"" [pg. 317]""If you want to understand human motives, read Proust or Trollope or Tom Wolfe, not Freud or Piaget or Skinner. We are obsessed with one anotherâs minds. âOur intuitive commonsense psychology far surpasses any scientific psychology in scope and accuracy,â wrote Don Symons. 39 Horace Barlow points out that great literary minds are, almost by definition, great mind-reading minds."" [pg. 333]""Robert Trivers has argued that to deceive others well, an animal must deceive itself, and that self-deceptionâs hallmark is a biased system of transfer from the conscious to the unconscious mind. Deception is therefore the reason for the invention of the subconscious."" [pg.335]""Mankind is a self-domesticated animal; a mammal; an ape; a social ape; an ape in which the male takes the iniative in courtship and females usually leave the society of their birth; an ape in which men are predators, women herbivorous foragers; an ape in which males are relatively hierarchical, females relatively egalitarian; an ape in which males contribute unusually large amounts of investment in the upbringing of their offspring by provisioning their mates and their children with food, protection, and company; an ape in which monogamous pair bonds are the rule but many males have affairs and occasional males achieve polygamy; an ape in which females mated to low-ranking males often cuckold their husbands in order to gain access to the genes of higher-ranking males; an ape that has been subject to unusually intense mutual sexual selection so that many of the features of the female body (lips, breasts, waists) and the mind of both sexes (songs, competitive ambition, status seeking) are designed for use in competition for mates; an ape that has developed an extraordinary range of new instincts to learn by association, to communicate by speech, and to pass on traditions. But still an ape.""[pg.348]"
252,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3355789-mark,4,"In a frenetic effort to stay interesting, Matt Ridley unconsciously finishes his book with a terrific built-in summary by introducing Robin Dunbar's ""Scherazade Effect"" which is the frenetic effort to stay interesting, with sex and hence reproduction and life itself at stake.The book's a little like that: Matt's a consummate researcher and very good at explaining, and he's scraped together a mountain of anecdotes in support of his thesis which is, what exactly? It's kind of a little bit lost in all the stories but basically looking for the reason we are people instead of ordinary animals, he finds sexual selection and the need to be attractive as causal in the case of neoteny, big brains, language, tools, dominant men and sexy women, everything you want.There are a million uncomfortable moments wherein simple circular dynamics diverge in unstable fashion to a new set point, like a peacock's feathers or human brains or a whale's (two ton!) gonads. Like Ridley, I couldn't resist a teaser there, but the  point  is that like so many, Ridley has a hard time wrapping his brain around recursive iterative dynamics. Since that's my JOB, I'm ok with it, but remember being frustrated and tied in a mental knot by the chicken / egg / chicken problem of feedback in physical systems. I do feel the analogy's apt though. There doesn't have to be a driving reason for everything, if a tiny nudge can suffice to loose an avalanche of consequent evolution. I find that believable.One thing he might have missed, in trying to explain us (humans) in an area cosmologists have long since overcome, which is the ""we're not special"" or ""duh, because WE're here"" explanation as to why the sun is just the right temperature or the boltzman constant just so: the reason is that the people in that potential universe or on that potential planet just arent. They aren't there, they entirely aint. I'm doing a horrible job explaining that, but basically SOMEBODY had to be on the top of the food chain and I'm personally glad to be lucky enough that it's me. Why am  I  thinking about evolution? My answer? ""Because if I were an ant I couldn't."" I think Ridley misses that he doesn't have to go searching for some reason why WE in particular are special. We're just lucky that way; ~ somebody had to be.Ahh, never mind all that. In summary, it's hard to dislike a guy who calls both Freud and Skinner misguided. This is a fun book and certainly has a lot of truth in it. Ridley wants a main theme and maybe hasn't got one, but he doesn't need it anyway. Bravo.-------------------------------Here's a long postscript on why there's a 50:50 ratio of the sexes.Gina asked why males aren't rare, since it wouldn't seem so many are necessary. I re-read a whole chapter & wrote this reply...The answer, in the Red Queen, lies around page 100. It's long and complex and, in case you want to cut to the chase, finally an unsatisfying answer.First I think I noted that male and female as different genders are an idea organized around using organelles (mitochondria) from just ONE parent. Apparently otherwise competition between them within the cell is destructive, so it's better to just pick one parent from which to get 'em. (It's the female: the sperm is stripped of all but its nucleus in the catharsis of fertilization.)Why not hermaphrodites came up next and the answer was that in a hermaphroditic population, there would be instabilities, for example a tendency to kill off your male parts would make more resources available to the female nature, which would be thereby advantaged. Ultrafemmes would outperform hermaphrodites as mothers, and in so doing, make sperm scarce. Female killer genes could also then prosper, these making a new offspring hypermale. So an instability is encouraged by the basic idea of commitment: by being ""all in"" in one's choice of sex, you have a better chance of success than playing both sides & thereby hedging two bets badly.So far we still don't have any reason why the numbers should be so easily balanced. There are plenty of creatures where that's not the case, and there are ""driving"" genes that cause sex ratio distortion. Ritter he documents one human family wherein only girls were born. Why wouldn't such a thing, this parthenogenesis, catch on, at least in some proportion? All these different causes seem like tendencies that ought to swing towards some optimal ratio which would (obviously?) benefit from a male percentage << 50%. ...and that's your question, still unanswered. Lemmings actually solve it with a third sex chromosome that biases the odds towards females, a seemingly better system. Are we just unlucky vs lemmings?He delves briefly into other systems, as when unfertilized eggs become male (a clearly stable situation) or my favorite, when ALL the fish in the school are female, save the biggest, who changes teams to fulfill his duties. I guess the point is, there are plenty of exceptions to the rule. Ridley delights in these digressions.Then there were many more anecdotes, sort of diffusing away into a fog of confusion, doubtless why I forgot this next point. ""Munching a burrito"" with some scientist, he notes that dominant women & monkeys (& cows and chickens) have more sons, that female hormones not genetics tend most (and there are many factors) to bias the sex ratios, and a shortage of men makes for dominant females. It doesn't seem to ""tend"" towards exactly 50:50 or even be strongly supported, certainly not convincingly so in the face of the profligate polygamous male hypothesis. So the question goes down as being self corrected by mysterious and non genetic means. Unsatisfying. More theories then follow, but many of these have to do with social criteria pertinent only to humans (you can always marry a beautiful daughter up-caste, but not a son) but these theories do not answer as to why farmers have failed to breed female only lines of cattle, however hard they try. That last observation was a quote from Dawkins, and seemingly his last word. I have to suspect Ridley should have accepted this as unknown and ended the chapter there.At least, I will."
253,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature by Matt RidleyâThe Red Queen"" is the very interesting book about how human nature evolved as a result of sex. According to the author, human beings were âdesignedâ to reproduce and that without understanding competitive reproduction we will not be able to comprehend the human psyche and nature. Well known journalist, scientist and educator; Matt Ridley, brings us a well-rounded science book that deals with many fascinating topics involving sexual evolution. The first third of book or so starts off a little dense and may put off some readers but once it picks up it really takes off and rewards readers with invaluable knowledge. This 416-page book is composed of the following ten chapters: 1. Human Nature, 2. The Enigma, 3. The Power of Parasites, 4. Genetic Mutiny and Gender, 5. The Peacockâs Tale, 6. Polygamy and the Nature of Men, 7. Monogamy and the Nature of Women, 8. Sexing the Mind, 9. The Uses of Beauty, and 10. The Intellectual Chess Game. Positives:1.	A well-written and well-researched book. 2.	The fascinating topic of sexual evolution in the hands of a master.3.	The book was originally published in 1993 but it holds up generally well and itâs still worth reading.4.	Good use of the best that science had to offer at that time.5.	Thought-provoking and refreshingly honest and witty approach.6.	Provides compelling arguments in support of a universal human nature.7.	Explains the reasoning behind the title which is a metaphor in evolution for âthe faster you run, the more the world moves with you and the less you make progressâ.8.	Some great analogies, âThe fashion in evolutionary science now is to scoff at progress; evolution is a treadmill, not a ladderâ.9.	What sex is. A look from three different kinds of scientists. Great stuff.10.	The unbelievable world of sex in both the animal and plant kingdom.11.	Some great facts and perspectives, âThe âgreat warâ of 1914-18 killed 25 million people in four years. The influenza epidemic that followed killed 25 million in four monthsâ.12.	What drive the evolution of sex.13.	Understanding what evolution is in a practical sense.14.	How science works to address a problem.15.	Understanding gender in terms of âgenetic lotteryâ. Or leave it to the environment.16.	Some great anecdotes, âAnaxagoraâs belief that lying on the right side during sex would produce a boy was so influential that centuries later some French aristocrats had their left testicles amputatedâ. Ouch!17.	The nature of âchoosyâ females.18.	The two warring factions in sexual selection: âFisherâ and âGood-genesâ.19.	Testosterone and its relation to disease.20.	What men find attractive in women.21.	The impact of human culture.22.	An honest look at the roles of the sexes.23.	An understanding about homosexual behavior.24.	Game theory and how it plays out between males and females. Always interesting.25.	Human evolution always fascinating.26.	The growth of our brains.27.	Understanding the evil practice of female infanticide.28.	Power as a tool for sexual success. Itâs good being the king.29.	Marriage, understanding the institution of.30.	Adultery and how it shaped human society.31.	Fascinating look at what societies favor daughters over sons and vice versa.32.	The differences of mental features between the sexes.33.	A look at social statuses.34.	The innate instinct of learning language.35.	The evidence for neoteny.36.	Links to notes worked great! Negatives:1.	The first third or so of the book was a bit dense and may have put off some readers.2.	Despite holding up generally well (book was published in 1993), some topics are outdated. For instance, free will is an illusion. I will provide a list of suggestion that offers more up to date information.3.	Animal altruism is not a myth.4.	Some topics are fairly logical. We all have a basic grasp of sexual selection.5.	Some topics may irk feminists. Let me leave it at that.6.	The author purposely sidesteps the issue of morality and the little that is here is inadequate.7.	âDeception is therefore the reason for the invention of the subconscious.â â Trivers Really?In summary, I wished I had read this book when it first came out in 1993. The book started off a little dry but once it gets going I wasnât able to put it down. Many topics of popular interest in the hands of an accomplished author make for good reading. In spite of its age, I learned some new things and have a much better grasp of why human nature evolved as a result of sex. If you have the patience to make it through the early chapters the book will reward you with wisdom, worth reading! Further recommendations: ""Humanâ and âWhoâs In Charge?â by Michael S.

256,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42782354-guilherme-zeitounlian,5,"This book is a very interesting essay about evolution, sex, genes, and behaviour.Even before finishing it, I was already sure that at least 50% of it is wrong.(After all, it presents theories that contradict one another.)But the presentation is very intelligent, drawing examples from all kinds of species (from bacteria to humans, including geese and peacocks - a lot of peacocks).And, most importantly, it makes you think. The experience is much more amusing if you pause and reflect - and try to devise your own explanations - before reading the main theories.That's why it gets a 5/5.OBS: In order to better enjoy the book, I recommend reading ""The Selfish Gene"" first."
257,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13334219-ralph-hermansen,4,"""The Red Queen"" by Matt Ridley. A review by Ralph Hermansen.I would buy Matt Ridley's next book without hesitation, no matter what the topic. He is one of the few authors who thoroughly researches his subject and understands the science underlying it. He then delivers the information to you in an interesting way. You certainly get your money's worth in his books.""The Red Queen"" is about the evolutionary forces which has shaped us as human beings. The significance of Lewis Carroll's Red Queen from the book, ""Alice in Wonderland"", is that we have to run just to stand still. So it is with evolution. We have to improve our survival skills over the generations to keep pace with the other plants and animals which are also advancing in their survival skills.Much of what we are as humans has to do with sexual selection. Charles Darwin introduced the concept of natural selection in his book, ""Origin of the Species"", but he devoted an even greater deal of space to his concept of sexual selection in his book, ""The Descent of Man"". No matter how superior you are in survival abilities, it is all for naught if you do not pass those traits on to your offspring. Therefore mating is vitally important. You must be attractive to the opposite sex and this manifests itself in diverse ways amongst the animals. Moreover, sexual selection may create traits that seem to work against survivability. The peacock would certainly be better served with a smaller, less ornate tail, which makes him a more obvious target for predators.Ridley picks up where Darwin left off and explores the sexuality of humans as they have evolved from apes and gradually became a big brained animal over millions of years of evolution. He has incorporated most of the ideas of modern scientists related to this subject. Men are attracted to beauty and women are attracted to powerful men, who can provide for them. In the animal kingdom, the female selects the male with the best traits and the males are willing to mate with most any female in heat. The case has become different for modern humans because human babies are helpless far longer than in normal in the animal kingdom. This is a consequence of out massive brain, which must continue developing outside the womb.One part of the book did leave me surprised. Ridley got so caught up in his analysis of what women would do in selecting men that he surmised that women would rarely engage in opportunistic sex as it is against their self interest. Mr. Ridley, if you had been single and dating in California in the 1970's, you would soon realize how very mistaken you are. Many women had decided that they were now equal to men and could enjoy the same pleasures and they did. A few years later, fear of AIDS put an end to this libertine period. Alas!Aside from that mistaken projection, the Red Queen book is excellent and I think you will enjoy reading it. Ralph Hermansen 10/04/08 "
258,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47841182-myrto-smyrilioy-zerva,5,"This is a book targeted at biologists and not, alike. It consists of a, not completely unbiased review of our knowledge on the subjects of a human evolution and inherent nature beautifully stated by a superfluous pen with a deep understanding and fiery passion on the subject. It is an educational read but the wit and humor is not secrificed in the altar of scientific accuracy or logical argument. I found this book both stimulating, informative and entertaining. This is also helped by a fantastic audio."
259,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1052384-nicholas,3,"I feel like I really missed out on what this book had to offer. I don't think that I had the requisite background for it at the time. Reread.This book is about the effect of parasites on sex and culture. Sex is the caused by the need to fight off parasites that have a much faster generational cycle than we do. Our culture is a product in large part of this sexual dynamic.Quotes:""Evolution is a treadmill not a ladder.""""Evolution is something that happens to organisms. It is a directionless process that sometimes makes an animal's decedents more complicated, sometimes simpler, and sometimes changes them not at all. We are so steeped in notions of progress and self-improvement that we find it strangely hard to accept this.""""Parasites are in constant battle with hosts, a battle that is fought by switching from one resistance gene to another; hence the battery of different versions of genes. None of this would work without sex.""""If the goal is to have the sexist son in the next generation, then one way of doing that is to mate with the sexiest male; a second way is to prevent other females from mating with the sexiest male.""""We are designed for a system of monogamy plagued by adultery.""""What caused the sudden and spectacular expansion of that one ape's head, from which so much else flowed? Why did it happen to one ape and not another? What can account for the astonishing speed, and the accelerating speed of the change? These questions may seem to have nothing to do with the subject of this book, but the answer may lie with sex. If new theories are right, the evolution of man's big head was the result of a Red Queen sexual contest between individuals of the same gender.""""Half the ideas in this book are probably wrong."""
260,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1251066-andy,3,"I've been meaning to read this for years, after an old flat-mate told me about it while studying for his BSc in the psychology of attraction. Finally found it in a charity shop in Tunbridge Wells and decided to finish of the year with some evolutionary pondering.Matt Ridley freely states that the first third may not be as interesting to some as he details the background of evolutionary theory in relation to sexual activity and behaviour in animals. Dry perhaps, may be a better term. It's the later parts of the book though where things get interesting, looking at how human nature (if indeed humans can be said to have a specific 'nature') may (or may not) have been shaped by evolutionary pressures. There are many fascinating examples and case studies, compiled expertly by Ridley. As he again mentions, he has compiled these mostly from the work of others, trying to tie a lot of individual theories and evidence together. Generally he manages a good job and it's eminently readable.Whether or not you agree or believe is entirely another matter and really, books such as this should be read to educate and promote discussion. He doesn't (and shouldn't) attempt to claim a definitive conclusion and many avenues are left open to debate. I personally found it compelling. My biggest issue is how out of date much of the evidence (and some occasional clumsy discussions, particularly around homosexuality) is now, having been written almost 20 years ago. I would certainly be interested in reading a more up to date discussion of the state of the field.Still, a well recognised and deserved text, worth reading."
261,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361083-erwin,5,"Excellent book. Definitely worth reading for everyone, particularly followers of any religion.Summary is that Human Intelligence, just like a peacocks feathers, are the result of Sexual Selection. The more intelligent, the more able to outsmart other humans, and the more able to mate --- this especially applies to men.Few aspects of human nature can be understood apart from sex, since human nature is a product of evolution, and evolution in our case is driven specifically by sexual replication.The book begins with an evolutionary account of sex itself, defending the theory that sex flourishes, despite its energetic costs, primarily because a sexually mixed heritage confers to offspring a defensive ""head start"" against parasites received from and originally adapted to the maternal host environment.Human intelligence is largely a result of sexual selection. Human intelligence far outstrips any survivalist demands that would have been placed on our hominid ancestors, and analogizes human intelligence to the peacock's tail, a trait widely believed to be the result of sexual selection. Human intelligence is used primarily to attract mates through prodigious displays of wit, charm, inventiveness, and individuality.Next I should read The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature."
262,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5619806-veronica,2,"Okay, so the good points of the book: when the author discusses the up to date and relevant research of scientists, he does so respectfully, succinctly, and accurately. He does not both too much with alternative perspectives, but for the most part, while sometimes unpalatable information, I tend to agree with the information. The worse points of the book: his own opinion is often absurd. His methods of making the information relatable is, in my opinion, stupid. He lacks the creativity to make a compelling story out of facts, and frankly, the theories are often so elegant and beautiful, it's unnecessary anyway. Finally, in his final depressing notes, he not just criticizes, but attempts to entirely discredit pioneers in many different fields, none of which he is an expert in. Even if some of the theories are no longer considered accurate or represent our world model, they paved the path for future endeavours which have enhanced our knowledge of the natural world and our place within it. Finally, several of the individuals he attempted to discredit are still at the forefront of their fields and are still considered accurate and representative of present day findings. Following this, he gives us his own uneducated opinions on where he thinks the future will take us. The only reason he got two stars at all was because of the research he did present and do justice to. I'm shocked this book has such high reviews. I was so looking forward to reading it. "
263,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5205758-mario-garc-a,5,"An amazing book on when and how things started developing for us in a way which serves no big purpose but keeping our social cohesion.By us I mean the human species as a subspecies of African ape, by when I mean historically and then, how, biologically.But categorizing that way is unfair to the acute reader. Matt Ridley manages to handle the subject with such an elegance, concision and property quite difficult to find among ""entrepreneurial"" scholars nowadays. This book is really informative and not just another idiot trying to make some extra-money by spreading pseudo-science.A must read if you want to get acquainted with the ways of modern Biology and Human Sciences in general; yet, you will find a lot of ingenious answers to common misconceptions and useful knowledge to understand the wonderful intricacies of social interaction at an animal level.And yes, it is an easy replacement for bad literature; for you see, It'll make you feel better with yourself, get you laid more often or just serve as a good excuse to keep your fidelity."
264,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/689670-joanna,1,"My review of this book can be summed up in a quote from the very end of the book, ""Half the ideas in this book are probably wrong."" That's probably a generous estimate on the author's part! I would also add ""sexist"" to ""wrong."" If only I'd read the end first, I could've saved myself a lot of frustration.A sampling:""The best [men] can hope for now is a good-looking younger mistress and a devoted wife who is traded in every decade or so. We're back to square one."" ""Inject all pregnant women with the right dose of hormones, and the result would be men and women with normal bodies but identical female brains. War, rape, boxing, car racing, pornography, and hamburgers and beer would soon be distant memories.""Then he talks about how women with Turner's syndrome are born without ovaries. ""They are exaggeratedly feminine in their behavior, with typically a special interest in babies, clothes, housekeeping, and romantic stories.""This book is bad science based in sexist stereotypes. Ironically, I read it for my feminist book club!"
265,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22176981-olivera,2,"Even though Matt Ridley said in his epilogue to this book that he doesn't regret including animals in this book I found it to be a flaw that can't necessarily be overcome. This isn't a book you will enjoy unless you are a fan of biology and the behavior of animals (which I in fact am not).I went into this expecting exactly what the title promised: the evolution of human nature, yet there was more talk about birds, insects, apes and snails than there actually was about humans. While I do understand that giving a kind of background for this topic is necessary, to me it seemed like it was overdone. Only in the last third did it actually focus on the theme it was supposed to focus on, but the 200+ pages that took me to get there weren't really worth it. There were some very interesting theories here, but I found a few facts being repeated over and over again. I don't really know what to say. I'm just pretty disappointed in The Red Queen and I'll be hesitant to pick up anything regarding this subject in the future, even though I am interested in it."
266,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4948409-samantha-sean,4,"In The Red Queen, Matt Ridley asserts that sexual selection is more prominent a factor of survival of a species than natural selection in its general form. Ridley cites Darwin, multiple fascinating biological studies, and psychological experiments. The findings of all his data verify his assertion well, though somehow I feel jilted. There is so much more to life than reproduction and procreation of the species. Attraction is not as simple a matter as genetic predilection and instinct, or generalizations in psychology. Ridley covers deviations very little, and explains why they exist (as byproducts or mutations). Overall, I vastly understand the world of sexual selection as a major contributor to our present customs and inclinations as a species. The rant on evolution at the end felt out of place, but the conclusion was concise. The value of the Red Queen is its compilation of data to support the relevance of sex in our evolution. "
267,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8739994-darrel,4,"Matt Ridley is a consistently good science writer and he does not disappoint in The Red Queen. The research and writing are solid. I should have read it many years ago when it first came out. My main criticism is that it is somewhat dated. It appears that he wrote nothing of the Bonobos in the original edition then threw in a few paragraphs in the later edition. Unfortunately, the information about Bonobo sexuality is important and should have informed his conclusions more. I do recommend it, but read with the knowledge that the original was written over 10 years ago and new information and research has emerged which is not taken into consideration. I don't think his conclusions would be radically changed, but certainly would be better nuanced.Dr. Darrel Ray, author of Sex and God: How Religion Distorts Sexuality, and The God Virus."
268,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75567-nils-samuels,3,"Consolidates ideas from anthropology and biology, arguing most interestingly for significant evolutionary differences between males and females, applied first to other animals and then to humans. First half of the book sets up the more homocentric second half. The summary: men are naturally polygamous, women naturally monogamous. Men like youth and beauty. Women like wealth and power. Civilization works for the greatest good when monogamy rules, since polygamy favors a select few and leaves many others partnerless. Otherwise the rich men in their sports cars would steal all the thunder and the lightning as well. And many more men would kill each other for beauty, literally not just metaphorically. "
269,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2296903-jana,4,"It's important to understand that evolution is not a process of improvement. Natural selection simply asserts that species change as they adapt to ever-changing environments. Evolution is not a process by which human beings or societies become better. Those organisms best able to survive in a challenging, shifting environment live to reproduce. The environment can change at any moment, thus neutralizing any advantage of any species.Sex provides the necessary variation that keeps evolution going, and without constant evolution, competitors and environmental change would lead to extinction of all species. "
270,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,4,"Would you like to more thoroughly understand why people are the way they are and why they do the crazy shit they do? If so, this book would be a great place to start. It's one of those ridiculously insight inducing reads. It's also one of those books that you absolutely can not judge by its cover. Or by its first and last chapters. Curious? Than by all means read on. One of the things that put me off of the book (before I actually read it) was the title The Red Queen. I'm dreadfully embarrassed to admit that I assumed it had something to do with menstruation. Not that there's anything wrong with menstruation. I just wasn't particularly motivated to commit a decent chunk of my ""one wild life"" to a long form exploration of that particular subject.When I actually read the book, I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't about menstruation at all. The title is actually a clever reference to Lewis Carroll's Red Queen from Through the Looking-Glass, a character who has to keep running to stay in the same place. Matt Ridley's hypothesis is that sex is essentially an organisms strategy for outwitting its constantly mutating internal predators (e.g. parasites, viruses etc.), a process he likens to an arms race. The point being, that in any sort of arms race, both sides work their asses off just to maintain their relative positions against the other. Essentially running in place. Hence ""The Red Queen"" analogy. Another reason I was reluctant to read the book, before a I actually read the book, was that I was sort of convinced that sexual selection (as opposed to natural selection all red in tooth and claw) was the lesser feature of Darwin's dangerous idea. After actually reading the book, I have essentially experienced a 180 degree change in perspective. I now view sexual selection as possessing awesome explanatory power. The Red Queen bravely attempts to address dozens of difficult questions regarding the otherwise mysterious workings of human nature and culture. Far form perfect. Provisional and dated. But nevertheless less brilliantly written and entertaining as all get out. The Red Queen offers an extraordinarily generative approach for interpreting the human condition and how it has evolved.I highly recommend actually reading this book."
271,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"This book one star deducted because of the long-winded introduction. I almost added it at the end though, because that was so brilliant. This is a lucid, immensely readable book about the evolutinary foundation of human nature. It starts out with animals and covers much the same ground as ""the Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins that I read not long ago. However, it as soon as it moves into the deeper waters of human nature it becomes vastly more interesting.Humang beings are just another animal species. We're not very special - other species have culture and language too, although not as finely honed as humans'. We run on instinct too, as learning is costly and dangerous. Language learning and a fear of snakes, for example, are hard-wired in our brains. Speaking of brains, why are ours so big? Matt Ridley presents the thoughs of Miller, who thinks it's selected for. Human beings are very keen on wit and humour (come think of it, so am I) and this has been sexually selected for. To keep ahead in the ferocious inter-species competition, men had to be ever smarter and this lead to an ever-increasing brain size for both genders. We live on gossip and deception and the most succesful of us tend to be the best ""mindreaders"". ""The choosines of human beings in picking their mates has driven the human mind into a history of frenzied expansion for no reason except that wit, virtuosity, inventiveness and individuality turn other people on"". It's an interesting theory at any rate! Anyone interested in human nature and why we are as we are should read this book. Fascinating! This works well as an introduction to both human nature and evolution."
272,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1641357-alexa,4,"I was wrong: Upon completion I'd say this. This started out so dry that I almost gave up, but I ended up really liking it. Very scientific review of why humans have 2 genders and aren't hermaphrodides, what advantages procreating through sex rather than one of the many other ways has etc. Once you get past the first 1/3 it becomes much more understandable and interesting. Rule 1 for all humans, ""success in life equals having grandchildren survive to adulthood"" (read - pass on your genes). Approach for men, that translates into the quantity of sexual partners Approach for women, that translates into quality of sexual partners. And the rest are fascinating deductions from that rule and those approaches. Just jump over the first chapters. Reminds me of one of my all time favorites. That is ""Brain Sex"" which surely has a better name, but is no more intersteing in the end."
273,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,4,"Sex and evolution -- always fun topics and even more fun when you throw them together. I must becoming centrist in my old age, because I found Ridley's approach to strike just the right tone between authoritative and skeptical. Nothing is certain, but certain theories seem to hold more sway. Ridley's narrative also makes it clear that the answer is probably in the middle of conflicting theories, human nature being as complex as it is.My two favorite takeaways from the book: 1) Sex is most probably an evolutionary response to dealing with disease. 2) The human mind is the equivalent of the peacock tail -- a quirk of human-ness that evolved to attract mates. Now I know why creativity is so sexual."
274,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6601778-parker-f,4,"A fascinating book on my favorite topic. The author refreshingly acknowledges that half of the theories he espouses in the book are likely to be wrong; for instance, I am highly skeptical of Ridley's theory that human large-brainedness arose from runaway sexual selection favoring cute, disproportionately large heads. Nonetheless, I have no good reason to doubt this, and, as Ridley notes, all arguments of runaway sexual selection involve somewhat circular reasoning. I was fond of Ridley's literary allusions to illustrate the primalness of our evolutionarily-shaped motivations. Finally, this book is highly motivational with regards to my life's goal of acquiring a large harem. "
275,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32369480-loki,3,"Thought provoking, but less than entirely convincing, look at how genetics effect psychology. The author is quick to clarify, but often writes in a style that seems to deliberately generate an overlarge need to clarify - this is a book of meandering thoughts for the most part. Ridley strives to sound neutral, but always gives the impression of having an agenda (although if it's any more developed than 'hey, use my cool metaphor', I missed it). Still, it raises some interesting questions, for all that it pretends to greater certainty than is really warranted in such a rapidly evolving field of study."
276,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1037357-angela-juline,1,"SOOO glad to be done with this book! I don't understand how it has such a high rating. My uncle sent it to my daughter, so I wanted to read it first. I'd let her read it, but I don't know why she would want to. He states a theory, and then loves to say, but, wait, in the black tailed, orange-rimmed sage grouse, the opposite happens. It's annoying how he picks out a totally obscure animal/insect/bacteria to prove the theory has flaws. Clearly, he has done an amazing amount of research - but to what end? I'm going to need to read some 4 & 5 star reviews to see what the point of this book is. "
277,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7506759-anthony-bello,2,"The author attempts to avoid heteronormativity and sexism and fails outright. Only the first half of the book is worth reading; I got to learn about all different strategies that nature uses for sexual and asexual reproduction and different biological applications of game theory. Past that, the rest merely reeks of essentializing Victorianism. The first half of the book will endure; the second half is already dated."
278,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105107-michael,1,"Unnecessary book that just forever states the obvious, written by someone without very much credibility and it seems to show. Essentially encapsulates in 350 pages what one could do alone in 20 minutes of just thinking."

281,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2775247-alexander-tomislav,5,"This book sets a case that sexual selection is the reason, as for the peacock's tail, so for the human intelligence as well. The title comes from Lewis Carroll's ""Alice through the Looking Glass"" character of Red Queen, who, the faster she goes, the more she stays in place. This is related to the evolutionary phenomenon of ""locked"" development, such as between parasites and hosts. The more parasites adapt to hosts' defenses, the more defenses will be evolved in the hosts.Drawing on many a research, the author starts with examples from the animal world, examining clues and evidence from a geneticist's, evolutionist's and ecological points of view. Biggest clue is how many features of animals (long tail feathers and bright colors in some birds, for example) serve more for the organism to breed, than to survive. Indeed, driven by the genes' impetus to replicate, it's more ""Breeding of the fittest"" than survival.One of the biggest problems that evolutionary science faces is the attitude, common in humanistic sciences, that male and female brains are identical. Not so, claims the author, and the reasoning is compelling and sound - just as different environmental pressures caused male and female bodies to be different, it did the same to our brains. No amount of wishful thinking or political correctness can make that different. However, he's quick to point out ""Give men an inch of inequality and they will claim a mile of bias."". The human body blueprint is female, and only through two testosterone bursts (in womb and at the start of puberty) does it become masculine. Environment plays a big role in gene expression and the author demonstrates in multiple places how nature and nurture aren't opposites, but work together. As a reason for explosive development of the human brain, the author shows how the competition between members of the same species drove that development. We didn't become smarter to make tools, or to hunt, or to develop language and society. Many animals hunt, have complicated social dynamics, use tools and rudimentary communication. We evolved big brains to outwit each other.Until humanity accepts what it is, instead of vainly focusing on what it should be, we can't advance as a species. Selected quotes:""Human nature is a product of culture, but culture is also a product of human nature, and both are the products of evolution."" [pg 6.]""Humanity is, of course, morally free to make and remake itself infinitely, but we do not do so. We stick to the same monotonously human pattern of organizing our affairs. If we were more adventurous, there would be societies without love, without ambition, without sexual desire, without marriage, without art, without grammar, without music, without smilesâ and with as many unimaginable novelties as are in that list. There would be societies in which women killed each other more often than men, in which old people were considered more beautiful than twenty-year-olds, in which wealth did not purchase power over others, in which people did not discriminate in favor of their own friends and against strangers, in which parents did not love their own children."" [pg. 7]""Evolution is something that happens to organisms. It is a directionless process that sometimes makes an animalâs descendants more complicated, sometimes simpler, and sometimes changes them not at all. We are so steeped in notions of progress and self-improvement that we find it strangely hard to accept this."" [pg. 31]""Nicholas Humphrey, a Cambridge psychologist, was the first to see clearly the solution to this puzzle. We use our intellects not to solve practical problems but to outwit each other. Deceiving people, detecting deceit, understanding peopleâs motives, manipulating peopleâ these are what the intellect is used for. So what matters is not how clever and crafty you are but how much more clever and craftier you are than other people. The value of intellect is infinite. Selection within the species is always going to be more important than selection between the species."" [pg. 34]""Sex is about disease. It is used to combat the threat from parasites. Organisms need sex to keep their genes one step ahead of their parasites. Men are not redundant after all; they are womanâs insurance policy against her children being wiped out by influenza and smallpox..."" [pg. 86]""The goal for every female animal is to find a mate with sufficient genetic quality to make a good husband, a good father, or a good sire. The goal for every male animal is often to find as many wives as possible and sometimes to find good mothers and dams, only rarely to find good wives. In 1972, Robert Trivers noticed the reason for this asymmetry, which runs right through the animal kingdom; the rare exceptions to his rule prove why it generally holds. The sex that invests most in rearing the youngâ by carrying a fetus for nine months in its belly, for exampleâ is the sex that makes the least profit from an extra mating. The sex that invests the least has time to spare to seek other mates. Therefore, broadly speaking, males invest less and seek quantity of mates, while females invest more and seek quality of mates."" [pg. 132]""Murder is ânaturalâ in the sense that our ape relatives commit it regularly, as apparently did our human ancestors. Prejudice, hate, violence, crueltyâ all are more or less part of our nature, and all can be effectively countered by the right kind of nurture. Nature is not inflexible but malleable."" [pg. 181]""Lesbians, free of constraints imposed by male nature, do not suddenly indulge in sexual promiscuity; on the contrary, they are remarkably monogamous. None of this is surprising: Female animals gain little from sexual opportunism, for their reproductive ability is limited not by how many males they mate with but how long it takes to bear offspring. In this respect men and women are very different."" [pg. 218]""[...]the ban on polygamous marriage does not prevent the males from seeking polygamous matings. Adultery is common. It is most common between high-ranking males and females of all ranks. To prevent it males try to guard their wives, are extremely violent toward their wivesâ lovers, and copulate with their wives frequently, not just when they are fertile."" [pg. 234]""The noble savage, far from living in contented sexual equanimity, was paranoid about becoming, and intent on making his neighbor into, a cuckold[...] Cuckoldry paranoia is deep-seated in men. The use of veils, chaperones, purdah, female circumcision, and chastity belts all bear witness to a widespread male fear of being cuckolded and a widespread suspicion that wives, as well as their potential lovers, are the ones to distrust[...] Jealousy is a âhuman universal,â and no culture lacks it. Despite the best efforts of anthropologists to find a society with no jealousy and so prove that it is an emotion introduced by pernicious social pressure or pathology, sexual jealousy seems to be an unavoidable part of being a human being."" [pg. 235]""There has been no genetic change since we were hunter-gatherers, but deep in the mind of the modern man is a simple male hunter-gatherer rule: Strive to acquire power and use it to lure women who will bear heirs; strive to acquire wealth and use it to buy other menâs wives who will bear bastards. It began with a man who shared a piece of prized fish or honey with an attractive neighborâs wife in exchange for a brief affair and continues with a pop star ushering a model into his Mercedes. From fish to Mercedes, the history is unbroken: via skins and beads, plows and cattle, swords and castles. Wealth and power are means to women; women are means to genetic eternity."" [pg. 244]""Testosterone is an ancient chemical, found in much the same form throughout the vertebrates. Its concentration determines aggressiveness so exactly that in birds with reversed sex roles, such as phalaropes and in female-dominated hyena clans, it is the females that have higher levels of testosterone in the blood. Testosterone masculinizes the body; without it, the body remains female, whatever its genes. It also masculinizes the brain."" [pg. 254]""Baby girls are more interested in smiling, communicating, and in people, boys in action and things. Shown cluttered pictures, boys select objects, girls people. Boys are instantly obsessed with dismantling, assembling, destroying, possessing, and coveting things. Girls are fascinated by people and treat their toys as surrogate people. Hence, to suit their mentalities, we have invented toys that suit each sex. We give boys tractors and girls dolls. We are reinforcing the stereotypical obsessions that they already have, but we are not creating them."" [pg. 256]""The Israeli kibbutz system has proved to be a large natural experiment in the persistence of sex roles. Men and women were initially encouraged to drop all sex roles in kibbutzim: Haircuts and clothes were unisex; boys were encouraged to be peaceful and sensitive, while girls were treated like tomboys; men did household chores and women went out to work. Yet three generations later, the attempt has largely been abandoned, and kibbutz life is actually more sexist than life in the rest of Israel. People have returned to stereotypes. Men politick, while women tend the home; boys study physics and become engineers, while girls study sociology and become teachers and nurses. Women manage the morale, health, and education of the kibbutz, while men manage the finances, security, and business.[...] Women clean house in a kibbutz because, like women everywhere, they complain that men would not do it properly. Men do not clean house in a kibbutz because, like men everywhere, they complain that if they did, their wives would say it had not been done properly."" [pg. 260]""The bizarre thing about this assertion of different natures is that it is a thoroughly feminist assertion. There is a contradiction at the heart of feminism, one that few feminists have acknowledged. You cannot say, first, that men and women are equally capable of all jobs and, second, that if jobs were done by women, they would be done differently. So feminism itself is anything but egalitarian. Feminists argue explicitly that if more women were in charge, more caring values would prevail. They begin from the presumption that women are by nature different beings. If women ran the world, there would be no war. When women run companies, cooperation, not competition, is the watchword. These are all explicit and firm assertions of sexism: that the personalities and natures of women are different from men. If womenâs personalities are different, is it not likely that they will prove better or worse at certain jobs than men? Differences cannot be appealed to when they suit and denied when they do not."" [pg. 261]""The assertion that âcultureâ explains human variation will be taken seriously when there are reports of women war parties raiding villages to capture men as husbands, or of parents cloistering their sons but not their daughters to protect their sonsâ virtue, or when cultural distributions for preferences concerning physical attractiveness, earning power, relative age, and so on show as many cultures with bias in one direction as in the other."" [pg. 275]""Somewhere in our education we unthinkingly absorb the idea that nature (genes) and nurture (environment) are opposites and that we must make a choice between them. If we choose environmentalism, then we are espousing a universal human nature that is as blank as a sheet of paper awaiting cultureâs pen, that humans are therefore perfectible and born equal. If we choose genes, then we espouse irreversible genetic differences between races and between individuals. We are fatalists and elitists. Who would not hope with all her heart that the geneticists were wrong?"" [pg. 317]""If you want to understand human motives, read Proust or Trollope or Tom Wolfe, not Freud or Piaget or Skinner. We are obsessed with one anotherâs minds. âOur intuitive commonsense psychology far surpasses any scientific psychology in scope and accuracy,â wrote Don Symons. 39 Horace Barlow points out that great literary minds are, almost by definition, great mind-reading minds."" [pg. 333]""Robert Trivers has argued that to deceive others well, an animal must deceive itself, and that self-deceptionâs hallmark is a biased system of transfer from the conscious to the unconscious mind. Deception is therefore the reason for the invention of the subconscious."" [pg.335]""Mankind is a self-domesticated animal; a mammal; an ape; a social ape; an ape in which the male takes the iniative in courtship and females usually leave the society of their birth; an ape in which men are predators, women herbivorous foragers; an ape in which males are relatively hierarchical, females relatively egalitarian; an ape in which males contribute unusually large amounts of investment in the upbringing of their offspring by provisioning their mates and their children with food, protection, and company; an ape in which monogamous pair bonds are the rule but many males have affairs and occasional males achieve polygamy; an ape in which females mated to low-ranking males often cuckold their husbands in order to gain access to the genes of higher-ranking males; an ape that has been subject to unusually intense mutual sexual selection so that many of the features of the female body (lips, breasts, waists) and the mind of both sexes (songs, competitive ambition, status seeking) are designed for use in competition for mates; an ape that has developed an extraordinary range of new instincts to learn by association, to communicate by speech, and to pass on traditions. But still an ape.""[pg.348]"
282,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3355789-mark,4,"In a frenetic effort to stay interesting, Matt Ridley unconsciously finishes his book with a terrific built-in summary by introducing Robin Dunbar's ""Scherazade Effect"" which is the frenetic effort to stay interesting, with sex and hence reproduction and life itself at stake.The book's a little like that: Matt's a consummate researcher and very good at explaining, and he's scraped together a mountain of anecdotes in support of his thesis which is, what exactly? It's kind of a little bit lost in all the stories but basically looking for the reason we are people instead of ordinary animals, he finds sexual selection and the need to be attractive as causal in the case of neoteny, big brains, language, tools, dominant men and sexy women, everything you want.There are a million uncomfortable moments wherein simple circular dynamics diverge in unstable fashion to a new set point, like a peacock's feathers or human brains or a whale's (two ton!) gonads. Like Ridley, I couldn't resist a teaser there, but the  point  is that like so many, Ridley has a hard time wrapping his brain around recursive iterative dynamics. Since that's my JOB, I'm ok with it, but remember being frustrated and tied in a mental knot by the chicken / egg / chicken problem of feedback in physical systems. I do feel the analogy's apt though. There doesn't have to be a driving reason for everything, if a tiny nudge can suffice to loose an avalanche of consequent evolution. I find that believable.One thing he might have missed, in trying to explain us (humans) in an area cosmologists have long since overcome, which is the ""we're not special"" or ""duh, because WE're here"" explanation as to why the sun is just the right temperature or the boltzman constant just so: the reason is that the people in that potential universe or on that potential planet just arent. They aren't there, they entirely aint. I'm doing a horrible job explaining that, but basically SOMEBODY had to be on the top of the food chain and I'm personally glad to be lucky enough that it's me. Why am  I  thinking about evolution? My answer? ""Because if I were an ant I couldn't."" I think Ridley misses that he doesn't have to go searching for some reason why WE in particular are special. We're just lucky that way; ~ somebody had to be.Ahh, never mind all that. In summary, it's hard to dislike a guy who calls both Freud and Skinner misguided. This is a fun book and certainly has a lot of truth in it. Ridley wants a main theme and maybe hasn't got one, but he doesn't need it anyway. Bravo.-------------------------------Here's a long postscript on why there's a 50:50 ratio of the sexes.Gina asked why males aren't rare, since it wouldn't seem so many are necessary. I re-read a whole chapter & wrote this reply...The answer, in the Red Queen, lies around page 100. It's long and complex and, in case you want to cut to the chase, finally an unsatisfying answer.First I think I noted that male and female as different genders are an idea organized around using organelles (mitochondria) from just ONE parent. Apparently otherwise competition between them within the cell is destructive, so it's better to just pick one parent from which to get 'em. (It's the female: the sperm is stripped of all but its nucleus in the catharsis of fertilization.)Why not hermaphrodites came up next and the answer was that in a hermaphroditic population, there would be instabilities, for example a tendency to kill off your male parts would make more resources available to the female nature, which would be thereby advantaged. Ultrafemmes would outperform hermaphrodites as mothers, and in so doing, make sperm scarce. Female killer genes could also then prosper, these making a new offspring hypermale. So an instability is encouraged by the basic idea of commitment: by being ""all in"" in one's choice of sex, you have a better chance of success than playing both sides & thereby hedging two bets badly.So far we still don't have any reason why the numbers should be so easily balanced. There are plenty of creatures where that's not the case, and there are ""driving"" genes that cause sex ratio distortion. Ritter he documents one human family wherein only girls were born. Why wouldn't such a thing, this parthenogenesis, catch on, at least in some proportion? All these different causes seem like tendencies that ought to swing towards some optimal ratio which would (obviously?) benefit from a male percentage << 50%. ...and that's your question, still unanswered. Lemmings actually solve it with a third sex chromosome that biases the odds towards females, a seemingly better system. Are we just unlucky vs lemmings?He delves briefly into other systems, as when unfertilized eggs become male (a clearly stable situation) or my favorite, when ALL the fish in the school are female, save the biggest, who changes teams to fulfill his duties. I guess the point is, there are plenty of exceptions to the rule. Ridley delights in these digressions.Then there were many more anecdotes, sort of diffusing away into a fog of confusion, doubtless why I forgot this next point. ""Munching a burrito"" with some scientist, he notes that dominant women & monkeys (& cows and chickens) have more sons, that female hormones not genetics tend most (and there are many factors) to bias the sex ratios, and a shortage of men makes for dominant females. It doesn't seem to ""tend"" towards exactly 50:50 or even be strongly supported, certainly not convincingly so in the face of the profligate polygamous male hypothesis. So the question goes down as being self corrected by mysterious and non genetic means. Unsatisfying. More theories then follow, but many of these have to do with social criteria pertinent only to humans (you can always marry a beautiful daughter up-caste, but not a son) but these theories do not answer as to why farmers have failed to breed female only lines of cattle, however hard they try. That last observation was a quote from Dawkins, and seemingly his last word. I have to suspect Ridley should have accepted this as unknown and ended the chapter there.At least, I will."
283,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature by Matt RidleyâThe Red Queen"" is the very interesting book about how human nature evolved as a result of sex. According to the author, human beings were âdesignedâ to reproduce and that without understanding competitive reproduction we will not be able to comprehend the human psyche and nature. Well known journalist, scientist and educator; Matt Ridley, brings us a well-rounded science book that deals with many fascinating topics involving sexual evolution. The first third of book or so starts off a little dense and may put off some readers but once it picks up it really takes off and rewards readers with invaluable knowledge. This 416-page book is composed of the following ten chapters: 1. Human Nature, 2. The Enigma, 3. The Power of Parasites, 4. Genetic Mutiny and Gender, 5. The Peacockâs Tale, 6. Polygamy and the Nature of Men, 7. Monogamy and the Nature of Women, 8. Sexing the Mind, 9. The Uses of Beauty, and 10. The Intellectual Chess Game. Positives:1.	A well-written and well-researched book. 2.	The fascinating topic of sexual evolution in the hands of a master.3.	The book was originally published in 1993 but it holds up generally well and itâs still worth reading.4.	Good use of the best that science had to offer at that time.5.	Thought-provoking and refreshingly honest and witty approach.6.	Provides compelling arguments in support of a universal human nature.7.	Explains the reasoning behind the title which is a metaphor in evolution for âthe faster you run, the more the world moves with you and the less you make progressâ.8.	Some great analogies, âThe fashion in evolutionary science now is to scoff at progress; evolution is a treadmill, not a ladderâ.9.	What sex is. A look from three different kinds of scientists. Great stuff.10.	The unbelievable world of sex in both the animal and plant kingdom.11.	Some great facts and perspectives, âThe âgreat warâ of 1914-18 killed 25 million people in four years. The influenza epidemic that followed killed 25 million in four monthsâ.12.	What drive the evolution of sex.13.	Understanding what evolution is in a practical sense.14.	How science works to address a problem.15.	Understanding gender in terms of âgenetic lotteryâ. Or leave it to the environment.16.	Some great anecdotes, âAnaxagoraâs belief that lying on the right side during sex would produce a boy was so influential that centuries later some French aristocrats had their left testicles amputatedâ. Ouch!17.	The nature of âchoosyâ females.18.	The two warring factions in sexual selection: âFisherâ and âGood-genesâ.19.	Testosterone and its relation to disease.20.	What men find attractive in women.21.	The impact of human culture.22.	An honest look at the roles of the sexes.23.	An understanding about homosexual behavior.24.	Game theory and how it plays out between males and females. Always interesting.25.	Human evolution always fascinating.26.	The growth of our brains.27.	Understanding the evil practice of female infanticide.28.	Power as a tool for sexual success. Itâs good being the king.29.	Marriage, understanding the institution of.30.

A look at social statuses.34.	The innate instinct of learning language.35.	The evidence for neoteny.36.	Links to notes worked great! Negatives:1.	The first third or so of the book was a bit dense and may have put off some readers.2.	Despite holding up generally well (book was published in 1993), some topics are outdated. For instance, free will is an illusion. I will provide a list of suggestion that offers more up to date information.3.	Animal altruism is not a myth.4.	Some topics are fairly logical. We all have a basic grasp of sexual selection.5.	Some topics may irk feminists. Let me leave it at that.6.	The author purposely sidesteps the issue of morality and the little that is here is inadequate.7.	âDeception is therefore the reason for the invention of the subconscious.â â Trivers Really?In summary, I wished I had read this book when it first came out in 1993. The book started off a little dry but once it gets going I wasnât able to put it down. Many topics of popular interest in the hands of an accomplished author make for good reading. In spite of its age, I learned some new things and have a much better grasp of why human nature evolved as a result of sex. If you have the patience to make it through the early chapters the book will reward you with wisdom, worth reading! Further recommendations: ""Humanâ and âWhoâs In Charge?â by Michael S.

287,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13334219-ralph-hermansen,4,"""The Red Queen"" by Matt Ridley. A review by Ralph Hermansen.I would buy Matt Ridley's next book without hesitation, no matter what the topic. He is one of the few authors who thoroughly researches his subject and understands the science underlying it. He then delivers the information to you in an interesting way. You certainly get your money's worth in his books.""The Red Queen"" is about the evolutionary forces which has shaped us as human beings. The significance of Lewis Carroll's Red Queen from the book, ""Alice in Wonderland"", is that we have to run just to stand still. So it is with evolution. We have to improve our survival skills over the generations to keep pace with the other plants and animals which are also advancing in their survival skills.Much of what we are as humans has to do with sexual selection. Charles Darwin introduced the concept of natural selection in his book, ""Origin of the Species"", but he devoted an even greater deal of space to his concept of sexual selection in his book, ""The Descent of Man"". No matter how superior you are in survival abilities, it is all for naught if you do not pass those traits on to your offspring. Therefore mating is vitally important. You must be attractive to the opposite sex and this manifests itself in diverse ways amongst the animals. Moreover, sexual selection may create traits that seem to work against survivability. The peacock would certainly be better served with a smaller, less ornate tail, which makes him a more obvious target for predators.Ridley picks up where Darwin left off and explores the sexuality of humans as they have evolved from apes and gradually became a big brained animal over millions of years of evolution. He has incorporated most of the ideas of modern scientists related to this subject. Men are attracted to beauty and women are attracted to powerful men, who can provide for them. In the animal kingdom, the female selects the male with the best traits and the males are willing to mate with most any female in heat. The case has become different for modern humans because human babies are helpless far longer than in normal in the animal kingdom. This is a consequence of out massive brain, which must continue developing outside the womb.One part of the book did leave me surprised. Ridley got so caught up in his analysis of what women would do in selecting men that he surmised that women would rarely engage in opportunistic sex as it is against their self interest. Mr. Ridley, if you had been single and dating in California in the 1970's, you would soon realize how very mistaken you are. Many women had decided that they were now equal to men and could enjoy the same pleasures and they did. A few years later, fear of AIDS put an end to this libertine period. Alas!Aside from that mistaken projection, the Red Queen book is excellent and I think you will enjoy reading it. Ralph Hermansen 10/04/08 "
288,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47841182-myrto-smyrilioy-zerva,5,"This is a book targeted at biologists and not, alike. It consists of a, not completely unbiased review of our knowledge on the subjects of a human evolution and inherent nature beautifully stated by a superfluous pen with a deep understanding and fiery passion on the subject. It is an educational read but the wit and humor is not secrificed in the altar of scientific accuracy or logical argument. I found this book both stimulating, informative and entertaining. This is also helped by a fantastic audio."

Reread.This book is about the effect of parasites on sex and culture. Sex is the caused by the need to fight off parasites that have a much faster generational cycle than we do. Our culture is a product in large part of this sexual dynamic.Quotes:""Evolution is a treadmill not a ladder.""""Evolution is something that happens to organisms. It is a directionless process that sometimes makes an animal's decedents more complicated, sometimes simpler, and sometimes changes them not at all. We are so steeped in notions of progress and self-improvement that we find it strangely hard to accept this.""""Parasites are in constant battle with hosts, a battle that is fought by switching from one resistance gene to another; hence the battery of different versions of genes. None of this would work without sex.""""If the goal is to have the sexist son in the next generation, then one way of doing that is to mate with the sexiest male; a second way is to prevent other females from mating with the sexiest male.""""We are designed for a system of monogamy plagued by adultery.""""What caused the sudden and spectacular expansion of that one ape's head, from which so much else flowed? Why did it happen to one ape and not another? What can account for the astonishing speed, and the accelerating speed of the change? These questions may seem to have nothing to do with the subject of this book, but the answer may lie with sex. If new theories are right, the evolution of man's big head was the result of a Red Queen sexual contest between individuals of the same gender.""""Half the ideas in this book are probably wrong."""

Finally found it in a charity shop in Tunbridge Wells and decided to finish of the year with some evolutionary pondering.Matt Ridley freely states that the first third may not be as interesting to some as he details the background of evolutionary theory in relation to sexual activity and behaviour in animals. Dry perhaps, may be a better term. It's the later parts of the book though where things get interesting, looking at how human nature (if indeed humans can be said to have a specific 'nature') may (or may not) have been shaped by evolutionary pressures. There are many fascinating examples and case studies, compiled expertly by Ridley. As he again mentions, he has compiled these mostly from the work of others, trying to tie a lot of individual theories and evidence together. Generally he manages a good job and it's eminently readable.Whether or not you agree or believe is entirely another matter and really, books such as this should be read to educate and promote discussion. He doesn't (and shouldn't) attempt to claim a definitive conclusion and many avenues are left open to debate. I personally found it compelling. My biggest issue is how out of date much of the evidence (and some occasional clumsy discussions, particularly around homosexuality) is now, having been written almost 20 years ago. I would certainly be interested in reading a more up to date discussion of the state of the field.Still, a well recognised and deserved text, worth reading."
291,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361083-erwin,5,"Excellent book. Definitely worth reading for everyone, particularly followers of any religion.Summary is that Human Intelligence, just like a peacocks feathers, are the result of Sexual Selection. The more intelligent, the more able to outsmart other humans, and the more able to mate --- this especially applies to men.Few aspects of human nature can be understood apart from sex, since human nature is a product of evolution, and evolution in our case is driven specifically by sexual replication.The book begins with an evolutionary account of sex itself, defending the theory that sex flourishes, despite its energetic costs, primarily because a sexually mixed heritage confers to offspring a defensive ""head start"" against parasites received from and originally adapted to the maternal host environment.Human intelligence is largely a result of sexual selection. Human intelligence far outstrips any survivalist demands that would have been placed on our hominid ancestors, and analogizes human intelligence to the peacock's tail, a trait widely believed to be the result of sexual selection. Human intelligence is used primarily to attract mates through prodigious displays of wit, charm, inventiveness, and individuality.Next I should read The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature."

He does not both too much with alternative perspectives, but for the most part, while sometimes unpalatable information, I tend to agree with the information. The worse points of the book: his own opinion is often absurd. His methods of making the information relatable is, in my opinion, stupid. He lacks the creativity to make a compelling story out of facts, and frankly, the theories are often so elegant and beautiful, it's unnecessary anyway. Finally, in his final depressing notes, he not just criticizes, but attempts to entirely discredit pioneers in many different fields, none of which he is an expert in. Even if some of the theories are no longer considered accurate or represent our world model, they paved the path for future endeavours which have enhanced our knowledge of the natural world and our place within it. Finally, several of the individuals he attempted to discredit are still at the forefront of their fields and are still considered accurate and representative of present day findings. Following this, he gives us his own uneducated opinions on where he thinks the future will take us. The only reason he got two stars at all was because of the research he did present and do justice to. I'm shocked this book has such high reviews. I was so looking forward to reading it. "

Matt Ridley manages to handle the subject with such an elegance, concision and property quite difficult to find among ""entrepreneurial"" scholars nowadays. This book is really informative and not just another idiot trying to make some extra-money by spreading pseudo-science.A must read if you want to get acquainted with the ways of modern Biology and Human Sciences in general; yet, you will find a lot of ingenious answers to common misconceptions and useful knowledge to understand the wonderful intricacies of social interaction at an animal level.And yes, it is an easy replacement for bad literature; for you see, It'll make you feel better with yourself, get you laid more often or just serve as a good excuse to keep your fidelity."
294,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/689670-joanna,1,"My review of this book can be summed up in a quote from the very end of the book, ""Half the ideas in this book are probably wrong."" That's probably a generous estimate on the author's part! I would also add ""sexist"" to ""wrong."" If only I'd read the end first, I could've saved myself a lot of frustration.A sampling:""The best [men] can hope for now is a good-looking younger mistress and a devoted wife who is traded in every decade or so. We're back to square one."" ""Inject all pregnant women with the right dose of hormones, and the result would be men and women with normal bodies but identical female brains. War, rape, boxing, car racing, pornography, and hamburgers and beer would soon be distant memories.""Then he talks about how women with Turner's syndrome are born without ovaries. ""They are exaggeratedly feminine in their behavior, with typically a special interest in babies, clothes, housekeeping, and romantic stories.""This book is bad science based in sexist stereotypes. Ironically, I read it for my feminist book club!"
295,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22176981-olivera,2,"Even though Matt Ridley said in his epilogue to this book that he doesn't regret including animals in this book I found it to be a flaw that can't necessarily be overcome. This isn't a book you will enjoy unless you are a fan of biology and the behavior of animals (which I in fact am not).I went into this expecting exactly what the title promised: the evolution of human nature, yet there was more talk about birds, insects, apes and snails than there actually was about humans. While I do understand that giving a kind of background for this topic is necessary, to me it seemed like it was overdone. Only in the last third did it actually focus on the theme it was supposed to focus on, but the 200+ pages that took me to get there weren't really worth it. There were some very interesting theories here, but I found a few facts being repeated over and over again. I don't really know what to say. I'm just pretty disappointed in The Red Queen and I'll be hesitant to pick up anything regarding this subject in the future, even though I am interested in it."
296,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4948409-samantha-sean,4,"In The Red Queen, Matt Ridley asserts that sexual selection is more prominent a factor of survival of a species than natural selection in its general form. Ridley cites Darwin, multiple fascinating biological studies, and psychological experiments. The findings of all his data verify his assertion well, though somehow I feel jilted. There is so much more to life than reproduction and procreation of the species. Attraction is not as simple a matter as genetic predilection and instinct, or generalizations in psychology. Ridley covers deviations very little, and explains why they exist (as byproducts or mutations). Overall, I vastly understand the world of sexual selection as a major contributor to our present customs and inclinations as a species. The rant on evolution at the end felt out of place, but the conclusion was concise. The value of the Red Queen is its compilation of data to support the relevance of sex in our evolution. "
297,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8739994-darrel,4,"Matt Ridley is a consistently good science writer and he does not disappoint in The Red Queen. The research and writing are solid. I should have read it many years ago when it first came out. My main criticism is that it is somewhat dated. It appears that he wrote nothing of the Bonobos in the original edition then threw in a few paragraphs in the later edition. Unfortunately, the information about Bonobo sexuality is important and should have informed his conclusions more. I do recommend it, but read with the knowledge that the original was written over 10 years ago and new information and research has emerged which is not taken into consideration. I don't think his conclusions would be radically changed, but certainly would be better nuanced.Dr. Darrel Ray, author of Sex and God: How Religion Distorts Sexuality, and The God Virus."
298,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75567-nils-samuels,3,"Consolidates ideas from anthropology and biology, arguing most interestingly for significant evolutionary differences between males and females, applied first to other animals and then to humans. First half of the book sets up the more homocentric second half. The summary: men are naturally polygamous, women naturally monogamous. Men like youth and beauty. Women like wealth and power. Civilization works for the greatest good when monogamy rules, since polygamy favors a select few and leaves many others partnerless. Otherwise the rich men in their sports cars would steal all the thunder and the lightning as well. And many more men would kill each other for beauty, literally not just metaphorically. "
299,0060556579,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2296903-jana,4,"It's important to understand that evolution is not a process of improvement. Natural selection simply asserts that species change as they adapt to ever-changing environments. Evolution is not a process by which human beings or societies become better. Those organisms best able to survive in a challenging, shifting environment live to reproduce. The environment can change at any moment, thus neutralizing any advantage of any species.Sex provides the necessary variation that keeps evolution going, and without constant evolution, competitors and environmental change would lead to extinction of all species.
