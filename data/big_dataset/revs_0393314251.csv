Gould documents a series of scientific frauds by racist scientists seeking to show white racial superiority. This book will make your blood boil - but if more people had read it no one would have fallen for all that bell-curve rubbish a few years later. Racism sucks, and it is based on ignorance. If you are looking for a cure to such ignorance, this is as good a place to start as any."
1,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1959519-max-maxwell,2,"NOTE: Feel free to read the full review, but I can sum it up in a fact. Gould need only have written the two-page epilogue to his book, a concise essay, rather than the remainder of the book. In fact, the entire thing is just so much pink fiberglass insulation leading up to the final page of the book. Everything he intended to say is there without any jargon or facts and figures. As a teacher, I intend to photocopy and teach that page alone. Carry on if desired.____________________________________________I am not a philistine, nor am I stupid, and rare is the book that totally mystifies me. It is regrettable, then, that this, which will be placed, in due time, on that narrow metaphorical shelf, bewildered not out of being truly beyond grasping, but rather out of poor presentation and overly technical writing. I feel that this is relevant to the aims of this review. I quote David Kipen's review of the The Zohar: Pritzker Edition Vol. 1:If a book is so knotty that it makes a critic's skull ache, most critics would consider that something an unwary reader deserves to know.And now you know. (To be clear, the first four chapters are not troublesome; it's chapter five, ""The Real Error of Cyril Burt,"" that should've been omitted. But I'll get to that in due time.)These are the main points of Gould's book: (a) That there is no discernible difference, especially of intellect, between the various races of Homo sapiens; (b) that scientists are prey to the same biases and subjectivities as we all are, and they may colour their work thus; (c) that intelligence is a nebulous, unquantifiable entity, and we often fall prey to the fallacy of reification when referencing intelligence, i.e. we feel that that which is named is definable; and (d) that sociobiology, as put forth by Richard Dawkins and E. O. Wilson, is incorrect insofar as it seeks to find an explanation for human behaviour in Darwinian theory. I can get behind propositions (a) through (c), but I find (d) revolting and completely off-base.In fact, my point (b) above, Gould's assertion that scientists' work might be shaped by their biases, is the basis for the ultimate failure of The Mismeasure of Man. Gould ""knows"" that IQ measures nothing, and that sociobiology is false, and that admitting any innate difference between human minds will lead to social darwinism, so of course, he's churned out this massive synthesis in support of precisely those ideas. The fact that he doesn't realize his hypocrisy is more or less vomit-inducing. The fact is that IQ measures something real, so says recent, moderate research (see ""The Search for Intelligence"" by the ubiquitous Carl Zimmer, Scientific American, October 2008, pp. 68-75). I agree with Gould when he quotes John Stuart Mill, saying thatThe tendency has always been strong to believe whatever received a name must be an entity or being, having an independent existence of its own. And if no real entity answering to the name could be found, men did not for that reason suppose that none existed, but imagined that it was something particularly abstruse and mysterious.The rub is that some things that don't answer to names actually don't exist, for one. Unicorns come to mind. Another conundrum arrises when we take into account the first rule of behavioural genetics, as quoted in Steven Pinker's 
The Blank Slate
:All human behavioural traits are heritable.This is key. It simply states, rather uncontroversially, that all traits might be inherited, and to say as much is not to embrace genetic determinism. But in the book, Gould poo-poos sociobiology and the rule. He states that human being have no innate leaning toward aggressiveness. In a sense, Mismeasure is the archenemy of The Blank Slate. Gould never actually advocates that we are blank slates, stating instead thatI cannot adopt such a nihilistic position without denying the fundamental insight of my profession.He does, however, essentially state that IQ is meaningless because it reifies intelligence, and that there's nothing innately different about one human's brain or another's, in a sort of ""Harrison Bergeron"" vision of equality. Pinker pretty much shows this to be false, but finds a way to celebrate our differences.To me, the problem with IQ is not that it measures nothing, in theory, although some people just don't test well, and I exclude them from judgment. My beef is that IQ is just so linear and one-dimensional. Who decided that skill in math and grammar was the sole indicator of intelligence? What about athletic ability? Artistic ability? Ability to categorize? Or to ask the big questions? What about people with great ""people skills,"" or an aptitude for mechanics? Educators will be familiar with Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences, and I subscribe to it wholeheartedly. Darwin himself was of average intelligence, but excelled at research (Gardner's ""naturalist"" intelligence). And I believe that each of us is capable of whatever we wish to accomplish—there are pilots and painters without arms, and I almost cringe before throwing out the token ""Beethoven was deaf"" nugget. Genes are not destiny, and work can overcome them. That said, smart people know their limits and they don't wax poetic about how they don't exist and we're all equal in every way. I know that I am not good at math, that is, I was not born with an innate ability to comprehend mathematics intuitively. I could certainly apply myself and learn math, but why bother?—I understand biology and literature in ways most mathematicians do not.And this brings us to the part of the book that made me give it one star—""The Real Error of Cyril Burt,"" consisting of eighty-six pages of advanced math. This is a fatal error for a pop-sci book. I had to skip the chapter after 20 pages; it was going in one eye and out the other, or as Richard Ellis says, MEGO syndrome set in (My Eyes Glaze Over). Sample:The original measures may be represented as vectors of unit length, radiating from a common point. If two measures are highly correlated, their vectors lie close to each other. The cosine of the angle between any two vectors records the correlation coefficient between them...Not exactly quantum mechanics, to be sure, but enough to kill my interest, and lose the point. If Gould needs a lot of math to tell me something very loose and unsure, and Pinker needs no math to tell me something completely concrete, well, Occam and his famed blade point to the latter.This is the second Gould I've read, and it was the second to involve a disclaimer about a glut of details to come in the introduction. When you're used to Richard Dawkins and Carl Sagan, with their grand, sweeping,and poetic generalizations about life, the universe, and everything, these details are not only shelter to the devil—they are the devil.Believe it or not, I recommend this book. The first four chapters and the epilogue—the story of a sterilized woman with Down's syndrome, which broke my heart—are pretty good. But bad editing is its downfall. When I count three spelling errors, I send the thing back to my mental publishers."
2,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3389050-sean-delauder,5,"Before a proper summation can be given, one first has to understand the Why of The Mismeasure of Man. The Why being hundreds of years of conservative, white-folk-do-well-because-they're-smartest ideology supported by ""science"", and the more recent belief in the existence of an inherited IQ number by which all humans can be ranked, culminating in The Bell Curve, by Herrnstein and Murray (1994). It is a book that asserts poor people are, in short, intellectually inferior to the non-poor, and thus can never rise above their status (barring some fluke) to achieve the success that wealthier people enjoy.The book was roundly criticized as sloppy, statistically inaccurate, and pandering to a conservative audience that wanted to believe the poor were not worth the money spent on them, with Gould as one of its loudest critics.In sum, Gould's book is an admonishment of ideology behind The Bell Curve (Gould published The Mismeasure of Man years earlier, then republished when The Bell Curve was released) and the willingness of social scientists to shape their findings to fit their narrative over the past centuries of anthropological research. In essence, they found what they set out to find (support for white, Europeans being more intelligent than others), in spite of clear evidence to the contrary--thus the title of the book. He debunks the methodologies and findings of ideas such as: mental capacity is determined by cranial volume, and how those who used these methods tried to fit their beliefs to their findings and preserve the idea that Wealthy White People have earned their status because they are more intelligent (this became a problem when some African skulls, and even some female skulls *gasp!*, had greater volume than their caucasian counterparts), as well as the notion of a measurable IQ. For those with a mathematical bent, the latter portion of the book explains the error of Herrnstein and Murray's calculations, and the continuing trend of partiality toward specific data that proved their hypothesis while ignoring data that might disprove it.The latter part of this trend is what Gould finds disheartening and enraging at the same time. It is symptomatic of Bad Science. That being when scientists find an abundance of evidence that points in a different direction from what they expected, yet cling to their preconceived expectations anyway, and search for a way to manipulate their data to confirm the existing bias. Imagine if Newton had at first insisted his laws of motion were based upon the energy inherent in apples, and never allowed his findings to alter his opinion. In the far future these notions of gender- and race-based intellectuality will be long behind us and we will look back in incredulity. But if not for Gould, this book, and others like him, we might never take those steps forward.If you take anything from the book, or at least the idea of the book if you choose not to read it in its entirety, it should be 1) always approach an idea with some degree of skepticism, and 2) consider the possibility of an agenda behind a proposal--even when offered by something so noble and ideal as the scientific community."
3,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,5,"Gould is a good person and an excellent thinker. This is a call to scientists to examine their own biases and it is a demolishment of centuries of racist genetic testing. It's also such a pleasure to read someone who is a sound thinker and can write logically. I know some of his debunkings (i.e. Morton) have since been debunked, but that does nothing to diminish the importance of this work. Also, he notes that racist ""science"" tends to proceed from movements demanding equality. And so it is that the likes of Murray joined by a bunch of other people are once again advancing the guard of IQ determinism. I could really use an updated Mismeasurement of Man right about now"
4,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13302827-kolbj-rn-br-nnick,1,"This book is a political document, not a popular science book. Unfortunately, the book is an example of dishonest cherry picking of findings and selective omission of studies that would ruin the story Gould tries to construct. Ironically, Gould commits the same ""crime"" he accuses the racist scientists of: selective bias.There is no scientific honesty in this book, and as a consequence, Gould gives ammo to those he tries to discredit and disarm. Irony once again.Maybe this topic should be left untouched, as there is great potention for harm associated with it. That is my own personal conclusion after pursuing the primary literature on the topics raised by Gould."
5,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/974210-erik-graff,5,"The public school system I attended in Park Ridge, Illinois had us taking standardized texts several times a year, year after year: Iowa Tests, California Testa, PSAT, NMSQT, ACT, SAT etc. Some of us, the cooperative ones, got quite good at it and had our choice of colleges. We were, we were told, intelligent--or, correlatively, ""not living up to potential"".Beyond the satisfaction of thinking myself smart, however, was an unease. It wasn't just that I wasn't particularly good at much of anything except tests, it was because of the segregation of students from one another beginning in elementary school and continuting, with ever greater degrees of discrimination, through junior and senior high schools. I couldn't buy it. A lot of the kids I was being separated from seemed smarter than me by any number of practical estimations.Gould's book is a history and critique of intelligence testing. It began in France, simply as a means of identifying areas of relative academic standing. Its purpose was benign: find the kids lagging in, say, numeration and pay enough attention to them to bring them up to speed. It became, primarily under the North Americans, a ontological measure of inherent capacity.Much of Gould's exposition hinges on the uses and abuses of factoral analysis, a mathematical tool he himself employed in his own academic training. His explanation of the method and of its history of abuse by intelligence measurers is clear and telling.Some of Gould's critique is based on a review, conducted by his students, of the data originally gathered and manipulated by early intelligence theorists. Errors are found, lots of them--virtually all tendentious. (Would that the means existed for such reviews of many of the foundational discoveries of science!)"

7,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/207680-danny,3,"I'm no expert in psychometrics, neuroscience, genetics, education, biology, physiology, psychology, factor analysis, or quantitative methodology. I'm only a layperson with an interest in literature, humanity, and science. So just note that the comments below are offered by a nonprofessional.My comments on The Mismeasure of Man: This book presents an interesting history of various attempts to measure intelligence among groups and attempts to rank groups by ""innate"" mental ability. Gould argues, essentially, that such attempts are useless and unfounded because intelligence is not a reified thing, and that preconceived political and social views (bias) have always plagued efforts to measure intelligence and always will. The book is an indictment of biological determinism, racism, and attempts to justify racism through science. While his history of intelligence testing and racism is instructive, this book does not adequately describe how science and psychometrics have evolved/matured in recent years. So the book does not present a complete history, in my view.While his arguments appeal to my sensibilities, I think Gould fails in some degree to offer sufficient counter arguments by others who challenge his own thinking (which is what I hoped for). So, as with nearly all books, this work should be read and considered in conjunction with other works that both agree and disagree with Gould's analysis and conclusions.I certainly do appreciate Gould's critique on the attempts, past and present, to classify racial groups in some kind of hierarchical ranking. However, I think, while a noble effort, Gould himself brings his own bias to the work. This is just to say that I agree with Gould in general, but I read with caution. In addition to this book, I have read Jensen's response to The Mismeasure of Man, an opinion paper by Bernard D. Davis about the book (two responses from people with opposing political views), and works by others who supported and criticized Gould's work. My opinions hold firm. Psychometrics and testing is of great value when identifying gaps in learning and evaluating education programs and policy. There is absolutely no valid justification for racism. Individual ability cannot be determined by race. Mental ability is not a measure for ""social worth."" Bias does exist, but scientific reasoning and quantitative methodologies aim to eliminate bias. Intelligence and academic success are influenced by a combination of biological, physiological, and psychological factors and a multitude of environmental factors including health, diet, education, social policy, culture, school climate, parenting, proximity to violence and crime, etc. And, finally, what I've learned most of all from this exercise is that there is always much, much more to be learned. I offer these references below not to advocate for the authors' political view, but simply to present alternative perspective:Davis, Bernard D. (1983). Neo-Lysenkoism, IQ, and the press.

8,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117697-shaenon-garrity,4,"A history of the use of intelligence testing to support racism, sexism, and class boundaries, focusing on two areas: 19th-century craniometry and 20th-century IQ tests. The going gets a little heavy in the final chapters when Gould busts out the math, but it's an eye-opener, using two specific historical examples to make larger points about the way science, though supposedly neutral, can be warped to enforce existing prejudices. (When poor Italian immigrants flooded into America in the early 20th century, research suddenly proliferated ""proving"" that Italians were a separate, mentally inferior nonwhite race; in Britain, studies focused on supporting the innate rightness of the class system and recommending lesser education for poor children.) Gould's message is ultimately positive: that our mental limits are far less relevant than our mental potential."
9,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583387-nebuchadnezzar,4,"The Mismeasure of Man is often touted as a definitive refutation of racialist pseudoscience and eugenics. However, while I would highly recommend Gould's work, I would do so as an entry point to the subject.Gould's prose is highly readable and entertaining as always. His coverage of the history of eugenics and scientific racism is excellent and engaging and it's worth reading for this alone. Now, on to the qualifications. A flaw in the book is Gould's revised measurements of Morton's skulls. Gould seems to have inadvertently proven his own point as revised measurements of their cranial capacity have been taken and it seems that Morton was mostly right, contra Gould. (See Nature mag: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/...) This doesn't detract too heavily from Gould's main point in my opinion, as cranial capacity cannot be used as a proxy measurement for IQ anyway. But it is hypocritical to accuse a long-dead academic of ideological bias and sloppy methodology and then engage in the same distortions. As Gould gets closer to the present, he begins to get sloppier. He derails in one part to take some swipes at sociobiology and E.O. Wilson. For anyone familiar with the sociobiology debate, this comes off as Gould just venting about a personal squabble. His rebuttals to the more contemporary race and IQ proponents do not adequately address their methodology. While placing them in historical context makes it fairly easy to see what their basic motives and mistakes are, Gould fails to rigorously refute their more nuanced statistical arguments. I would recommend the work of James R. Flynn on more contemporary race and IQ arguments. Flynn's work on the subject is superior in its scholarship and nuance.Nevertheless, this book is a great place for the lay person to start when it comes to the sordid history of the use of biology and psychology in service of ideology and bigotry."
10,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8377122-peerawat-chiaranunt,1,"I found this book very disappointing considering how much I love other books by Gould. The Mismeasure of Man aims to attack some of the supposed evidence for scientific racism. The book's purpose intrigued me initially, but as I began reading its content, I found Gould's method very unconvincing. This is one of Gould's arguments that I found most difficult to buy - Gould's attack on craniometry. He first gives a brief background of some of the first craniometric studies of human races done by Agazzis and Morton (quite informative). Gould then points out the flaw in Morton's studies: his measurements of the volume of skulls are done by filling the skull with seeds, and Morton might have, according to Gould, pressed the seeds further in the skulls that he believed (a priori) to be larger. It is an interesting case study of confirmation bias, and Gould claimed that he repeated Morton's measurements to find out that Morton's measurements were indeed influenced by his preconceptions. Gould's re-measurements were then falsified by many other scientists/anthropologists (according to a critique titled 'Mismeasure of Gould'). Gould seems to forget that he too has his own preconceptions about the topic.I think it is very difficult to read a book that relies on claiming that its opponent is under the influence of confirmation bias. The author would then simply repeat the experiment, only to be falsified by his critics, who suggest that he too is under the influence of said bias. It somehow seems like an endless exchange of straw-man arguments, and I don't find that very interesting to read about.Gould's fascination with the relationship between fact/theory and human preconceptions in science is admirable, but he does it much more beautifully in Wonderful Life. I suggest that you should read that rather than The Mismeasure of Man."
11,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"This was absolutely spectacular! A scientific look at the prejudices that pseudo science has used to confirm and back unnecessary racism. An inside look at the so called evidence that has furthered the labeling and segregating of mankind. It was absolutely flawless! I loved this book. Page after page was extremely infuriating. It is amazing how we can use science to twist facts to our own liking. I am so glad I found this at the library. It makes me both simultaneously wonder what other current ""facts"" are being distorted to further agendas, and feel extremely grateful that we are finally trying to put all human beings on an even footing. There is no better time to be who you are than today. "
12,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46840194,4,"Though written 40 years ago, Gould's polemic against hereditarianism has not lost any of its potency and urgency. Whether through craniometry, obscure body measurements, general intelligence or IQ-tests, the ruling class has time and time again found ways to reify social and historical classes as expressions of a timeless, unchanging reality. This mechanism, rooted in feudalism, persists vigourously in capitalism and makes a sneaky comeback in the guise of fascism and colonialism. To be recognized and combatted - in the end, all attempts to directly connect biology to sociology succumbs to race science, whether in the shape of ""judeo-bolshevism"", the paternalistic discourse of slavery or the endless contempt for the have-nots and their organizing:IQ of 75 or below should be the realm of unskilled labor, 75 to 85 ""preeminently the range for semi-skilled labor."" More specific judgments could also be made. ""Anything above 85 IQ in the case of a barber probably represents so much dead waste"" (1919, p. 288). IQ 75 is an ""unsafe risk in a motorman or conductor, and it conduces to discontent"" (Terman, 1919). Proper vocational training and placement is essential for those ""of the 70 to 85 class."" Without it, they tend to leave school ""and drift easily into the ranks of the anti-social or join the army of Bolshevik discontents"" (1919, p. 285)."

14,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16159568-jack,2,"This wasn't quite the book I was looking for, nor is it entirely what it appears - at least, as it may appear to a contemporary reader. Perhaps when it was first published it didn't seem so...unpromising. Let me try to explain myself.The Mismeasure of Man has the subtitle 'The definitive refutation to the argument of The Bell Curve'. That's why I picked it up. That's not really what the book is about, only about thirty pages near the end address that book particularly. Gould's work is a general for-the-layman, kinda, criticism of intelligence testing, nature-over-nurture style science. I think it was intended to be polemical, but its targets, while correctly identified in the terms of advancing his argument, are too soft to really persuade me. I haven't read The Bell Curve, nor do I intend to (I have other ways of self-harm), but I am aware of it as a malingering presence over right-wing American politics, whose rhetoric has continuously encroached over Europe and Ireland in the past few years. It's a notable work of scientific racism and as someone fervently against that whole hate thing, I wanted to read a strong rebuttal of prejudice veiled in objective language. I'm open about being thoroughly against racial differences being quantified in intelligence. I had my opinion before I read this book, and my disappointment stems from feeling that if I wasn't already inclined towards that belief, I would not be persuaded of it; at least, not as regarding modern prejudice. Most of this book is about scientists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. I didn't really need to know exactly how phrenology was a pseudoscience, nor did I need to learn that men of that milieu had biases that corrupted the supposed objectivity of their work. I knew that already. By the time Gould got to 'the point' for me, it was too late, because I expected something different of this book than what I wanted. I have to reflect more so on my own desires or biases as a reader than appraise an apparently sound, if politically unfit academic work. I don't get into arguments online because I rarely write to anyone. I find it difficult to converse with anyone with the immediacy the electronic word has. I've been reading forums since I was 12, and absorbing almost everything I read as accurate reflections of life experience, as grains of truth. I find the idea of being a political centrist repulsive, but I'm not really sure what I believe. At least, I don't find my beliefs to be systematic or coherent enough to wage war with my ideological opponents as the bulk of discourse, online or otherwise, seems to be. I am desperate to become morally and ideologically stalwart but cannot justify the confidence / arrogance of knowing myself to be right. And yet I came at this book not to learn both sides of a debate, but strengthen an inherent belief of mine. If I am unusually hypocritcal in my efforts to sharpen my political sensibility, I must improve; yet the thought that this is a mundane reality of human experience is similarly demoralizing. Yeats may have written that the best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity, but I sure am sick of being vacillating while posturing at being some sort of intellectual free-thinker. A bit of passionate intensity might do me some good. I would like my words, in speech or text, to have some power similar to the tens of thousands of words I have read over many years, in books, or more frequently, anonymous remarks online, that assert their realities upon my consciousness regardless of contradicting variance. I don't think it made me more intelligent or well-rounded to absorb so much conflicting free expressions of opinion, even if that is a supposed hallmark of democracy. It has been mostly confusing."

Few tragedies can be more extensive than the stunting of life, few injustices deeper than the denial of an opportunity to strive or even hope, by a limit imposed from without, but falsely identified as lying within"".I cannot do this book justice in a review. The matter is complicated and lies at the heart of what I believe. I have not yet taken an IQ test which I couldn't have done better if I had practiced certain things beforehand. Next number in a line, logic - it's all perfectly learnable and not a bit innate. I could be as smart as I like, but if I didn't know the language of the test, I would fail. That the result of this kind of testing would signify some kind of innate, inherited, intelligence is ludicruos - I was sure of that even at 15! Validity of a test : the extent to which it measures what it is supposed to measure. Does an IQ test really measure intelligence, and what precisely IS intelligence? According to Cyril Burt, Spearman, Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray intellligence is a single measurable thing, which is inherited and does not change. This would be laughable if the consequences of their beliefs have not had such negative affects on society. Stephen Jay Gould takes the studies of the intelligence researches and picks them apart. He doesn't spare his words and that makes this book a refreshing and personal read. He makes a strong point about Binet, the inventor of IQ in fearing that it would be used to limit possibilities - which is exactly what happened. Binet invented his test to find children who needed extra help in class - that was his sole purpose. He did not claim to measure intelligence, the ""intelligence quotient"" is a division of mental age with chronological age and to be used to determine whether a child needed special education or not. Binet: ""the scale, properly speaking, deos not permit the measure of the intelligence, because intellectual qualities are not superposable, and therefore cannot be measured as linear surfaces are measured"". The result of extensive intelligence testing in the United States resulted in the sterlization of thousands upon thousands of ""morons, imbeciles and idiots"", to prevent further deterioration. It also resulted in the 11+ testing of children in Britain, separating the children (20%) who would go on to secondary school in preparation of higher education and the ones (80%) who were sent to vocational school with not hope of university studies. Again, I cannot do ""the mismeasure of man"" justice here - but I recommend everyone to read it. It is frightening, upsetting and immensely informative."
16,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6226405-yasiru,2,"I read from this book (though I readily admit I haven't read the whole thing) during my introductory psychology course at university because the lecturer pointed it out as an example of good science debunking racial prejudices. I was somewhat sceptical then (about a book on science being written for the express purpose of countering a political attitude supposedly resting on scientific grounds), and as it turned out, Gould was overzealous with his case and may have proceeded with just the kind of selective bias he accuses others of (apart from other errors), however commendable his motivation might have been.See- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mism...The whole episode provides a somewhat more detached lesson which is still very important (and goes back at least to David Hume, an empiricist well aware of the limits his school of thought imposed itself)- science only tells us how things are, and carries no suggestions about how they ought to be (though it can tell you what ways some outcome might be best brought about). We can't afford to meet fatally polarised views (from The Bell Curve say, which this book criticises) with those from the opposite (ideological) extreme. Only seek falsifiable trends, record them, then consider what can be done with them for purposes decided in advance by different modes of discourse from the empirical (ethical and otherwise). It's also important with the scientific method to admit what we don't know and anticipate deficiencies in our analyses and possibly the overall paradigm (see Kuhn's work). There should always be a strong philosophical or ideological bulwark between scientific description and policy prescription. Certainly beware reification, but also be vigilant against the more pressing concern of slippery slopes."

The first time was at least twenty years ago, when I gave my father a copy for his birthday (he enjoyed it greatly) and then snuck a read of it myself separately. Okay, I didn't read the whole thing; I cut straight to the chapter where Gould swung a wrecking ball through ""The Bell Curve"" in a few concise pages, the better to arm myself with arguments against that apologia for institutionalized racism. But I did myself a disservice by not reading everything that came before, and so this time I read everydarnthing between the covers.Much of the first third or so of the book is going to be tough sledding for some people, and Gould himself apologizes for this, because he has to get technical about certain things that are highly relevant to his point. But the strands come together quickly enough, and soon you see the point being made: Most of what we have labeled ""intelligence"" is aptitude testing used in ways not intended by its manufacturers (and not very reliable to begin with), and has served to justify all manner of other mismeasurements of men. And Gould makes no apology for the political flavor of his argument: he is arguing for better ways to understand human beings than by devices that have lent themselves to allowing whole classes of people to be intentionally mislabeled as a little less than human.

19,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82786816-griffin-wilson,2,"This book, published in 1981, was partially a response to Arthur Jensen, a famous psychometrician and behavior geneticist, who I might consider the 'arch-hereditarian' of modern intelligence research, and whose famous 1969 article drew great ire from the public and a wide variety of intellectuals. Gould deems Jensen and his school ""biodeterminists,"" and sets out to debunk the theoretical basis of intelligence research, the g-factor (along with providing a history lesson).Something I did really appreciate about the book is the first two thirds or so. Here, Gould gives an excellent overview of the history of racism in Western science, which I am very glad to have read. Had I stopped after chapter 5 or so, I would probably give this book at least 4 stars.Unfortunately, Gould does not stop there, and it becomes increasingly obvious that he goes to great care to provide the reader with the most racist and sexist quotes possible in order to impassion them and fill them with rage against those (modern hereditarians) to whom he will later compare the various 19th century outdated western thinkers. In this way, he poisons the well against them, and talks himself and the reader into the a priorism which he claims to despise. There are countless problems with his assertions, most of which have not held up well in the last 40 years. Here are only a few:1. Morton's skulls: Gould 'corrects' Morton's measurements because he believes Morton fudged them just to fit his own beliefs. Several years after the publication of this book someone went back to re-measure Morton's skulls and -- surprise! -- got the same measurements Morton did. It is now well-known that there is a strong correlation between brain size and cognitive ability (between .2 and .3)2. Gould goes for low-hanging fruit and only 'debunks' scientists from the 19th/ early 20th century. He examines almost no research from the 1960s or 70s. If I were dissatisfied with the state of modern astronomy would I rail against Ptolemy, or would I try to engage with thought from the last several decades?3. The g-factor: this section has particularly not faired well as, even among environmentalists, the reality of the g-factor has more or less become accepted. The theory of multiple intelligences has not held up, and I am unaware of any modern researcher that espouses this view. His explanation of what it is is also a straw man: it is an empirically derived concept, not a ""thing"" that has a ""concrete"" location in the brain, nor is it ""innate"" and not subject to environmental changes; IQ tests are are also not a direct measure of it, which is what Gould seems to think -- they are only estimates that have a margin of error.The two concluding articles are inconsequential and use the same types of sophistry to malign various people via straw mans and well-poisoning (although I appreciate his short comments on Darwin at the end).Most of the 5 star reviews of this are by people who have not read 'the other side.' If they did, I believe they would have a more measured, less enthusiastic, approach.I would recommend reading Jensen's response: ""The Debunking of Scientific Fossils and Straw Persons"" and a more up-to-date work on modern research in this area: ""The Neuroscience of Intelligence"" by Dr. Richard J. Haier -- the field was really revolutionized in the 90s and 00s with the advent of PET scans and MRIs."
20,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7399710-natalie,1,"This was one of the most boring books I have ever read. Gould brought up some good points and he told some good stories, but he just went on and on and on. After 5 hours of different ways that these scientists measured skulls and how it was wrong, I was so ready to be done. Not only was the book boring, it was insanely negative. Gould paints a picture of doom and gloom, that mankind is completely subject to their own preconceptions and that all measurements done in the name of science are skewed to show what the scientist wants to see, and no scientific study can be trusted. Isn't that a little dramatic? Really? Also, other reviewers have mentioned Gould's own skewed perception of the data that he is presented, and they have a good point. Just like the people in his book, Gould is susceptible to bias. So if you decide to read this book, and you can stay awake long enough to make it through, make sure you take Gould's advice, and take everything he says with a grain of salt. It is just one man's point of view."

I think this book should be on the reading list for all budding scientists (including myself): beware, you my wrap your research in all the fancy analysis and mathematical formulation that you want, but you can still be led astray and down the path of bad science and logical fallacies. The book does really make you question the usefulness and validity of standardized tests that are a critical part of western higher education. ETS itself will admit that current research is mixed at best with regards to correlating GRE performance with graduate school success."

Gould shines a light on a long history of bias, bad science, discrimination an racism in areas of education, measure of intelligence, anthropology and even immigration and eugenics. Unfortunately, I am not well educated in statistics for which I couldn't appreciate the book at its fullest and should revisit it once I have acquired the necessary knowledge.

That's one of the most relevant arguments that the book profoundly explores throughout its deconstruction of biologically deterministic pseudosciences. These were always inextricably linked to the social prejudices of the racist, sexist, classist, ableist white men who developed and popularized all of these in fruitless attempts to ""evidence"" the political status quo of society as results arising from simple nature: Society is a reflection of nature, the strong ruling over the weak. These branches of study took many shapes, many names, and their lasting impact remains even to this day in the continuation of some of these practices.Beginning with the anatomical pseudosciences that took skewed recordings of data obtained via the methodology of anthropometrics, they sought to physiologically ""explain"" why some groups are ""inferior"" to others. This lasted for many years, adopting many different names and changing ideas to justify the preconceived bias of the researchers. They assumed that some human groups were inferior, so their anatomy must evidence this, somehow. As other branches of actual science advanced, these people eventually incorporated some of these: the theory of evolution, as well as incomplete theories of heredity and genetics. All this continued until the fraud, the self-contradictions, and data inconsistencies eventually led to them falling out of favor. Here, IQ testing came into the spotlight, and has been the most lasting type of hierarchical ranking of human groups. Measuring, testing, and branding their victims for life through faulty procedures to help determine some mysterious g value obtained through factor analysis. The victims that scored low were inevitably shunned for life, unable to advance, to receive education, accomodations, or any type of aid. Similar to the preceeding case, the people responsible for this were already prejudiced from the start. They assumed the conclusions and sought evidence that favored said conclusions. Fraud, misconduct, faulty testing, data manipulation, and idealized interpretations in favor of their preconceived conclusions was observable throughout the history of these fields. Biological determinism is a theory of limits, and it imposes all forms of limits on the people that rank in the lowest levels of their unilinear models of a ladder of ascending values of worth. The results always victimized less fortunate members of society, trapping them in a self-fulfilling prophecy of bigotry. IQ determines your ""worth"" from the start, and treats you according to your value, the majority of people being deemed unfit and suffering the results: a continuation of hierarchical oppression, exploitation, and discrimination involving economical limitations, continuing lack of access to education, and massive collective suffering at the hands of eugenics programs in programs of genocide, mass sterilization, etc.Worth cannot be granted as the result of some abstract factor that some bigoted people deemed fundamental. As Thurstone demonstrated, a simple geometric rotation of the vector projection of the factors used to measure IQ leads to the g factor of ""general intelligence"" disappearing. There's no justification for preferring g, only a biased preference of g as the core value of intelligence, since it ""evidences"" their bigoted theories; there's not any actual empirical science behind it. And as Gould explains, there's not even any scientific basis for assuming that g, or any value obtained from factor analysis (like Thurstone's primary abilities) are tangible, something physically real. One cannot separate psychological ""measurements"" from politics and society. To do so ignores the centuries of unequal material and ideal stratification of society's less fortunate at the hands of the groups benefitting from the hierarchical system. The fact that we have yet to cast aside these faulty ideas as the absurd, asinine ideas of bigoted men is truly saddening. In his words:""I criticize the myth that science itself is an objective enterprise done properly only when scientists can shuck the constraints of their culture and view the world as it is. . . . Science is rooted in creative interpretation. Numbers suggest, constrain, and refuse; they do not, by themselves, specify the contents of scientific theories.""-S. J. Gould"
26,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12788229-christopher,5," With the return of ""race science"", yet again, this book is as relevant now as when it was first published. Gould was wrong that Charles Murray's argument would not make it to the twenty-first century, thanks to people like Sam Harris, but was fortunately right about everything else. He even predicted what arguments against his book people would make and preemptively debunked them. He said that he did this because it would be a good measure to see which of his critics actually read his book. Read his introduction and then read the one star reviews on Goodreads if you want to have a good laugh.  There has been an active movement to dismiss Gould since his death, because people know that he could no longer defend himself. One example is there have been two studies that measured Samuel Morton's skulls again to try and claim that Gould was biased and had slandered Morton. Here is the problem with these studies. 1. They didn't measure all the skulls, just a very small portion of them. 2. Gould never claimed that Morton's measurements were off, which is why he never measured the skulls himself. He just assumed that Morton's numbers were accurate. 3. Gould's main argument against Morton is that he used uneven sample sizes, threw out numbers that hurt the result he wanted and made other methodological ""errors"" all of which favored the idea that whites had bigger skulls. Gould shows that even if all Morton's numbers were correct, if you statistically correct for his unequal sampling you get a different result. 4. Gould also questions the whole assumption that brain size is correlated to intelligence, though he admits some studies show a small correlation, which he attributes to environmental factors like better nutrition.  This book is a very rigorous and well researched history of racist pseudoscience and its shortcomings. The later section where Gould questions factor analysis is more complex, but still well argued and researched. The parts added to this later addition are a bit redundant. What is most stunning about this book is how it refutes the arguments of people who came after it was written, but as Gould points out, the basic argument has changed very little, its just the details that are changed. Its always been bunk though, and will continue to be bunk. "
27,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42839452-kim-hoag,5,"The rot of the need to be superior (“biological paternalism”) has always been pervasive and accepted and has destroyed many. How it has been subsumed into the educational, religious, and political systems—injected into the bloodstreams of nations—is the topic of this book. To purposefully mismeasure a racial group in order to rank and dismiss them has an insidious history which Gould details clearly. I thought I'd be bored with the statistics, measurements, and factor analyses but the themes of having to be vigilant as well as how subtle prejudice really is are not only consistently laid out but also constantly displayed and proven. And, yes, some of the middle chapter's math did throw me, but not far off the track. Gould's depth of erudition and passion flow through his observations. Quoting Shakespeare and T.H. White his thoughts are worthy of contemplation: “Few arguments are more dangerous as those that feel right but cannot be justified”; “If the misery of our poor be caused not by the laws of nature, but by our institutions, great is our sin”. Today, within these racist cross-winds, this book is still timely."
28,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/113865150-reece-carter,4,"Wowza. What a book. Working in a cognitive lab, this book seemed extremely relevant. Gould tells the history of psychology's attempts to understand and measure intelligence. But perhaps even more important than that, Gould teaches us a lesson in measuring our faith in science. As much as we like to think that science is the pinnacle of objectivity, all the science we do is inherently steeped in culture -- a fact that influences it inevitably. Gould weaves a brilliant tale of how racism, nationalism, and prejudice create self fulfilling interpretations of otherwise objective numbers. We learn to be careful with our interpretations and to always scrutinize both science and ourselves to ensure the most objective results. Gould effectively presents the failures of biological determinism and urges us not to fall into the same traps as our forefathers. "

He makes complex scientific and mathematical ideas simple, understandable, and enjoyable to read.Well worth a read."
30,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1637903-curtis,2,"I started reading this book based a friend's recommendation after a discussion about science and politics. Going into it, I understood it to be two things: 
   An argument against the use of science to ""prove"" preconceived notions, in particular about the supposedly innate cognitive abilities of different races 
  
   A larger look at how it's possible to ""fight science with science"" (my phrase) 
 Given the binary option of saying whether I think Gould is successful in achieving his stated goals, I'd have to say yes. I think that, overall, he compellingly argues that some scientists are disingenuous, or even at times outright deceptive, and use scientific knowledge and techniques to draw unwarranted conclusions that bolster their biases and prejudices. He also shows how a scientist who relies on ""good"" methodology to gather ""objective"" data can still suffer bias, but that such data can, at least, be re-examined later. (""Objectivity must be defined as fair treatment of data, not absence of preference."" [p. 36]) My general criticism of Gould is that as much as he points at other people, he doesn't point at himself. Time after time, he lambastes various scientists for failing to see ""obvious"" problems with their data, techniques, hypotheses, etc. However, Gould has several planks in his own eye.Political Bias: Gould is unequivocally leftist, and it shows. That would be fine, in and of itself, if he followed the same advice that he gives to all the dead scientists he pillories...but alas. In the Introduction to the Revised Edition, Gould says he would respect Charles Murray more if he admitted his conservative bias in The Bell Curve (p. 37-38). To his credit, Gould does discuss his own (politically) liberal history and leanings. However, throughout the book, Gould pokes at political conservatism, making various claims about their motives and intentions with regard to furthering arguments about hereditary intelligence, while completely ignoring similar criticisms of the left. The frequent jibes and potshots at conservatism give the reader a sense of a broad, historical arc in which conservatives, and only conservatives, have tried to foist their ideas on a broader public using (capital-S) Science! There are many places where Gould could equally recriminate leftist ideas, such as when referring to the evils of eugenics or discussing the desire to create a sort of workers' caste system based on ""intelligence."" Whether he disregards such opportunities intentionally or because he is blind to them seems irrelevant, but the fact of his disregard is, ironically, very telling. Disclaimer: I am a libertarian, but I grew up in a (very) conservative home. Perhaps, because of my background, I am more attuned to criticism against conservatism than other political ideas. If I am misstating Gould's lack of criticism of the left, I am happy to be corrected in the comments to my review.Factual squishiness: Gould is a good story teller, but after reading some others' critiques about his book, I'm not sure if ""good story"" equals ""good history."" That said, in a 1983 review of the first edition of Mismeasure, Bernard Davis points to some problems with Gould's analysis of various scientific studies — problems like completely ignoring things that would refute Gould's arguments. Other reviews point out problems not just with Gould's history, but with his science as well, such as John B. Carroll's contradiction of Gould's claims related to factor analysis, g and ""reification."" Furthermore is the recent study by Jason E. Lewis et al claiming that Gould was largely wrong in his derision of Morton's skull analysis.Now, I admit that I don't have the scientific or historical chops to know whether Gould or his critics are right. However, I do think there is enough evidence to show that Gould's claims are, at best, overstated. (At worst, they're straw men.) Ultimately, I can't take Gould at his word any more than the other scientists.Final thoughts:The problems outlined above notwithstanding, I do think Gould is somewhat successful in his point about the nature of scientific inquiry. That others can go back and review his claims (and correct them where necessary), despite his biases, seems quite obvious, in fact. However, I disagree with others who have said that this ""larger"" point supersedes the issues prevalent throughout the book. If Gould makes his point, it is ironically, and not intentionally, so. "
31,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1178529-ann,4,"Evolutionary TheoryThe Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay GouldIn The Mismeasure of Man evolutionary biologist, anatomist, and historian of science, Stephen Jay Gould, provides both a historical sketch and scathing critique of the methods and motivations underpinning biological determinism, a theory that “society…is an accurate reflection of biology.” (Gould: 1981:20) Gould critically analyzes two myths: that scientific processes are objective, and that human intelligence is a heritable trait and racially dependent. Gould’s analysis is geared towards addressing the claim “that worth can be assigned to individuals and groups by measuring intelligence as a single quality;” in taking this approach, Gould exposes the scientific shortcomings and political contexts of biological determinist arguments. (Gould 1981:20) Gould debunks the myth of scientific objectivity by exposing certain past scientific practices and theories (polygeny, craniometry, phrenology, recapitulation, hereditarian IQ theory) as scientific racism. He also calls out scientists (Binet, Broca, Burt, Goddard, Morton, Spearman, Terman, Thurstone, and Yerkes, to name a few) for rationalizing prejudices instead of shucking the constraints of their culture. Gould identifies two fallacies which underlie the scientific weaknesses in biological determinism: reification, or “our tendency to convert abstract concepts” (intelligence) “into entities” (quantifiable gray matter), and ranking or hierarchy, which is the “propensity for ordering complex variation as a gradual ascending scale.” (Gould 1981: 24) In presenting his argument in the form of a historical sketch, Gould is able to demonstrate how Victorian era perceptions of inferiority, of non-Europeans, heavily influenced scientific processes, the implications of which are seen in 20th Century cases of immigration, criminology, and education. According to Gould, science needs to be understood as a social phenomenon; as scientists do science, it is a socially embedded activity. In this way, The Mismeasure of Man is a call to arms for scientists to be aware of the impact cultural assumptions have on their work and to challenge colleagues by confronting unquestioned scientific procedures and theories that perpetuate the social constructs of race, class and sexism. This book, however, is clearly not written for scientists, but instead the lay person. While Gould’s work certainly illustrates that we should all be skeptical and not assume that science is neutral, it should be pointed out that his claims are not based on empirical research, but instead a general analysis of historical records. While I’m sure that most would agree with the opinions he expresses in this work, without empirical data, his assertions are just that - opinions. Further, his ruthless and scathing arguments are more rhetorical than empirical, and his statistical analysis, which is clearly skewed by obsolete data, leaves the work to be somewhat ironical in nature. None the less, Gould’s work is highly enlightening. For example, I was unaware that eugenics programs in the United States were discontinued as a means to discredit Hitler, not in support of an underlying American egalitarian spirit. Within the realms of anthropology and archaeology, ranking and hierarchy permeate numerous past theoretical perspectives, and teleological notions of progress are a prevalent within evolutionary thought. Racial determinism was rampant among early evolutionists, such as Morgan, Tylor, and Waitz. In some way Gould has done for biological determinism in biology what Boas did for evolutionism in anthropology. "
32,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92145325-benjamin-chambers,5,"Stephen Jay Gould’s The Mismeasure of Man is, at its simplest level, a brief history of pseudoscientific racism and exposition of its fundamental fallacies.On a broader level, pseudoscientific racism is but one form of a larger ideology that Gould critiques, which he calls biological determinism. He summarizes it thusly: “The general argument may be called biological determinism. It holds that shared behavioral norms, and the social and economic differences between human groups – primarily races, classes, and sexes – arise from inherited, inborn distinctions and that society, in this sense, is an accurate reflection of biology” [Gould’s italics] (52).Pseudoscientific racism, then, is a subset of biological determinism, the branch in which the human groups under consideration are races. As biodeterminism’s most popular and virulent form, Gould devotes the bulk of his book to pseudoscientific racism. Importantly, a key takeaway is that, for biodeterminist arguments, race, class, and sex are interchangeable categories. In other words, the fallacious arguments used to justify racial oppression are the same as those used to justify class and sexual oppression. For example, the biodeterminist arguments which assert the inferiority of blacks are the same, almost verbatim, as those which assert the inferiority of the poor.Gould acknowledges the breadth of biological determinism and recognizes the impossibility of adequately covering such a big idea in such a small book. So, he further narrows his thesis to a specific kind of biodeterminism, one Gould believes is the strongest and most pernicious, i.e. intelligence quantification. As Gould states: “The Mismeasure of Man treats one particular form of quantified claim about the ranking of human groups: the argument that intelligence can be meaningfully abstracted as a single number capable of ranking all people on a linear scale of intrinsic and unalterable mental worth” [Gould’s italics] (20).Gould exposes the deep-seated fallacies that undergird biological determinism’s every historical incarnation. The book is neatly divided into two parts: the first covers the old-school pseudoscientific racism of the 19th century, specifically craniology; and the second covers 20th century mental testing, specifically IQ. As previously stated, the unifying theme across this sordid history is that of the quantification of intelligence. Or as Gould states: “This book discusses, in historical perspective, a principle theme within biological determinism: the claim that worth can be assigned to individuals and groups by measuring intelligence as a single quantity. Two major sources have supported this theme: craniometry (or the measurement of the skull) and certain styles of psychological testing” [Gould’s italics] (52).Gould summarizes his ultimate thesis as such: “This book, then, is about the abstraction of intelligence as a single entity, its location within the brain, its quantification as one number for each individual, and the use of these numbers to rank people in a single series of worthiness, invariably to find that oppressed and disadvantaged groups – races, classes, sexes – are innately inferior and deserve their status” (56-7).After perusing the historical record and scrutinizing biological determinism’s eminent figures and their foundational research, Gould concludes “that determinist arguments for ranking people according to a single scale of intelligence, no matter how numerically sophisticated, have recorded little more than social prejudice” (60). Proponents of biodeterminism have held preconceived conclusions informed by prejudice, not the facts. They have only interpreted the facts in a manner congenial to those preferred conclusions. Once the façade of impartiality is removed and the data evaluated objectively, it is evident that biological determinism is nothing more than an ignominious attempt at the “rationalization of the social order” (104). Such a revelation – that intellectuals harbor prejudice reflective of their class position and conduct their research in a way that reinforces rather than challenges said prejudices – is not surprising and further substantiates Noam Chomsky’s claim that “the intellectual tradition is one of servility to power.”Biological determinism is a belief that biological composition, and not social environment, determines, and thus can be used to accurately predict, individual and social outcomes. It holds that any social hierarchy is an accurate representation of its constituent members’ intrinsic worth and potential capability. It thus assumes and asserts that the social hierarchy in question is legitimate. Biodeterminism’s central claim is that societal inequalities reflect natural inequalities, i.e. biology determines sociology. As Gould puts it: “Biological determinism is, in its essence, a theory of limits. It takes the current status of groups as a measure of where they should and must be” [Gould’s italics] (60).Ultimately though, biological determinism is not a scientific conclusion derived form the objective evaluation of empirical evidence, but a preconceived and self-serving rationale by powerful and privileged groups for their immoral and unjust treatment of powerless and underprivileged groups, e.g. blacks, indigenous peoples, poor workers, and women. Biodeterminism is an ideological weapon used to justify class, racial, and sexual oppression. Dutch astronomer and communist Antonie Pannekoek discerned its social utility and eternal recurrence as an instrument of elite rule when he said: “It is not for the first time that a ruling class tries to explain, and so to perpetuate, its rule as the consequences of an inborn difference between two kinds of people, one destined by nature to ride, the other to be ridden.”This doctrine of genetic predestination serves an exculpatory function. French Enlightenment thinker Condorcet recognized this fact, accusing biological determinists of “making nature herself an accomplice in the crime of political inequality” (53). By naturalizing unequal social arrangements, biodeterminism exonerates the holders and enforcers of power. It tries to excise from the collective conscious the historical creation and maintenance of social institutions and the artificial – not natural – forces which shape society. Biodeterminism’s erasure of social structures grants the very architects of injustice the privilege of issuing Panglossian decrees that we live in the best of all possible worlds given our biological constitutions. Any attempt to change the status quo is thus condemned as a revolt against nature that can only have cataclysmic consequences.Gould demonstrates how the belief in biological determinism is culturally instilled and accepted a priori, not an a posteriori conclusion reached from the impartial evaluation of data. He demonstrates how preferred conclusions unconsciously shape the asking of questions and interpretation of data. Because biodeterminism is the initial hypothesis and congenial to elite predilections, “there has been a tendency to assume biological causation without question, and to accept social explanations only under the duress of a siege of irresistible evidence” as Swedish sociologist Gunnar Myrdal put it (53). In short, it bears repeating, “that determinist arguments for ranking people according to a single scale of intelligence, no matter how numerically sophisticated, have recorded little more than social prejudice” (60)."
33,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1637858-dave-maddock,4,"Though the expanded second edition is marketed as a ""refutation of the argument of The Bell Curve,"" Mismeasure was written first. Not having read The Bell Curve, I skipped the ~25 page addendum that directly responds to it. It's only fair to read Curve itself before attacks of it, but frankly, it is unlikely I will ever do so.Gould builds a compelling case against various historical and contemporary scientific arguments for biological determinism. Mismeasure has been criticized as a leftist polemic and not wholly without cause. For example, Gould takes some potshots at conservative misuse of such theories while greatly overlooking the large role the political left has played in eugenics programs, etc. However, after we've given Stephen his paddling for that sin, it remains to address the substance of his argument. At the heart of which is the simple observation that for all the lip service paid to experiment by ghosts-of-biological-determinism-past, no one has tried very hard to control for the plethora of confounding environmental factors which, when therefore improperly included in experiments hoping to measure only innate qualities, threaten to insidiously justify the status quo. Given that such science is not being done in a vacuum (virtually everyone involved left, right, or center has a policy agenda they were/are pushing), it is incumbent upon them to follow as much as possible what I call Feynman's first principle:The first principle [of science] is that you must not fool yourself--and you are the easiest person to fool.At the very least, Gould has shown us how deficient determinists have been in this regard."
34,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4771466-john-martindale,3,"Well, I do think the book could have handled a little more editing; parts were pretty dragged out, boring and repetitive. I personally don't have the knowledge to verify what Gould wrote, on Wikipedia there is a fair amount of criticism; claiming he cherry picked the data and had an obvious political agenda and that he made straw-men and then went about knocking them down. Hopefully this isn't the case. I definitely share Gould's disgust of eugenics and genetic determinism, if these scientist promoted what he claimed they did, they do need to be opposed. Now I didn't care for some of the political tone throughout the book, one gets the subtle impression every now and then that Gould believed the ridiculous notion that conservatives on the whole are racist and want to starve the poor and think everyone's intelligences are fixed.The main thing I took away from the book is; scientist are all to human. If it is true that these renown scientist did such shoddy work and despite of this, their ""research"" was widely accepted and influenced political policy, we have good reason to wonder about what is passed off today as objective and scientific fact (Global warming comes to mind). When political and personal biases are brought into the mix, science can't be fully trustedThe book answered a historical question for me, that being why America turned away most of the Jews trying immigrate before and during WWII. If what Gould wrote is true, then indeed, bad science, in this case, influenced political law which then resulted in millions of Jews wanting to flee sure death being refused entrance. All of this because of dubious IQ tests claiming that most Jews were morons and couldn't be allowed to pollute the American Caucasians who were already in such disasterly peril because of the black population."

All those scientists, they were SURE one could reduce a human to one number.. And threading through the book is the scary feature of the most pre WWII societies - arrogant totalitarian denial of personhood and freedom of choice to the individuals, colored with a rich dose of ""social darwinism"". It is so sad to think that all the horrible practices of eugenics and sterilization of ""undesirable society members"" have ONLY stopped after the tragedy of WWII and Holocaust.On the scientific side, there is a nice discussion of uses and limits of factor analysis, that (turns out!) has been invented to make sense of the different tests such as IQ. Gould is demonstrating how ""general intelligence factor"" is dependent on the coordinate system used for the factor analysis - and can be either a major parameter revealed in the tests, or disappears almost entirely when another coordinate system is chosen - the one stressing specific abilities such as verbal and math.On a different note, most Charlie Chaplin movies were filmed at the same time in the same country and helped identify and empathise with exactly those characters that social darwinists of the time would probably recommend sterilising. I'm not sure, but I want to think that Chaplin movies have also contributed to re-humanisation of the society and acceptance of human rights that happened later. "
36,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4489591-matt,3,"This was a fascinating but frustrating look at two flawed methods of understanding and quantifying human intelligence: craniometry and intelligence testing. I was sure I'd mostly skim the first section and be far more invested in the chapters on testing, but the opposite was true. His thorough takedown of craniometry was revealing more for racially-charged quotations from the 18th and 19th centuries than the analysis of fraud and biases in measuring, averaging and reporting capacities of skulls. The second half of the book was a much tougher slog for this layman, specifically because of some in-depth discussion of factor analysis. I hope you're up on your statistics, graphing and trigonometry because otherwise it's a dense thicket of axes, rotations and primary/secondary vectors. There are still interesting factoids and quotations, but it's slow going and I'm not sure how useful any of it was in aiding understanding of the topic.Ultimately, I think I'm more concerned by the personal idiosyncrasies of the author. For example, he is obviously invested in the topic and writes with passion and forcefulness, but his depictions of some of the major figures borders on gleeful character assassination. He also has a penchant for odd moments of metaphor and poetry, thrown with no preamble into a cut-and-dried paragraph on the specifics of averaging test scores. It may be that I'm unused to science-for-the-layman the late 70’s way, but it strikes me as an odd and problematic book. It zigs where I was expecting zags, then tops it off with a symbolic paean to Babe Ruth, Bach, Shakespeare and human social evolution in contrast to biological evolution.

It points out the error of reducing intelligence into a single value, of attributing intelligence solely to either nature or nurture, and of putting meaning in results grouped by arbitrary qualities such as skin color.In today's world, none of these ideas are revolutionary. I think anyone who's spent time reading up science articles on the internet would know that, of course, it is silly to reduce intelligence to a single value or to think it is caused only by genes or only by the environment.What really struck me in this book was the extent to which some scientists -- and note that these are learned and respected men of their time -- could ignore and even twist facts in favor of their biases. It is embarrassing that human studies ever went through such a period, but also encouraging because no one in their right mind today would suggest that a group of people is more intelligent than another simply because of race or gender.It does make me wonder: had I been born during the time when eugenics was the fashionable topic, as a white man to a relatively well off family, would I believe the crap some of those biased studies are suggesting? I certainly hope not, but to be honest, I wouldn't know."

Like a great vintage wine, this classic work in the history of science has aged well; Gould's additional essays, most notably his devastatingly effective critique of ""The Bell Curve"", have only enhanced this fine book's virtues. ""The Mismeasure of Man"" opens with an excellent survey of questionable science done to support racist views of 19th Century American and European anthropologists. It proceeds with the origins of IQ testing and how it inevitably led to biased testing against those not of Northern European heritage in the United States as well as in Europe. Most noteworthy is Gould's extensive coverage of scientific fraud in psychology and the development of psychometrics (statistics used in psychological testing). Indeed, his account of the origins and development of the sophisticated multivariate statistical method known as factor analysis is the finest I have read. All of this is told in vivid, often humorous, prose which ranks among Gould's finest writing.

I never really thought about the origin of statistical tests before, and I worked a lot with principal components as a graduate student. I also liked how Gould mentions how factor analysis is most appropriately used at the frontiers of science, when there is little theoretical framework to shape the questions and analysis. It makes so much sense, but I had never really formulated it in my mind in this way.I know that Gould has his own share of biases that led to some cherry-picking and some biased remeasurements of his own.

It is a very thorough analysis of analysis gone wrong and the social implications associated with doing so. The need to measure IQ became warped throughout the ages and served two miserable purposes of which become readily apparent in the book. First, poorly designed IQ tests became the basis of years of racism justified under the onus of Darwinian right. It was disturbing to witness that such bias still exists today within the workplace/civilization, etc.Second, it suggests that testing as a practice is in fact capping certain individuals on what they believe their own potential is. I like that the new dialogue within intelligence has veered toward ""Mindset"" or the power of the growth oriented individual.

He does so not only to shame the bigots of the past-- including some choicely offensive quotes from Actual Beloved American Founding Fathers-- but also to shine a light on the fallibility of humans more generally. That is, despite all the progress that a rich cultural and social milieu has granted us, we must must MUST all strive to be cognizant of our biases, lest we continually repeat the same errors of history and force injustice upon the same unlucky minorities.

More controversially, The Bell Curve further delved into the IQ differences, exhibited through testing, in race.Gould tries to debunk IQ testing and it's corollary conclusions by pointing out how politicized and racist IQ testing has been in the past.Did this disprove ""The Bell Curve""'s thesis?

The majority of thinkers he attacks have long since been discredited, and their research only remembered by science historians. When he attacks Charles Murray et al, he actually is questioning what is going on the present intellectual sphere.

Gould emphatically rejects that there is any basis for a relationship between race and IQ (or any other measure of intelligence) despite repeated, biased efforts to find one.

55,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2447514-david-ozab,5,"(NOTE: An extensive overview that I originally wrote for an Educational Psychology class. I have trimmed it a bit, but it still runs about 1800 words.)This is a tragic tale, a tale of lost opportunities and destroyed lives: a story of how an elite few held power over others, and validated the continuation of this circumstance through the seemingly objective view of science. In different eras this so called science had different names, polygeny, social Darwinism, and eugenics were the most prominent, but it always served the same purpose. Certain people were superior to others. This superiority was evident in the present divisions of society, could be quantitatively demonstrated through objective science, and must be preserved against any call for reform. To do any less would spell the demise of civilization.Gould’s tale begins with the state of science prior to Darwin. The publication of The Origin of Species is a natural dividing point in the history of biology, just as Copernicus’ heliocentric theory is in the history of astronomy. The two principal camps were the monogenists who believed that different races were “descended from the same Adam,” and the polygenists who held that different races were in fact different species. Both groups justified a common racism in different ways, seeing blacks and Native Americans as either inferior humans, or as other inferior species. No one, of course would dare think that whites would rank anywhere other than the top.It seems appropriate that the United States, as the last outpost of slavery in the Western world, would also be a welcome home to polygeny. Louis Agassiz was the principal theorist in the field. Born in Switzerland, he already held a high reputation before immigrating to America. As a devout creationist, who lived long enough to be the “major scientific opponent to evolution,” (p 43) Agassiz was not an easy convert to polygeny. It took his own personal revulsion to blacks upon first encountering them to convince him. Though Agassiz supported legal equality he lectured at length on the dangers of mixing races. Agassiz never conducted experiments to support his claims, yet won a wide following.The principal experimental scientist of polygeny was Samuel George Morton. He had a reputation as a great objectivist, and it was his experiments that, for a short time, lent support to Agassiz’s theories. Morton was a practitioner of craniometry, the long debunked study of the human skull. In two separate, and highly regarded studies, Crania Americana, and Crania Aegyptica, he attempted to demonstrate the differences in intelligence between whites, blacks, and Native Americans through the measurement of cranial capacity. Putting aside for the moment the total disrepute into which craniometry fell around the turn of the century, Gould examines the data and demonstrates all kinds of fudging and finagling. These acts were obviously unconscious on Morton’s part; otherwise he would not have published his findings, yet they supported his apriori convictions. Numbers were rounded in opportune ways, skulls that didn’t fit Morton’s hypothesis were eliminated as anomalies, while others that were equally “anomalous” were included if they helped him to reach his preconceived conclusion.Evolutionary theory changed the terms of the debate, but the debate itself continued. Now the argument was over the distance of a common ancestor, and whether or not races were close enough to be part of the same species, or far apart enough to be considered separately. Again, the one point not in dispute was the superiority of whites. Craniology reached its height in the second half of the nineteenth century mirroring the growing appeal of quantification in the sciences. Disciplines were judged more and more by a level of perceived objectivity demonstrated by a preponderance of measurement.Paul Broca was the principal figure during the peak of craniology. His studies went far beyond those of Morton, but had the same goal, to prove the superiority of the white, European male. He shared one other trait with Morton, as with all the researchers covered, he began with his conclusions, and then followed a trail of facts in a circle until he came back to prior conclusions. Broca’s research was far more substantial than Morton’s and he produced far more reliable facts, but he subsequently, and unconsciously, manipulated his facts to support his apriori beliefs. The central error of craniology was that skull size, and later brain size, was a measurement of intelligence. Broca and his followers tried to measure a quantity that didn’t exist; with a method that was a more reliable measure of height. Broca never allowed that a woman’s brain is on average smaller than a man due to a difference in stature. He also included measurements of groups that are, on average, shorter than Europeans, such as pygmies, Eskimos, and Peruvian Indians, to support his data. He only recognized the possible differences in height when they contradicted him. For example, when confronted with German brains that were, on average, larger than French brains, he defended his Gaulic brethren by pointing out the obvious, Germans are, on average, taller then the French, therefore any difference must be attributable to height not intelligence.The demise of craniology at the turn of the century did not mean the demise of prejudice. Modern bigotry required modern methods. This is where the book reaches the modern, and still present, error of hereditary intelligence. Alfred Binet was the unwilling father of this new school, and the rampant misuse of his methods formed a foundation for eugenics, social Darwinism and modern racism that persists to this day. Binet began with craniology, but soon realized its core fallacies. Instead he moved on to the new equivalent of craniology, mental testing. Binet’s approach was to combine a wide variety of tests in order to gain an average intellectual level, which some called “mental age.” This number was divided by chronological age to give the resultant “intelligence quotient” or IQ. For simplicity the number was multiplied by 100, therefore equality between mental and chronological age produced an average of 100. Binet, however, reminded all that intelligence “is not a single, scalable thing like height.” (p 151) Furthermore, he conceived of his test as a means of identifying children in need of remedial help. He feared, however, that IQ might be used as an excuse for unloading troubled children. Unfortunately for so many, Binet’s warnings went unheeded while his fears were soon fulfilled.A short list of those who dismantled Binet’s intentions is also a list of the some of the most prominent names in educational psychology. H. H. Goddard identified the moron. They were not so feeble-minded as to warrant obvious care, they could feed themselves, dress themselves, but still posed a threat as long as they could fully participate in society (vote) and were allowed to reproduce. After all intelligence was hereditary according to Goddard, and while highly intelligent (i.e. well off) parents might occasionally produce an unfortunate offspring on occasion (i.e. a mildly retarded or learning disabled child), morons (actually the poor and uneducated) would only breed more morons (also poor and uneducated). Goddard went further, screening new immigrants, most of whom could not speak any English, to prevent the introduction of new morons into society. This was the first step toward the highly restrictive Immigration Restriction Act of 1924.Lewis Terman continued Goddard’s work in the mass marketing of the Stanford-Binet test and the growing popular belief in innate IQ. R. M. Yerkes applied these tests to the Army in 1915, in a manner so shoddy that none of the results can be taken seriously. (In an interesting side experiment, Gould gave these same tests to one of his college classes, obtaining similarly useless results) The political consequences of Yerkes results were catastrophic. He found an average mental age of thirteen among recruits, which he presumed represented a random sample of the population, and wondered if democracy could survive an electorate of near morons. C. C. Brigham, one of Yerkes’ followers, published a book titled A Study of American Intelligence. This was the call for social action, and Congress responded within a year. Gould continues with the tale of Sir Cyril Burt, who was the official psychologist of the London City Council for twenty years. Burt is an interesting figure for two reasons. The first was his own mental instability that lead him later in life to falsify data, and make outrageous claims. The second, though, is much more illuminating. Gould engages in an intensive study of factor analysis that, due to considerations of space, I will not repeat here. Through this examination, however, Gould unveils what he calls “the real error of Cyril Burt.” Through factor analysis Charles Spearman, Burt’s predecessor at University College, London, had found a principal correlation that he called “g.” Both Spearman and Burt considered “g” to be evidence of a single quantifiable mental property called “intelligence.” All the unintentional errors of both, as well as Burt’s later falsifications, grow from this first error. Gould demonstrates that correlation does not mean cause:“It is not even true that intense correlations are more likely to represent cause than weak ones, for the correlation of my age with the price of gasoline is nearly 1.0.”Gould concludes his book on a positive note. He talks about “debunking as a positive science,” arguing that disproof is the basis of good science as long as it replaces flawed ideas with better ones, not old prejudices with different ones. He talks about the potential of human biology, and ends with a quote from T.H White’s novel The Once and Future King. In the book, each of the animals comes before God as an embryo. God offers all of them any additions they desire. The lion chooses claws and sharp teeth, the deer chooses antlers and hooves, and this continues until the human approaches and says the following:“Please God, I think you made me in the shape which I now have for reasons best known to Yourself and that it would be rude to change. If I am to have my choice, I will stay as I am. I will not alter any of the parts which you gave me . . .”To which God replied: ”Well done . . . (you are) the only one who has guessed Our riddle . . . You will look like an embryo ‘till they bury you but all others will be embryos before your might. Eternally undeveloped, you will always remain potential in our image . . .”"
56,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,3,"This book is a demolition job of much of the previous work conducted on inherent intelligence and IQ testing. Gould chooses to focus his criticism not on cases of overt fraud and data manipulation, but on the far more interesting cases in which scientists thought they were doing good work and yet cultural bias insidiously seeped in. If Gould had focused on cases of overt manipulation this book would have read as gossipy and would not have been applicable decades later, which I think is one of the major strengths of the book. Also, personally as a scientist, I found insidious bias more relatable than overt fraud, since we’re all subject to that. Also, while Gould spends a fair amount of time in the beginning of the book discussing early, crude craniometry studies (which are quite easy to criticize and are no longer taken very seriously), he actually spends the majority of the book discussing studies of general intelligence conducted in the twentieth century (notably Spearman’s g factor), which continue to have an impact on how we view intelligence today. I really respect him for that. He does quite a good job making the book accessible to a general audience as well. For example, his explanation that correlation does not imply causation, and that the vast majority of correlations are noncausal. Additionally, that the strength of a correlation does not make it more likely that a causal relationship exists. I thought the writing was clear and well planned. I also loved the emphasis on scientific “fact” still being subject to cultural bias. There is hard data, but then the analysis and interpretation of that data is colored by culture, the knowledge of statistics at the time etc. This book focuses on how the hereditarian school of thinking when applied to intelligence, is flawed because of preconceived notions coloring the available data, but the general principle can be applied to scientific investigation in general. The section on factor analysis was to me the most interesting section of the book, and based on a pretty self-congratulatory foreword by Gould himself at the beginning of this edition of the book, his favorite part as well. It seemed to me that Gould really vilified factor analysis, regarding it as little better than a tool to support a priori often racist ideas about innate mental capacity. But factor analysis has been used extensively in a variety of legitimate scientific investigations. I think Gould is really throwing out the baby with the bathwater on this one. It’s a powerful tool that happens to have been misused a lot in a particular field of study. While factor analysis was critical for Spearman to establish his “g” (a problematic construct of intelligence, especially as it deemphasizes the effects of training and cultural background on intelligence according to Gould), it is not itself a fallacious method of investigation. However, this book is exhaustive (read: exhausting). It was hard for me to rate this book because I think Gould did a really thorough job with his chosen subject, I just found that it got quite tedious in many of the chapters. As a reference book, it’s a good history of the evolution of how we think about intelligence. As a popular science book to read from cover to cover, as I treated it, I found that it fell a bit flat. He meticulously re-examines the data of several studies (like Samuel Morton’s cranial capacity studies between races conducted in the mid 1800’s). He also analyzes several intelligence tests, sometimes question by question. I think this book would read better in a much abridged version, with separate indexed supplements at the end including the detailed reanalysis etc. "

Other than this however, Brain measurements and factor analysis: that seems to be 50% of this book. The strength of this book is the fact that Gould actually checks the math of historical studies, (something everyone else just takes for granted), and finds it lacking. This in itself is incredible, and in my mind speaks to the replicability crisis facing science as a whole. According to Gould, Failure to use factor analysis (analyzing a variety of factors to see what percentage of cause they account for) is the main problem with the bell curve and other racially biased studies. Discounting this measure allows these studies to misconstrue an IQ with general intelligence, or ""G"". This is almost laughable, as it almost the definition of conflating correlation with causation. Thats the core of the issue here, that as long as there are other reasonable answers (or even reasonable doubt) to the presence of intelligence other than heritability, then it is ridiculous to act as if heritability is the only explanatory factor in intelligence. The other main explanatory option is, of course, education, with whom there is almost a one-to-one correlation with success on intelligence tests, and yet is often entirely ignored. The search for 'G' is almost inherently flawed, as the search is bounded by the belief that general intelligence firstly exists, and secondly, has a single cause, in this case, heredity. This is so astounding that it would beggar belief if you could somehow forget about the underlying motivation and perhaps unconscious bias: racism. I've tried, and I don't think I see another options that explains the history of mental testing so well. I have not yet read the bell curve, but can very easily see the motivations that may have led to its inception, both political and ideological. I will eventually read it for myself, but must confess its size and aspiration intimidate me slightly. Below is what I found to be Gould's most salient point:“Errors of reductionism and biodeterminism take over in such silly statements as “Intelligence is 60 percent genetic and 40 percent environmental.” A 60 percent (or whatever) “heritability” for intelligence means no such thing. We shall not get this issue straight until we realize that the “interactionism” we all accept does not permit such statements as “Trait x is 29 percent environmental and 71 percent genetic.” When causative factors (more than two, by the way) interact so complexly, and throughout growth, to produce an intricate adult being, we cannot, in principle, parse that being’s behavior into quantitative percentages of remote root causes. The adult being is an emergent entity who must be understood at his own level and in his own totality. The truly salient issues are malleability and flexibility, not fallacious parsing by percentages. A trait may be 90 percent heritable, yet entirely malleable.”"

Or put another way, it explores the stinking swamp of race science with hopes of getting people to notice the stench.I've not previously delved into the history of race science and hereditarianism. I was aware that it was a thing, that it keeps raising its ugly head every few years (Human Biodiversity - HBD - is a recent version you may have heard of), and that it pollutes an entire corner of psychology. As such, this book was enlightening and also disheartening. It reinforced just how a priori the entire field is and why it will continue to be popular.The first time I became aware that IQ testing wasn't actually doing what the marketing claims would have you believe was in high school. My brother was very intent on ""raising his IQ"" by studying for IQ tests. Well you might ask, how can you improve your test score on something that is meant to measure something innate? Over the years I've read several papers discussing factors that impact test scores (stress, hunger, nutrition levels, tiredness, sleep deprivation, etc) and realised that these intelligence tests aren't measuring what some would claim. And worse, often the results are interpreted in almost exactly the opposite of what they should be (i.e. a poor test result is probably more an indicator of some discriminatory factor, like attending an underfunded school, than of being stupid).So it is well worth reading this book to understand how fraught this field is with literal white supremacists and eugenicists (see my comments below). It isn't an easy read but is relatively accessible to most people who give it the time required.Some related papers:What IQ Tests TestDoes IQ Really Predict Job Performance?Thoughts during reading:Have just gotten to the bit about G and Factor Analysis. I'm passingly familiar with principal components analysis, a technique similar in some ways to Factor Analysis, and largely agree with what Gould is saying. It is very easy to not understand what the principal components are actually showing you, let alone what that correlation means. The first thing you learn in statistics is that correlation doesn't equal causation and something about storks bringing babies.But this rabbit hole goes deeper still.I decided to do a quick bit of lateral reading to find some more on G and Factor Analysis. I didn't get past the former's Wikipedia page. Just about every reference was from a known white supremacist (Jensen being particularly prominent as a primary source). Makes it a tad hard to take the field seriously, and hard to find decent research when a jumping-off point like Wikipedia is swamped in BS.Of course, the rabbit hole goes deeper again.Another of the people referenced is Richard Lynn (a white supremacist). He and his protege, Emil Kirkegaard (a eugenicist and all-round nasty POS), run a bunch of pseudojournals and a fake research group (Ulster Institute for Social Research) that is all basically a front for white supremacist money to generate pseudoscience. Fun fact: Kirkegaard's most cited paper has pretty much only been cited by him, fifty-nine times. Thankfully the mainstream doesn't take these guys seriously anymore, but they have tendrils, as can be seen by Lynn (and other white supremacists) being referenced on the Wikipedia page.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_facto...https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Mankind...https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Emil_Ki...https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Richard..."
59,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18216012-daniel-cunningham,3,"This book is frustratingly hard to rate.On the one hand it disturbingly documents the history of ""scientific"" racism/prejudice re: temperament/intelligence/etc.On the other hand it is frustratingly out of date, even as a historical source; pages and pages are used to 'disprove' e.g. craniology or the validity/goodness of forced sterilization which presumably no one believes in anymore, outside of some kooks who are not going to read this book.On the one hand it documents the invalid attempts to 'prove' the existence and measurement of g by factor analysis and testing done in the 1910's, and the role of this proof of the supposed racial inferiority of e.g. blacks to justify the... racial inferiority of blacks.On the other hand, the book doesn't address more recent research on the heritability of g (than the early 1900's!) or non-racial/racist dimensions of this (e.g. Gould leaves the unwary reader with the impression that all research on heritability is race/racism or class based.)On the one hand a questioning of (some aspects of) g, heritability of g, evolutionary/social psychology/biology is given (this is the argument/question of the existence of modules/a multitude of evolved behaviors, for those who are at least somewhat familiar with these debates.)On the other hand, Gould's answer is literally that the mind is like a general purpose computer (he uses this as an analogy at one point, but then also states twice that the mind is a 'general' thinking device, which is how it can so adaptably implement different cultures.) But this is problematic, to say the least, if there is no such thing as general intelligence.All in all, a passionate argument against racism, including the (highly, highly likely to be) invalid claim that races are separable by intelligence/IQ/g/etc. But far from perfect and showing its age quite a bit."
60,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1216728-sophia,5,"This book is very well written, well organized, and well researched. It is a thorough investigation into the most widespread ""scientific"" attempts to justify social inequality based on hereditary intelligence. Even just presenting the historical content is enough for a modern mind to see where these pasts scientists went wrong, and how they were so blinded by the mindset of the time that they made mistakes that they themselves would critisize in others when it came to less politically charged topics.Reading this book makes your stomach turn for two reasons: it describes the prejudice, racism and bigotry of historical figures at levels we don't even represent in movies anymore; and it makes you wonder if there is anything that you are THAT wrog about as they were. The moral of the story can be identified as the inability of scientists to maintain rigor when their own prejudices aren't explicitly acknowledged and dealt with systematically. Maybe the moral for a non scientist would really be: dont trust scientists to be unbiased. Which is the same thing really.To be fair I must acknowledge that I found there to be too much of the same information in this book. As the author points out, this insistence on hereditarianism stems from a recurring mistakes and misconceptions, but as a reader, it gets a bit tedious after a while. While historically valuable, I also found there was an exessive use of excerpts from the original authors. Some were too vile to read, most just make you cringe. That being said, I think everyone should try to read 1 chapter of this book, whichever chapter speaks to you most. The message will be in there, the historical perspective illuminating. "
61,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7456449-shane,3,"I appreciate the overall arc and I found the introduction and conclusion to be exemplars of argument. However, I was quickly bored by several of the chapters that attacked old research that few continue to support as solid science. Gould wanted to create a timeless piece of scholarship by avoiding contemporary arguments. He could have written a shorter (and more readable) book by skipping his assault on the numbers, calculations, and data accumulated by these dead scholars and simply attacked their assumptions and conclusions. The assumptions and conclusions of determinists are where the real danger exists - not their measurements.In particular, I appreciated Gould's distinction between the slow evolution of genetic Darwinism and the much faster social evolution that follows a more Lamarckian model (not Lamarck's actual argument). Darwinism occurs over millions of years and has not differentiated humans in any appreciable way. Humans are highly adaptable and responsive to conditions. Lamarckian social evolution is highly variable, reversable, and responsible for nearly all observable variation among humans."

It demonstrates how inventions intended for the good of humankind - underlying reasons behind the development of IQ testing to aid and support those with difficulties - is turned upside down by the charlatans of science for their own political and social determinism. Step by step, the brilliant Dr. Gould, lays bare the defects in the conclusions by a line of so-called politicians and pseudo-scientist. The list goes on and on until the present day and how these theories are put forth as lost hope for certain groups of people who need care, support and some human dignity. These wicked theories have been and are still being propounded by so-called Christian conservatives (not sure what that means) to support tax cuts for the rich and the destruction of supports built to assist those with disabilities and lower income to live a modicum of life.Quoting Darwin, “if the misery of our poor be caused not by the laws of nature, but by our institutions, great is our sin”. The quote sums it all."

This is the real lesson I drew from the book. As a Marine Biology major and an Atheist, I have noticed that many of us truly feel that science is automatically self-correcting. As Gould points out, this is not always the case. Far too often we ignore the mistakes of the past and subsequently perpetuate them.The book is considered a refutation of the so-called science of The Bell Curve and I suppose it does this, but mainly it is a cautionary (if long) tale of just how influential our personal biases and arrogance can be on our science. It is a lesson that bears repeating because it is obvious that many of us have yet to learn it."
64,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91468394-annelie,3,"This book is great and so thoroughly done! I wouldn't recommend it, though, for those who aren't seriously interested in science -- despite the care Gould takes to tell this story, and his wonderful, easy-to-understand writing style, this book was excruciating to get through most of the time. I also found myself disappointed by Gould's lack of connection from hereditarian ideology and the expansion of the incarceration system, which systematically prepares black children for lives of degradation and prison and white students for white-collar jobs in which they are in control. A book which connects his findings to modern pedagogical practices would have been better. Nevertheless, this book does dispel one of the most ingrained, insidious beliefs in our society, with such rigor and intelligence that I really do recommend this book to anyone who is willing to tackle it. "
65,0393314251,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65746991-hiro,5,"Gould's exploration fo the history of craniometry was compelling, frightening and somehow darkly funny--the sheer dedication these 19th-century freaks had to skull shape and the mental gymnastics with which they convoluted their results just... amazed me. His discussion of the history of mental testing and IQ also struck me like a comi-tragic bludgeon. I would be laughing if this shit weren't used to justify... you know, genocide. Included in the latter half of the book are charts and figures for lil mathies like me (and other curious nerds). Also included was the instillation of a terrible disappointment that this book is just as relevant today as it was in the '80s, and the lingering dread that it will be relevant for decades to come. "

I would have rather skimmed many of the passages/chapters, especially since much of the laud that this book has received is due to the visual representation of factor analysis. It also made for some odd driving moments when you are listening to a lengthy, racist quotation by a famous scientist with your windows down and then slow down in traffic. I have many times had to stop the book or roll up the windows so neighboring cars don't hear me listening to ""how inferior the lower races are to the whites."" I also felt like I couldn't listen to it with my kids around. It felt like medicine. You need to hear it, but just not all the time or all in one dose. "

A great read; Mr Gould makes the subject interesting for a lay audience, but also has some very good points to make about bias in science. His account of how prejudiced scientists performed flawed experiments and used the data to reinforce their own ridiculous ideas of race and intelligence is one that everyone should read. Some of this flawed data is still being used today to ill effect.I've also read criticism of Gould's book as being selective in its use of data to represent His views; I suppose this is inevitable. Nevertheless, as a book that opened my eyes to the subject, it was a valuable read."

So I have no idea why he chose to abandon science and hurl himself into this ideological abyss called ""Mismeasure"". This is essentially a political mission, lauded by those who refuse to believe there could be such a thing as heritable IQ, even when all credible science supports it. He pulls a contortion act with his data to shore up arguments, real non-science, and he was called out out by researchers in the field who know loads more than he does about this. Skip this and read his other brilliant stuff."

The book starts with the history of skull measurement and moving on to the development and misuse of the ""intelligence test."" Gould uses statistics and a freeview of original documents to unveil the actual internet's of the scientists involved in the history and their missteps or outright dishonesty. The book is also a refutation of the infamous book Bell Curve. In the introduction to the most recent edition of this book, Gould has one of the most complete damning take-downs of another scientist that I have ever heard. I laughed outloud after reading it. The only problem I had was that the book, because of the multiple introductions and afterwards for the multiple versions, seemed repetitive. Gould uses the same analogies in the introductions and other places in the book. It made me wonder at times if I had accidentally repeated a section (I was listening to the audiobook).I still enjoyed the book thoroughly and learned a lot. I would recommend it to anyone looking for arguments against one-size-fits-all styles of testing or education."

The second half of the book is about intelligence testing, measuring IQ using pen and paper tests. Large segments is devoted to explaining the minute mathematical intricacies of factor analysis - a statistical method.

Rather than elevate struggling students, it tends to assign arbitrary limits to the potential of classes of human beings. It is also quite timely in that mental testing led to the inherently racist Immigration Act of 1924, and now a century later we continue to act in a supremely shameful manner toward our fellow man."

I was a proto-internet troll.Then I read this (and met people very different from me, and experienced life outside of school, and...no one thing ever completely changes someone's life.) I realized that ""intelligence"" is not a defined concept, even if I did well on meaningless tests. Moreover, it helped inoculate me against the ""hereditary intelligence"" BS that seems to be the gateway to pseudo-scientific racism. This book is the definitive take-down of that BS.

As it turns out, Gould made a false claim in The Mismeaure of Man; however, that said, Gould still forms a convincing argument that the racial differentiation is still a categorical error. Gould makes an argument that nature should make some of us smarter and some of us not simply on the basis of our racial background is something that has yet to be conclusively proven--and if left at that, would have been sufficient, although I'm quite certain that those who make a practice of not facing their bias regarding race wouldn't be persuaded in any case. Unfortunately, Gould over-extended his argument in the area of phrenology, suggesting the Morton data was biased purposefully when the relationship between intelligence and cranial size is largely found to be spurious when controlling for other influence of body size like sex, height, etc. It was a hill not worth dying upon, and yet, unfortunately, Gould has undermined his credibility by doing so--either purposefully or carelessly.Here is the NYT article that corrects the phrenological assertions Gould makes against Morton for your consideration: https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/14/sc...The underlying PLOS study highlighted in the NYT article above: http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/...There are some other criticisms of Gould's work, some worthy, most not. But again, Gould's argument that we should be wary of a categorical error, one in which a property is ascribed to a thing that could not possibly have that property is still a worthwhile contribution for the reader's consideration. If heritability is proven to be the primary determinant of intelligence--
on the basis of race
, then strong replicated science will find that particular substantive conclusion of racial dominance in intelligence to be acceptable, but as of yet, it has not. On that basis, at least, Gould is still on very solid ground: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/sc..."
