0,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"If I was to sign up for a religion it would really have to offer me much more than the chance to chant “Holy, Holy, Holy” at the right hand of God for the rest of eternity. One of the things that would nearly sway me would be if it gave me a change to do and be all of the things there just isn’t time in one life to be and do. And if I was converted to this particular religion one of the lives that would be on the top of the list would have to be some sort of brain scientist type person – you know, a neurologist or a cognitive scientist, some sort of brain dude.This really was a remarkable book about a remarkable journey into the brain of the author. Not just some crappy journey you might expect from one of those horrid 1950s science documentaries … “Let me take you deep inside my brain…” No, nothing like that. This was a literal journey into his brain. Often it involved him being strapped into some god-awful, whirling machine and having to do things so that analysis could be done on him as he was ‘working’. It is such a great idea for a book and one I would have loved to have come up with – this is precisely the journey I would have liked to have gone on. I could think of nothing better than playing with some of the stuff this guy gets to play with in this book.There is lots of quite difficult material presented, but always in an interesting and engaging way. In fact, it was so well presented and so fascinating that the book just whizzed by. His discussion of our brain on drugs, for example, was quite fascinating. But the most interesting parts of this book are the bits about the placebo effect and whether it ‘really exists’. I have always known that the placebo effect accounts for about 30% of the effectiveness of any medical treatment – but had no idea how I knew this. That this isn’t actually the case – that it really depends on the nature of the drug or treatment under consideration – is interesting enough. What is even more interesting is that the placebo effect can even be detectable when you know it is a placebo you are taking. Get your head around that one. You can know you are taking a sugar table and it can still make you feel better! He even goes so far as to say that clinical tests on Valium show that the drug is only effective if you are told you are going to be on it - not if you don't know. Lorena told me off today for suggesting this – but that was what the man said.This was an interesting book on a truly fascinating subject."
1,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,1,"Disturbingly simple depiction of the mind. Johnson is unquestionably in awe of the brain. His awe seems to have impaired his skepticism. The result is that he sensationalized what he learned and at times provided absolutely false information as if it were fact. For example, He is under the assumption that the better people are at reading emotions, the more extroverted. Where is the evidence for such an absurd claim? This is why extraverts often misdiagnose introverts with autism, when in fact they are not even on the spectrum. Worse, despite being around some of the most respected neuroscientists the world has to offer, he was still holding tight to the myth that people only use 10% of their brains. It's absurd. These are only two examples of the many. He really didn't have a good enough grasp of neuroscience to write this book. Some journalists and science writers can swing it, but he is not nearly skeptical enough to pull it off. The book's target audience seems to be those who also have no education in the neurosciences. Sadly, those people will believe what he is saying because he included work from very respected researchers who have conducted some pretty good studies. He related their work as well as many of his own assumptions. The very way in which he ties together the bits of information he gleaned from the researchers really demonstrates his lack of understanding. For him to have written a book to educate others seems grossly irresponsible. I would highly suggest finding an introductory book written by an actual scientist instead. "

3,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/447127-giedra,4,"I really liked this book. Each chapter focused on a different aspect of the mind. For example, one chapter discussed our ability to ""mindread"" other people, referring to how we can read subtle cues about a person's mood, whether they are lying, etc. from their facial expressions, tone, etc. and we have no idea we can even do this. He points out that we DO usually sense that we enjoy conversing with some people more than others even when the content of hte conversations is largely the same, and posits that this may often be because you ""click"" with someone in terms of being able to optimally mindread one another. Another chapter provided insights into ADD/ADHD and how what we call ""attention"" is really more than 1 skill (there is auditory attention, visual attention, then the ability to switch back and forth or decide which external stimuli to ignore, etc.) Talked about using a neurofeedback machine that reads brainwaves to train kids to be more attentive--the system uses a video game in which successful movement of your ""guy"" only happens when you are focused in a particular way. ADHD kids using the system report that now they understand what it's supposed to feel like when they are reading. Many interesting things to ponder. I will enjoy rereading it as well, as you can easily take what you learn from this book and recognize that certain things going on in your own life are attributable to this or that neurotransmitter/attention skill/mindreading ability or lack thereof. Then realizing these things, you might be able to train yourself to overcome certain deficiences or to do things to compensate. My only complaint was that the last chapter got all Freud-talkie and was nearly as impenetrable as Freud(trying to explain what things from Freud are still worthy of being part of our lexicon and which things just have to be completely tossed based on what we know from brain science). Just plain dull after all the interesting reading that came before. "
4,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7476-michelle,3,"OLD: some interesting bits, but a little too everyday and wandering for me? but only 1/3 done and won't judge until the end.NEW:It feels like Steven Berlin Johnson set out on a quest to understand his own mind, kept a diary about it, and decided to publish it when he reached a conclusion. He doesn't delve too deeply into either the science or the anecdotes, and I lost his train of thought several times. It's a neat exploration, but a bit too self-indulgent to be a really compelling story for a reader."
5,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,3,"Description: Mind Wide Open speaks to brain buffs, self-obsessed neurotics, barstool psychologists, mystified parents, grumpy spouses, exasperated managers, and anyone who enjoys speculating and gossiping about the motivations and behaviors of other human beings. Steven Johnson shows us the transformative power of understanding brain science and offers new modes of introspection and tools for better parenting, better relationships, and better living."
6,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108010-tina,4,"This is a pretty fascinating book. It gets a little annoying whenever Johnson tries to pimp it out as a self-help book (""learning about your brain can help you!"" blah blah), but luckily, it's NOT a self-help book -- it's an informative book about how your brain functions and how he went about exploring (via MRI and neurofeedback, etc.) about how his brain works. (I'm guessing he thought trying to pass it off as self-help would increase his audience?)The chapter on attention was a tiny bit dull for me in some parts, but this might have been b/c I was already pretty familiar with most of the info. (This is pretty much the extent of the usefulness of my psych degree.) But the info about the connections between emotion and memory, and the evolutionary purpose behind laughter and play -- stuff like that was really interesting. It's also a fairly quick, easy, layperson-targeted read, so you get to learn great stuff without giving yourself a headache. I recommend this one to my science nerd friends, or really, anyone who's interested in an introduction to how the brain works. "
7,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1915901-lauren-kampwirth,5,Yep. I'm a neuroscience nerd.
8,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/821868-kirsten,4,"This is a really excellent look at how neuroscience relates to our everyday emotional lives. One of the most interesting bits to me was the discussion of the way that we remember trauma. Research now shows that a lot of conventional wisdom about trauma is flat-out wrong; in particularly, this book suggests that if ""talking out"" a traumatic event reproduces the fear response (increased heart rate, etc.), it may cause the fear produced by the memories to become more firmly etched, not less. This means that talk therapy might not actually be the most effective treatment for survivors, especially if the trauma is recent.It can be kind of eerie to realize that so much of what we experience emotionally is related to chemicals flowing about in your brain, but I found it fascinating. I'm pretty used to the idea in some ways already, since I take medication to control my depression, but this book has really sparked my interest and I'm planning on seeking out some of the books that he mentions in his excellent footnotes."
9,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1971718-b-rule,3,"This book is fine but it's on the level of a breezy magazine piece. The picture it presents of the brain is a vastly simplified one, and the set-pieces Johnson delivers in each chapter skate along the surface of the implications of modern neuroscience for philosophy, sociology, politics, etc. It turns out all the rich detail got dumped in the endnotes, but my opinion of the book was well set before I got to them. This would have been a much better book if that detail had been incorporated into the body of the work. As it stands, this doesn't delve much beyond the level of ""wow, did you know you can do biofeedback and fMRIs to see how the brain has an actual architecture, and your mind is actually made up of a bunch of subsystems for various tasks like pattern-matching, visual acuity, different types of attentionality, etc. I won't bore you with the details, but cool, huh?!"""
10,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50091051-jeremy-phillips,4,"Good stuff, if a little dated now. Lots of interesting info about brain mechanics and the psychic 0inner-world. Not too much overt speculation or blah blah about evolutionary biology. Know thyself. "
11,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2164930-bucket,5,"Steven Johnson explores neuroscience in a very accessible way by describing his journey to understand his own brain. He submits himself to MRIs, biofeedback machines, neurofeedback machines, and other neurological testing to gain insight into how his own brain (and all of our brains too) function on a daily basis. He closes with a section about Freud, and how neuroscience, while showing the need to update or alter some of Freud's theories about psychoanalysis, does not totally replace them. Johnson posits that understanding the neuroscience and acknowledging the role that biology and even geneology play doesn't mean that we are somehow locked into behaving a certain way or that the poetic, psychological, literary, and philosophical interpretations of how our minds work suddenly go out the window. Instead, each of these interpretations have their place. Johnson also states that understanding a little more about the chemical and biological mechanisms in his brain actually makes him feel less limited and more in control. Knowledge is power, rah rah!Particularly interesting insights to me: Using 10% of our brains most of the time isn't a bad thing; instead it's efficient. Our brains are composed of dozens of different tools that serve different purposes. If we used all of them at once, the sheer volume of information and input would leave us unable to function. Our brain uses the 10% (or so) that is directly tied to whatever task we're working on. His findings turn conventional wisdom about dealing with trauma on its head. We all know we're supposed to ""talk it out"" when something traumatic or painful happens, and ""not brag"" when something wonderful and exciting happens. However, reliving memories and their associated emotions makes them stronger. Therefore talking about the painful can reinforce it and ensure the emotional response remains long after, and keeping something great quiet may cause us to lose the great emotional feeling that came with it. Our limbic brain is more or less responsible for emotional responses and our neocortex is more or less responsible for intellection and thinking. These systems work together, but at different speeds. The limbic brain learns slowly and remains in various emotional states longer, whereas the neocortex learns (and moves on) very quickly. This explains those moments where you feel stressed or anxious and don't know why. Then when you think for a moment, you remember something that you just heard that was stress-inducing and that your neocortex had moved on from before your limbic brain was finished reacting. There's also a fascinating section of the book about our abillity to detect emotion - subconsciously and in a split second. We're not just talking happy and sad here, but 412 different ""discrete emotional concepts."" All this is handled by our limbic system; in fact, bringing your neocortex into play and trying to analyze the emotions on someone's face will make your reading less accurate that going with your split-second decision.Themes: neuroscience, psychological, self-knowledge, technology, personality"
12,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/185740-daniel-hadley,3,"What Johnson does well is break down complex scientific topics with clear prose and interesting real life examples. Sometimes I sense that he is oversimplifying things, but overall I like his style. Here's the good news: we can read minds. Our brains can read subtle clues in facial expressions, body language and voice intonations. This happens in the subconscious, below our radar (or, outside of the ""Executive Branch,"" as Johnson calls the conscious mind). Pretty cool. We also are high on drugs all the time. Many of the same chemicals that make crack so much fun can be had in ordinary situations. My only beef with the book: it glosses over or doesn't address some major debates in neuroscience. It sidesteppes the whole debate over the role of evolutionary psychology by saying that we are products of both nature and nurture. Mostly, though, I would have liked to see more about the debates over free will that are happening in neuroscience circles. To get that, I think I will read Wegner's boook, The Illusion of Conscious Will, which I skimmed once in the bookstore. "
13,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3352854-david-skip-everling,3,"Good book. I think I would have given this a higher rating if I had read it when it was published in 2004, since I've read a half-dozen books since then that explore similar material. Indeed the more recent books from contemporaries like Malcolm Gladwell and Jonah Lehrer, Blink and How We Decide (respectively) are good examples, get the benefit of more recent studies and analysis. None of this is Johnson's fault of course, which is why I feel compelled to note it here, but it affected my engagement with the book nonetheless.Still, Johnson has his own perspectives and niches of interest even looking at the same clinical psychology, and the book offered a refreshing dose of open-mindedness about the brain and how we might learn to tune it more precisely with emerging neuroscience."
14,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8631670-stephanie-hinds,3,"I agree with other readers that this book contained mostly information I already knew. This was not unexpected as it is roughly my field of expertise and the book was published in 2004- written about current understanding of the brain. The brain is our body's most complex organ, & perhaps the most complex thing known to man. Within 5 years of my completing school, fundamental ideas about the brain (ex. We don't grow new neurons) were not only being challenged but being disproven. All that being said, I approached the book with modest expectations and was very pleased. I read it in a single setting, way into the night. I was most impressed by the author's skill in drawing parallels btw neurophysiology & common life experiences, making complex topics easily accessible to anyone interested. "
15,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57143010-debra-blasi,4,"Johnson explores the physiology of his own brain and, ergo, ours in this mainstream (i.e., not esoteric) book. His thesis is right: the more we know how our brains actually function, the more control we have over how and what we think and do. Example: Your body continues producing emotional symptoms to a fear or anxiety (like racing heartbeat, sweaty palms, knotted stomach) after your brain has moved onto other tepid topics. Therefore we sometimes *feel* toward subjects that are no longer irrelevant to our fear, irritation, joy, or other emotions."
16,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1453656-grace,4,"Steven Johnson wanted to know what his brain was doing when he felt/did different things, why he felt/did different things, and to what extent all human brains are the same/different. He went to lots of specialists, got hooked up to various brain-reading machines and wrote this book about his experiences. It was really fun to read and really interesting. Warning: it does offer theories explaining how chemicals in our brain are responsible for all emotions, including love, so if you don't want to think of love as a chemical reaction in your brain, you may want to skip that chapter."
17,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25904772-steele-dimmock,3,"This is a solid intro in to Brain Science worthy of 3.5 stars.I got a few things out of it:* Freud attracted a large audience because you didn't need to be mentally ill to get something out of it* Duchenne smiles* Experiments prove that Human's remember pain in a separate location from memories* Your brain is nothing but drugs, constantly going in and out* One of the effects of Prozac is the removal of rejection sensitivity* Prefrontal Cortex function is reduced when you are sad and increased when you are happy."
18,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74499-lance-agena,2,"Read like a magazine article. Light reading, but I expected less of a personal narrative and more referenced studies. He provided notes at the back, but it didn't complement the main text as it should have — it felt like the notes provided an excuse for not writing about the the subject in depth. It did have some interesting parts though. However, if I really wanted further information, I suspect I'd have to read a book by one of the scientists he references."
19,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/219366-erica,2,"Not one of my favorite Steven Johnson books. Although the premise for the book is an interesting one--that the basics of neuroscience can provide us with tools to discover new things about our attitudes and actions on an everyday basis--I felt the book was just too navel-gazing. When in doubt, Johnson talked about himself and his issues. A set of short case studies might have been more interesting. "
20,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/464314-courtney,5,"I learned that there is a module in our brain that inherently fears snakes...and garden hoses, and vacuum cleaner cords, and anything else that might be mistaken for one."
21,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51055891-j-crossley,3,"This book was very interesting. The author looks at the brain, what it can accomplish, and recent research regarding the brain. The chapter on the ability to mindread other people explains how we can react to others by reading subtle cues and microexpressions. While empathy takes longer, mindreading happens in rapid-fire time. The sections regarding ADD and autism explains that it is not so much issues with “attention” but has to do with different skills. These skills, such as visual attention, auditory attention, and stored memories give us information. We need to decide what to listen to and what to ignore. It could be that for people with ADD and autism that they are disregarding important information and listening to unimportant details. Memory and trauma are discussed, and recent research is showing that each time you relate a traumatic event it becomes more entrenched in your mind. This is due to a couple of things. One is that memory is more fluent; it is not “set in stone.” Also, when you recount a stressful/traumatic event, your brain floods with chemicals that make you feel like you are in the traumatic event again. Talk therapy may not be the best option given the recent studies. The author explains that knowing about how the chemicals in his brain work, it gives him power because he can be more in control. He states at the beginning of the book that talking about the brain and its sections can get very detailed. He decided not to go that detailed so that the book is accessible to everyone. He also participates in the scans and testing, so that gives a human element rather than just being a dry textbook reading of research. "
22,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2506768-tiffany,2,"Maybe because I've read a lot of books on neurology and the biochemical processes of the brain, maybe because it was an audiobook narrated by a guy who sounded a teeny tiny bit like the guy that narrates high school film strips. But, I had trouble staying focused on this. The content is interesting in places, particularly on the different chemicals in the brain, but it felt meandering overall. I appreciated his real world examples, but I was kind of tired of his example of the wind breaking a window by about the fifth time he mentioned it. I also somewhat disagree with his assertion that we should take beta-blockers to keep from reinforcing the trauma in the weeks after a traumatic event. And his seeming assertion that memories cannot be repressed. (I think I'm overstating that one a bit.) His research was sound, but his literary meanderings and the somewhat questionable leaps in logic he reached from the research left me a little frustrated with the book as a whole."
23,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95235758-julian-lynn,4,"Utilizing the strength of his genuine inquisitiveness and the backdrop of his personal and intimate reporting style, Steven Johnson causes the ""science of the mind""—the subject matter of ""Mind Wide Open""—to feel more immediate and engaging than most writers on the subject. Based upon Western medicine's chemical-mechanistic model about how our bodies work, Johnson tours the terrain of the working mind, as it acts and reacts to various stimuli. Multiple theoretical models are presented, encouraging engaged readers to draw conclusions of their own. This reader's only residual wish is that Johnson had included more information on the electrical nature of the mind-body relationship. "
24,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12651424-tapan,3,"Certainly, our brain is not a component that functions standalone, but it behaves like a hub of activities by a lot of components within it. These components and chemicals are responsible for our emotions and how we can perceive ourselves. The author explains these aspects in a simple language which is easy to understand. However, I couldn't agree with a lot of aspects. No doubt, the author is obsessed with Neurosciences but often doesn't convincingly relate it to human behavior. Like relating how we deal with stress and justification of gender classification for the same was not at all convincing. Moreover, mind-reading as a central part of our existence is also neither convincing for me."
25,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61714220-shirley,4,"Very interesting read. I find the information useful. So, our brain is an assemblage of modules, with some having more autonomy than others. These modules and submodules interact but can also be in conflict with each other, and are constantly doing a balancing act. When these modules are out of sync, we get anxious and stressed. Just like the real world, where there are differing opinions and schools of thoughts. Our brain need to process these information, with the end goal of us having a unified sense of self."

44,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/356012-michael,5,"In a nutshell, this is Johnson’s story about his foray into locating the secrets of the/his human brain (at least per available technology circa 2003) with the ultimate goals of both offering his audience a basic understanding of the chemical nature of mental activity and reframing Freudian thought in the context of a more sophisticated understanding of these processes (positioning the Freudian model as essentially empirical and necessarily metaphorical as a distant precursor to certain technologies at our disposal today).As horrible as this description might sound, Johnson is typically an engaging writer, so I went for it. I was not disappointed. His narrative follows a series of research “discoveries” such as the “Attention Trainer” neurofeedback helmut, utilized to analyze and possibly treat the omnipresent ADD syndrome (I can’t help but think of Ferris Bueller’s Principal cycling through the suburbs) and the two-foot diameter fMRI tube that enables brain slice imaging to locate neural hot spots as they relate to different mental tasks (sounds most uncomfortable). Discussions of the role of the amygdala and brain chemicals such as oxytocin are articulated through a personalized lens (instilling his fear instinct as 9/11 unfolded blocks away and enabling his wife’s “tending instinct” towards their baby, respectively). It’s all quite interesting and well worth the 30 cent late fee.He also mentions the Simon Baron-Cohen Autism Quotient Test. If you personally sense a certain social retardation – regardless of phone number memorization skills – I would warn you to refrain from Googling this one."

He's upfront about reducing his subject to a few chemicals and parts of the brain, making the five major chapters a sort of sturdy introduction to neuroscience. What he picks are some of the most fascinating bits, like oxytocin, a chemical found in high doses in the brains of new couples and women who have recently given birth. Is this the love drug? Johnson cites a scientist who hesitates at such oversimplification, but spends much more time suggesting it's a big part of what keeps people enthralled. He's a positive guy and sees something important in each of his subjects, be it brain chemistry, evolutionary psychology or the notes of Sigmund Freud. Johnson subjects himself to fMRI and MRI, reading experiments and videogames that challenge him to move a wheel with thought alone. His interests span just as wide, trying to explain how fear, love and music became so important in minds, the range of the placebo effect, men and women's hormone shifts, drug use and what the brain looks like when it's come up with a new idea. Not all of his arguments are convincing (like the sales pitch for the merits of poor, maligned Freudianism in the Conclusion), but Johnson illuminates much in this book."

This book is mostly written for a lay audience, but there were occasional complicated science words thrown in to remind us that the topic was supposed to be hard. The metaphors and examples that the author used to explain some of the complex topics were useful, but on the other hand, the same examples were used over and over. Wind = broken window, clear sky = plane crash disaster. I would have liked to see more diverse examples that might be more relevant to a diverse audience (and to help us generals the concepts a little more). I would defiantly recommend that you stop reading before the ""conclusion"" chapter. This very long chapter tires to integrate Freud into modern brain theory (some concepts covered previously in the book and other that weren't). I found most of this information irrelevant to the rest of the book, boring, hard to get through, and boring. I would have enjoyed the book much more if it had ended before this chapter.

Probably why I used to find Nachmanides on Genesis 1:26 so inspiring even if I no longer feel it’s intellectually enough by any stretch of the imagination. That’s why I’ve started Daniel Dennett’s consciousness explained several times although I’ve never been able to get through all the way (even if it did lead me to several other really more accessible reads along the way.That said, this is solid overview of what Johnson calls “recreational neuroscience”. He covers most of the major questions that would interest a lay person in the subject. Like what does it be to “be hormonal”, or what do we mean by our real self when we feel the conflict between our emotional limbic brain and our rational neocortex. All good stuff. Still, while a good overview, there wasn’t anything really new for me here unlike his recent Where Good Ideas Come From which I thought was just brilliant.So, if you’re fairly new to the subject of “recreational neuroscience”, it’s a good read.

He reveals the results in Mind Wide Open, an engaging and personal account of his foray into edgy brain science. In the 21st century, Johnson observes, we have become used to ideas such as ""adrenaline rushes"" and ""serotonin levels,"" without really recognizing that complex neurobiology has become a commonplace thing to talk about. He sees recent laboratory revelations about the brain as crucial for understanding ourselves and our psyches in new, post-Freudian ways. Readers shy about slapping electrodes on their own temples can get a vicarious scientific thrill as Johnson tries out empathy tests, neurofeedback, and fMRI scans. The results paint a distinct picture of the author, and uncover general brain secrets at the same time. Memory, fear, love, alertness--all the multitude of states housed in our brains are shown to be the results of chemical and electrical interactions constantly fed and changed by input from our senses.

It amazed me to hear the science of the neurochemistry behind fear, love, and even laughter. Johnson gives so much information that was unbeknownst to me prior to reading. If you are interested in learning about why we feel what we feel and why we react the way that we react, then I strongly recommend. I loved to read about something called ""flash memory"" which is an immediate response to fear. I liked learning about why this occurs and how it affects other people. I really liked reading all of Johnson's personal experiences and how his puts the information into real life scenarios and puts it into perspective. Some questions that I have for someone who has read the book: - What was the most intriguing chapter for you and what did you like learning about the most?- Do you completely agree with Johnson’s input about gender differences and how genders organize stress differently and how males put on more stress than females ? - In what ways did/do you use this information in everyday life?"

The answer: a lot, but we still have much to discover about the complicated circuits run by experience, memory, emotion, and brain chemistry. This topic could have scared away non-scientists, but Johnson (a non-scientist) explains technical terms clearly and enthusiastically, using personal examples to illustrate key concepts. Some readers might question his claims; does a baby's crying result more from chemistry than emotion? Despite its uncertain conclusions and relevance to, say, PTSD, Mind Wide Open is an excellent introduction to the complex feedback system that defines our daily experiences.

I'm convinced that we are about 90% programmed, hard-wired to do what we do based on neuroscience and conditioning by events and genes. You think you make your choices? No, your gut bacteria give you cravings. Your genes push you mightily toward one preference rather than another. Your culture provides a framework within which you function. Your amygdala tells you what to feel, and how deeply to feel about it. You are a bundle of predetermined actions. About 90% of what you do is totally predictable, and probably even a higher percentage if we had more data. This book is a bit dated now, but it's a very readable exploration into neuroscience. "

I didn't time my wait list at the library well and ended up with a bunch of books at once and this one got pushed to the bottom.

74,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/356012-michael,5,"In a nutshell, this is Johnson’s story about his foray into locating the secrets of the/his human brain (at least per available technology circa 2003) with the ultimate goals of both offering his audience a basic understanding of the chemical nature of mental activity and reframing Freudian thought in the context of a more sophisticated understanding of these processes (positioning the Freudian model as essentially empirical and necessarily metaphorical as a distant precursor to certain technologies at our disposal today).As horrible as this description might sound, Johnson is typically an engaging writer, so I went for it. I was not disappointed. His narrative follows a series of research “discoveries” such as the “Attention Trainer” neurofeedback helmut, utilized to analyze and possibly treat the omnipresent ADD syndrome (I can’t help but think of Ferris Bueller’s Principal cycling through the suburbs) and the two-foot diameter fMRI tube that enables brain slice imaging to locate neural hot spots as they relate to different mental tasks (sounds most uncomfortable). Discussions of the role of the amygdala and brain chemicals such as oxytocin are articulated through a personalized lens (instilling his fear instinct as 9/11 unfolded blocks away and enabling his wife’s “tending instinct” towards their baby, respectively). It’s all quite interesting and well worth the 30 cent late fee.He also mentions the Simon Baron-Cohen Autism Quotient Test. If you personally sense a certain social retardation – regardless of phone number memorization skills – I would warn you to refrain from Googling this one."

Your amygdala tells you what to feel, and how deeply to feel about it. You are a bundle of predetermined actions.

104,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/356012-michael,5,"In a nutshell, this is Johnson’s story about his foray into locating the secrets of the/his human brain (at least per available technology circa 2003) with the ultimate goals of both offering his audience a basic understanding of the chemical nature of mental activity and reframing Freudian thought in the context of a more sophisticated understanding of these processes (positioning the Freudian model as essentially empirical and necessarily metaphorical as a distant precursor to certain technologies at our disposal today).As horrible as this description might sound, Johnson is typically an engaging writer, so I went for it. I was not disappointed. His narrative follows a series of research “discoveries” such as the “Attention Trainer” neurofeedback helmut, utilized to analyze and possibly treat the omnipresent ADD syndrome (I can’t help but think of Ferris Bueller’s Principal cycling through the suburbs) and the two-foot diameter fMRI tube that enables brain slice imaging to locate neural hot spots as they relate to different mental tasks (sounds most uncomfortable). Discussions of the role of the amygdala and brain chemicals such as oxytocin are articulated through a personalized lens (instilling his fear instinct as 9/11 unfolded blocks away and enabling his wife’s “tending instinct” towards their baby, respectively). It’s all quite interesting and well worth the 30 cent late fee.He also mentions the Simon Baron-Cohen Autism Quotient Test. If you personally sense a certain social retardation – regardless of phone number memorization skills – I would warn you to refrain from Googling this one."
105,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147818-john-wiswell,3,"Johnson brings understandable, conversational language to one of the most imposing and important sciences of the modern time: the study of the brain. He's upfront about reducing his subject to a few chemicals and parts of the brain, making the five major chapters a sort of sturdy introduction to neuroscience. What he picks are some of the most fascinating bits, like oxytocin, a chemical found in high doses in the brains of new couples and women who have recently given birth. Is this the love drug? Johnson cites a scientist who hesitates at such oversimplification, but spends much more time suggesting it's a big part of what keeps people enthralled. He's a positive guy and sees something important in each of his subjects, be it brain chemistry, evolutionary psychology or the notes of Sigmund Freud. Johnson subjects himself to fMRI and MRI, reading experiments and videogames that challenge him to move a wheel with thought alone. His interests span just as wide, trying to explain how fear, love and music became so important in minds, the range of the placebo effect, men and women's hormone shifts, drug use and what the brain looks like when it's come up with a new idea. Not all of his arguments are convincing (like the sales pitch for the merits of poor, maligned Freudianism in the Conclusion), but Johnson illuminates much in this book."
106,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3023275-audiaa,3,"3.5 starsI enjoyed reading most of this book and learned a few things I didn't know about the brain and topics such as the fight or flight response, biofeed back, being in ""the zone"", and how hormones affect behavior. This book is mostly written for a lay audience, but there were occasional complicated science words thrown in to remind us that the topic was supposed to be hard. The metaphors and examples that the author used to explain some of the complex topics were useful, but on the other hand, the same examples were used over and over. Wind = broken window, clear sky = plane crash disaster. I would have liked to see more diverse examples that might be more relevant to a diverse audience (and to help us generals the concepts a little more). I would defiantly recommend that you stop reading before the ""conclusion"" chapter. This very long chapter tires to integrate Freud into modern brain theory (some concepts covered previously in the book and other that weren't). I found most of this information irrelevant to the rest of the book, boring, hard to get through, and boring. I would have enjoyed the book much more if it had ended before this chapter. The first several chapters were interesting, relevant, and presented information in an easy to understand if perhaps over simplified and redundant way."
107,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/649480-adam-jacobson,3,"I’m fascinated by the mind/brain problem. How do we get from a set of molecules to consciousness? Probably why I used to find Nachmanides on Genesis 1:26 so inspiring even if I no longer feel it’s intellectually enough by any stretch of the imagination. That’s why I’ve started Daniel Dennett’s consciousness explained several times although I’ve never been able to get through all the way (even if it did lead me to several other really more accessible reads along the way.That said, this is solid overview of what Johnson calls “recreational neuroscience”. He covers most of the major questions that would interest a lay person in the subject. Like what does it be to “be hormonal”, or what do we mean by our real self when we feel the conflict between our emotional limbic brain and our rational neocortex. All good stuff. Still, while a good overview, there wasn’t anything really new for me here unlike his recent Where Good Ideas Come From which I thought was just brilliant.So, if you’re fairly new to the subject of “recreational neuroscience”, it’s a good read. But if you’ve read in this area before, you’ll get a good review a few interesting insights but nothing really new. "
108,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1167923-patrick,5,"Given the opportunity to watch the inner workings of his own brain, Steven Johnson jumps at the chance. He reveals the results in Mind Wide Open, an engaging and personal account of his foray into edgy brain science. In the 21st century, Johnson observes, we have become used to ideas such as ""adrenaline rushes"" and ""serotonin levels,"" without really recognizing that complex neurobiology has become a commonplace thing to talk about. He sees recent laboratory revelations about the brain as crucial for understanding ourselves and our psyches in new, post-Freudian ways. Readers shy about slapping electrodes on their own temples can get a vicarious scientific thrill as Johnson tries out empathy tests, neurofeedback, and fMRI scans. The results paint a distinct picture of the author, and uncover general brain secrets at the same time. Memory, fear, love, alertness--all the multitude of states housed in our brains are shown to be the results of chemical and electrical interactions constantly fed and changed by input from our senses. Mind Wide Open both satisfies curiosity and provokes more questions, leaving readers wondering about their own gray matter. --Therese Littleton"
109,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11550691-robert,4,"I like the first hand, get involved, stick my head into a large object style of science writing that characterizes Mind Wide Open. While perhaps not as personal as when Mary Roach had sex with her husband during a functional MRI in Bonk: the Curious Coupling of Science and Sex, I think Johnson deserves some credit.Mind Wide Open has some really great insights into recent discoveries in neuroscience, explained in a clear, practical manner. Johnson describes behaviors of his own that he wants to understand better, and then describes the underlying brain chemistry that explains those behaviors. This leads him to neurofeedback practitioners, cognitive scientists, psychologists, and, yes, sticking his head in a functional MRI while mentally rewriting the text from a chapter of this book.Hopefully, I'll remember the following brain chemicals from the book. If not, I'll have to read my own review.serotonin - modulating rejection sensitivity and social confidencedopamine - regulates pursuit of new experiences and surpriseendorphins and norepinephrine - regulates pleasure seeking and reward dependencecortisol - stressoxytocin - drive to create emotional bonds"
110,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59469277-alannah-morse,4,"This book was amazing and truly gave me an inside look of the human brain. It amazed me to hear the science of the neurochemistry behind fear, love, and even laughter. Johnson gives so much information that was unbeknownst to me prior to reading. If you are interested in learning about why we feel what we feel and why we react the way that we react, then I strongly recommend. I loved to read about something called ""flash memory"" which is an immediate response to fear. I liked learning about why this occurs and how it affects other people. I really liked reading all of Johnson's personal experiences and how his puts the information into real life scenarios and puts it into perspective. Some questions that I have for someone who has read the book: - What was the most intriguing chapter for you and what did you like learning about the most?- Do you completely agree with Johnson’s input about gender differences and how genders organize stress differently and how males put on more stress than females ? - In what ways did/do you use this information in everyday life?"
111,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1008236-bookmarks-magazine,0,"What would you learn if you ""could see what your brain looked like when it was remembering a long-forgotten childhood experience, or listening to a song, or conceiving a good idea?"" The answer: a lot, but we still have much to discover about the complicated circuits run by experience, memory, emotion, and brain chemistry. This topic could have scared away non-scientists, but Johnson (a non-scientist) explains technical terms clearly and enthusiastically, using personal examples to illustrate key concepts. Some readers might question his claims; does a baby's crying result more from chemistry than emotion? Despite its uncertain conclusions and relevance to, say, PTSD, Mind Wide Open is an excellent introduction to the complex feedback system that defines our daily experiences. This is an excerpt from a review published in Bookmarks magazine."
112,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/349264-tracey,3,"Using himself as a subject, Johnson explores the current state of brain/mind exploration, using biofeedback, MRIs and chemical analysis, among other tools. He examines what creative thinking looks like in the brain, improves his facial expression reading skills and comes to grips with his own use of humour as a coping skill, as well as learns why sunny days and high, whistling noises are alert triggers for him. The first few chapters are the strongest, as they document his experiments on himself; while the remainder of the book is more traditional, using existing research to support his thesis. He dedicates over 40 pages to his notes, and includes a bibliography and index as well. An ""engaging travelogue from the frontiers of human brain science"" - I'd definitely recommend it to anyone interested in this area of research."
113,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1750845-darya,4,"A nice introduction into neuroscience of emotions and social interactions: how and why we become afraid of presumably harmless things and what we can do to overcome these fears, how we ""read"" other people, neurochemistry of love and attachment etc. An easy to read account of the author's experiences with biofeedback, fMRI etc. and his interviews with prominent neurobiologists and behavioral biologists such as Joseph LeDoux, Antonio Damasio etc. The book is by no means overwhelmed by scientific terms, the author consciously kept it as simple as possible, so it should be a pleasure to read for a lay person.To summarize, if you're curious about neuroscience of social interactions but don't have a biology background, look no further than this book."
114,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/757602-lars-guthrie,3,"If you haven't read much about neuroscience's leaps in research on the brain over the past couple of decades and the evidence drawn from that research that forcefully makes the case that our brains are plastic organisms, this is an easy-to-read introduction. Sometimes I thought Johnson was superficial. In a fascinating chapter on face and affect recognition, he introduces Simon Baron-Cohen as an authoritive expert without barely a mention of the controversy stirred up by the psychologist's 'male brain' theory of autism. I found Norman Doidge's similar briefing, 'The Brain That Changes Itself' the better of the two books, although 'Mind Wide Open' did help me to solidify background knowledge and gave me a list of sources to go to in the future.

I could never imagine thinking this. The more you learn, the more you can appreciate how magical it actually is!

Johnson effectively teaches about the mind without relying on jargon that baffles the reader. Of course, as a first trip into brain science, the book is a brief and flitting survey of many topics, but I found it fascinating. One of the lessons I learned is that our memory, and even how our brains process information, is bound and heavily guided by emotion, and emotion can shape what we learn and how we learn. Recommended for anyone interested in neuroscience, psychology, or a users guide to brains. One caveat: since this is the first book I've read about neuroscience, I can't say how accurate the information is."

Johnson describes behaviors of his own that he wants to understand better, and then describes the underlying brain chemistry that explains those behaviors. This leads him to neurofeedback practitioners, cognitive scientists, psychologists, and, yes, sticking his head in a functional MRI while mentally rewriting the text from a chapter of this book.Hopefully, I'll remember the following brain chemicals from the book.

It amazed me to hear the science of the neurochemistry behind fear, love, and even laughter. Johnson gives so much information that was unbeknownst to me prior to reading. If you are interested in learning about why we feel what we feel and why we react the way that we react, then I strongly recommend. I loved to read about something called ""flash memory"" which is an immediate response to fear. I liked learning about why this occurs and how it affects other people. I really liked reading all of Johnson's personal experiences and how his puts the information into real life scenarios and puts it into perspective. Some questions that I have for someone who has read the book: - What was the most intriguing chapter for you and what did you like learning about the most?- Do you completely agree with Johnson’s input about gender differences and how genders organize stress differently and how males put on more stress than females ? - In what ways did/do you use this information in everyday life?"

The answer: a lot, but we still have much to discover about the complicated circuits run by experience, memory, emotion, and brain chemistry. This topic could have scared away non-scientists, but Johnson (a non-scientist) explains technical terms clearly and enthusiastically, using personal examples to illustrate key concepts. Some readers might question his claims; does a baby's crying result more from chemistry than emotion? Despite its uncertain conclusions and relevance to, say, PTSD, Mind Wide Open is an excellent introduction to the complex feedback system that defines our daily experiences.

He examines what creative thinking looks like in the brain, improves his facial expression reading skills and comes to grips with his own use of humour as a coping skill, as well as learns why sunny days and high, whistling noises are alert triggers for him. The first few chapters are the strongest, as they document his experiments on himself; while the remainder of the book is more traditional, using existing research to support his thesis.

162,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72857319-ali-haf,3,"Very accessible for a layman.However, I found some parts of the book to be repetitive and unnecessarily long.Also, a handful of information aren't really accurate, as other readers have mentioned."
163,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65341138-tina,5,"If I was to sign up for a religion it would really have to offer me much more than the chance to chant “Holy, Holy, Holy” at the right hand of God for the rest of eternity. One of the things that would nearly sway me would be if it gave me a change to do and be all of the things there just isn’t time in one life to be and do. "
164,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/356012-michael,5,"In a nutshell, this is Johnson’s story about his foray into locating the secrets of the/his human brain (at least per available technology circa 2003) with the ultimate goals of both offering his audience a basic understanding of the chemical nature of mental activity and reframing Freudian thought in the context of a more sophisticated understanding of these processes (positioning the Freudian model as essentially empirical and necessarily metaphorical as a distant precursor to certain technologies at our disposal today).As horrible as this description might sound, Johnson is typically an engaging writer, so I went for it. I was not disappointed. His narrative follows a series of research “discoveries” such as the “Attention Trainer” neurofeedback helmut, utilized to analyze and possibly treat the omnipresent ADD syndrome (I can’t help but think of Ferris Bueller’s Principal cycling through the suburbs) and the two-foot diameter fMRI tube that enables brain slice imaging to locate neural hot spots as they relate to different mental tasks (sounds most uncomfortable). Discussions of the role of the amygdala and brain chemicals such as oxytocin are articulated through a personalized lens (instilling his fear instinct as 9/11 unfolded blocks away and enabling his wife’s “tending instinct” towards their baby, respectively). It’s all quite interesting and well worth the 30 cent late fee.He also mentions the Simon Baron-Cohen Autism Quotient Test. If you personally sense a certain social retardation – regardless of phone number memorization skills – I would warn you to refrain from Googling this one."
165,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147818-john-wiswell,3,"Johnson brings understandable, conversational language to one of the most imposing and important sciences of the modern time: the study of the brain. He's upfront about reducing his subject to a few chemicals and parts of the brain, making the five major chapters a sort of sturdy introduction to neuroscience. What he picks are some of the most fascinating bits, like oxytocin, a chemical found in high doses in the brains of new couples and women who have recently given birth. Is this the love drug? Johnson cites a scientist who hesitates at such oversimplification, but spends much more time suggesting it's a big part of what keeps people enthralled. He's a positive guy and sees something important in each of his subjects, be it brain chemistry, evolutionary psychology or the notes of Sigmund Freud. Johnson subjects himself to fMRI and MRI, reading experiments and videogames that challenge him to move a wheel with thought alone. His interests span just as wide, trying to explain how fear, love and music became so important in minds, the range of the placebo effect, men and women's hormone shifts, drug use and what the brain looks like when it's come up with a new idea. Not all of his arguments are convincing (like the sales pitch for the merits of poor, maligned Freudianism in the Conclusion), but Johnson illuminates much in this book."
166,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3023275-audiaa,3,"3.5 starsI enjoyed reading most of this book and learned a few things I didn't know about the brain and topics such as the fight or flight response, biofeed back, being in ""the zone"", and how hormones affect behavior. This book is mostly written for a lay audience, but there were occasional complicated science words thrown in to remind us that the topic was supposed to be hard. The metaphors and examples that the author used to explain some of the complex topics were useful, but on the other hand, the same examples were used over and over. Wind = broken window, clear sky = plane crash disaster. I would have liked to see more diverse examples that might be more relevant to a diverse audience (and to help us generals the concepts a little more). I would defiantly recommend that you stop reading before the ""conclusion"" chapter. This very long chapter tires to integrate Freud into modern brain theory (some concepts covered previously in the book and other that weren't). I found most of this information irrelevant to the rest of the book, boring, hard to get through, and boring. I would have enjoyed the book much more if it had ended before this chapter. The first several chapters were interesting, relevant, and presented information in an easy to understand if perhaps over simplified and redundant way."
167,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/649480-adam-jacobson,3,"I’m fascinated by the mind/brain problem. How do we get from a set of molecules to consciousness? Probably why I used to find Nachmanides on Genesis 1:26 so inspiring even if I no longer feel it’s intellectually enough by any stretch of the imagination. That’s why I’ve started Daniel Dennett’s consciousness explained several times although I’ve never been able to get through all the way (even if it did lead me to several other really more accessible reads along the way.That said, this is solid overview of what Johnson calls “recreational neuroscience”. He covers most of the major questions that would interest a lay person in the subject. Like what does it be to “be hormonal”, or what do we mean by our real self when we feel the conflict between our emotional limbic brain and our rational neocortex. All good stuff. Still, while a good overview, there wasn’t anything really new for me here unlike his recent Where Good Ideas Come From which I thought was just brilliant.So, if you’re fairly new to the subject of “recreational neuroscience”, it’s a good read. But if you’ve read in this area before, you’ll get a good review a few interesting insights but nothing really new. "
168,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1167923-patrick,5,"Given the opportunity to watch the inner workings of his own brain, Steven Johnson jumps at the chance. He reveals the results in Mind Wide Open, an engaging and personal account of his foray into edgy brain science. In the 21st century, Johnson observes, we have become used to ideas such as ""adrenaline rushes"" and ""serotonin levels,"" without really recognizing that complex neurobiology has become a commonplace thing to talk about. He sees recent laboratory revelations about the brain as crucial for understanding ourselves and our psyches in new, post-Freudian ways. Readers shy about slapping electrodes on their own temples can get a vicarious scientific thrill as Johnson tries out empathy tests, neurofeedback, and fMRI scans. The results paint a distinct picture of the author, and uncover general brain secrets at the same time. Memory, fear, love, alertness--all the multitude of states housed in our brains are shown to be the results of chemical and electrical interactions constantly fed and changed by input from our senses.

One of the things that would nearly sway me would be if it gave me a change to do and be all of the things there just isn’t time in one life to be and do. "
194,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/356012-michael,5,"In a nutshell, this is Johnson’s story about his foray into locating the secrets of the/his human brain (at least per available technology circa 2003) with the ultimate goals of both offering his audience a basic understanding of the chemical nature of mental activity and reframing Freudian thought in the context of a more sophisticated understanding of these processes (positioning the Freudian model as essentially empirical and necessarily metaphorical as a distant precursor to certain technologies at our disposal today).As horrible as this description might sound, Johnson is typically an engaging writer, so I went for it. I was not disappointed. His narrative follows a series of research “discoveries” such as the “Attention Trainer” neurofeedback helmut, utilized to analyze and possibly treat the omnipresent ADD syndrome (I can’t help but think of Ferris Bueller’s Principal cycling through the suburbs) and the two-foot diameter fMRI tube that enables brain slice imaging to locate neural hot spots as they relate to different mental tasks (sounds most uncomfortable). Discussions of the role of the amygdala and brain chemicals such as oxytocin are articulated through a personalized lens (instilling his fear instinct as 9/11 unfolded blocks away and enabling his wife’s “tending instinct” towards their baby, respectively). It’s all quite interesting and well worth the 30 cent late fee.He also mentions the Simon Baron-Cohen Autism Quotient Test. If you personally sense a certain social retardation – regardless of phone number memorization skills – I would warn you to refrain from Googling this one."
195,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147818-john-wiswell,3,"Johnson brings understandable, conversational language to one of the most imposing and important sciences of the modern time: the study of the brain. He's upfront about reducing his subject to a few chemicals and parts of the brain, making the five major chapters a sort of sturdy introduction to neuroscience. What he picks are some of the most fascinating bits, like oxytocin, a chemical found in high doses in the brains of new couples and women who have recently given birth. Is this the love drug? Johnson cites a scientist who hesitates at such oversimplification, but spends much more time suggesting it's a big part of what keeps people enthralled. He's a positive guy and sees something important in each of his subjects, be it brain chemistry, evolutionary psychology or the notes of Sigmund Freud. Johnson subjects himself to fMRI and MRI, reading experiments and videogames that challenge him to move a wheel with thought alone. His interests span just as wide, trying to explain how fear, love and music became so important in minds, the range of the placebo effect, men and women's hormone shifts, drug use and what the brain looks like when it's come up with a new idea. Not all of his arguments are convincing (like the sales pitch for the merits of poor, maligned Freudianism in the Conclusion), but Johnson illuminates much in this book."
196,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3023275-audiaa,3,"3.5 starsI enjoyed reading most of this book and learned a few things I didn't know about the brain and topics such as the fight or flight response, biofeed back, being in ""the zone"", and how hormones affect behavior. This book is mostly written for a lay audience, but there were occasional complicated science words thrown in to remind us that the topic was supposed to be hard. The metaphors and examples that the author used to explain some of the complex topics were useful, but on the other hand, the same examples were used over and over. Wind = broken window, clear sky = plane crash disaster. I would have liked to see more diverse examples that might be more relevant to a diverse audience (and to help us generals the concepts a little more). I would defiantly recommend that you stop reading before the ""conclusion"" chapter. This very long chapter tires to integrate Freud into modern brain theory (some concepts covered previously in the book and other that weren't). I found most of this information irrelevant to the rest of the book, boring, hard to get through, and boring. I would have enjoyed the book much more if it had ended before this chapter. The first several chapters were interesting, relevant, and presented information in an easy to understand if perhaps over simplified and redundant way."
197,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/649480-adam-jacobson,3,"I’m fascinated by the mind/brain problem. How do we get from a set of molecules to consciousness? Probably why I used to find Nachmanides on Genesis 1:26 so inspiring even if I no longer feel it’s intellectually enough by any stretch of the imagination. That’s why I’ve started Daniel Dennett’s consciousness explained several times although I’ve never been able to get through all the way (even if it did lead me to several other really more accessible reads along the way.That said, this is solid overview of what Johnson calls “recreational neuroscience”. He covers most of the major questions that would interest a lay person in the subject. Like what does it be to “be hormonal”, or what do we mean by our real self when we feel the conflict between our emotional limbic brain and our rational neocortex. All good stuff. Still, while a good overview, there wasn’t anything really new for me here unlike his recent Where Good Ideas Come From which I thought was just brilliant.So, if you’re fairly new to the subject of “recreational neuroscience”, it’s a good read. But if you’ve read in this area before, you’ll get a good review a few interesting insights but nothing really new. "
198,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1167923-patrick,5,"Given the opportunity to watch the inner workings of his own brain, Steven Johnson jumps at the chance. He reveals the results in Mind Wide Open, an engaging and personal account of his foray into edgy brain science. In the 21st century, Johnson observes, we have become used to ideas such as ""adrenaline rushes"" and ""serotonin levels,"" without really recognizing that complex neurobiology has become a commonplace thing to talk about. He sees recent laboratory revelations about the brain as crucial for understanding ourselves and our psyches in new, post-Freudian ways. Readers shy about slapping electrodes on their own temples can get a vicarious scientific thrill as Johnson tries out empathy tests, neurofeedback, and fMRI scans. The results paint a distinct picture of the author, and uncover general brain secrets at the same time. Memory, fear, love, alertness--all the multitude of states housed in our brains are shown to be the results of chemical and electrical interactions constantly fed and changed by input from our senses. Mind Wide Open both satisfies curiosity and provokes more questions, leaving readers wondering about their own gray matter. --Therese Littleton"

While perhaps not as personal as when Mary Roach had sex with her husband during a functional MRI in Bonk: the Curious Coupling of Science and Sex, I think Johnson deserves some credit.Mind Wide Open has some really great insights into recent discoveries in neuroscience, explained in a clear, practical manner. Johnson describes behaviors of his own that he wants to understand better, and then describes the underlying brain chemistry that explains those behaviors. This leads him to neurofeedback practitioners, cognitive scientists, psychologists, and, yes, sticking his head in a functional MRI while mentally rewriting the text from a chapter of this book.Hopefully, I'll remember the following brain chemicals from the book.

It amazed me to hear the science of the neurochemistry behind fear, love, and even laughter. Johnson gives so much information that was unbeknownst to me prior to reading. If you are interested in learning about why we feel what we feel and why we react the way that we react, then I strongly recommend. I loved to read about something called ""flash memory"" which is an immediate response to fear. I liked learning about why this occurs and how it affects other people. I really liked reading all of Johnson's personal experiences and how his puts the information into real life scenarios and puts it into perspective. Some questions that I have for someone who has read the book: - What was the most intriguing chapter for you and what did you like learning about the most?- Do you completely agree with Johnson’s input about gender differences and how genders organize stress differently and how males put on more stress than females ? - In what ways did/do you use this information in everyday life?"

The answer: a lot, but we still have much to discover about the complicated circuits run by experience, memory, emotion, and brain chemistry. This topic could have scared away non-scientists, but Johnson (a non-scientist) explains technical terms clearly and enthusiastically, using personal examples to illustrate key concepts. Some readers might question his claims; does a baby's crying result more from chemistry than emotion? Despite its uncertain conclusions and relevance to, say, PTSD, Mind Wide Open is an excellent introduction to the complex feedback system that defines our daily experiences. This is an excerpt from a review published in Bookmarks magazine."
202,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/349264-tracey,3,"Using himself as a subject, Johnson explores the current state of brain/mind exploration, using biofeedback, MRIs and chemical analysis, among other tools. He examines what creative thinking looks like in the brain, improves his facial expression reading skills and comes to grips with his own use of humour as a coping skill, as well as learns why sunny days and high, whistling noises are alert triggers for him. The first few chapters are the strongest, as they document his experiments on himself; while the remainder of the book is more traditional, using existing research to support his thesis. He dedicates over 40 pages to his notes, and includes a bibliography and index as well. An ""engaging travelogue from the frontiers of human brain science"" - I'd definitely recommend it to anyone interested in this area of research."

Sometimes I thought Johnson was superficial. In a fascinating chapter on face and affect recognition, he introduces Simon Baron-Cohen as an authoritive expert without barely a mention of the controversy stirred up by the psychologist's 'male brain' theory of autism. I found Norman Doidge's similar briefing, 'The Brain That Changes Itself' the better of the two books, although 'Mind Wide Open' did help me to solidify background knowledge and gave me a list of sources to go to in the future.

I could never imagine thinking this. The more you learn, the more you can appreciate how magical it actually is! Case in point: Dawkins' Unweaving the Rainbow. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQAPmA...Off point, but still a good video about atheism and scientific thought about our purpose: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptwEV0..."

Johnson effectively teaches about the mind without relying on jargon that baffles the reader. Of course, as a first trip into brain science, the book is a brief and flitting survey of many topics, but I found it fascinating. One of the lessons I learned is that our memory, and even how our brains process information, is bound and heavily guided by emotion, and emotion can shape what we learn and how we learn. Recommended for anyone interested in neuroscience, psychology, or a users guide to brains. One caveat: since this is the first book I've read about neuroscience, I can't say how accurate the information is."
207,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4230067-mohammad-abdelkhalek,4,"this book takes you on a journey through the reverse engineering of mind reading, adrenalin rushes, fear, love and attention, it gives non-scientists an idea of how the brain works though everyday activities. The book is also very rich in the famous ""oh shit"" moments, when you read about an idea that you've thought about for quite a long time (i was really amazed when the author started talking about the shivers of pleasure we get from listening to good music). Finally, the book makes a comparison between the Freudian model of the psyche, and the model proposed by neuroscience, assessing the Freudian model and finding the things that we can still learn from and the things that are more or less obsolete. the book is also very good in terms of entertainment, definitely a must read."
208,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1537951-abbey,5,"Forget free will! Free will is an illusion. I'm convinced that we are about 90% programmed, hard-wired to do what we do based on neuroscience and conditioning by events and genes. You think you make your choices? No, your gut bacteria give you cravings. Your genes push you mightily toward one preference rather than another. Your culture provides a framework within which you function. Your amygdala tells you what to feel, and how deeply to feel about it. You are a bundle of predetermined actions. About 90% of what you do is totally predictable, and probably even a higher percentage if we had more data. This book is a bit dated now, but it's a very readable exploration into neuroscience. "

I'm not sure if this is the same Steven Johnson that wrote Ghost Map, but I like neuroscience so I figured I'd check it out. I have to admit that I did not finish this book. I didn't time my wait list at the library well and ended up with a bunch of books at once and this one got pushed to the bottom. What I read was interesting, well-researched, and very comprehensible by the layperson. Maybe I'll check it out again in the future to finish it, but it wasn't so engrossing that I'm likely to get around to doing so."

254,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/356012-michael,5,"In a nutshell, this is Johnson’s story about his foray into locating the secrets of the/his human brain (at least per available technology circa 2003) with the ultimate goals of both offering his audience a basic understanding of the chemical nature of mental activity and reframing Freudian thought in the context of a more sophisticated understanding of these processes (positioning the Freudian model as essentially empirical and necessarily metaphorical as a distant precursor to certain technologies at our disposal today).As horrible as this description might sound, Johnson is typically an engaging writer, so I went for it. I was not disappointed. His narrative follows a series of research “discoveries” such as the “Attention Trainer” neurofeedback helmut, utilized to analyze and possibly treat the omnipresent ADD syndrome (I can’t help but think of Ferris Bueller’s Principal cycling through the suburbs) and the two-foot diameter fMRI tube that enables brain slice imaging to locate neural hot spots as they relate to different mental tasks (sounds most uncomfortable). Discussions of the role of the amygdala and brain chemicals such as oxytocin are articulated through a personalized lens (instilling his fear instinct as 9/11 unfolded blocks away and enabling his wife’s “tending instinct” towards their baby, respectively). It’s all quite interesting and well worth the 30 cent late fee.He also mentions the Simon Baron-Cohen Autism Quotient Test. If you personally sense a certain social retardation – regardless of phone number memorization skills – I would warn you to refrain from Googling this one."
255,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147818-john-wiswell,3,"Johnson brings understandable, conversational language to one of the most imposing and important sciences of the modern time: the study of the brain. He's upfront about reducing his subject to a few chemicals and parts of the brain, making the five major chapters a sort of sturdy introduction to neuroscience. What he picks are some of the most fascinating bits, like oxytocin, a chemical found in high doses in the brains of new couples and women who have recently given birth. Is this the love drug? Johnson cites a scientist who hesitates at such oversimplification, but spends much more time suggesting it's a big part of what keeps people enthralled. He's a positive guy and sees something important in each of his subjects, be it brain chemistry, evolutionary psychology or the notes of Sigmund Freud. Johnson subjects himself to fMRI and MRI, reading experiments and videogames that challenge him to move a wheel with thought alone. His interests span just as wide, trying to explain how fear, love and music became so important in minds, the range of the placebo effect, men and women's hormone shifts, drug use and what the brain looks like when it's come up with a new idea. Not all of his arguments are convincing (like the sales pitch for the merits of poor, maligned Freudianism in the Conclusion), but Johnson illuminates much in this book."
256,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3023275-audiaa,3,"3.5 starsI enjoyed reading most of this book and learned a few things I didn't know about the brain and topics such as the fight or flight response, biofeed back, being in ""the zone"", and how hormones affect behavior. This book is mostly written for a lay audience, but there were occasional complicated science words thrown in to remind us that the topic was supposed to be hard. The metaphors and examples that the author used to explain some of the complex topics were useful, but on the other hand, the same examples were used over and over. Wind = broken window, clear sky = plane crash disaster. I would have liked to see more diverse examples that might be more relevant to a diverse audience (and to help us generals the concepts a little more). I would defiantly recommend that you stop reading before the ""conclusion"" chapter. This very long chapter tires to integrate Freud into modern brain theory (some concepts covered previously in the book and other that weren't). I found most of this information irrelevant to the rest of the book, boring, hard to get through, and boring. I would have enjoyed the book much more if it had ended before this chapter. The first several chapters were interesting, relevant, and presented information in an easy to understand if perhaps over simplified and redundant way."
257,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/649480-adam-jacobson,3,"I’m fascinated by the mind/brain problem. How do we get from a set of molecules to consciousness? Probably why I used to find Nachmanides on Genesis 1:26 so inspiring even if I no longer feel it’s intellectually enough by any stretch of the imagination. That’s why I’ve started Daniel Dennett’s consciousness explained several times although I’ve never been able to get through all the way (even if it did lead me to several other really more accessible reads along the way.That said, this is solid overview of what Johnson calls “recreational neuroscience”. He covers most of the major questions that would interest a lay person in the subject. Like what does it be to “be hormonal”, or what do we mean by our real self when we feel the conflict between our emotional limbic brain and our rational neocortex. All good stuff. Still, while a good overview, there wasn’t anything really new for me here unlike his recent Where Good Ideas Come From which I thought was just brilliant.So, if you’re fairly new to the subject of “recreational neuroscience”, it’s a good read. But if you’ve read in this area before, you’ll get a good review a few interesting insights but nothing really new. "
258,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1167923-patrick,5,"Given the opportunity to watch the inner workings of his own brain, Steven Johnson jumps at the chance. He reveals the results in Mind Wide Open, an engaging and personal account of his foray into edgy brain science. In the 21st century, Johnson observes, we have become used to ideas such as ""adrenaline rushes"" and ""serotonin levels,"" without really recognizing that complex neurobiology has become a commonplace thing to talk about. He sees recent laboratory revelations about the brain as crucial for understanding ourselves and our psyches in new, post-Freudian ways. Readers shy about slapping electrodes on their own temples can get a vicarious scientific thrill as Johnson tries out empathy tests, neurofeedback, and fMRI scans. The results paint a distinct picture of the author, and uncover general brain secrets at the same time. Memory, fear, love, alertness--all the multitude of states housed in our brains are shown to be the results of chemical and electrical interactions constantly fed and changed by input from our senses. Mind Wide Open both satisfies curiosity and provokes more questions, leaving readers wondering about their own gray matter. --Therese Littleton"
259,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11550691-robert,4,"I like the first hand, get involved, stick my head into a large object style of science writing that characterizes Mind Wide Open. While perhaps not as personal as when Mary Roach had sex with her husband during a functional MRI in Bonk: the Curious Coupling of Science and Sex, I think Johnson deserves some credit.Mind Wide Open has some really great insights into recent discoveries in neuroscience, explained in a clear, practical manner. Johnson describes behaviors of his own that he wants to understand better, and then describes the underlying brain chemistry that explains those behaviors. This leads him to neurofeedback practitioners, cognitive scientists, psychologists, and, yes, sticking his head in a functional MRI while mentally rewriting the text from a chapter of this book.Hopefully, I'll remember the following brain chemicals from the book. If not, I'll have to read my own review.serotonin - modulating rejection sensitivity and social confidencedopamine - regulates pursuit of new experiences and surpriseendorphins and norepinephrine - regulates pleasure seeking and reward dependencecortisol - stressoxytocin - drive to create emotional bonds"
260,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59469277-alannah-morse,4,"This book was amazing and truly gave me an inside look of the human brain. It amazed me to hear the science of the neurochemistry behind fear, love, and even laughter. Johnson gives so much information that was unbeknownst to me prior to reading. If you are interested in learning about why we feel what we feel and why we react the way that we react, then I strongly recommend. I loved to read about something called ""flash memory"" which is an immediate response to fear. I liked learning about why this occurs and how it affects other people. I really liked reading all of Johnson's personal experiences and how his puts the information into real life scenarios and puts it into perspective. Some questions that I have for someone who has read the book: - What was the most intriguing chapter for you and what did you like learning about the most?- Do you completely agree with Johnson’s input about gender differences and how genders organize stress differently and how males put on more stress than females ? - In what ways did/do you use this information in everyday life?"
261,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1008236-bookmarks-magazine,0,"What would you learn if you ""could see what your brain looked like when it was remembering a long-forgotten childhood experience, or listening to a song, or conceiving a good idea?"" The answer: a lot, but we still have much to discover about the complicated circuits run by experience, memory, emotion, and brain chemistry. This topic could have scared away non-scientists, but Johnson (a non-scientist) explains technical terms clearly and enthusiastically, using personal examples to illustrate key concepts. Some readers might question his claims; does a baby's crying result more from chemistry than emotion? Despite its uncertain conclusions and relevance to, say, PTSD, Mind Wide Open is an excellent introduction to the complex feedback system that defines our daily experiences. This is an excerpt from a review published in Bookmarks magazine."
262,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/349264-tracey,3,"Using himself as a subject, Johnson explores the current state of brain/mind exploration, using biofeedback, MRIs and chemical analysis, among other tools. He examines what creative thinking looks like in the brain, improves his facial expression reading skills and comes to grips with his own use of humour as a coping skill, as well as learns why sunny days and high, whistling noises are alert triggers for him. The first few chapters are the strongest, as they document his experiments on himself; while the remainder of the book is more traditional, using existing research to support his thesis. He dedicates over 40 pages to his notes, and includes a bibliography and index as well. An ""engaging travelogue from the frontiers of human brain science"" - I'd definitely recommend it to anyone interested in this area of research."

286,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3023275-audiaa,3,"3.5 starsI enjoyed reading most of this book and learned a few things I didn't know about the brain and topics such as the fight or flight response, biofeed back, being in ""the zone"", and how hormones affect behavior. This book is mostly written for a lay audience, but there were occasional complicated science words thrown in to remind us that the topic was supposed to be hard. The metaphors and examples that the author used to explain some of the complex topics were useful, but on the other hand, the same examples were used over and over. Wind = broken window, clear sky = plane crash disaster. I would have liked to see more diverse examples that might be more relevant to a diverse audience (and to help us generals the concepts a little more). I would defiantly recommend that you stop reading before the ""conclusion"" chapter. This very long chapter tires to integrate Freud into modern brain theory (some concepts covered previously in the book and other that weren't). I found most of this information irrelevant to the rest of the book, boring, hard to get through, and boring. I would have enjoyed the book much more if it had ended before this chapter. The first several chapters were interesting, relevant, and presented information in an easy to understand if perhaps over simplified and redundant way."
287,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/649480-adam-jacobson,3,"I’m fascinated by the mind/brain problem. How do we get from a set of molecules to consciousness? Probably why I used to find Nachmanides on Genesis 1:26 so inspiring even if I no longer feel it’s intellectually enough by any stretch of the imagination. That’s why I’ve started Daniel Dennett’s consciousness explained several times although I’ve never been able to get through all the way (even if it did lead me to several other really more accessible reads along the way.That said, this is solid overview of what Johnson calls “recreational neuroscience”. He covers most of the major questions that would interest a lay person in the subject. Like what does it be to “be hormonal”, or what do we mean by our real self when we feel the conflict between our emotional limbic brain and our rational neocortex. All good stuff. Still, while a good overview, there wasn’t anything really new for me here unlike his recent Where Good Ideas Come From which I thought was just brilliant.So, if you’re fairly new to the subject of “recreational neuroscience”, it’s a good read. But if you’ve read in this area before, you’ll get a good review a few interesting insights but nothing really new. "
288,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1167923-patrick,5,"Given the opportunity to watch the inner workings of his own brain, Steven Johnson jumps at the chance. He reveals the results in Mind Wide Open, an engaging and personal account of his foray into edgy brain science. In the 21st century, Johnson observes, we have become used to ideas such as ""adrenaline rushes"" and ""serotonin levels,"" without really recognizing that complex neurobiology has become a commonplace thing to talk about. He sees recent laboratory revelations about the brain as crucial for understanding ourselves and our psyches in new, post-Freudian ways. Readers shy about slapping electrodes on their own temples can get a vicarious scientific thrill as Johnson tries out empathy tests, neurofeedback, and fMRI scans. The results paint a distinct picture of the author, and uncover general brain secrets at the same time. Memory, fear, love, alertness--all the multitude of states housed in our brains are shown to be the results of chemical and electrical interactions constantly fed and changed by input from our senses. Mind Wide Open both satisfies curiosity and provokes more questions, leaving readers wondering about their own gray matter. --Therese Littleton"
289,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11550691-robert,4,"I like the first hand, get involved, stick my head into a large object style of science writing that characterizes Mind Wide Open. While perhaps not as personal as when Mary Roach had sex with her husband during a functional MRI in Bonk: the Curious Coupling of Science and Sex, I think Johnson deserves some credit.Mind Wide Open has some really great insights into recent discoveries in neuroscience, explained in a clear, practical manner. Johnson describes behaviors of his own that he wants to understand better, and then describes the underlying brain chemistry that explains those behaviors. This leads him to neurofeedback practitioners, cognitive scientists, psychologists, and, yes, sticking his head in a functional MRI while mentally rewriting the text from a chapter of this book.Hopefully, I'll remember the following brain chemicals from the book. If not, I'll have to read my own review.serotonin - modulating rejection sensitivity and social confidencedopamine - regulates pursuit of new experiences and surpriseendorphins and norepinephrine - regulates pleasure seeking and reward dependencecortisol - stressoxytocin - drive to create emotional bonds"
290,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59469277-alannah-morse,4,"This book was amazing and truly gave me an inside look of the human brain. It amazed me to hear the science of the neurochemistry behind fear, love, and even laughter. Johnson gives so much information that was unbeknownst to me prior to reading. If you are interested in learning about why we feel what we feel and why we react the way that we react, then I strongly recommend. I loved to read about something called ""flash memory"" which is an immediate response to fear. I liked learning about why this occurs and how it affects other people. I really liked reading all of Johnson's personal experiences and how his puts the information into real life scenarios and puts it into perspective. Some questions that I have for someone who has read the book: - What was the most intriguing chapter for you and what did you like learning about the most?- Do you completely agree with Johnson’s input about gender differences and how genders organize stress differently and how males put on more stress than females ? - In what ways did/do you use this information in everyday life?"
291,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1008236-bookmarks-magazine,0,"What would you learn if you ""could see what your brain looked like when it was remembering a long-forgotten childhood experience, or listening to a song, or conceiving a good idea?"" The answer: a lot, but we still have much to discover about the complicated circuits run by experience, memory, emotion, and brain chemistry. This topic could have scared away non-scientists, but Johnson (a non-scientist) explains technical terms clearly and enthusiastically, using personal examples to illustrate key concepts. Some readers might question his claims; does a baby's crying result more from chemistry than emotion? Despite its uncertain conclusions and relevance to, say, PTSD, Mind Wide Open is an excellent introduction to the complex feedback system that defines our daily experiences. This is an excerpt from a review published in Bookmarks magazine."
292,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/349264-tracey,3,"Using himself as a subject, Johnson explores the current state of brain/mind exploration, using biofeedback, MRIs and chemical analysis, among other tools. He examines what creative thinking looks like in the brain, improves his facial expression reading skills and comes to grips with his own use of humour as a coping skill, as well as learns why sunny days and high, whistling noises are alert triggers for him. The first few chapters are the strongest, as they document his experiments on himself; while the remainder of the book is more traditional, using existing research to support his thesis. He dedicates over 40 pages to his notes, and includes a bibliography and index as well. An ""engaging travelogue from the frontiers of human brain science"" - I'd definitely recommend it to anyone interested in this area of research."
293,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1750845-darya,4,"A nice introduction into neuroscience of emotions and social interactions: how and why we become afraid of presumably harmless things and what we can do to overcome these fears, how we ""read"" other people, neurochemistry of love and attachment etc. An easy to read account of the author's experiences with biofeedback, fMRI etc. and his interviews with prominent neurobiologists and behavioral biologists such as Joseph LeDoux, Antonio Damasio etc. The book is by no means overwhelmed by scientific terms, the author consciously kept it as simple as possible, so it should be a pleasure to read for a lay person.To summarize, if you're curious about neuroscience of social interactions but don't have a biology background, look no further than this book."
294,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/757602-lars-guthrie,3,"If you haven't read much about neuroscience's leaps in research on the brain over the past couple of decades and the evidence drawn from that research that forcefully makes the case that our brains are plastic organisms, this is an easy-to-read introduction. Sometimes I thought Johnson was superficial. In a fascinating chapter on face and affect recognition, he introduces Simon Baron-Cohen as an authoritive expert without barely a mention of the controversy stirred up by the psychologist's 'male brain' theory of autism. I found Norman Doidge's similar briefing, 'The Brain That Changes Itself' the better of the two books, although 'Mind Wide Open' did help me to solidify background knowledge and gave me a list of sources to go to in the future.

I could never imagine thinking this. The more you learn, the more you can appreciate how magical it actually is! Case in point: Dawkins' Unweaving the Rainbow. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQAPmA...Off point, but still a good video about atheism and scientific thought about our purpose: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptwEV0..."
296,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2295046-dwain,3,"If neuroscience sounds interesting to you...you're probably a little odd and you will enjoy this book. Johnson effectively teaches about the mind without relying on jargon that baffles the reader. Of course, as a first trip into brain science, the book is a brief and flitting survey of many topics, but I found it fascinating. One of the lessons I learned is that our memory, and even how our brains process information, is bound and heavily guided by emotion, and emotion can shape what we learn and how we learn. Recommended for anyone interested in neuroscience, psychology, or a users guide to brains. One caveat: since this is the first book I've read about neuroscience, I can't say how accurate the information is."
297,0743241665,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4230067-mohammad-abdelkhalek,4,"this book takes you on a journey through the reverse engineering of mind reading, adrenalin rushes, fear, love and attention, it gives non-scientists an idea of how the brain works though everyday activities. The book is also very rich in the famous ""oh shit"" moments, when you read about an idea that you've thought about for quite a long time (i was really amazed when the author started talking about the shivers of pleasure we get from listening to good music). Finally, the book makes a comparison between the Freudian model of the psyche, and the model proposed by neuroscience, assessing the Freudian model and finding the things that we can still learn from and the things that are more or less obsolete. the book is also very good in terms of entertainment, definitely a must read."

I'm convinced that we are about 90% programmed, hard-wired to do what we do based on neuroscience and conditioning by events and genes. You think you make your choices? No, your gut bacteria give you cravings. Your genes push you mightily toward one preference rather than another. Your culture provides a framework within which you function. Your amygdala tells you what to feel, and how deeply to feel about it. You are a bundle of predetermined actions. About 90% of what you do is totally predictable, and probably even a higher percentage if we had more data. This book is a bit dated now, but it's a very readable exploration into neuroscience. "

I'm not sure if this is the same Steven Johnson that wrote Ghost Map, but I like neuroscience so I figured I'd check it out. I have to admit that I did not finish this book. I didn't time my wait list at the library well and ended up with a bunch of books at once and this one got pushed to the bottom. What I read was interesting, well-researched, and very comprehensible by the layperson. Maybe I'll check it out again in the future to finish it, but it wasn't so engrossing that I'm likely to get around to doing so."
