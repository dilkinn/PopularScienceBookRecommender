0,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"This book wasn't a blog but it might as well have been. It is a series of essays on different body parts, from the head down. The author concentrates on the medical, with anecdotes, always interesting, but also brings in what history, mythology, different cultures and even literature have to say about that part of the anatomy. It reminds me a little of F. González-Crussí, especially Notes of an Anatomist, but González-Crussí's meditations were more deeply philosophical and beautifully, classically written. That isn't to say that Gavin Francis can't write, he can, this is a really good book, but not one that will go down in literature as a classic. Rant on disappeared books and librarians who want to make things comfortable for white folk (view spoiler)[WTF is going on? I added this book and read it about six weeks ago. It should still be in currently reading but has been deleted from my bookshelves. No point in writing about it in Feedback, I either just get ignored or 'we need more details please contact Support'. Contacting Support gets some cut and pasted anodyne reply as I've complained about this issue time and again. I can even 'prove' it in that I have books on my exported bookshelves files that are no longer on my GR shelves, some even have likes/comments and some people actually remember. So what is happening to these disappeared books? I believe it is librarians doing whatever it is that causes this. I don't do any Librarian stuff any more unless it affects my books or I see something really egregious. But you can't argue with the Librarians, nor will the Chief Librarian or Support help out there. I've had a long. ongoing battle with GR Librarians and Support about The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn being combined with Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: Robotic Edition as they say the books are similar enough to be the same book.The authors of this crap 'robotic edition' say they changed all the people into robots so that teachers wouldn't have any problem with the white boys (Tom and Huckleberry) and the slave (Jim). I can only presume that all these librarians and support staff are White and do not want the evils of slavery as committed by White people to be embarrassing to teachers who think like them. Mark Twain didn't think this way and this White-washing is appalling.But why would Adventures in Human Being have been deleted from my bookshelves? (hide spoiler)]"

We take a journey with Dr. Gavin Franciswho shares with us his experience as a doctor... sharing real case studies of ways the body has been imagined and portrayed over the millennia. In one of my favorite books of short stories for this year- 2015. ""The Wonder Garden"", by Lauren Acampora... there was a story about a man curious to know if it were possiblefor a person to touch their own brain. (such a good story)... but I've been forever more curious myself about the brain....& the physical handling of it myself - since then. Somehow, I had it 'wired' in my thinking that a doctor working on the brain must require ten times more 'dexterous' abilities than any other type of doctor ... so I found this very interesting to read:""People tend to think of brain surgeons as being very dexterous"", the neurosurgeon replied, ""but it's the plastic surgeons and microvascular surgeons, who do that meticulous stuff"". He indicated the slide on the wall: a patients brain with with an aerial array of steelrods, clamps, and wires. ""The rest of us just go gardening.""Going through the body.. We travel from the brain...head: eyes, face,ears...learning about the Different developments with artificial lenses, palsy of the face muscles, vertigo...etc..The chest: heart, lungs, breasts, ....our upper limb... Shoulder & arms... Wrists & hands. It was fascinating to me ....( awful too)... when an injured motorcyclist was rushed into emergency...and reading the entire process. The man not only broke his shoulder..,but his right arm was paralyzed. The care...conversation... treatment.. between Dr Gavin and patient had me hanging off the seat of my chair... ( as I struggle to move my right foot from an ankle replacement surgery 2.5 months ago-- and my husband who still can't make a fist with his right hand yet-- after once having 11 pins inserted to fix broken bones.. With another surgery on the way...YES... It was all a little fascinating to read. Dr. Gavin also talked about the book The Illiad... saying what an accurate observer of anatomythe author was .... Some people called him a ""batterfield medic"". (injured warriors)....which then lead into his sharing about his training with military doctors---( for which he had always had his suspicions about), having studied emergency medicine himself and as a GP...But as I read more... saw how his respect for military doctors was elevated... so was mine. It was the military doctors that taught him 'hands-on' trauma surgeries. AMEN for that!!Kidneys, liver, the intestines, pelvis, childbirth....etc etc...this book is packed filled with a little something of interest to anyone with a body. Dr. Gavin Francis's humanity so very lovely....This book too! "
2,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31467977-tom-quinn,5,"Absolutely magnificent. A stirring, stimulating read and deeply engrossing. Dr. Francis draws on a wealth of experience without coming across as bragging, and invites consideration of what the human experience is all about with sage observations of the various facets of our human anatomy, the parts that make us work and, more intriguingly, what happens when those parts don't work. It is by turns philosophical and whimsical, vacillating from profound to lighthearted with an almost poetic delivery informed by years of clinical training. The ties between anatomy and the humanities are explored with a refined dignity that impresses and excites, beautifully showing our dual nature: body and soul intertwined.5 stars out of 5. Of particular interest to me was the chapter about the shoulder and arms which shares an incredible walkthrough of The Illiad's accuracy with regard to battlefield wounds and trauma."
3,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39595324-jay-green,2,"In the 1980s, Picador brought out a bunch of books featuring anecdotes about the human body by the Mexican physician F. Gonzalez-Crussi. I lapped them up. Apart from the suspicious overuse of the word ""guerdon,"" the stories were well told, interesting, educational, and sometimes a little awe-inspiring. Gavin Francis's book follows in the same tradition, but without any of the enthusiasm. These are drily recounted chapters with the necessary exhibitions of erudition but none of the wit or charm of Gonzalez-Crussi's books. I may have picked up one or two novel facts about the human body but I don't think they'll remain with me for long, so mundane were they. Gonzalez-Crussi, by contrast, even made the rectum sound majestic."
4,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie,4," BOTWhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05xd44cDescription: Gavin Francis leads us round a cultural map of the body - an adventure in what it means to be human. Taking in health and illness, and offering insights on everything from the ribbed surface of the brain to the unique engineering of the foot.Drawing on his own experiences as a physician and writer, he blends first-hand case studies with reflections on the way the body has been imagined and portrayed over millennia. 1/5: Gavin begins with the moment, age 19, when he first held a human brain. 2/5: Francis has dissected many human faces during medical training, and as a demonstrator of anatomy, but he has never lost the sense of privilege that doing so brings. Our faces are key to our human identity - when faces are available, we pay more attention to them than to any part of the visual world. When our ability to use our facial muscles to convey our emotions is harmed, as in Bell's palsy, it can be socially devastating. But even when a face is damaged, it's still vital to our sense of self. 3/5: A serious motorbike crash brings a young soldier to A&E with a badly injured shoulder. His arm is paralysed, and may not recover.Since Homer wrote the Iliad almost three thousand years ago, military strategists have understood the power of wounds to the brachial plexus, the network of nerves behind our collarbones. Our 'arms' are both parts of our body, and weapons of war. 4/5: The liver is a mysterious organ - essential to life, multifarious in its actions, its tissue unusual in being able to regenerate.Ancient cultures used the livers of sacrificed animals to predict events; Biblical kings planned wars according to what the liver foretold. Livers appear in the proverbs of eastern Europe and in the folk tales gathered by the Brothers Grimm. And when a young gardener scratches her finger on a thorn and falls into a coma, it might be her liver which saves her life. 5/5: His journey ends at the foot - a marvel of engineering often overlooked by anatomists and medical students.It's thanks to the arches of our feet that we stepped into our humanity more than two million years ago.Read by Bill Paterson"
5,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"Gavin Francis is a surgeon, an emergency room specialist, and a family physician. He takes the reader on a quick tour of the human body, from head to toe. He blends together anecdotes from his personal experience with literature, science, and history. This is not a comprehensive guide to human anatomy. Each chapter is but a cursory glance at some body part. But, as a result, the book is highly entertaining and engaging. Francis avoids excessive jargon, and brings his personal touch to each subject.The book is filled with surprising facts that would make for great party conversations. For example, until the late 1700’s, it was believed that human conception required simultaneous male and female orgasms. The liver is the only organ that can be regenerated, if part of it is lost. Francis also helped instill in me a deep respect for military doctors. They are under intense pressure, yet their experience has been very helpful to civilian doctors as well. I also enjoyed the numerous links Francis drew to classical literature and folk tales. For example, the descriptions of injuries related in the Iliad are very accurate. As another example, he relates a serious infection a woman got from brush with a thorn bush with the tale of Sleeping Beauty.You will learn some amazing facts about the human body from this book, even though you won’t get a coherent understanding of it. In addition, you will be entertained by beautiful writing and personal observations that show a deeply sensitive writer and doctor."
6,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,3,"As a teenager, I read Asimov's classic Fantastic Voyage and that was an absolutely fascinating journey through the human body (in a miniaturized submarine!). In his own way, Gavin Francis does much the same thing: he travels along the body from head to feet, taking a close look at organs and body parts. Francis is a Scottish surgeon with a lot of practical experience. But he certainly did not turn this book into a dry, encyclopaedic exposé. On the contrary, Francis writes very smoothly, provides a minimum of technical-scientific information and focuses mainly on very concrete cases of people who have a problem with a certain body part. Those scenes are alternately intriguing, endearing and sometimes also hard to stomach, for example when he describes brain surgery or the dying process of an old, demented woman with cancer. Francis does not really dive deeply into the matter, but his approach makes you all the more impressed by the complex, fascinating machine that is our body. But that brings us to a critical footnote: Francis does indeed approach the body as a machine, disregarding the whole domain of consciousness and of psychology. He opts for a purely clinical focus, at least in his descriptions. Is that reductionist? Yes, of course it is, but if you read his case studies, you will notice that fortunately (and necessarily) he also takes into account the psychological aspect in his medical practice. Because let's face it: it is an essential part of the ""functioning"" of a person. If you can live with the limitations of Francis's clinical focus, this is a very nice read!"
7,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,4,"Exceptional poetic, lyrical (quotes too by past poets and philosophers included)detailing of the human body. Human body systems are equated to geographic shapes and movements of wider nature through the treatments of their own special workings. Dr. Francis starts with the brain and moves on down to the last chapter on feet /toes. Lovely, peaceful, respect of awe poise is rare and exquisite! I've never come across something this aesthetic ""light"" let alone anything with this literary approach for ANY scientific or medical information book, treatise, dissertation. Passages that would fit more easily into emotive poems flow with adoration for the form. And within each tale is a different patient whose illness or condition reflects a difficulty within the pertinent detailed system.The doctor's gentleness! Gentle as can be managed under such perimeters for pain, strife, fear, joy or encompassing acceptance for ordeal or future outcome. This might be appreciated more by those who have little medical detail memory, but maybe not. It could be that those who work within these very spaces would love this one just as much.My favorite was the neck/shoulder chapter and his Iliad / Homer interface. This author has lead the most unusual adventurer life. He's traveled with his work and also changed entire medical venues more than a few times. He is the living antithesis of the Hilary Mantel quip re his profession. Very unusual person, quite beyond unusual doctor as his sensitivity is also literally acute.Very interesting read- and highly recommend."
8,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10393926-joe-mcnally,5,"I reviewed this book on Amazon's UK site. It's worth noting that the book, and my review, refer to the UK's National Health Service (the NHS), which makes many mistakes, but without it millions of lives in Britain would be seriously affected. For all its UK 'bias' (Dr, Francis lives and practices in Scotland, it is a book that will cross all boundaries and cultures, and I urge you to read it.Medicine men...I never quite know what to make of those I meet. Last year, in the early hours of an April morning, I sat alone against the rear wall and watched a young doctor sympathetically settle my wife into a bed in the intensive care unit. The ward was quiet. Away to my left was a small peacock of a man in glittering waistcoat that looked cut from a priest's vestments. I thought he was wearing spats, but as he approached, head up, better to see down his nose, I saw they were two tone, like golf shoes.The young doctor was telling the nurse what medication my wife needed when the peacock, still ten strides away, called out 'No!' And he took over, without even acknowledging his young colleague. I later discovered that this peacock of a surgeon had told my sister to 'get yourself home and empty your bowels', when she presented with severe abdominal pain. Three days later he was cutting cancer from her bowel.Then, as my wife's condition deteriorated, I was introduced to another surgeon, a man of humility and humanity, a man who did not patronise as he answered me straight:'What's the prognosis for my wife, please?''The next 24 hours will be crucial'''Worst case scenario?''We have had informal discussions of putting your wife on a ventilator.''What happens then?''...it is very difficult to come back from'Since then, I've taken a much greater interest in the way the body works and the way the minds of those who choose medicine as a profession work. Gavin Francis's book not only taught me about the body, but it gave me back some sanity and balance in the judgement of others. The drama of saving lives, of making decisions, of being 'somebody', attracts the peacocks, but what a salve it is to find that it has an irresistible pull too for people like Gavin Francis. You will be in turns transfixed and enchanted by Dr Francis's gradual uncloaking of the human body, not least by his skill in portraying without 'big words'.You'll learn not only about the bone and blood and meat of which we're made, but of how others, long dead, saw it - the Greeks, the Romans, the philosophers, and the great writers. And all of it as seamless as the body itself. You are not jerked from place to place, but led smoothly along with the expertise of a born writer as well as a great doctor. You will watch with enchanted horror the rapid deterioration of a dark-haired young woman whose brush with a rose thorn brought her long lost mother to her intensive care bedside. And while the mother waits with her taped-eyed, tubed and wired unconscious child, Gavin Francis links her story beautifully with that of Snow White and the beliefs of older days.John McEnroe's wife, the rock star, Patti Smith, finally discouraged him from trying to be a top guitarist by asking him, 'What are the chances of god giving you the talent to be the greatest tennis player in the world, and then adding some more to make you the greatest rock guitarist?'Nobody could ask such a question of Dr Francis, a man blessed with the ability to be the finest of medicine men, alongside a sublime gift as a writer and a toucher of the human heart, in a manner way beyond the physical. I suspect the main wish of anyone finishing this book will be that Dr Francis would add them to his list patients.I am off now to buy the other books of Gavin Francis. Happily, my wife will be able to read them too. After three weeks of lying with nine tubes sewn into her neck feeding her all the nutrients her body needed, her pancreas survived (well, all but the tail). That tail died. I suspect this tale, so wonderfully told by Gavin Francis, will outlive many of us."
9,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3932962-barbara-the-bibliophage,3,"More reviews at TheBibliophage.com.Physician Gavin Francis truly takes readers on Adventures in Human Being. From stem to stern, tip to toes, Francis picks a vital part of anatomy and verbally dissects it. It’s a fascinating premise for anyone who enjoys information about their body, or who is just beginning the learning adventure.Francis organizes his essays in seven sections: Brain, Head, Chest, Upper Limb, Abdomen, Pelvis, and Lower Limb. Each essay takes a particular topic related to a vital organ or organs, including patient stories, and those from Francis’ doctoring experiences.As much philosophical as it is anatomical, Adventures in Human Being draws from various cultures and traditions as well. Francis may discuss stigmata, while detailing injuries to a patient’s hands. Or he’ll present the womb as holding within it the fine line between life and death. His approach is unique, and eminently readable.I listened to the audiobook, with excellent narration by Thomas Judd. While it’s not a reference book, I think I’ll refer back to it as medical events happen in our family. I may even track down a print copy so as to have the ability to ponder elements of the essays in a different way.This is a book about the human body that’s as much about being a human as it is about the body itself. Highly recommend for science nerds and anyone with a body!"
10,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38868822-aisha,5,"Sensational. A moment of silence for a work of not only literature, but also science. The way the two opposing elements of literature and science intertwined is noteworthy. The core of this book, which was a series of stories as Francis journeys the reader from cranium to calcaneum touched me heart and soul. It is a book that I could always go back to, reading it was no rush because somehow it resembled me, and that way I was sure relativity and interest would never be lost as long as I breathed. I can't wait to reread it in the future and extract newer meaning, it truly is brim with life."
11,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10084711-shelby-shelbyymay,4,"Adventures in Human Being was a quick and interesting read. Perfect for those wanting either to pick up a non-fiction book but don’t really know where to start; or for those interested in human anatomy but want to read something that is light and sufficiently brief. Each chapter outlines a different part of the body, and begins from head to toe, although you can read the chapters in any order. The book is written by an experienced doctor who has worked in a number of different areas within the medical field, but now mostly practices as a family doctor. His chapters describe not only the facts and functions of a body part, but also his own accounts of instances where he has witnessed or been involved in surgery or medical examinations. He also describes ‘folk lore’ or ‘original’ medical thoughts/examinations/treatments regarding the body and its ailments, across history. The pages don’t fill you will technical jargon either, and Gavin Francis’ writing is both enlightening and humorous, and was a delight to read. "
12,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15019743-ali-al-khalifa,4,"Like Oliver Sacks, Gavin Francis has written a book for a non-medical audience that explores anatomical subjects in highly accessible manner, with minimal jargon and many real-life examples that are as interesting as they are insightful. In a profession that requires its practitioners to be clinical and detached from the patients they treat so intimately, the author shows thoughtfulness and sensitivity in his dealings with those under his care. Through this head to foot exploration of the human landscape, Gavin’s beautifully written prose leaves the reader with a deeper appreciation of the complexity and fragility of our bodily terrain."
13,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,3,"Gavin Francis’ book is basically a series of essays about the human body and how it works (and how it breaks), from the head down. It’s pretty readable, with anecdotes from Francis’ time as a doctor, though it’s not something that grabbed me as much as, say, Henry Marsh’s Do No Harm. Actually, it’s fading a bit from memory already. It’s certainly readable and filled some time during an epic plane and train ride from Canada through Amsterdam to Belgium; it’s not revelatory, or amazingly written. I’m a little surprised, though, at how ‘meh’ I feel about it in retrospect.Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."
14,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/162989-emily-brown,5,"Very much a fantastic journey. Every doctor has tales to tell and these are fascinating. I really enjoyed reading about ECT, DSH, and seeing a kidney come to life. Easy to read and full of awesome facts!! Highly recommend!!"
15,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9117467-lizzie,5,"Rare for a medical professional to be able to talk so poetically about the human body. A great mix of history, philosophy and anatomy intertwined with tales from the ""front line"". Well done to Dr Francis on taking the sterility out of the medical world."
16,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"'Adventures in Human Being' are a collection of interesting vignettes about the human body by a practicing physician. In eighteen chapters Gavin Francis takes us on a journey from our heads to our feet, explaining through a representative case history of an actual patient how a body organ or system works, adding to the story the often fanciful and metaphysical guesses of physicians in earlier civilizations. This is a very respectful and amusing exploration of our facial nerves, lungs, livers, breasts, kidneys, hips, shoulders and feet. I share the author's opinion about how wondrous the physical workings of our bodies are to discover - and how delicious were the mistaken conclusions of observers of the body in the past. The interplay of a body-part function and cultural beliefs is always fascinating. Myths such as the one about the Greek Titan Prometheus on having his liver eaten every day by an eagle as a punishment from the god Zeus, only to have the liver grow back every night describes a regenerative ability of the liver which is true in fact, excepting Prometheus' immortality. Alas, our livers are not quite so robust with longevity, but they do tend to grow back if not too seriously injured. Even more fascinating, to me, was a cultural belief women needed to be brought to an orgasm before conception was possible -a belief leading to medical prescriptions of the use of vibrators until the 19th century. Alas, men no longer take such care in procreation today.Not many of the stories are cause for a titter, gentle reader, but they all are very interesting and many are a reminder of our humanity, nonetheless. The author writes very well, and he has an ability to select the most salient fact of interest for laypersons such as myself. I enjoyed 'Adventures in Human Being' very much."
17,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3960665-ryan,5,"A Scottish GP introduces human anatomy to the public.

20,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1647517-victor-sonkin,5,"Written by a doctor, a review of the human body from the perspective of someone who tries to heal it (in the very mundane, 21st-century, European medical sense). It proceeds from top to bottom with little details, explanations of anatomy, reminiscences from education at the Edinburgh University, and many quotes from various sources (including many from Classical authors, which I found endearing). It reads well, it's rather short, and it's very interesting. My only question is how the author juggles his medical practice with everything else that he does (he also traveled as a doctor in Arctic and Antarctic expeditions and wrote books about that, too) — but I hope to ask him personally in Krasnoyarsk."
21,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66616-charlene,3,"Beautifully written but a bit lacking in substance. Perhaps that criticism comes from my own expectations . . . I wasn't expecting a collection of essays (which this is). Gavin Francis is a Renaissance man/physician/world traveler and author. Best section was ""Shoulder: Arms and Armour"" that uses Homer's Siege of Troy as a source. "
22,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63297537-spencer-fancutt,2,"Clunky when attempting to be literary or philosophical, but very interesting anecdotes about a variety of patients, medical procedures, and the wonders of the body. At one point, Francis talks about people who can 'wink with both eyes' and it serves as a good example of how his lesser abilities in the former field can obscure our appreciation of his clear expertise in the latter. Another thread that annoyed me slightly was the impression he gives of himself- he is quite clearly our hero and teacher from the essays. Never a misstep, always there with the textbook perfect comments for patients. Worth a read for the facts it shares presented in layman's terms."
23,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley,5,"Dr. Francis’s book of essays takes one on a fascinating anatomical cook’s tour—literally from head to toe. The book uses patient case histories, tales from med school, great moments in medical history, and even references to art and pop culture to intrigue the reader with the awesome nature of the human body. This isn’t the kind of book that tries to tell one everything there is to know on a subject. Rather it drills deep on specific subjects, but with humor and readability. While the book examines specific issues pertaining to the body part under consideration, it gives the layman reader the necessary background to comprehend even the most complex topics, often through interesting factoids. In 18 chapters divided into seven parts by regions of the body, one will learn about topics such as: electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), the almost ancient art of cataract surgery, botoxing of Bell’s Palsy patients, how the Epley manoeuver is used to seemingly miraculously cure vertigo through snappy head movements, why Renaissance thinkers thought the soul resided in the lips, why having one’s blood circulated pulselessly causes problems, how a “Brachial stun” immobilizes an arm, why suicidal wrist slashers rarely succeed, where the nail goes in a proper crucifixion, how kidneys became the gift that keeps giving, how a scratch on the hand almost cost a gardener her life and what her liver did to save her, why your bowel movements matter, how fetoliths (i.e. “stone babies”) come to reside in the abdomens of older women, why--in some cultures--it’s necessary to eat the afterbirth while others insist on burying it under the house, why the hip’s blood supply is lacking, and how the foot is really more specialized and consequential to human existence than our hands and their well-publicized opposable thumbs. My wife got me this book after seeing it on the list of the best books of 2015 put out by “The Economist” magazine. It was an excellent choice and it moved it quickly to the front of my reading list. I’d highly recommend it for anyone interested in science, medicine, anatomy, physiology, or the human body. "
24,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1704896-flora,5,"A fascinating journey (head to foot, naturally) through the human body. Gavin Francis has drawn on a wide range of texts which enrich his writing on the body: poetry, fairy tale, philosophy as well as historical sources. In other hands, this could be heavy going, however he has a light touch and the text is never a struggle to get through. I liked the balance between the lyrical and the matter-of-fact. Francis manages to de-mystify the body and its functions (and failings) while also encouraging a sense of fascination and wonder. He is never cold and distant (although can be clinical!), instead he celebrates the life-long relationship we have with our bodies and how that impacts on how we interact with the world around us, particularly through art.Thinking about your body and how it works can be scary (at least for me with my hypochondriac tendencies). This book doesn't hide the fact that things can go wrong, and badly, but Francis' clear, compassionate tone somehow it makes it seem less frightening."
25,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4415716-icy-sedgwick,4,"When I picked up this book, I was expecting something like Francis Larson's Severed - an examination of body parts in terms of their anatomy, and their representation in art and culture. That's certainly how it sells itself, and being involved with the Wellcome Collection, I certainly thought that was the case.And when the book actually fulfils that, it does it very well. When Francis focuses on the body part in question, his writing is eloquent, his examples are relevant, and the accompanying anatomical illustrations provide a useful point of interest. That said, I think this book is, in some ways, more of a memoir of the author's working life than it is a tour-de-force of medical non-fiction. More than one of the chapters is devoted more to a case history than to a consideration of a particular body part, as though Francis is working through some kind of trauma or guilt. Interesting, yes, but valuable? I'm not sure. It's worth a read but expect a lot of personal stories on the way."
26,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5777523-jami,4,"I listened to this on audible, and the narration was fine. I tend to enjoy nonfiction books more in audio than print format.This started a little slow for me, but it became more interesting as the book progressed. I wasn't too keen on the literary references and some of the historical information at first, but then it became a bit more interesting. The book was set up in sections starting a the head and ending with the feet. While there wasn't a lot of new medical information, I did learn some things here and there. I did enjoy listening to the case studies and their application to the particular body part under discussion.There was some humor in the book; I LOL during the rectum discussion when a patient's x-ray was stolen (I won't spoil it, but it is good!!!). I also realized that perhaps I shouldn't be listening to the placenta part during my lunch hour; as I was eating my lunch and listening to the book, the author was discussing cultures where placenta was eaten for various reasons. "
27,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29075574-belle,4,"Reading this book was like taking an exclusive tour of the universe beneath our skin. The author examines every part of our body from head to toes and combining his own medical experience as a doctor into it with a blend of mythology and literature. I particularly liked the chapter on blindness, in which he used Jorge Luis Borges whom some of the readers may have already been familiar with, as a literary example by exploring his blindness which wasn’t regarded as a terrible thing, in terms of helping him to create literature through his imagination. Instead of laden the book with medical jargon, he chose to approach each organ in our anatomy with a sense humour tinged with familiarity, in order to emphasize the wonderful uniqueness and complexities, which human body possesses and illustrates what weaknesses we’re biologically programmed to have in return for these abilities. It’s a magnificent exploration of human condition and our anatomy."

Francis leads the reader on an adventure through what it means to be human. Both a user's guide to the body and a celebration of its elegance, this book will transform the way you think about being alive, whether in sickness or in health.Gavin Francis blends his own experience in learning and treating, the history of various fields, and anecdotal stories and neat turns of phrase that make the world of the body and its working both fun and accessible to those with a passing interest. From head to toe you're taken on a journey of his life, patient's experience, and the history of science and medicine in understanding certain areas. Good for dipping in and out of, a neat little body part at a time. A very good book."

A grand tour of the intricacies of the machine that we take for granted every day, this book is written with fluid prose. It explores an aspect of the human body in each chapter, starting from the head and going down to the toes. However, you'd be foolish in writing this off as a mere science book. Adventures in Human Being explores art and and history and geography, lightly peppered with scientific detail. Francis draws on his great medical experience by giving anecdotes of his time working in different parts of the medical profession. Some of these anecdotes are quite upsetting, some uplifting, but they tell you something new; they open your eyes.Yes, you may call this a science book, and you may learn from it in this light. However, I also acquired a deep sense of the wonder of the human body that I did not possess before. "

I stand upright to walk, I have opposable thumbs, I cogitate, and do many more things.With the book Adventures in Human Being, Dr. Gavin Francis explores stories of being a medical practitioner linked to human anatomy. He starts with stories related to the brain and moves systematically down to the feet. For example, with the brain, he discusses his training to be a doctor and how he first encountered a human brain outside the body. This leads to Dr. Francis talking about people with intractable depression receiving Electroshock Therapy. He muses on how Electroshock Therapy is viewed in popular culture with pieces like One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.So Dr. Francis follows this pattern throughout the book. He muses on all sorts of different things. The book is pretty good as a result. It points out a lot of different stuff that I don’t usually think of. People think of opposable thumbs as being a rare thing that makes people human, but it isn’t since Chimpanzees have them too. Almost all apes have thumbs and can hold things as we can.

That might be why we seem to take them so much for granted, ignoring and often mistreating a precisely engineered machine very much to our long term cost.In this remarkable collection of essays Gavin Francis, an Edinburgh GP with a neat sideline as an author and explorer takes us on a tour of the human body that literally covers its every inch from head to toe.Along the way he makes the sometimes deliberately obscure world of medicine understandable to readers, like the current reviewer, from a humanities background who have never fully recovered from coming over all queasy when dissecting a frog in a high school biology lesson.That alone would make this a worthwhile book, Francis though goes beyond the mind blowing science involved in the near miracle of the liver regenerating itself throughout a lifetime of misuse and the mechanics involved in the simple act of making a fist to reveal the hidden poetics that remind us that medicine is rightly referred to as an art.It is to be found on almost every page from the anatomical names of the parts that make up the aorta , nodulus, lunula have a music all of their own, and the semi-mystical way the eye transforms light into vision. Francis approaches all of this with an undisguised wonder that is that is thrillingly infectious.His frame of cultural reference is eclectic and he has an eye for the impact successive distinctive, sometimes obsessive, characters have had on the history of medicine. Men like Charles Bell the artist ans surgeon who advanced anatomical knowledge by drawing the horrors of the Napoleonic wars and Pierre Barbet, another surgeon who went to extreme lengths to prove how the crucifixion might have been carried out.He also draws on examples from his own experience of practising as a doctor in hospitals and the community, revealing himself to be a physician of unusual empathy. Any of his readers might wish for such a medic to be at their bedside in the worrying hours before a dawn they might not see.This short but brilliant book puts Gavin Francis amongst the small group of people who write about science for a popular audience without patronising their readers. His style brings to mind that of the late Oliver Sacks, urbane, approachable and unashamed of his own sense of wonder. "

In Adventures in Human Being, Gavin Francis leads the reader on a journey through health and illness, offering insights on everything from the ribbed surface of the brain to the secret workings of the heart and the womb; from the pulse of life at the wrist to the unique engineering of the foot. Drawing on his own experiences as a doctor and GP, he blends first-hand case studies with reflections on the way the body has been imagined and portrayed over the millennia. If the body is a foreign country, then to practice medicine is to explore new territory. Francis leads the reader on an adventure through what it means to be human. Both a user's guide to the body and a celebration of its elegance, this book will transform the way you think about being alive, whether in sickness or in health.My ReviewI saw this book at the airport and was drawn to the cover, it isn't often I comment on covers but this one pulled me over. The human skeleton with words of body parts etched into the visible parts of the body. Doctor Francis takes us on a trip through the human body, given insights into different parts of the anatomy, workings within the body and to keep it interesting he gives some stories about patients past.I do enjoy a book where you learn something as you go along, I also like to read about real life human experiences. The human body is an amazing vessel, intricate workings and even when one part fails to work at optimal, the body still continues and compensates, obviously within reason, if your head is removed it is game over.The only thing I would say is there were a lot of things that people would need to google and in some parts he went off on a tangent or brought in things I didn't feel were always relevant to the section I was reading. I would have loved more of the personal stories and maybe some more laymen terms however overall an engaging read where you can learn a few things about the fabulous human body. 4/5 for me this time, this author does have other works available that I will at some point track down, I won't be rushing out to get the back catalog just yet though.

48,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1047783-richard,4,"A Cooks Tour of the human body with fantastic anecdotes along the way. If you like the Diagnosis feature in the NYTimes, you'll like this.My favorite story is about a little toe preserved in a reliquarium in Granada, Andalucia. The owner of the toe lost it in a car accident. Insurance payouts enabled him to buy a house which he named The House of the Little Toe. He kept the toe, had it mummified, and stores it in the garden. Once a year in October, about 200 neighbors gather, the reliquary is brought out, placed on a platform (usually used for carting the Virgin around on her feast days) and carried through the city. After reaching a particular fountain the revels begin. Once everyone is well fed, good and drunk, and having given thanks to the toe for its beneficence, the group reverses course and returns the little toe to its house and garden. The book continues with a discussion of the foot, and the body parts that are stored for posterity in the morgue where the author is working.Not every anecdote is as whimsical as that, but the stories are generally compelling, and the book is fun and educational.Go for it."
49,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28604716-left-coast-justin,4,"This was an odd but entertaining book, combining the history of medicine, the author's own memories and a very sympathetic view of hospital patients into a light and pleasant read.Some interesting things I learned while reading: People who's faces droop on one side may be having a stroke, but not necessarily. If they can raise their eyebrow on the affected side, it indicates stroke; if they cannot, it indicates a swollen facial nerve (known as Bell's palsy).The straightened-out distance from mouth to anus through our digestive system is thirty to forty feet.The recommended treatment for 'DSH' patients (""deliberate self harm,"" generally manifested as cutting oneself) is to put a rubber band around your wrist and snap yourself instead; it still hurts, but doesn't leave scars.Your foot actually has three arches; two lengthwise and one crosswise. Fifty-four different muscles come into play during walking.These are examples of the sort of tidbits Dr. Francis pulls out of the soup of a life spent studying humans and their bodies. Fun stuff."
50,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16829065-haniin,4,"Let's start off by saying that I really enjoyed reading this book. Francis' simple yet poetic way of describing the human body, from head to toe, was in many ways a lot more fun to read than my anatomy Gray's book. He presents the human body to the reader not only through his knowledge of our anatomy and the cases of his patients but he also includes historical, mythical, biblical and poetical insights - which made the whole book a lot more interesting, in my opinion. Then there are the illustrations or diagrams that ties together with the knowledge presented to the reader in an efficient way. I'd definitely recommend this book to my medical classmates as I think it adds in many ways to the knowledge that we've already obtained from our anatomy classes. But I would also recommend it to anyone else, for that matter, who's interested in knowing more about the human body since the language and terms used are fairly simple to understand. "
51,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,5,"The bodies of humans are suffused with meanings, sacred and profane, poetic and prosaic, sexual and mundane. Gavin Francis' project has been to explore the meanings attached to each body part from cranium to calcaneus. Francis' medical training and experiences have suited him well for the task. He recounts clinical stories related to body parts as well as the history of knowledge about the part's physiology and function. Best of all, the incredibly well- read Francis uses literary references to provide us with a sense of how people have viewed body parts over time. I'm not sure I would pick up a book on anatomy to read for pleasure, but this book was a deep pleasure to read. The prose is beautifully written and the narrative is fascinating. It is charming, witty, and deeply human. Francis would be a great companion for a long evening chat by the fireside."

I was going to read while taking some interesting notes but it is, in-fact, a lyrical and poetic journey from head to toe of the human body through the prism of art, literature, poetry, medical history and science. I am not going to pretend I understood everything though. The explanation of the workings of the heart left me flummoxed and palpitating. The pace and flow is not like an ICU but more like meeting your very knowledgeable GP in the National Gallery. Get to know your body from the inside and which parts may look like a Gothic or Roman arch depending on your gender."

He kept the toe, had it mummified, and stores it in the garden.

Then there are the illustrations or diagrams that ties together with the knowledge presented to the reader in an efficient way. I'd definitely recommend this book to my medical classmates as I think it adds in many ways to the knowledge that we've already obtained from our anatomy classes.

Best of all, the incredibly well- read Francis uses literary references to provide us with a sense of how people have viewed body parts over time.

I frequently marveled at Dr. Francis's depth of knowledge and compassion for his patients, as well as his ability to write so eloquently about his research and varied career as a physician. His research is vast and surprising, and the individual stories fascinating. You'll come away from this reading with a renewed respect for the mechanical masterpiece that is the human body."

A very interesting read and while at times I felt bombarded with information that I had no idea what to do with, other times I very much enjoyed learning something new. It is fascinating to realize how little I knew about the human body and what the perceptions of its functions were even 50 years ago. This in not an in depth analysis of the human body but it does have sufficient information for people like me who are not in the medical field. "

Poetry), into an intimate map of the human body and how it works.

87,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4818761-joseph-reynolds,4,"Fascinating and wonderful. He has a great format: take a part of the body, write a historical essay on da Vinci, or maybe some poets, or something else very intriguing that is referential to that body part, then slip in some patient histories. Great idea. Except....just maybe Dr Francis is also trapped by the format and it occasionally bogs down. This is my only criticism in a very fine book. This is not as good as 'Do No Harm' but I still recommend it highly. "

Francis takes the reader on a journey to explore the human body from head to toe acquainting us with those most hidden, misunderstood, and ever-present parts of ourselves. Francis provides a good blend of historical and art historical information about the human body to embellish the case studies for each section of presented anatomy. Deeply personal and charming, Adventures in Human Being, is the medical history book that you need to read. "

90,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47623615-tom,5,"Likeable, unassuming, beautifully written journey down the body (more or less in ""heads, shoulders, knees & toes"" sequence) by an Edinburgh GP, filled with anecdotes, anatomical details, enlightenment about the rigors of a medical education and peerless illustrations from Grey's Anatomy.I found it enjoyable because it conveys a sense of wonder, wears its research lightly, but still makes some fabulous digressions, such as comparing mortality rates in epic poetry with modern warfare, or more straightforward moments of comedy involving foreign bodies. One or two chapters end rather abruptly before they're fully formed, like a doctor's appointment I guess, but it left me wanting more."

The rest of the book doesn't quite measure up to that one exceptional part of the book. While talking about the bowels and related areas of the body, this author was able to find beauty in what most people find disgusting. For me, that was the highlight of this book. Interesting perspective"

I stand upright to walk, I have opposable thumbs, I cogitate, and do many more things.With the book Adventures in Human Being, Dr. Gavin Francis explores stories of being a medical practitioner linked to human anatomy. He starts with stories related to the brain and moves systematically down to the feet. For example, with the brain, he discusses his training to be a doctor and how he first encountered a human brain outside the body. This leads to Dr. Francis talking about people with intractable depression receiving Electroshock Therapy. He muses on how Electroshock Therapy is viewed in popular culture with pieces like One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.So Dr. Francis follows this pattern throughout the book. He muses on all sorts of different things. The book is pretty good as a result. It points out a lot of different stuff that I don’t usually think of. People think of opposable thumbs as being a rare thing that makes people human, but it isn’t since Chimpanzees have them too. Almost all apes have thumbs and can hold things as we can. One of Dr. Francis’ teachers pointed out that the shape of the foot allows one to walk upright. This leads to an examination of a set of footprints from 3.5 million years ago made by our distant ancestors in volcanic ash.Anyway, this one was enjoyable."
98,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11125713-lesley,3,"I wasn't ""taken"" by this book at the start - possibly due to it beginning with the brain and head and I already have a strong background in this area - but as it progressed I became more engrossed. The mix of science with more artistic comments wasn't originally to my taste, again mostly at the beginning of the book, but by the liver and everything below I was grasping for the the philosophical input. The chapters on the bowels and reproductive system were wonderful. The mix of fact and anecdote was really well balanced. Overall, this is a really well written account of the human body and our interactions with life, illness and death. A good mix of science, experiences and philosophy - it just didn't grip me as other similar texts have."
99,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4322886-eli-claire,3,"What a cool book. I first came across it in the gift shop of the Wellcome Collection in London, a museum of medical antiquities, and knew I had to check it out sooner than later. Francis writes about the body in such a beautiful way- he uses examples from his own practice and literature, poetry, music, and art to talk about each major body part. I skipped one chapter that discussed self-harm, but otherwise listened/read the whole thing, and really enjoyed it. The human body is so fascinating, and I loved the perspective you got from this book. "

I think it is well written for people who don't work in the medical field. It describes part of the routine doctors go through and provide insight to the relationship between doctors and patients. All that while talking about some of the marvellous things in the human body. This book is really good for anyone thinking about enrolling in a medical carrier."

I stand upright to walk, I have opposable thumbs, I cogitate, and do many more things.With the book Adventures in Human Being, Dr. Gavin Francis explores stories of being a medical practitioner linked to human anatomy. He starts with stories related to the brain and moves systematically down to the feet. For example, with the brain, he discusses his training to be a doctor and how he first encountered a human brain outside the body. This leads to Dr. Francis talking about people with intractable depression receiving Electroshock Therapy. He muses on how Electroshock Therapy is viewed in popular culture with pieces like One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.So Dr. Francis follows this pattern throughout the book. He muses on all sorts of different things. The book is pretty good as a result. It points out a lot of different stuff that I don’t usually think of. People think of opposable thumbs as being a rare thing that makes people human, but it isn’t since Chimpanzees have them too. Almost all apes have thumbs and can hold things as we can.

136,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47979973-a-w,4,"Our bodies are ever present and yet their organs and rhythms are uncharted territory to those of us without specific medical training. That might be why we seem to take them so much for granted, ignoring and often mistreating a precisely engineered machine very much to our long term cost.In this remarkable collection of essays Gavin Francis, an Edinburgh GP with a neat sideline as an author and explorer takes us on a tour of the human body that literally covers its every inch from head to toe.Along the way he makes the sometimes deliberately obscure world of medicine understandable to readers, like the current reviewer, from a humanities background who have never fully recovered from coming over all queasy when dissecting a frog in a high school biology lesson.That alone would make this a worthwhile book, Francis though goes beyond the mind blowing science involved in the near miracle of the liver regenerating itself throughout a lifetime of misuse and the mechanics involved in the simple act of making a fist to reveal the hidden poetics that remind us that medicine is rightly referred to as an art.It is to be found on almost every page from the anatomical names of the parts that make up the aorta , nodulus, lunula have a music all of their own, and the semi-mystical way the eye transforms light into vision. Francis approaches all of this with an undisguised wonder that is that is thrillingly infectious.His frame of cultural reference is eclectic and he has an eye for the impact successive distinctive, sometimes obsessive, characters have had on the history of medicine. Men like Charles Bell the artist ans surgeon who advanced anatomical knowledge by drawing the horrors of the Napoleonic wars and Pierre Barbet, another surgeon who went to extreme lengths to prove how the crucifixion might have been carried out.He also draws on examples from his own experience of practising as a doctor in hospitals and the community, revealing himself to be a physician of unusual empathy. Any of his readers might wish for such a medic to be at their bedside in the worrying hours before a dawn they might not see.This short but brilliant book puts Gavin Francis amongst the small group of people who write about science for a popular audience without patronising their readers. His style brings to mind that of the late Oliver Sacks, urbane, approachable and unashamed of his own sense of wonder. "
137,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3642368-lainy,4,"Time taken to read - 6 days on and offPages - 252Publisher - Profile Books LimitedBlurb from GoodreadsWe have a lifetime's association with our bodies, but for many of us they remain uncharted territory. In Adventures in Human Being, Gavin Francis leads the reader on a journey through health and illness, offering insights on everything from the ribbed surface of the brain to the secret workings of the heart and the womb; from the pulse of life at the wrist to the unique engineering of the foot. Drawing on his own experiences as a doctor and GP, he blends first-hand case studies with reflections on the way the body has been imagined and portrayed over the millennia. If the body is a foreign country, then to practice medicine is to explore new territory. Francis leads the reader on an adventure through what it means to be human. Both a user's guide to the body and a celebration of its elegance, this book will transform the way you think about being alive, whether in sickness or in health.My ReviewI saw this book at the airport and was drawn to the cover, it isn't often I comment on covers but this one pulled me over. The human skeleton with words of body parts etched into the visible parts of the body. Doctor Francis takes us on a trip through the human body, given insights into different parts of the anatomy, workings within the body and to keep it interesting he gives some stories about patients past.I do enjoy a book where you learn something as you go along, I also like to read about real life human experiences. The human body is an amazing vessel, intricate workings and even when one part fails to work at optimal, the body still continues and compensates, obviously within reason, if your head is removed it is game over.The only thing I would say is there were a lot of things that people would need to google and in some parts he went off on a tangent or brought in things I didn't feel were always relevant to the section I was reading. I would have loved more of the personal stories and maybe some more laymen terms however overall an engaging read where you can learn a few things about the fabulous human body. 4/5 for me this time, this author does have other works available that I will at some point track down, I won't be rushing out to get the back catalog just yet though.

If you like the Diagnosis feature in the NYTimes, you'll like this.My favorite story is about a little toe preserved in a reliquarium in Granada, Andalucia. The owner of the toe lost it in a car accident. Insurance payouts enabled him to buy a house which he named The House of the Little Toe. He kept the toe, had it mummified, and stores it in the garden. Once a year in October, about 200 neighbors gather, the reliquary is brought out, placed on a platform (usually used for carting the Virgin around on her feast days) and carried through the city. After reaching a particular fountain the revels begin. Once everyone is well fed, good and drunk, and having given thanks to the toe for its beneficence, the group reverses course and returns the little toe to its house and garden. The book continues with a discussion of the foot, and the body parts that are stored for posterity in the morgue where the author is working.Not every anecdote is as whimsical as that, but the stories are generally compelling, and the book is fun and educational.Go for it."
139,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28604716-left-coast-justin,4,"This was an odd but entertaining book, combining the history of medicine, the author's own memories and a very sympathetic view of hospital patients into a light and pleasant read.Some interesting things I learned while reading: People who's faces droop on one side may be having a stroke, but not necessarily. If they can raise their eyebrow on the affected side, it indicates stroke; if they cannot, it indicates a swollen facial nerve (known as Bell's palsy).The straightened-out distance from mouth to anus through our digestive system is thirty to forty feet.The recommended treatment for 'DSH' patients (""deliberate self harm,"" generally manifested as cutting oneself) is to put a rubber band around your wrist and snap yourself instead; it still hurts, but doesn't leave scars.Your foot actually has three arches; two lengthwise and one crosswise. Fifty-four different muscles come into play during walking.These are examples of the sort of tidbits Dr. Francis pulls out of the soup of a life spent studying humans and their bodies. Fun stuff."
140,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16829065-haniin,4,"Let's start off by saying that I really enjoyed reading this book. Francis' simple yet poetic way of describing the human body, from head to toe, was in many ways a lot more fun to read than my anatomy Gray's book. He presents the human body to the reader not only through his knowledge of our anatomy and the cases of his patients but he also includes historical, mythical, biblical and poetical insights - which made the whole book a lot more interesting, in my opinion. Then there are the illustrations or diagrams that ties together with the knowledge presented to the reader in an efficient way. I'd definitely recommend this book to my medical classmates as I think it adds in many ways to the knowledge that we've already obtained from our anatomy classes. But I would also recommend it to anyone else, for that matter, who's interested in knowing more about the human body since the language and terms used are fairly simple to understand. "
141,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,5,"The bodies of humans are suffused with meanings, sacred and profane, poetic and prosaic, sexual and mundane. Gavin Francis' project has been to explore the meanings attached to each body part from cranium to calcaneus. Francis' medical training and experiences have suited him well for the task. He recounts clinical stories related to body parts as well as the history of knowledge about the part's physiology and function. Best of all, the incredibly well- read Francis uses literary references to provide us with a sense of how people have viewed body parts over time. I'm not sure I would pick up a book on anatomy to read for pleasure, but this book was a deep pleasure to read. The prose is beautifully written and the narrative is fascinating. It is charming, witty, and deeply human. Francis would be a great companion for a long evening chat by the fireside."

I was going to read while taking some interesting notes but it is, in-fact, a lyrical and poetic journey from head to toe of the human body through the prism of art, literature, poetry, medical history and science. I am not going to pretend I understood everything though. The explanation of the workings of the heart left me flummoxed and palpitating. The pace and flow is not like an ICU but more like meeting your very knowledgeable GP in the National Gallery. Get to know your body from the inside and which parts may look like a Gothic or Roman arch depending on your gender."

If you like the Diagnosis feature in the NYTimes, you'll like this.My favorite story is about a little toe preserved in a reliquarium in Granada, Andalucia. The owner of the toe lost it in a car accident. Insurance payouts enabled him to buy a house which he named The House of the Little Toe. He kept the toe, had it mummified, and stores it in the garden. Once a year in October, about 200 neighbors gather, the reliquary is brought out, placed on a platform (usually used for carting the Virgin around on her feast days) and carried through the city. After reaching a particular fountain the revels begin. Once everyone is well fed, good and drunk, and having given thanks to the toe for its beneficence, the group reverses course and returns the little toe to its house and garden.

If they can raise their eyebrow on the affected side, it indicates stroke; if they cannot, it indicates a swollen facial nerve (known as Bell's palsy).The straightened-out distance from mouth to anus through our digestive system is thirty to forty feet.The recommended treatment for 'DSH' patients (""deliberate self harm,"" generally manifested as cutting oneself) is to put a rubber band around your wrist and snap yourself instead; it still hurts, but doesn't leave scars.Your foot actually has three arches; two lengthwise and one crosswise. Fifty-four different muscles come into play during walking.These are examples of the sort of tidbits Dr. Francis pulls out of the soup of a life spent studying humans and their bodies. Fun stuff."
170,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16829065-haniin,4,"Let's start off by saying that I really enjoyed reading this book. Francis' simple yet poetic way of describing the human body, from head to toe, was in many ways a lot more fun to read than my anatomy Gray's book. He presents the human body to the reader not only through his knowledge of our anatomy and the cases of his patients but he also includes historical, mythical, biblical and poetical insights - which made the whole book a lot more interesting, in my opinion. Then there are the illustrations or diagrams that ties together with the knowledge presented to the reader in an efficient way. I'd definitely recommend this book to my medical classmates as I think it adds in many ways to the knowledge that we've already obtained from our anatomy classes. But I would also recommend it to anyone else, for that matter, who's interested in knowing more about the human body since the language and terms used are fairly simple to understand. "

Gavin Francis' project has been to explore the meanings attached to each body part from cranium to calcaneus. Francis' medical training and experiences have suited him well for the task. He recounts clinical stories related to body parts as well as the history of knowledge about the part's physiology and function. Best of all, the incredibly well- read Francis uses literary references to provide us with a sense of how people have viewed body parts over time. I'm not sure I would pick up a book on anatomy to read for pleasure, but this book was a deep pleasure to read. The prose is beautifully written and the narrative is fascinating. It is charming, witty, and deeply human. Francis would be a great companion for a long evening chat by the fireside."

I was going to read while taking some interesting notes but it is, in-fact, a lyrical and poetic journey from head to toe of the human body through the prism of art, literature, poetry, medical history and science. I am not going to pretend I understood everything though. The explanation of the workings of the heart left me flummoxed and palpitating. The pace and flow is not like an ICU but more like meeting your very knowledgeable GP in the National Gallery. Get to know your body from the inside and which parts may look like a Gothic or Roman arch depending on your gender."

It brings readers to a marvellous journey of the body with very poetic and beautiful prose. Cold anatomy and medicine are transformed into something very human and literary by the author. His rich knowledge in medicine as well as literature and art has made this book a gem. Bumping into this book was unintended but I am glad I bought it. I enjoyed it thoroughly and it opened my eye to the most imitate landscape of our own bodies. I recommend it to anyone who cares to know more about the human body.

I frequently marveled at Dr. Francis's depth of knowledge and compassion for his patients, as well as his ability to write so eloquently about his research and varied career as a physician. His research is vast and surprising, and the individual stories fascinating. You'll come away from this reading with a renewed respect for the mechanical masterpiece that is the human body."
175,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8137399-melissa,4,"For the non-medical folks wanting to know more about the human body. A very interesting read and while at times I felt bombarded with information that I had no idea what to do with, other times I very much enjoyed learning something new. It is fascinating to realize how little I knew about the human body and what the perceptions of its functions were even 50 years ago. This in not an in depth analysis of the human body but it does have sufficient information for people like me who are not in the medical field. "
176,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2846902-cathriona,4,"In Adventures in Human Being, Gavin Francis reminisces on his experiences and encounters as an Internal Medicine doctor, cleverly weaving real life stories, philosophical quotes, and poetry (yes, that’s right. Poetry), into an intimate map of the human body and how it works. Despite the subject matter, this volume of cleverly crafted prose is hilarious.It is a thought-provoking reminder that humor, when done right, is the key to a good read, regardless of the subject matter. "
177,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4818761-joseph-reynolds,4,"Fascinating and wonderful. He has a great format: take a part of the body, write a historical essay on da Vinci, or maybe some poets, or something else very intriguing that is referential to that body part, then slip in some patient histories. Great idea. Except....just maybe Dr Francis is also trapped by the format and it occasionally bogs down. This is my only criticism in a very fine book. This is not as good as 'Do No Harm' but I still recommend it highly. "

Francis takes the reader on a journey to explore the human body from head to toe acquainting us with those most hidden, misunderstood, and ever-present parts of ourselves. Francis provides a good blend of historical and art historical information about the human body to embellish the case studies for each section of presented anatomy. Deeply personal and charming, Adventures in Human Being, is the medical history book that you need to read. "
179,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/753935-hillary,3,"Thoughtful and philosophical, the author takes the reader on a tour of the body - head to toe. There are some stories that grab the reader's attention, and some that just don't.

180,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47623615-tom,5,"Likeable, unassuming, beautifully written journey down the body (more or less in ""heads, shoulders, knees & toes"" sequence) by an Edinburgh GP, filled with anecdotes, anatomical details, enlightenment about the rigors of a medical education and peerless illustrations from Grey's Anatomy.I found it enjoyable because it conveys a sense of wonder, wears its research lightly, but still makes some fabulous digressions, such as comparing mortality rates in epic poetry with modern warfare, or more straightforward moments of comedy involving foreign bodies. One or two chapters end rather abruptly before they're fully formed, like a doctor's appointment I guess, but it left me wanting more."

I like the way he kind of describes the body as art, and does he seriously still make house calls??? Yet another reason to move to Scotland... Anyway, I really like the way Gavin Francis writes, and I look forward to finally going back and reading his first book, True North: Travels in Arctic Europe, as well as whatever he puts out next! "

The rest of the book doesn't quite measure up to that one exceptional part of the book. While talking about the bowels and related areas of the body, this author was able to find beauty in what most people find disgusting. For me, that was the highlight of this book. Interesting perspective"
183,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/996749-jane,5,"Superb book. Perfect blend of science and beautiful, poetic prose regarding the human body.

I stand upright to walk, I have opposable thumbs, I cogitate, and do many more things.With the book Adventures in Human Being, Dr. Gavin Francis explores stories of being a medical practitioner linked to human anatomy. He starts with stories related to the brain and moves systematically down to the feet. For example, with the brain, he discusses his training to be a doctor and how he first encountered a human brain outside the body. This leads to Dr. Francis talking about people with intractable depression receiving Electroshock Therapy. He muses on how Electroshock Therapy is viewed in popular culture with pieces like One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.So Dr. Francis follows this pattern throughout the book. He muses on all sorts of different things. The book is pretty good as a result. It points out a lot of different stuff that I don’t usually think of. People think of opposable thumbs as being a rare thing that makes people human, but it isn’t since Chimpanzees have them too. Almost all apes have thumbs and can hold things as we can. One of Dr. Francis’ teachers pointed out that the shape of the foot allows one to walk upright. This leads to an examination of a set of footprints from 3.5 million years ago made by our distant ancestors in volcanic ash.Anyway, this one was enjoyable."
188,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11125713-lesley,3,"I wasn't ""taken"" by this book at the start - possibly due to it beginning with the brain and head and I already have a strong background in this area - but as it progressed I became more engrossed. The mix of science with more artistic comments wasn't originally to my taste, again mostly at the beginning of the book, but by the liver and everything below I was grasping for the the philosophical input. The chapters on the bowels and reproductive system were wonderful. The mix of fact and anecdote was really well balanced. Overall, this is a really well written account of the human body and our interactions with life, illness and death. A good mix of science, experiences and philosophy - it just didn't grip me as other similar texts have."

I first came across it in the gift shop of the Wellcome Collection in London, a museum of medical antiquities, and knew I had to check it out sooner than later. Francis writes about the body in such a beautiful way- he uses examples from his own practice and literature, poetry, music, and art to talk about each major body part.

Best of all, the incredibly well- read Francis uses literary references to provide us with a sense of how people have viewed body parts over time. I'm not sure I would pick up a book on anatomy to read for pleasure, but this book was a deep pleasure to read. The prose is beautifully written and the narrative is fascinating.

I stand upright to walk, I have opposable thumbs, I cogitate, and do many more things.With the book Adventures in Human Being, Dr. Gavin Francis explores stories of being a medical practitioner linked to human anatomy. He starts with stories related to the brain and moves systematically down to the feet. For example, with the brain, he discusses his training to be a doctor and how he first encountered a human brain outside the body. This leads to Dr. Francis talking about people with intractable depression receiving Electroshock Therapy. He muses on how Electroshock Therapy is viewed in popular culture with pieces like One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.So Dr. Francis follows this pattern throughout the book. He muses on all sorts of different things. The book is pretty good as a result. It points out a lot of different stuff that I don’t usually think of. People think of opposable thumbs as being a rare thing that makes people human, but it isn’t since Chimpanzees have them too. Almost all apes have thumbs and can hold things as we can. One of Dr. Francis’ teachers pointed out that the shape of the foot allows one to walk upright.

The chapters on the bowels and reproductive system were wonderful. The mix of fact and anecdote was really well balanced.

Francis writes about the body in such a beautiful way- he uses examples from his own practice and literature, poetry, music, and art to talk about each major body part. I skipped one chapter that discussed self-harm, but otherwise listened/read the whole thing, and really enjoyed it.

That might be why we seem to take them so much for granted, ignoring and often mistreating a precisely engineered machine very much to our long term cost.In this remarkable collection of essays Gavin Francis, an Edinburgh GP with a neat sideline as an author and explorer takes us on a tour of the human body that literally covers its every inch from head to toe.Along the way he makes the sometimes deliberately obscure world of medicine understandable to readers, like the current reviewer, from a humanities background who have never fully recovered from coming over all queasy when dissecting a frog in a high school biology lesson.That alone would make this a worthwhile book, Francis though goes beyond the mind blowing science involved in the near miracle of the liver regenerating itself throughout a lifetime of misuse and the mechanics involved in the simple act of making a fist to reveal the hidden poetics that remind us that medicine is rightly referred to as an art.It is to be found on almost every page from the anatomical names of the parts that make up the aorta , nodulus, lunula have a music all of their own, and the semi-mystical way the eye transforms light into vision. Francis approaches all of this with an undisguised wonder that is that is thrillingly infectious.His frame of cultural reference is eclectic and he has an eye for the impact successive distinctive, sometimes obsessive, characters have had on the history of medicine. Men like Charles Bell the artist ans surgeon who advanced anatomical knowledge by drawing the horrors of the Napoleonic wars and Pierre Barbet, another surgeon who went to extreme lengths to prove how the crucifixion might have been carried out.He also draws on examples from his own experience of practising as a doctor in hospitals and the community, revealing himself to be a physician of unusual empathy. Any of his readers might wish for such a medic to be at their bedside in the worrying hours before a dawn they might not see.This short but brilliant book puts Gavin Francis amongst the small group of people who write about science for a popular audience without patronising their readers. His style brings to mind that of the late Oliver Sacks, urbane, approachable and unashamed of his own sense of wonder. "

In Adventures in Human Being, Gavin Francis leads the reader on a journey through health and illness, offering insights on everything from the ribbed surface of the brain to the secret workings of the heart and the womb; from the pulse of life at the wrist to the unique engineering of the foot. Drawing on his own experiences as a doctor and GP, he blends first-hand case studies with reflections on the way the body has been imagined and portrayed over the millennia. If the body is a foreign country, then to practice medicine is to explore new territory. Francis leads the reader on an adventure through what it means to be human. Both a user's guide to the body and a celebration of its elegance, this book will transform the way you think about being alive, whether in sickness or in health.My ReviewI saw this book at the airport and was drawn to the cover, it isn't often I comment on covers but this one pulled me over. The human skeleton with words of body parts etched into the visible parts of the body. Doctor Francis takes us on a trip through the human body, given insights into different parts of the anatomy, workings within the body and to keep it interesting he gives some stories about patients past.I do enjoy a book where you learn something as you go along, I also like to read about real life human experiences. The human body is an amazing vessel, intricate workings and even when one part fails to work at optimal, the body still continues and compensates, obviously within reason, if your head is removed it is game over.The only thing I would say is there were a lot of things that people would need to google and in some parts he went off on a tangent or brought in things I didn't feel were always relevant to the section I was reading. I would have loved more of the personal stories and maybe some more laymen terms however overall an engaging read where you can learn a few things about the fabulous human body. 4/5 for me this time, this author does have other works available that I will at some point track down, I won't be rushing out to get the back catalog just yet though.

If you like the Diagnosis feature in the NYTimes, you'll like this.My favorite story is about a little toe preserved in a reliquarium in Granada, Andalucia. The owner of the toe lost it in a car accident. Insurance payouts enabled him to buy a house which he named The House of the Little Toe. He kept the toe, had it mummified, and stores it in the garden. Once a year in October, about 200 neighbors gather, the reliquary is brought out, placed on a platform (usually used for carting the Virgin around on her feast days) and carried through the city. After reaching a particular fountain the revels begin. Once everyone is well fed, good and drunk, and having given thanks to the toe for its beneficence, the group reverses course and returns the little toe to its house and garden. The book continues with a discussion of the foot, and the body parts that are stored for posterity in the morgue where the author is working.Not every anecdote is as whimsical as that, but the stories are generally compelling, and the book is fun and educational.Go for it."
229,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28604716-left-coast-justin,4,"This was an odd but entertaining book, combining the history of medicine, the author's own memories and a very sympathetic view of hospital patients into a light and pleasant read.Some interesting things I learned while reading: People who's faces droop on one side may be having a stroke, but not necessarily. If they can raise their eyebrow on the affected side, it indicates stroke; if they cannot, it indicates a swollen facial nerve (known as Bell's palsy).The straightened-out distance from mouth to anus through our digestive system is thirty to forty feet.The recommended treatment for 'DSH' patients (""deliberate self harm,"" generally manifested as cutting oneself) is to put a rubber band around your wrist and snap yourself instead; it still hurts, but doesn't leave scars.Your foot actually has three arches; two lengthwise and one crosswise. Fifty-four different muscles come into play during walking.These are examples of the sort of tidbits Dr. Francis pulls out of the soup of a life spent studying humans and their bodies. Fun stuff."
230,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16829065-haniin,4,"Let's start off by saying that I really enjoyed reading this book. Francis' simple yet poetic way of describing the human body, from head to toe, was in many ways a lot more fun to read than my anatomy Gray's book. He presents the human body to the reader not only through his knowledge of our anatomy and the cases of his patients but he also includes historical, mythical, biblical and poetical insights - which made the whole book a lot more interesting, in my opinion. Then there are the illustrations or diagrams that ties together with the knowledge presented to the reader in an efficient way. I'd definitely recommend this book to my medical classmates as I think it adds in many ways to the knowledge that we've already obtained from our anatomy classes. But I would also recommend it to anyone else, for that matter, who's interested in knowing more about the human body since the language and terms used are fairly simple to understand. "

If you like the Diagnosis feature in the NYTimes, you'll like this.My favorite story is about a little toe preserved in a reliquarium in Granada, Andalucia.

He kept the toe, had it mummified, and stores it in the garden.

If they can raise their eyebrow on the affected side, it indicates stroke; if they cannot, it indicates a swollen facial nerve (known as Bell's palsy).The straightened-out distance from mouth to anus through our digestive system is thirty to forty feet.The recommended treatment for 'DSH' patients (""deliberate self harm,"" generally manifested as cutting oneself) is to put a rubber band around your wrist and snap yourself instead; it still hurts, but doesn't leave scars.Your foot actually has three arches; two lengthwise and one crosswise. Fifty-four different muscles come into play during walking.These are examples of the sort of tidbits Dr. Francis pulls out of the soup of a life spent studying humans and their bodies. Fun stuff."
260,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16829065-haniin,4,"Let's start off by saying that I really enjoyed reading this book. Francis' simple yet poetic way of describing the human body, from head to toe, was in many ways a lot more fun to read than my anatomy Gray's book. He presents the human body to the reader not only through his knowledge of our anatomy and the cases of his patients but he also includes historical, mythical, biblical and poetical insights - which made the whole book a lot more interesting, in my opinion. Then there are the illustrations or diagrams that ties together with the knowledge presented to the reader in an efficient way. I'd definitely recommend this book to my medical classmates as I think it adds in many ways to the knowledge that we've already obtained from our anatomy classes. But I would also recommend it to anyone else, for that matter, who's interested in knowing more about the human body since the language and terms used are fairly simple to understand. "
261,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,5,"The bodies of humans are suffused with meanings, sacred and profane, poetic and prosaic, sexual and mundane. Gavin Francis' project has been to explore the meanings attached to each body part from cranium to calcaneus. Francis' medical training and experiences have suited him well for the task. He recounts clinical stories related to body parts as well as the history of knowledge about the part's physiology and function. Best of all, the incredibly well- read Francis uses literary references to provide us with a sense of how people have viewed body parts over time. I'm not sure I would pick up a book on anatomy to read for pleasure, but this book was a deep pleasure to read. The prose is beautifully written and the narrative is fascinating. It is charming, witty, and deeply human. Francis would be a great companion for a long evening chat by the fireside."

I was going to read while taking some interesting notes but it is, in-fact, a lyrical and poetic journey from head to toe of the human body through the prism of art, literature, poetry, medical history and science. I am not going to pretend I understood everything though. The explanation of the workings of the heart left me flummoxed and palpitating. The pace and flow is not like an ICU but more like meeting your very knowledgeable GP in the National Gallery. Get to know your body from the inside and which parts may look like a Gothic or Roman arch depending on your gender."
263,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5973187-wsclai,5,I love this book and doesn't want to finish reading it. It brings readers to a marvellous journey of the body with very poetic and beautiful prose. Cold anatomy and medicine are transformed into something very human and literary by the author. His rich knowledge in medicine as well as literature and art has made this book a gem. Bumping into this book was unintended but I am glad I bought it. I enjoyed it thoroughly and it opened my eye to the most imitate landscape of our own bodies. I recommend it to anyone who cares to know more about the human body.

I frequently marveled at Dr. Francis's depth of knowledge and compassion for his patients, as well as his ability to write so eloquently about his research and varied career as a physician. His research is vast and surprising, and the individual stories fascinating. You'll come away from this reading with a renewed respect for the mechanical masterpiece that is the human body."
265,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8137399-melissa,4,"For the non-medical folks wanting to know more about the human body. A very interesting read and while at times I felt bombarded with information that I had no idea what to do with, other times I very much enjoyed learning something new. It is fascinating to realize how little I knew about the human body and what the perceptions of its functions were even 50 years ago. This in not an in depth analysis of the human body but it does have sufficient information for people like me who are not in the medical field. "

Poetry), into an intimate map of the human body and how it works. Despite the subject matter, this volume of cleverly crafted prose is hilarious.It is a thought-provoking reminder that humor, when done right, is the key to a good read, regardless of the subject matter. "
267,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4818761-joseph-reynolds,4,"Fascinating and wonderful. He has a great format: take a part of the body, write a historical essay on da Vinci, or maybe some poets, or something else very intriguing that is referential to that body part, then slip in some patient histories. Great idea. Except....just maybe Dr Francis is also trapped by the format and it occasionally bogs down. This is my only criticism in a very fine book. This is not as good as 'Do No Harm' but I still recommend it highly. "

Francis takes the reader on a journey to explore the human body from head to toe acquainting us with those most hidden, misunderstood, and ever-present parts of ourselves. Francis provides a good blend of historical and art historical information about the human body to embellish the case studies for each section of presented anatomy. Deeply personal and charming, Adventures in Human Being, is the medical history book that you need to read. "

270,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47623615-tom,5,"Likeable, unassuming, beautifully written journey down the body (more or less in ""heads, shoulders, knees & toes"" sequence) by an Edinburgh GP, filled with anecdotes, anatomical details, enlightenment about the rigors of a medical education and peerless illustrations from Grey's Anatomy.I found it enjoyable because it conveys a sense of wonder, wears its research lightly, but still makes some fabulous digressions, such as comparing mortality rates in epic poetry with modern warfare, or more straightforward moments of comedy involving foreign bodies. One or two chapters end rather abruptly before they're fully formed, like a doctor's appointment I guess, but it left me wanting more."

The rest of the book doesn't quite measure up to that one exceptional part of the book.

Interesting perspective"

I stand upright to walk, I have opposable thumbs, I cogitate, and do many more things.With the book Adventures in Human Being, Dr. Gavin Francis explores stories of being a medical practitioner linked to human anatomy. He starts with stories related to the brain and moves systematically down to the feet. For example, with the brain, he discusses his training to be a doctor and how he first encountered a human brain outside the body. This leads to Dr. Francis talking about people with intractable depression receiving Electroshock Therapy. He muses on how Electroshock Therapy is viewed in popular culture with pieces like One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.So Dr. Francis follows this pattern throughout the book. He muses on all sorts of different things. The book is pretty good as a result. It points out a lot of different stuff that I don’t usually think of. People think of opposable thumbs as being a rare thing that makes people human, but it isn’t since Chimpanzees have them too. Almost all apes have thumbs and can hold things as we can. One of Dr. Francis’ teachers pointed out that the shape of the foot allows one to walk upright. This leads to an examination of a set of footprints from 3.5 million years ago made by our distant ancestors in volcanic ash.Anyway, this one was enjoyable."

Francis' simple yet poetic way of describing the human body, from head to toe, was in many ways a lot more fun to read than my anatomy Gray's book. He presents the human body to the reader not only through his knowledge of our anatomy and the cases of his patients but he also includes historical, mythical, biblical and poetical insights - which made the whole book a lot more interesting, in my opinion. Then there are the illustrations or diagrams that ties together with the knowledge presented to the reader in an efficient way. I'd definitely recommend this book to my medical classmates as I think it adds in many ways to the knowledge that we've already obtained from our anatomy classes. But I would also recommend it to anyone else, for that matter, who's interested in knowing more about the human body since the language and terms used are fairly simple to understand. "
291,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,5,"The bodies of humans are suffused with meanings, sacred and profane, poetic and prosaic, sexual and mundane. Gavin Francis' project has been to explore the meanings attached to each body part from cranium to calcaneus. Francis' medical training and experiences have suited him well for the task. He recounts clinical stories related to body parts as well as the history of knowledge about the part's physiology and function. Best of all, the incredibly well- read Francis uses literary references to provide us with a sense of how people have viewed body parts over time. I'm not sure I would pick up a book on anatomy to read for pleasure, but this book was a deep pleasure to read. The prose is beautifully written and the narrative is fascinating. It is charming, witty, and deeply human. Francis would be a great companion for a long evening chat by the fireside."
292,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21637893-chris-steeden,3,"I am not quite sure what to make of this book. I was expecting more of a layman’s text book. I was going to read while taking some interesting notes but it is, in-fact, a lyrical and poetic journey from head to toe of the human body through the prism of art, literature, poetry, medical history and science. I am not going to pretend I understood everything though. The explanation of the workings of the heart left me flummoxed and palpitating. The pace and flow is not like an ICU but more like meeting your very knowledgeable GP in the National Gallery. Get to know your body from the inside and which parts may look like a Gothic or Roman arch depending on your gender."
293,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5973187-wsclai,5,I love this book and doesn't want to finish reading it. It brings readers to a marvellous journey of the body with very poetic and beautiful prose. Cold anatomy and medicine are transformed into something very human and literary by the author. His rich knowledge in medicine as well as literature and art has made this book a gem. Bumping into this book was unintended but I am glad I bought it. I enjoyed it thoroughly and it opened my eye to the most imitate landscape of our own bodies. I recommend it to anyone who cares to know more about the human body.
294,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42162715-carol,4,"This was simply a beautiful, elegant exploration of the human body, from head to toe, written for the most part in layman terms. I frequently marveled at Dr. Francis's depth of knowledge and compassion for his patients, as well as his ability to write so eloquently about his research and varied career as a physician. His research is vast and surprising, and the individual stories fascinating. You'll come away from this reading with a renewed respect for the mechanical masterpiece that is the human body."
295,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8137399-melissa,4,"For the non-medical folks wanting to know more about the human body. A very interesting read and while at times I felt bombarded with information that I had no idea what to do with, other times I very much enjoyed learning something new. It is fascinating to realize how little I knew about the human body and what the perceptions of its functions were even 50 years ago. This in not an in depth analysis of the human body but it does have sufficient information for people like me who are not in the medical field. "
296,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2846902-cathriona,4,"In Adventures in Human Being, Gavin Francis reminisces on his experiences and encounters as an Internal Medicine doctor, cleverly weaving real life stories, philosophical quotes, and poetry (yes, that’s right. Poetry), into an intimate map of the human body and how it works. Despite the subject matter, this volume of cleverly crafted prose is hilarious.It is a thought-provoking reminder that humor, when done right, is the key to a good read, regardless of the subject matter. "
297,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4818761-joseph-reynolds,4,"Fascinating and wonderful. He has a great format: take a part of the body, write a historical essay on da Vinci, or maybe some poets, or something else very intriguing that is referential to that body part, then slip in some patient histories. Great idea. Except....just maybe Dr Francis is also trapped by the format and it occasionally bogs down. This is my only criticism in a very fine book. This is not as good as 'Do No Harm' but I still recommend it highly. "
298,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43090915-katie,5,"A delightful medical history / memoir. Francis takes the reader on a journey to explore the human body from head to toe acquainting us with those most hidden, misunderstood, and ever-present parts of ourselves. Francis provides a good blend of historical and art historical information about the human body to embellish the case studies for each section of presented anatomy. Deeply personal and charming, Adventures in Human Being, is the medical history book that you need to read. "
299,0465079687,http://goodreads.com/user/show/753935-hillary,3,"Thoughtful and philosophical, the author takes the reader on a tour of the body - head to toe. There are some stories that grab the reader's attention, and some that just don't. Overall, I enjoyed this reflective attempt by the author to become an anatomical tour guide, not simply by pointing out and naming landmarks, but by sharing stories of things that happened there, the local culture, etc. "
