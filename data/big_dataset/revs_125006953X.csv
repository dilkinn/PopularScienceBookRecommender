0,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Popular science books about physics seem to fall into three types. Some are dense digging directly into the hard science. While they have much to offer, they can be frustratingly difficult. Some are lightweight resorting to extended analogies and oversimplifications. They can create the illusion of understanding rather than genuine understanding. Others try for the middle ground. Too often these alternate between oversimplifications and detailed science resulting in a disjointed narrative.Galfard, an accomplished physicist who was mentored by Stephen Hawking, tries for the middle ground and largely succeeds. He lightens up on the details: only one well known equation, only the simplest math, the minimum of particle names and scientific lingo required to be coherent. Also important, Galfard manages to maintain a consistent level of detail throughout. He presents concepts in a straightforward way that doesn’t diminish their meaning or their challenges to our intuition. With this style, he can’t dig deeply into how scientists have formulated their theories, but he does a good job of presenting their conclusions.Galfard uses a protagonist – you. You become an ethereal mind exploring the universe from the very large to the very small. At first I thought this approach was a little hokey, but I grew comfortable with it and found myself enjoying it. Galfard has a conversational style and a sense of humor that keeps you moving along. He did an excellent job of using his protagonist to visualize concepts. The travelogue helped tie ideas together giving the book a continuity often lacking in science books. It also served as a spacer giving a break between difficult sections.Galfard’s book is comprehensive. You travel through space to the end of the visible universe and along the way Galfard explains what you are seeing. He digs into general relativity as you slide through the curves of space time. He puts you on a rocket ship at near the speed of light to explain special relativity. He morphs you into a mini you to explore quantum mechanics and explain field theories. He takes you to a black hole then to the edge of a singularity and explains theories about the big bang, inflation and the multi-verse. He doesn’t leave out dark matter or dark energy. At the end he ventures into pure theory discussing quantum gravity and string theory.So despite the light touch in his presentation, the subject matter is not light. Galfard says his “ambition” is to leave no reader behind. While that may be a stretch, I think any reader with a genuine interest can get something out of this book. Galfard is an unusually skillful writer for a physicist and I think he hits a sweet spot offering substance without being intimidating. As someone who regularly reads this genre, I can’t say there was much new. But I did like the way he showed the relationships and contradictions between theories, particularly field theories and theories of gravity and space-time, which he used to explain the need for theories of quantum gravity. I enjoyed my ride through space and the quantum and I think others who are fascinated by the cosmos will as well. "

It was so good, it is a perfect marriage between perfect narrative and interesting context while at the same time not letting anything out . If you are interested in physics, black holes, string theory and quantum science but feel intimidated to read about it, make this your introductory book because it will explain everything in layman terms and you'll have fun learning all the components that make up our known universe while getting a glimpse at our future in science. I couldn't recommend this book more ,please read it as this would help anyone to broaden their horizons."
2,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2295530-roxana,5,This book has overwhelmed me so much! Such a brilliant description of modern astrophysics in a relatively accessible way. I can only say that I loved it and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in astronomy and astrophysics. 5/5.
3,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5555413-vishy,5,"One of my alltime favourite books on physics for the general reader. Written by Christophe Galfard, who was at one time Stephen Hawking's student, it covers in wonderfully accessible prose all the important events, theories, personalities and gives us a glimpse into what is in store for the future - stuff like Relativity, Quantum mechanics, Black Holes, Origin of the Universe, the birth and death of stars, the Big Bang Theory etc. Galfard's wonderful sense of humour is infectious - I couldn't stop laughing at many points in the book. If I have compare this with competing works which cover similar themes - like books by Stephen Hawking, Roger Penrose, John Gribbin, Brian Greene, John Barrow, George Gamov, Bill Bryson - I think its closest competitors would be works by John Gribbin and Bill Bryson. If compares favourably with both of them, though Gribbin's works have more depth and Bryson covers all the sciences in his book. I would say that this is the best first introduction to physics for the general reader. If you love science, you will love this. "
4,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,4,"67th book for 2019.Galfard—who amongst other claims to fame, was a graduate student of the late, great Stephen Hawking—has written a excellent general introduction to modern physics as a series of whimsical thought experiments. While thought experiments have a long history in theoretical physics—Einstein used thought experiments to elucidate many of his theoretical insights (e.g., what would it be like if an observer were to travel at the same speed as a beam of light?)—Galfard has taken the radical step of rewriting the entire canon of modern physics into a series of thought experiments that allow the non-mathematically inclined reader to get an intuitive grasp of current theoretical knowledge in physics. And he has managed to do this with a writing style that is both highly entertaining and informative.4-stars. "
5,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10017251-thuong-le,3,"If you’re like me and you are really fascinated by the universe and how it was created (The Big Bang Theory), then you’re going to want to pick this one up! I was browsing in Waterstones, (like I usually do) checking out the new releases when I saw this book, picked it up and thought, ‘I need to read this!’ I’ve had an interest in astronomy ever since I studied a small module of it in Science, but my knowledge of it has not progressed since then, so this book was the perfect opportunity for me to find out more about the universe. This book is divided into 7 parts. Part 1 – 2 was easier to understand, but as we go into parts 3 – 7 of the book it gets a bit more complicated with cosmic, black holes, energy, quantum, vacuums and electrons. The only equation was E = mc 2 this made it a little less complicated. I bookmarked the pages that were interesting to me and as for the rest, it was history! Aha, what I mean is it went through one ear and out the other.“The Sun, being a star, is not a big ball of fire – fire needs oxygen, and although the Sun creates bits of it along with other elements, there’s not enough free oxygen in outer space to sustain any fire whatsoever.”It was very intriguing to learn about the sun. The sun is already half way into its life span but it has another 5 billion years before its energy, hydrogen and helium ran out and thus becoming a red giant. The sun is the sole reason why we’re alive. Without the sun, the water will evaporate and Earth will not survive. Did you know the sun is actually white?! It’s actually all the colours of the rainbow. Mind blown. My cousin asked me a trick question: Can the speed of light travel faster than time? I said light travels faster. It was a right mild guess, as I had no idea. I just assume that maybe time is slower than light. I asked my colleague and she said that it's a trick question because light is controlled by time. According to the book, I have my answer at page 151:“In outer space, light travels at around 300,000 kilometres per second.”In Chapter 4 of Part 4 A Drive into the Quantum World, talks briefly about magnets and why it can’t collide through a fridge – it will only be stuck to it because of electrons keeping them apart. I don’t think I ever thought about magnets analytically much in Science, all I knew that it has a magnetic force that attracts metal. This is part of a quantum-mechanical principle called Pauli Exclusion Principle, discovered by Swiss theoretical physicist Wolfgang Pauli, who was also awarded the 1945 Noble Prize. One thing I am curious about is: where the did all the water come from?! It covers about 71% of the Earth. When the Earth first formed, it was constantly hit by comets and asteroids, and this is where the water came from. Having watched a documentary about it, it is still a mystery to me. This universe is a mystery... its often said that the universe was created 13.8 billion years ago but no one knows for sure, it could be more than that. “Without radioactivity, life on Earth would be impossible.”Polish French Scientist called Marie Curie, who is the first person ever to be awarded the Noble Prize in Physics, discovered radioactivity. Radioactivity is particles that released from nuclei because of nuclear instability. Overall I give this a 3 solid stars. I think Galfard did a good job of writing it, so that everyone could follow and understand it, but I was still confused. Since I have no background in Science, this was still a struggle to read (the reason for my rating). That was how Science class was for me because I was always learning about metals and rocks, which didn’t exactly, piqued my interest. But nonetheless, it provided me with an eye-opener that there is much much more to the universe than I imagined."
6,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34207574-miquel-reina,5,"I read this book without any expectations and quickly I realized that this, was an amazing book with an amazing adventure. The book mixes a novelistic structure with a learning style and I loved this combination. I think that the idea of explaining hard and abstract concepts from physics and astronomy using a narrative thread that connects and guides the reader in a kind of journey is perfect. I highly recommend this book to all astronomy and physics fans who want to enjoy a space adventure.Spanish version:Empecé a leer este libro sin ninguna expectación y rápidamente me di cuenta que se trataba de un libro exraórdinario que contaba una aventura extraordinaria. El libro mezcla una extructura novelesca con un estilo de aprendizaje, y me ecnantó. Creo que la idea de contar conceptos físicos y espaciales abstractos y díficiles de entender usuando una voz narrativa que guía al lector es perfecto. Recomiendo esta libro a todos los amantes de la astronomía y la física que quieran aprender de una forma mucho más dinámica y divertida. "
7,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28168594-philippe-malzieu,5,"Galfard work with Stépane Hawking. Another astrophysician book? What's news? I was not very interested in reading this book. A friend offered it to me in french edition and I must recognize I had pleasure to read it.It is well written and in fact exciting.Rémi Brague remarked that cosmos etymologically came from beauty, women and jewel. In latin, mundus design cosmos and also female jewelry. Cosmos, beauty, women. I like this association."
8,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5838785-ivana,5,"Mind-bending, fascinating, inspiring, and awe-striking. I'll be thinking about what I've read for weeks. What an amazing universe we live in, and how vastly unknown it is. With new discoveries looming just over the horizon, I can't wait (or imagine) the things we'll come to understand; for understanding our universe ultimately means understanding ourselves and how we came to be. A fantastic read. Simply fantastic. "
9,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,3,"How am I supposed to rate a book that was written by Stephen Hawking's grad student, who is brilliant, when the writing made me dizzy? The description of this book touted it as Miss Frizzle for adults interested in physics. That was an apt description. Galfard took the reader on a chaotic adventure through the world of physics, so chaotic that I feel like I unlearned everything I had previously learned. I found previously familiar subjects hard to follow, simply because of the writing style. This book got tons of great reviews. So, obviously his writing style worked well for others. I honestly felt a sense of motion sickness with each turn of the page. It felt as if facts were flying at me while I read, but I was not being connected to the larger picture. If I had no understanding of physics and tried to read this book I would have been hopelessly lost and would have certainly given up. If the style does not agree with you and you have even a rudimentary grasp of physics, I would suggest you skip to Part Five, where Galfard began to talk about his work with Stephen Hawking. If you start at Part Five, there is a wealth of information in this book because he allows you to understand ongoing black hole research, which made the book worthwhile. Also, I have to say, for as difficult as it was to understand most of the concepts covered in this book (concepts I understood fairly well prior to reading this book), Galfard did an excellent job of summarizing Lisa Randall's work on extra dimensions (not an easy task). "
10,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19554295-lydia,5,"This is seriously in the running for best non-fiction book I've ever read!Anyone who knows me knows I love space. I love looking at stars, planets, nebluae, galaxies and everything else out there. The problem, up until this point, has been that I've never properly understood what any of it is. This book changed all that.It explains everything so clearly. It assumes no knowledge of science at all (thank goodness!) and starts completely from scratch. Over 400 pages you then cover general relativity, quantum mechanics and string theory to name a few of the topics included. The visual imagery is so beautiful and wonderfully easy to read that learning about the universe is almost effortless. Some parts read like a novel, it's so cleverly written to help you understand it. And you really can understand it! Or at least, I could, and my scientific know-how is pitiful. (WAS pitiful!!)I tried 'A Brief History of Time' and had to give up after 30 pages. I managed all of this and would happily read more! I will be buying this book for everyone I know for the next year's worth of birthday presents. I cannot reccomend this enough!"
11,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14072411-melissa,5,My husband enjoys science books and when starts talking about all this intelligent stuff my brain is asleep. Finally a book that makes learning about scientific topics like the universe and time easier to understand and fun at the same time! Even better it's actually for adults! Now I am flaunting my new knowledge at home and once or twice I even got to tell him something he hasn't read about yet! I love this book and hopefully my excited rambling is a good enough review to make you read this awesome book!
12,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85723871-thomas-dietert,4,"The Universe in Your Hand is a remarkable journey through both the very-large and very-small worlds of which most humans could never fathom on their own. It is a special book, one full of nigh-inconceivable conceptions brought to life inside the reader's mind with the tactful aid of Christopher Galfard's prose and deep technical perspectives on all the topics ranging over quantum field theory, particle physics, cosmology, and astrophysics. Gracefully tackling the difficulties of disseminating the nature of such a wide range of subjects to the layman, Galfard succeeds without a shadow of a doubt.Galfard has chosen an incredibly abstract and high-level approach to describe and incite imaginary conceptions of the complex and inhuman ideas that comprise astrophysics and quantum physics, and for much of the book this literary technique resoundingly succeeds. The reader need not already possess an internal visualization of an atom, proton, electron, quark, gluon, muon, or neutrino (or any other sub-atomic particle for that matter!), nor galaxies, black-holes, the surface of last scattering, or the pre-Big Bang inflation field, as Galfard's word weaving reconstructs these brilliant ideas within the mind of the reader with well-worded, impossible-yet-imaginable gedanken (thought) experiments. With these thought experiments, the reader is transported into realms of which the average reader could not conceive on their own, to places such as the nucleus of an atom of Gold, a true vacuum (which is certainly not empty!), the horizon of a black-hole, and at the very end, outside the universe itself(?). This book proved to be a phenomenal companion to several other more concrete, mathematical books about quantum mechanics that I am currently reading and have read alike; In fact, this is the highest value proposition I can give for recommending this book to another mind. The sheer magnitude between the mental models of reality employed by the average reader, and the illustrious mental conceptions presented by Galfard is astounding. The Way the World Works is simply not the way we humans conceive of it to be (due to millions of years of natural selection), and the elegantly phrased content delivery system a-la-gedanken-experiment that panders to our innate spatio-temporal visualization capacities is achieved brilliantly. There is no replacement for learning the maths behind such far-removed aspects of reality as quantum tunneling, quark jails (the strong interaction force), and Hawking radiation; likewise, there is no replacement for well-constructed thought experiments that help one to visualize and internalize such foreign conceptions as the surface of last scattering (the edge of the observable universe), radioactive decay (via weak-interaction force), or bubble universes (string theory(?)). The reason I rated this book 4/5 stars, in lieu of the strong praise given above, has (perhaps redundantly stated) much more to do with my own personal preferences and experience reading the book than any of its content or structure. The literary devices used to transport the reader to virtually unfathomable spaces or times (and sometimes outside the context of either!) are mostly a great success, but were sometimes too far out-there for me to feel like I was actually visualization much of anything coherent at all. Perhaps that was the point, and perhaps I was not playing the role as the imaginer (imaginee?) as well as I could have, but alas, I felt that there were sections where, though I gave it my best, I simply couldn't imagine what I was being asked to. At risk of being redundant (though, a conclusion almost always is): The Universe in Your Hand takes readers on a journey throughout space, time, and beyond. In my opinion, it is a journey that all who have a passion for both better understanding the universe in which we live and constructing better conceptions of physical reality itself, should embark on. So, what are you waiting for?!"
13,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5032322-carol-storm,2,Did not finish -- the science was interesting but the author's voice was too cute. Bring back Isaac Asimov!
14,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102484307-muhammad-abdullah,5,"This is an amazing read which takes readers to the journey through infinite distances in the far-reaches of the universe. The readers see mind-boggling things throughout the journey and get amazing experiences which one can't imagine in daily life. Galfard did a stupendous job to write such a wonderful book. I really love this book and enjoy it a lot. This book can be categorized into three parts.  1. The World of Very Lagre 2. The World of Very Small 3. The World of Very FastThe first two chapters take us to the journey in the world of very large things. This includes stars, galaxies, clusters, black holes etc. The third chapter takes us in the world of very fast where we travel to the far-reaches of heavens with enormous speeds which are much faster than the speed of light. This is the portion where the physical laws breakdown , not in physical manner but in truly imaginative way. The middle chapters take us to scuba dive into the quantum world. The last few chapters strengthen our knowledge about the mysterious worlds of string theory and multiverse. A very good book for layman to know a lot about the universe, black holes, quantum worlds and many more in a very easy and simple way. This is a great book in all aspects. I highly recommend it to all."
15,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48009491-brianna-silva,5,"I don't even know how to express my love for this book. It explains complex scientific concepts in accessible, easy-to-understand terms, by inviting the reader on a narrative journey where they are the protagonist, discovering the wonders of the universe firsthand.For me, this book awoke a somewhat-dormant love for science that I've had since I was a kid. I feel like my eyes have been opened to a whole new world, and I am in love.I went from being almost 100% ignorant about physics and space, to being able to have intelligent conversations about quantum physics, cosmology, multiverse theories, and all sorts of weird aspects of modern science.If you're at all interested in better understanding science, but feel intimidated to learn, pick up this book. Just do it. You'll thank me later.You may just fall in love, too."
16,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4461733-paperclippe,4,"I won't lie, from the outset of this book I was a little bit worried for two reasons: first, because I've reached a point where, because I've read so many popsci books, they all start to sound the same, and therefore just become white noise. Background radiation, if you will. Now, that's obviously not the fault of the book, strictly speaking, but I was hoping that since it was a newer publication, it might have more recent information, especially since the discovery of the Higgs boson and the gravitational waves at LIGO.My second bit of concern was that the little interstitial tidbits, where it was you who was travelling through space and time and experiencing cosmological phenomena first-hand, were a bit too similar to Chris Impey's ""How It Began,"" which was not a bad book, but was guilty of the above issue as well as having interstitials that were... just... bad. They were like sci-fi by someone who's never actually read sci-fi before.Pleasantly, however, both of these fears were assuaged early on, as after just the first few introductory chapters, Galfard did move on to newer theories in physics, both quantum and astro, and presented them in a very comprehensible way (he did say that in the introduction, his two goals were to 1) use only one formula, it being E=mc^2, and to 2) write a book that literally anyone could understand, and I'm fairly certain that that would be the case). Indeed, I was very happy at points to be made to say, ""Hm. I never thought of that."" I mean, that may not seem like a big deal, but I read one of these ""birth of the cosmos""-type books a month, so to even have a new perspective on old information is always a delight (and probably why I keep coming back to them over and over again). And of course, Galfard did delve into newer and fresher topics, discussing the Higgs boson (and the problems with it; how it only gives some particles mass and leaves others alone), the gravitation wave detection at LIGO as well as the future of these detectors with VIRGO and LISA, and the touchy subject of quantum gravity - in fact, I could stand to go back and listen to those parts again.The only part that really made me full-on emoji frown was that at the end of the book, Galfard went full on woo-woo string theory. Now, I realize that this isn't the time nor the place to get into why I'm so highly skeptical regarding strings and Ms and 'branes, but for the sake of fair criticism I will say that Galfard was guilty of all the same things that other proponents of string theory seem to be guilty of: he, and they, tell you what string theory might explain. They tell you about that maths that might make it work. They use the word ""might"" a lot. They kind of gloss over the problems with it (where are the super symmetrical partners? why are its predictions of vacuum energy so goofy?) and ignore the fact that it is incapable of presenting falsifiable evidence, that it is completely untestable. And as for what string theory might mean? What might it imply if the universe is not made of dual particle-waves? But anyway, I've wasted way too much space in a book review talking about something that has very little to do with the book at all. I'll wrap that up by saying that it's not so much that he presented string theory as an option that bugs me, it's that Galfard presented exactly no other options, putting all his cosmological eggs in one stringy basket. And, I have to be honest, actually, it was one of the most fair assessments of string theory I've ever heard while still being unabashedly and shamelessly pro-string theory.I really do believe that Galfard achieved what he set out to do in the beginning of the book - he wrote a book that just about anyone with a vested interest in science, and maybe even those without, would be captivated by and would understand. He succeeded in presenting a text that didn't just rehash old information, but made you think about old information in new ways, and in the context of new discoveries, more of which are coming our way all the time, and did it in a compelling and fun way. There are a lot of popular science books riding this cosmological wave right now, but The Universe in Your Hand is the first one in a long time that really made me sit up and think about what it all means, and for that, I recommend this book enormously."
17,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21735404-empirical-rationalist,5,"I started this book with no high expectations. And the thought experiment Galfard uses at the beginning felt almost fatuous. But with that feeling, I kept breezing through the book. All chapters are being grouped under 7 overarching parts, and they are tied and flow organically. There is a summary whenever lots of ground is covered. A lot of concepts, which are taken for granted, are being elucidated fantastically. I was irked when he changed the thought experiment setting from just mind to corporeal one and back, but again it helped to clarify the concepts he is trying to explain. I feel like I have a better understanding on theories like Cosmic Background Radiation, Cosmological Inflation, and General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics' takes on Black Holes. This is the first Popular Science book from which I understood why and how General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory are contradictory. And the whole purpose of Schrödinger’s cat gedanken experiment is being put in context beautifully. The tone of the book is very conversational. Considering my reading pace, I finished this quite fast. This work stands very well with Einstein's quote ""If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself."""
18,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71784540-cosmaelogy,5,"This was the book that got me into space. It's so beautifully written in a way that is perfectly understandable for someone with minimal knowledge of physics and space in general. It's not a book that just spews out facts but it gives you brilliant imagery so you can very much feel like you actually are on a journey through the cosmos and beyond. Because of this book, I really have developed an even bigger fascination for space and the universe. I have so much love for this book and I think it's going to be one of my most favourite reads ever. "
19,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46502154-anna,4,It's a fascinating book even though absorbing and remembering all of this knowledge after just one read seems like an impossible task... What probably means I'll read it again sometime in the future ;) 
20,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,4,"I will start with the positives. As works of popular physics go, this is genuinely interesting and can hold the attention of a non-genius reader ( i.e. all of us who do not understand physics at all). The book does indeed contain only one equation and it never strays far from common explanations of incredibly, stupidly complicated things. In this regard, the author completely hit the mark. However, particularly in the introductory part, and at times peppered through the book, are narrative pieces which I did not enjoy. The shtick the author uses to take the reader through complicated phenomena is to help them envision themselves on a beach, looking up at the stars, flying through space, meeting robots, going into a black hole and so on and so forth. As a mechanism for the delivery of tangible knowledge, this is useful. As fragments of narrative prose, they diminish the overall effect of the book. In those paragraphs, the sentences are too short, the imagination is not rattled and the use of incessant metaphors in order to force the reader in that imaginative framework can be pretty annoying at times. Overall, as long as you can get past that, the writing is good, the subject is dealt with simply and clearly, and one would come better off having read this than not."
21,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42028968-nicola,5,"I can only say good things about this book! I just love everything about it. It has to be one of my favourite all time non fiction books. Such an all encompassing, insightful view of our universe. Definitely a book to immerse yourself in and get lost amongst the pages as you travel through the stars, black holes, quantum physics and the fundamentals of the universe. I didn’t want it to end !! "
22,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58199290-janice-bridger,4,"I thought this book was appropriate as my last read of the year! It stretched my mind but allowed me to expand my knowledge of our understanding of the universe.I was recommended to read it by a physics teacher and was naturally suspicious that it would be beyond me, but was pleasantly surprised for 3/4 of it! You take part in a flight of imagination or gedanken experiment to go to the edges of the visible universe- both large and small! Then travelling very fast (nearly at the speed of light) and slow! You look at existing theories such as those of Newton and Einstein and see how far they apply. It was only when it got beyond the known visible edges into pure thought that I struggled- partly because in an effort to access it to all readers, things were often stated with little info as to how we got there - cosmic background microwave radiation, bubble universes and string theory for example -I felt a bit rushed and needed far more time to think about them. I suppose everything had its fair share it’s just the later things were less likely to be understood by the average reader so felt more rushed! Anyway despite that it’s a must read as long as you are prepared to think and are interested!!"
23,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34660926-kristen-kieffer,2,"Actual Rating: 2.5 / 5 starsDespite learning quite a bit from this book, I DNF'd at roughly the 65% - 70% mark. Galfard's ""hands-on"" way of explaining the many complex elements of astrophysics was, at first, fun. But as the book continued, the situations and explanations he described became increasingly wacky and, ironically, made the concepts more difficult to understand. I no longer had the patience to devote to unraveling them, so you're all getting a rare DNF sighting from me. Woo."

28,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8317760-colin-ring,5,One of the best and most accessible science books I've read lately. Wow!
29,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41302595-zheng,3,There is too much Unnecessary Narrative in each chapter in this book that I have to page very frequently to read some of interesting paragraphs
30,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,2,The author was doing something with words and letters but wasn't exactly writing
31,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39453356-katie,5,"I loved every single word of this, beginning to end. This is exactly the space/science/physics book I was looking for. It takes such huge concepts and explains them in ways that you can really understand, but never in a manner that is condescending or overly simplistic. I read about things that I already found interesting (black holes, the beginning of the universe, cosmological concepts, parallel universe theories) and managed to understand them in more depth. And I also read about things that I haven’t looked into in that much depth, and found them absolutely fascinating – for instance, quantum and particle physics which I never, ever managed to grasp at school. The author’s writing is so evocative and engaging too. Sometimes, with science books, the concepts are totally intriguing and that is what makes the book so interesting to read, but in this one, it was the combination of his style and the subject. It was so warm and descriptive, breaking down these complex topics and allowing you to visualise them in a succession of thought experiments – travelling through the universe to the surface of last scattering, going beyond the event horizons of black holes, and down to the very, very small with quantum fields. The author effortlessly and seamlessly goes between the known and the unknown and the very, very and the very, very tiny and summarises everything so beautifully. I knew it was going to be good from the first chapter with the gorgeous and chilling description of the death of the sun, placing the reader in the midst of this massive cosmic event. The chapters and parts were set out so well and clearly, breaking it down into nice, digestible chunks. I highly, highly recommend this book to anyone just getting into these scientific concepts or wanting to know about them in more depth. I overshot with diving straight into Brian Cox’s Universal (although I am just listening to the audiobook of his The Planets and it is wonderful), but this was exactly the kind of book I was looking for. And it was great to read the Epilogue with all the hopes for the future of science and understanding the universe. Science is such a bedrock of our world and incredibly important, especially in these times of deniers. The ending on the note of the LIGO and VIRGO gravitational wave detectors was a great point to conclude on, drawing together all the knowledge thus far and showing how it has built upon itself. This was only three years before the very first picture of the M-87 black hole was taken, also, so it is exciting to think what is coming. This was absolutely my favourite non-fiction science book so far! Thank you for the wonderful journey, Christophe Galfard!"

Gravity is amazing and what causes gravity is even more phenomenal. As long as this was the topic then I was loving this book. But as soon as the book switches over to quantum field theory(about halfway through the book) I got lost and confused haha. I understand this isn’t the authors fault, it’s just that quantum physics is THAT hard to understand as a concept. Quarks, Gluons, Positrons, the disappearing of particles and reappearing again, the wall of last scattering, string theory, plank dimensions...it’s all very hard to mentally picture and that makes it hard to grasp.

You can tell the author loves the subject of the book and is excited to share his findings and those before him. I did learn a lot and am amazed by the brilliant minds that have helped us to understand the universe as we can in the now. It’s amazing how much we know that we didn’t only 100 years ago.

36,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25999818-jason-oliver,5,"I love reading about physics and this book is one of the best Ive read. Having different people explain the same things in different ways really helps to grasp these complicsted and difficult concepts. Galfard takes you on thought experiment after thought experiment to help you understand thebuniverse, both the large and the small. You imagine being in black hole and you imagine riding electomagnetic waves. This is how phsics has mainly progressed since Einstein and Galfard lets you pretend you are the physicist. He even leads you to an answer and then commends your for figuring it out, even discovering it. The book felt like being part of The Magic School Bus. This book also covers some more recent discoveries such as the detection of gravitational waves when two black holes collided. Lastly, he takes you where physics isnheaded. He takes you on though experiments to what things are likenif some of the leading theories are true.A great book. The author obtained his PHD under Dtephen Hawking and worked with Hawking on black holes and the origin of the universe. But imaginary time still confises me. I dont grasp that concept. Maybe the next explination will work."
37,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4196-bobby,5,"A wonderful, basic introduction to topics like gravity, quantum theory, Einstein's theories, and the like. This book is likely too superficial for physics majors, but I think it's an excellent first book for most others. I recommend starting with this one, before moving on to Brian Greene, Stephen Hawking, etc. The writing style is breezy, conversational style, and as the author states in the intro, the only equation in the whole book is E=mc2. I do think the book would have benefited from some illustrations but this is a minor issue."
38,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467608-serro,2,"Mr Galfard brings nothing new to the table. Maybe just the approach of a journey through space as a mind to explore general relativity and as a mini-you to explore the quantum world, which honestly at times was rather silly.Yet as a whole it is a good introduction to the world of the very big and the very small projected at first timers of these realms. I didn't really test the sense of humour in it and I think that should Mr Galfard have an aunt she wouldn't be too pleased either, especially if she likes vases. Those who start reading this book will know what I mean."
39,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93676995-ashleigh-trickett,4,"This book is beautifully written, surprisingly poetic in parts, with an unexpected vein of humour threaded throughout! The opening chapters capture your imagination and attention, followed by many moments of drama and theatrics. This series of gedanken experiments are fun, interesting and more importantly, accessible. Galfard lives up to his ambition/promise in chapter 1 -he leaves no one behind."
40,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74056738-corry-sweet,5,"I like this book because the author doesn't just throw maths down your throat. The only equation in the entire book is Einstein's E=mc2 so you don't need a first class in physics from Cambridge to understand most of it. For anyone that is bored of being stuck on Earth during lockdown, I highly recommend this."

47,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46621828-alex,4,Very informative and thought-provoking. Galfard provides the reader with an amazingly detailed perspective of the various fields that surround us and make up our universe.

49,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9300518-arielle,4,A fun listen. Lots of visualization and immersion and the language isn’t too confusing tho there were still plenty of concepts I was like “durrrr what?”. Recommended if you want a brief look at the craziness that is space.
50,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53483800-alyson-walton,4,"This was a book I was expecting to love . . .yet I didn't. Can't lie, I found this book hard work.Whilst all the concepts are there, and the explanations are throughly dealt with, I agree with reviews which cite them as over simplified. Not that this isn't useful to a none scientist like me, just that it is repetitive and ends up a little annoying."
51,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5861984-judyta-szaci-o,3,"I quite enjoyed my time with this book even though the tone of its narrative did not always agree with me. I've seen that other people called it 'condescending' and 'patronising' in their reviews. I wouldn't go as far. I didn't feel patronised while reading it. I just felt I wasn't the target audience, that's all. The book is clearly thought to address the beginners while I - ignorant as I am in this field - can't call myself a beginner, having devoured several books by other authors on the same matters.In places, Galfard made some issues easier for me to visualise. In other instances, he confused me about the things I though I had already grasped. Overall, sadly, I don't think I've learnt anything new. However, with Michio Kaku's Parallel Worlds: A Journey through Creation, Higher Dimensions, and the Future of the Cosmos getting more and more dated with every passing year, Galfard's book may be the one I'd recommend to those who want to start on a journey through modern physics."
52,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,4,"I'm a bit uncertain on how to rate, or even review, this book. On the one hand, the explanations of physics, quantum mechanics, general relativity, astrophysics, cosmology, gravity, etc are pretty good and, most importantly, understandable without requiring a physics degree.* On the other hand, the imaginary adventurous travels (i.e. thought experiments) to such things as the inside of atoms and the cosmos in general just didn't really work for me, though I did eventually get used to it. Maybe this sort of thing works better for people who have pictures and movies pop up in their heads when they read books, but that simply isn't me. Otherwise, an interesting introductiory book that makes mind-bending subjects not so complicated, while managing to be entertaining at the same time.~~~~*Except String Theory. I think you need to have ingested a substantial quantity of magic mushrooms for that to make any sense."

I absolutely loved this book, this explained the recent developments in physics and clearly substantiates the facts of physics really well.Protons are made up of quarks while these are held together by a strong force which is generated by gluons. The further quarks are apart the more ferocious the strong force becomes. The carriers of the strongest force we know, the strong nuclear force, which keeps quarks confined, only allowing them to be free when they are holding close to one another, thus guaranteeing that the matter we are made of does not split apart. Quarks and gluons.These make up 99.97 % of our body mass. Two gluons bind to make a quark duet or a meson, which hold sthe nucleus together with the strong nuclear force. The nucleus is responsible for the lose of mass in the thermonuclear fusion reaction of the sun converts mass to energy.Particles that no one looks at do travel through all possible paths that space-time can offer. On it's way it splits into an infinite number of ghost images, or a wave, rippling in all directions through space-time. ""The very act of probing reality changes it's nature."" ""Just like all the thoughts you may or may not have on a given subject suddenly becomes reduced to one who hears you speak it out loud.""It goes into how John Dirac, created the idea of the quantum field and discovered antimatter by consequence. He expounds with an analogy, if an electron appeared out of nowhere this would mean that there has to be some sort of dormant energy according to E=mc^2. This anti-electron was discovered an called a positron, and there are other anti-particles that are related to other elementary particles (quarks, gluons, photons etc.).The quest to understand reality is a personal one, when all is said and done, and neither the supercomputer nor I should impose our views upon you. It's your right to have ideas of your own.-GalfordThis books starts out going from the absolute in physics to dubious, providing a firm foundation to the exploration of the mysteries of the universe which is later in the book.One can argue there are three kinds of mysteries in physics. The first ones are inherent to the theories themselves; they are theoretical. The second ones are rooted in observations and experiments. These are the ones that usually, but not always, drive research. The third type of mystery arises when no one understands anything anymore. - GalfordSome believe that gravity is a force of particles called gravitons, even though despite gravitons having no known reason to interact with one another were they to exist and being elementary they should be able to appear everywhere, this leading to a collapse in pretty much everywhere from gravity. Scientists believe that gravitons do exist, at least to as a part of the bigger theory that everybody is looking for.Quantum Superposition is how a particle when undetected is in all possible places at once, kind of like a wave. When detected this particle stops, and this is called quantum wave collapse. Heisenberg Uncertainty principle is you can never know where the particle is (position) or it's velocity. The Schrodinger's cat experiment demonstrates quantum superposition macroscopically, by placing a cat in a box that you cannot see. Then place a radioactive element in it (1/2 of radioactive decay), then place an vial of poison in the box and smash it. Since you cannot see the cat this means it is both dead and alive at the same time. Hugh Everett III said because of this quantum superposition, everything even our universe should be thought of as a quantum wave with parallel universes around us existing out of all the possibilities that could have been in our own universe.Adding the mass of every star, dust cloud, and everything else of the Milky Way. There is not enough matter to keep any star from shooting away, given the velocity. There should be about five times more matter than what you can see, Jan Oort discovered this and called it Dark Matter. Hubble's Law is when galaxies twice as far away from each other moves away twice as fast. This lead to the discovery of an anti-gravitational force, repelling matter and energy instead of attracting them. This is called Dark Energy and to account for its observed effects there must be lots of it (3 times more than dark matter). This leaves Dark Energy (72%), Dark Matter (23%), and the matter we know including light (4.6%). Singularities are when there are too much mass, or energy, in too small a volume, leading to the collapse of space-time. This is supposedly how black holes start and how our universe and space time was formed. The Inflationary period, the was a field filling the universe with a repulsive anti-gravity force. That field was so powerful that it triggered a period of extreme expansion, an extreme expansion that blew apart different parts of the early universe at a rate much faster that the speed of light, allowing for places that today seem to far apart to have ever been in touch to actually have been in the past. (This is no contradiction to limit for speed of light, because space-time itself expanded.) This also explains how the universe is isotropic, not including aniotropies (which are tiny temperature differences). This expansion released an extraordinary amt of energy, and this is what is thought to be the catalyst of the Big Bang. The No boundary proposal by hawking-hartle proposed that the universe has no beginning as we would understand it, they mathematically proved this.From the Earth we have a foreseeable radius of 13.8 billion years, the Planck's scale is the limit to what we can probe both in the very small and the very big. Theoretically, there exists a quantum string it is the most fundamental elements of our universe, it also is ten dimensional, not within the dimensions that we can perceive. However, Closed Strings, some call these gravitrons and branes which can propagate through spacetime. The Anthropic priniciple states that out of the unfathomably man possible forms extra dimensions could take, only the ones compatible with the existence of humans need be taken into account for us to be here, or we wouldn't be around to talk about them. Gedanken experiments are experiments of pure thought. In September 2015, was the telltale signal of two black holes merging, we had no idea that black holes could merge with each other, let alone merge. Thanks to this signal it confirms that what we think of black holes corresponds with real ones."

I appreciated the list of topics covered by all chapters.However, I think the author should not be afraid and underestimate readers, by assuming that ""popularization"" means being limited both in vocabulary and in long-term passed knowledge. Carl Sagan, among others, proved that science can be accessible to all without sacrificing scientific (or literary, for that matter) language and information, becoming a best-seller in a decade where educational level was for sure one step behind today's. So, if the goal was to give the reader a sense of satisfaction and achievement having grasped some main concepts without much effort, then it's a success. But the wonderful reality behind science requires waking up souls and curious spirits, instead of only giving a color-by-numbers-type guide to our Universe."

I had already read Brian Greene’s Fabric of the Cosmos which I found to be an engaging and straightforward description of physics. Because he came after that text, Galford’s just didn’t measure up to my expectations.If you have never read a general account of physics, this work will certainly help you understand this fascinating subject."

I absolutely loved this book, this explained the recent developments in physics and clearly substantiates the facts of physics really well.Protons are made up of quarks while these are held together by a strong force which is generated by gluons. The further quarks are apart the more ferocious the strong force becomes. The carriers of the strongest force we know, the strong nuclear force, which keeps quarks confined, only allowing them to be free when they are holding close to one another, thus guaranteeing that the matter we are made of does not split apart. Quarks and gluons.These make up 99.97 % of our body mass. Two gluons bind to make a quark duet or a meson, which hold sthe nucleus together with the strong nuclear force. The nucleus is responsible for the lose of mass in the thermonuclear fusion reaction of the sun converts mass to energy.Particles that no one looks at do travel through all possible paths that space-time can offer. On it's way it splits into an infinite number of ghost images, or a wave, rippling in all directions through space-time. ""The very act of probing reality changes it's nature."" ""Just like all the thoughts you may or may not have on a given subject suddenly becomes reduced to one who hears you speak it out loud.""It goes into how John Dirac, created the idea of the quantum field and discovered antimatter by consequence. He expounds with an analogy, if an electron appeared out of nowhere this would mean that there has to be some sort of dormant energy according to E=mc^2. This anti-electron was discovered an called a positron, and there are other anti-particles that are related to other elementary particles (quarks, gluons, photons etc.).The quest to understand reality is a personal one, when all is said and done, and neither the supercomputer nor I should impose our views upon you. It's your right to have ideas of your own.-GalfordThis books starts out going from the absolute in physics to dubious, providing a firm foundation to the exploration of the mysteries of the universe which is later in the book.One can argue there are three kinds of mysteries in physics. The first ones are inherent to the theories themselves; they are theoretical. The second ones are rooted in observations and experiments. These are the ones that usually, but not always, drive research. The third type of mystery arises when no one understands anything anymore. - GalfordSome believe that gravity is a force of particles called gravitons, even though despite gravitons having no known reason to interact with one another were they to exist and being elementary they should be able to appear everywhere, this leading to a collapse in pretty much everywhere from gravity. Scientists believe that gravitons do exist, at least to as a part of the bigger theory that everybody is looking for.Quantum Superposition is how a particle when undetected is in all possible places at once, kind of like a wave. When detected this particle stops, and this is called quantum wave collapse. Heisenberg Uncertainty principle is you can never know where the particle is (position) or it's velocity. The Schrodinger's cat experiment demonstrates quantum superposition macroscopically, by placing a cat in a box that you cannot see. Then place a radioactive element in it (1/2 of radioactive decay), then place an vial of poison in the box and smash it. Since you cannot see the cat this means it is both dead and alive at the same time. Hugh Everett III said because of this quantum superposition, everything even our universe should be thought of as a quantum wave with parallel universes around us existing out of all the possibilities that could have been in our own universe.Adding the mass of every star, dust cloud, and everything else of the Milky Way. There is not enough matter to keep any star from shooting away, given the velocity. There should be about five times more matter than what you can see, Jan Oort discovered this and called it Dark Matter. Hubble's Law is when galaxies twice as far away from each other moves away twice as fast. This lead to the discovery of an anti-gravitational force, repelling matter and energy instead of attracting them. This is called Dark Energy and to account for its observed effects there must be lots of it (3 times more than dark matter). This leaves Dark Energy (72%), Dark Matter (23%), and the matter we know including light (4.6%). Singularities are when there are too much mass, or energy, in too small a volume, leading to the collapse of space-time. This is supposedly how black holes start and how our universe and space time was formed. The Inflationary period, the was a field filling the universe with a repulsive anti-gravity force. That field was so powerful that it triggered a period of extreme expansion, an extreme expansion that blew apart different parts of the early universe at a rate much faster that the speed of light, allowing for places that today seem to far apart to have ever been in touch to actually have been in the past. (This is no contradiction to limit for speed of light, because space-time itself expanded.) This also explains how the universe is isotropic, not including aniotropies (which are tiny temperature differences). This expansion released an extraordinary amt of energy, and this is what is thought to be the catalyst of the Big Bang. The No boundary proposal by hawking-hartle proposed that the universe has no beginning as we would understand it, they mathematically proved this.From the Earth we have a foreseeable radius of 13.8 billion years, the Planck's scale is the limit to what we can probe both in the very small and the very big. Theoretically, there exists a quantum string it is the most fundamental elements of our universe, it also is ten dimensional, not within the dimensions that we can perceive. However, Closed Strings, some call these gravitrons and branes which can propagate through spacetime. The Anthropic priniciple states that out of the unfathomably man possible forms extra dimensions could take, only the ones compatible with the existence of humans need be taken into account for us to be here, or we wouldn't be around to talk about them. Gedanken experiments are experiments of pure thought. In September 2015, was the telltale signal of two black holes merging, we had no idea that black holes could merge with each other, let alone merge. Thanks to this signal it confirms that what we think of black holes corresponds with real ones."

I appreciated the list of topics covered by all chapters.However, I think the author should not be afraid and underestimate readers, by assuming that ""popularization"" means being limited both in vocabulary and in long-term passed knowledge. Carl Sagan, among others, proved that science can be accessible to all without sacrificing scientific (or literary, for that matter) language and information, becoming a best-seller in a decade where educational level was for sure one step behind today's. So, if the goal was to give the reader a sense of satisfaction and achievement having grasped some main concepts without much effort, then it's a success. But the wonderful reality behind science requires waking up souls and curious spirits, instead of only giving a color-by-numbers-type guide to our Universe."
87,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49160575-kris,2,"I wanted to like this book, but I was annoyed by the imagined visualizations. I had already read Brian Greene’s Fabric of the Cosmos which I found to be an engaging and straightforward description of physics. Because he came after that text, Galford’s just didn’t measure up to my expectations.If you have never read a general account of physics, this work will certainly help you understand this fascinating subject."
88,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59872036-milo,5,the book was really intresting and fun to read but it was very complicated and took a while to get through
89,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46101008-aidan,2,I only read about 50% of this book. I gave up because it's been weirdly written. This is a children's science book. 
90,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,2,The author was doing something with words and letters but wasn't exactly writing
91,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39453356-katie,5,"I loved every single word of this, beginning to end. This is exactly the space/science/physics book I was looking for. It takes such huge concepts and explains them in ways that you can really understand, but never in a manner that is condescending or overly simplistic. I read about things that I already found interesting (black holes, the beginning of the universe, cosmological concepts, parallel universe theories) and managed to understand them in more depth. And I also read about things that I haven’t looked into in that much depth, and found them absolutely fascinating – for instance, quantum and particle physics which I never, ever managed to grasp at school. The author’s writing is so evocative and engaging too. Sometimes, with science books, the concepts are totally intriguing and that is what makes the book so interesting to read, but in this one, it was the combination of his style and the subject. It was so warm and descriptive, breaking down these complex topics and allowing you to visualise them in a succession of thought experiments – travelling through the universe to the surface of last scattering, going beyond the event horizons of black holes, and down to the very, very small with quantum fields. The author effortlessly and seamlessly goes between the known and the unknown and the very, very and the very, very tiny and summarises everything so beautifully. I knew it was going to be good from the first chapter with the gorgeous and chilling description of the death of the sun, placing the reader in the midst of this massive cosmic event. The chapters and parts were set out so well and clearly, breaking it down into nice, digestible chunks. I highly, highly recommend this book to anyone just getting into these scientific concepts or wanting to know about them in more depth. I overshot with diving straight into Brian Cox’s Universal (although I am just listening to the audiobook of his The Planets and it is wonderful), but this was exactly the kind of book I was looking for. And it was great to read the Epilogue with all the hopes for the future of science and understanding the universe. Science is such a bedrock of our world and incredibly important, especially in these times of deniers. The ending on the note of the LIGO and VIRGO gravitational wave detectors was a great point to conclude on, drawing together all the knowledge thus far and showing how it has built upon itself. This was only three years before the very first picture of the M-87 black hole was taken, also, so it is exciting to think what is coming. This was absolutely my favourite non-fiction science book so far! Thank you for the wonderful journey, Christophe Galfard!"
92,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3073125-jon-ure-a,5,"At first, I thought I wouldn't like it much. The information was framed in a sort of narrative which initially took too much space. Although it did distract at times, astronomy, and many of the natural forces, are very visual and easier to understand that way. Still, I probably could have done without most/all of the references to the ""great-auntie"" character.I thought this book did an exceptional job making you understand why scientists thought there were holes in the theories of that time and what would fill them. It clarified aspects of quantum field theory that were muddled for me, such as how did the particles pop up to life and which were related to which forces. It earned extra points for showing how the universe would look when travelling at near light speed, and the temporal distortion related to general relativity.It reminded me that there's so much to find out yet. Dark matter and energy are out there according to the current theories, but they might be imaginary placeholders for whole aspects of reality we don't understand. General relativity and quantum field theory don't speak to each other, meaning there's likely an underlying theory that would connect both but that scientists can barely hypothesize about. Although black holes probably hold the key, no information seems to survive falling in. There was a bit about string theory at the end; given that it hasn't produced any proof, I became disillusioned about it years ago.Always nice to read about quantum mechanics, although I wish it could have gone deeper into its weirdness: nonlocality and entanglement, the observer effect, quantum tunnelling and the wave-particle duality, for example, but there are plenty of books focusing on that particular subject out there.In general, a fantastic book lacking in formulas (thankfully, because I'm abysmal in math) that shows how science can explain the universe in 2017 and what remains to be understood."
93,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62639477-taylor-woodson,3,"For me this book was extremely interesting as long as I was reading about General and Special Relativity. Gravity is amazing and what causes gravity is even more phenomenal. As long as this was the topic then I was loving this book. But as soon as the book switches over to quantum field theory(about halfway through the book) I got lost and confused haha. I understand this isn’t the authors fault, it’s just that quantum physics is THAT hard to understand as a concept. Quarks, Gluons, Positrons, the disappearing of particles and reappearing again, the wall of last scattering, string theory, plank dimensions...it’s all very hard to mentally picture and that makes it hard to grasp. A nod to the author though for giving it his best to make such difficult concepts easy(or easier) to read."
94,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82471363-emmanouil,5,"Very interesting book. It touches on many of the prevalent theories and ideas behind our understanding of the universe, its past, present, and future. As such, it risked being overly complex and hard to follow, something that the authirs works around perfectly. His anecdotes and presentation of each topic are simple so that people like myself without a strong background in physis can understand most of it fairly easily(some concepts are inherently harder to grasp), while also being educational enough to give one a good introduction to many extremely interesting ideas.A MUST read for anyone interested in learning a few things about our universe but is not armed with the proper theoretical background."
95,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35045797-iris-alvino,5,Well that was epic. The overall tone of the book was witty and good humored. You can tell the author loves the subject of the book and is excited to share his findings and those before him. I did learn a lot and am amazed by the brilliant minds that have helped us to understand the universe as we can in the now. It’s amazing how much we know that we didn’t only 100 years ago. I’m excited to see what our new eye in the sky can detect and hope we get proof of multiverses and wormholes and even life on other planets and within other universes. Man that would be amazing to have proven in my lifetime. I definitely will keep my ear out for everything that is soon to be discovered.

These are the ones that usually, but not always, drive research. The third type of mystery arises when no one understands anything anymore. - GalfordSome believe that gravity is a force of particles called gravitons, even though despite gravitons having no known reason to interact with one another were they to exist and being elementary they should be able to appear everywhere, this leading to a collapse in pretty much everywhere from gravity. Scientists believe that gravitons do exist, at least to as a part of the bigger theory that everybody is looking for.Quantum Superposition is how a particle when undetected is in all possible places at once, kind of like a wave. When detected this particle stops, and this is called quantum wave collapse. Heisenberg Uncertainty principle is you can never know where the particle is (position) or it's velocity. The Schrodinger's cat experiment demonstrates quantum superposition macroscopically, by placing a cat in a box that you cannot see. Then place a radioactive element in it (1/2 of radioactive decay), then place an vial of poison in the box and smash it.

There should be about five times more matter than what you can see, Jan Oort discovered this and called it Dark Matter. Hubble's Law is when galaxies twice as far away from each other moves away twice as fast. This lead to the discovery of an anti-gravitational force, repelling matter and energy instead of attracting them. This is called Dark Energy and to account for its observed effects there must be lots of it (3 times more than dark matter). This leaves Dark Energy (72%), Dark Matter (23%), and the matter we know including light (4.6%). Singularities are when there are too much mass, or energy, in too small a volume, leading to the collapse of space-time. This is supposedly how black holes start and how our universe and space time was formed. The Inflationary period, the was a field filling the universe with a repulsive anti-gravity force. That field was so powerful that it triggered a period of extreme expansion, an extreme expansion that blew apart different parts of the early universe at a rate much faster that the speed of light, allowing for places that today seem to far apart to have ever been in touch to actually have been in the past. (This is no contradiction to limit for speed of light, because space-time itself expanded.)

118,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59872036-milo,5,the book was really intresting and fun to read but it was very complicated and took a while to get through
119,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46101008-aidan,2,I only read about 50% of this book. I gave up because it's been weirdly written. This is a children's science book. 
120,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,2,The author was doing something with words and letters but wasn't exactly writing
121,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39453356-katie,5,"I loved every single word of this, beginning to end. This is exactly the space/science/physics book I was looking for. It takes such huge concepts and explains them in ways that you can really understand, but never in a manner that is condescending or overly simplistic. I read about things that I already found interesting (black holes, the beginning of the universe, cosmological concepts, parallel universe theories) and managed to understand them in more depth. And I also read about things that I haven’t looked into in that much depth, and found them absolutely fascinating – for instance, quantum and particle physics which I never, ever managed to grasp at school. The author’s writing is so evocative and engaging too. Sometimes, with science books, the concepts are totally intriguing and that is what makes the book so interesting to read, but in this one, it was the combination of his style and the subject. It was so warm and descriptive, breaking down these complex topics and allowing you to visualise them in a succession of thought experiments – travelling through the universe to the surface of last scattering, going beyond the event horizons of black holes, and down to the very, very small with quantum fields. The author effortlessly and seamlessly goes between the known and the unknown and the very, very and the very, very tiny and summarises everything so beautifully. I knew it was going to be good from the first chapter with the gorgeous and chilling description of the death of the sun, placing the reader in the midst of this massive cosmic event. The chapters and parts were set out so well and clearly, breaking it down into nice, digestible chunks. I highly, highly recommend this book to anyone just getting into these scientific concepts or wanting to know about them in more depth. I overshot with diving straight into Brian Cox’s Universal (although I am just listening to the audiobook of his The Planets and it is wonderful), but this was exactly the kind of book I was looking for. And it was great to read the Epilogue with all the hopes for the future of science and understanding the universe. Science is such a bedrock of our world and incredibly important, especially in these times of deniers. The ending on the note of the LIGO and VIRGO gravitational wave detectors was a great point to conclude on, drawing together all the knowledge thus far and showing how it has built upon itself. This was only three years before the very first picture of the M-87 black hole was taken, also, so it is exciting to think what is coming. This was absolutely my favourite non-fiction science book so far! Thank you for the wonderful journey, Christophe Galfard!"
122,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3073125-jon-ure-a,5,"At first, I thought I wouldn't like it much. The information was framed in a sort of narrative which initially took too much space. Although it did distract at times, astronomy, and many of the natural forces, are very visual and easier to understand that way. Still, I probably could have done without most/all of the references to the ""great-auntie"" character.I thought this book did an exceptional job making you understand why scientists thought there were holes in the theories of that time and what would fill them. It clarified aspects of quantum field theory that were muddled for me, such as how did the particles pop up to life and which were related to which forces. It earned extra points for showing how the universe would look when travelling at near light speed, and the temporal distortion related to general relativity.It reminded me that there's so much to find out yet. Dark matter and energy are out there according to the current theories, but they might be imaginary placeholders for whole aspects of reality we don't understand. General relativity and quantum field theory don't speak to each other, meaning there's likely an underlying theory that would connect both but that scientists can barely hypothesize about. Although black holes probably hold the key, no information seems to survive falling in. There was a bit about string theory at the end; given that it hasn't produced any proof, I became disillusioned about it years ago.Always nice to read about quantum mechanics, although I wish it could have gone deeper into its weirdness: nonlocality and entanglement, the observer effect, quantum tunnelling and the wave-particle duality, for example, but there are plenty of books focusing on that particular subject out there.In general, a fantastic book lacking in formulas (thankfully, because I'm abysmal in math) that shows how science can explain the universe in 2017 and what remains to be understood."
123,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62639477-taylor-woodson,3,"For me this book was extremely interesting as long as I was reading about General and Special Relativity. Gravity is amazing and what causes gravity is even more phenomenal. As long as this was the topic then I was loving this book. But as soon as the book switches over to quantum field theory(about halfway through the book) I got lost and confused haha. I understand this isn’t the authors fault, it’s just that quantum physics is THAT hard to understand as a concept. Quarks, Gluons, Positrons, the disappearing of particles and reappearing again, the wall of last scattering, string theory, plank dimensions...it’s all very hard to mentally picture and that makes it hard to grasp. A nod to the author though for giving it his best to make such difficult concepts easy(or easier) to read."
124,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82471363-emmanouil,5,"Very interesting book. It touches on many of the prevalent theories and ideas behind our understanding of the universe, its past, present, and future. As such, it risked being overly complex and hard to follow, something that the authirs works around perfectly. His anecdotes and presentation of each topic are simple so that people like myself without a strong background in physis can understand most of it fairly easily(some concepts are inherently harder to grasp), while also being educational enough to give one a good introduction to many extremely interesting ideas.A MUST read for anyone interested in learning a few things about our universe but is not armed with the proper theoretical background."
125,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35045797-iris-alvino,5,Well that was epic. The overall tone of the book was witty and good humored. You can tell the author loves the subject of the book and is excited to share his findings and those before him. I did learn a lot and am amazed by the brilliant minds that have helped us to understand the universe as we can in the now. It’s amazing how much we know that we didn’t only 100 years ago. I’m excited to see what our new eye in the sky can detect and hope we get proof of multiverses and wormholes and even life on other planets and within other universes. Man that would be amazing to have proven in my lifetime. I definitely will keep my ear out for everything that is soon to be discovered. 
126,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25999818-jason-oliver,5,"I love reading about physics and this book is one of the best Ive read. Having different people explain the same things in different ways really helps to grasp these complicsted and difficult concepts. Galfard takes you on thought experiment after thought experiment to help you understand thebuniverse, both the large and the small. You imagine being in black hole and you imagine riding electomagnetic waves. This is how phsics has mainly progressed since Einstein and Galfard lets you pretend you are the physicist. He even leads you to an answer and then commends your for figuring it out, even discovering it. The book felt like being part of The Magic School Bus. This book also covers some more recent discoveries such as the detection of gravitational waves when two black holes collided. Lastly, he takes you where physics isnheaded. He takes you on though experiments to what things are likenif some of the leading theories are true.A great book. The author obtained his PHD under Dtephen Hawking and worked with Hawking on black holes and the origin of the universe. But imaginary time still confises me. I dont grasp that concept. Maybe the next explination will work."
127,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4196-bobby,5,"A wonderful, basic introduction to topics like gravity, quantum theory, Einstein's theories, and the like. This book is likely too superficial for physics majors, but I think it's an excellent first book for most others. I recommend starting with this one, before moving on to Brian Greene, Stephen Hawking, etc. The writing style is breezy, conversational style, and as the author states in the intro, the only equation in the whole book is E=mc2. I do think the book would have benefited from some illustrations but this is a minor issue."
128,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467608-serro,2,"Mr Galfard brings nothing new to the table. Maybe just the approach of a journey through space as a mind to explore general relativity and as a mini-you to explore the quantum world, which honestly at times was rather silly.Yet as a whole it is a good introduction to the world of the very big and the very small projected at first timers of these realms. I didn't really test the sense of humour in it and I think that should Mr Galfard have an aunt she wouldn't be too pleased either, especially if she likes vases. Those who start reading this book will know what I mean."
129,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93676995-ashleigh-trickett,4,"This book is beautifully written, surprisingly poetic in parts, with an unexpected vein of humour threaded throughout! The opening chapters capture your imagination and attention, followed by many moments of drama and theatrics. This series of gedanken experiments are fun, interesting and more importantly, accessible. Galfard lives up to his ambition/promise in chapter 1 -he leaves no one behind."
130,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74056738-corry-sweet,5,"I like this book because the author doesn't just throw maths down your throat.

For anyone that is bored of being stuck on Earth during lockdown, I highly recommend this."

Can't lie, I found this book hard work.Whilst all the concepts are there, and the explanations are throughly dealt with, I agree with reviews which cite them as over simplified. Not that this isn't useful to a none scientist like me, just that it is repetitive and ends up a little annoying."
141,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5861984-judyta-szaci-o,3,"I quite enjoyed my time with this book even though the tone of its narrative did not always agree with me. I've seen that other people called it 'condescending' and 'patronising' in their reviews. I wouldn't go as far. I didn't feel patronised while reading it. I just felt I wasn't the target audience, that's all. The book is clearly thought to address the beginners while I - ignorant as I am in this field - can't call myself a beginner, having devoured several books by other authors on the same matters.In places, Galfard made some issues easier for me to visualise. In other instances, he confused me about the things I though I had already grasped. Overall, sadly, I don't think I've learnt anything new. However, with Michio Kaku's Parallel Worlds: A Journey through Creation, Higher Dimensions, and the Future of the Cosmos getting more and more dated with every passing year, Galfard's book may be the one I'd recommend to those who want to start on a journey through modern physics."
142,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,4,"I'm a bit uncertain on how to rate, or even review, this book. On the one hand, the explanations of physics, quantum mechanics, general relativity, astrophysics, cosmology, gravity, etc are pretty good and, most importantly, understandable without requiring a physics degree.* On the other hand, the imaginary adventurous travels (i.e. thought experiments) to such things as the inside of atoms and the cosmos in general just didn't really work for me, though I did eventually get used to it. Maybe this sort of thing works better for people who have pictures and movies pop up in their heads when they read books, but that simply isn't me. Otherwise, an interesting introductiory book that makes mind-bending subjects not so complicated, while managing to be entertaining at the same time.~~~~*Except String Theory.

It takes such huge concepts and explains them in ways that you can really understand, but never in a manner that is condescending or overly simplistic. I read about things that I already found interesting (black holes, the beginning of the universe, cosmological concepts, parallel universe theories) and managed to understand them in more depth. And I also read about things that I haven’t looked into in that much depth, and found them absolutely fascinating – for instance, quantum and particle physics which I never, ever managed to grasp at school. The author’s writing is so evocative and engaging too. Sometimes, with science books, the concepts are totally intriguing and that is what makes the book so interesting to read, but in this one, it was the combination of his style and the subject. It was so warm and descriptive, breaking down these complex topics and allowing you to visualise them in a succession of thought experiments – travelling through the universe to the surface of last scattering, going beyond the event horizons of black holes, and down to the very, very small with quantum fields. The author effortlessly and seamlessly goes between the known and the unknown and the very, very and the very, very tiny and summarises everything so beautifully. I knew it was going to be good from the first chapter with the gorgeous and chilling description of the death of the sun, placing the reader in the midst of this massive cosmic event. The chapters and parts were set out so well and clearly, breaking it down into nice, digestible chunks. I highly, highly recommend this book to anyone just getting into these scientific concepts or wanting to know about them in more depth. I overshot with diving straight into Brian Cox’s Universal (although I am just listening to the audiobook of his The Planets and it is wonderful), but this was exactly the kind of book I was looking for. And it was great to read the Epilogue with all the hopes for the future of science and understanding the universe. Science is such a bedrock of our world and incredibly important, especially in these times of deniers. The ending on the note of the LIGO and VIRGO gravitational wave detectors was a great point to conclude on, drawing together all the knowledge thus far and showing how it has built upon itself. This was only three years before the very first picture of the M-87 black hole was taken, also, so it is exciting to think what is coming.

Having different people explain the same things in different ways really helps to grasp these complicsted and difficult concepts. Galfard takes you on thought experiment after thought experiment to help you understand thebuniverse, both the large and the small. You imagine being in black hole and you imagine riding electomagnetic waves. This is how phsics has mainly progressed since Einstein and Galfard lets you pretend you are the physicist. He even leads you to an answer and then commends your for figuring it out, even discovering it. The book felt like being part of The Magic School Bus. This book also covers some more recent discoveries such as the detection of gravitational waves when two black holes collided. Lastly, he takes you where physics isnheaded. He takes you on though experiments to what things are likenif some of the leading theories are true.A great book. The author obtained his PHD under Dtephen Hawking and worked with Hawking on black holes and the origin of the universe. But imaginary time still confises me. I dont grasp that concept. Maybe the next explination will work."
157,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4196-bobby,5,"A wonderful, basic introduction to topics like gravity, quantum theory, Einstein's theories, and the like. This book is likely too superficial for physics majors, but I think it's an excellent first book for most others. I recommend starting with this one, before moving on to Brian Greene, Stephen Hawking, etc. The writing style is breezy, conversational style, and as the author states in the intro, the only equation in the whole book is E=mc2. I do think the book would have benefited from some illustrations but this is a minor issue."
158,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467608-serro,2,"Mr Galfard brings nothing new to the table. Maybe just the approach of a journey through space as a mind to explore general relativity and as a mini-you to explore the quantum world, which honestly at times was rather silly.Yet as a whole it is a good introduction to the world of the very big and the very small projected at first timers of these realms. I didn't really test the sense of humour in it and I think that should Mr Galfard have an aunt she wouldn't be too pleased either, especially if she likes vases. Those who start reading this book will know what I mean."
159,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93676995-ashleigh-trickett,4,"This book is beautifully written, surprisingly poetic in parts, with an unexpected vein of humour threaded throughout! The opening chapters capture your imagination and attention, followed by many moments of drama and theatrics. This series of gedanken experiments are fun, interesting and more importantly, accessible. Galfard lives up to his ambition/promise in chapter 1 -he leaves no one behind."
160,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74056738-corry-sweet,5,"I like this book because the author doesn't just throw maths down your throat.

Can't lie, I found this book hard work.Whilst all the concepts are there, and the explanations are throughly dealt with, I agree with reviews which cite them as over simplified. Not that this isn't useful to a none scientist like me, just that it is repetitive and ends up a little annoying."
171,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5861984-judyta-szaci-o,3,"I quite enjoyed my time with this book even though the tone of its narrative did not always agree with me. I've seen that other people called it 'condescending' and 'patronising' in their reviews. I wouldn't go as far. I didn't feel patronised while reading it. I just felt I wasn't the target audience, that's all. The book is clearly thought to address the beginners while I - ignorant as I am in this field - can't call myself a beginner, having devoured several books by other authors on the same matters.In places, Galfard made some issues easier for me to visualise. In other instances, he confused me about the things I though I had already grasped. Overall, sadly, I don't think I've learnt anything new. However, with Michio Kaku's Parallel Worlds: A Journey through Creation, Higher Dimensions, and the Future of the Cosmos getting more and more dated with every passing year, Galfard's book may be the one I'd recommend to those who want to start on a journey through modern physics."
172,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,4,"I'm a bit uncertain on how to rate, or even review, this book. On the one hand, the explanations of physics, quantum mechanics, general relativity, astrophysics, cosmology, gravity, etc are pretty good and, most importantly, understandable without requiring a physics degree.* On the other hand, the imaginary adventurous travels (i.e. thought experiments) to such things as the inside of atoms and the cosmos in general just didn't really work for me, though I did eventually get used to it. Maybe this sort of thing works better for people who have pictures and movies pop up in their heads when they read books, but that simply isn't me. Otherwise, an interesting introductiory book that makes mind-bending subjects not so complicated, while managing to be entertaining at the same time.~~~~*Except String Theory.

I absolutely loved this book, this explained the recent developments in physics and clearly substantiates the facts of physics really well.Protons are made up of quarks while these are held together by a strong force which is generated by gluons. The further quarks are apart the more ferocious the strong force becomes. The carriers of the strongest force we know, the strong nuclear force, which keeps quarks confined, only allowing them to be free when they are holding close to one another, thus guaranteeing that the matter we are made of does not split apart. Quarks and gluons.These make up 99.97 % of our body mass. Two gluons bind to make a quark duet or a meson, which hold sthe nucleus together with the strong nuclear force. The nucleus is responsible for the lose of mass in the thermonuclear fusion reaction of the sun converts mass to energy.Particles that no one looks at do travel through all possible paths that space-time can offer. On it's way it splits into an infinite number of ghost images, or a wave, rippling in all directions through space-time. ""The very act of probing reality changes it's nature."" ""Just like all the thoughts you may or may not have on a given subject suddenly becomes reduced to one who hears you speak it out loud.""It goes into how John Dirac, created the idea of the quantum field and discovered antimatter by consequence. He expounds with an analogy, if an electron appeared out of nowhere this would mean that there has to be some sort of dormant energy according to E=mc^2. This anti-electron was discovered an called a positron, and there are other anti-particles that are related to other elementary particles (quarks, gluons, photons etc.).The quest to understand reality is a personal one, when all is said and done, and neither the supercomputer nor I should impose our views upon you. It's your right to have ideas of your own.-GalfordThis books starts out going from the absolute in physics to dubious, providing a firm foundation to the exploration of the mysteries of the universe which is later in the book.One can argue there are three kinds of mysteries in physics. The first ones are inherent to the theories themselves; they are theoretical. The second ones are rooted in observations and experiments. These are the ones that usually, but not always, drive research. The third type of mystery arises when no one understands anything anymore. - GalfordSome believe that gravity is a force of particles called gravitons, even though despite gravitons having no known reason to interact with one another were they to exist and being elementary they should be able to appear everywhere, this leading to a collapse in pretty much everywhere from gravity. Scientists believe that gravitons do exist, at least to as a part of the bigger theory that everybody is looking for.Quantum Superposition is how a particle when undetected is in all possible places at once, kind of like a wave. When detected this particle stops, and this is called quantum wave collapse. Heisenberg Uncertainty principle is you can never know where the particle is (position) or it's velocity. The Schrodinger's cat experiment demonstrates quantum superposition macroscopically, by placing a cat in a box that you cannot see. Then place a radioactive element in it (1/2 of radioactive decay), then place an vial of poison in the box and smash it. Since you cannot see the cat this means it is both dead and alive at the same time. Hugh Everett III said because of this quantum superposition, everything even our universe should be thought of as a quantum wave with parallel universes around us existing out of all the possibilities that could have been in our own universe.Adding the mass of every star, dust cloud, and everything else of the Milky Way. There is not enough matter to keep any star from shooting away, given the velocity. There should be about five times more matter than what you can see, Jan Oort discovered this and called it Dark Matter. Hubble's Law is when galaxies twice as far away from each other moves away twice as fast. This lead to the discovery of an anti-gravitational force, repelling matter and energy instead of attracting them. This is called Dark Energy and to account for its observed effects there must be lots of it (3 times more than dark matter). This leaves Dark Energy (72%), Dark Matter (23%), and the matter we know including light (4.6%). Singularities are when there are too much mass, or energy, in too small a volume, leading to the collapse of space-time. This is supposedly how black holes start and how our universe and space time was formed. The Inflationary period, the was a field filling the universe with a repulsive anti-gravity force. That field was so powerful that it triggered a period of extreme expansion, an extreme expansion that blew apart different parts of the early universe at a rate much faster that the speed of light, allowing for places that today seem to far apart to have ever been in touch to actually have been in the past. (This is no contradiction to limit for speed of light, because space-time itself expanded.) This also explains how the universe is isotropic, not including aniotropies (which are tiny temperature differences). This expansion released an extraordinary amt of energy, and this is what is thought to be the catalyst of the Big Bang. The No boundary proposal by hawking-hartle proposed that the universe has no beginning as we would understand it, they mathematically proved this.From the Earth we have a foreseeable radius of 13.8 billion years, the Planck's scale is the limit to what we can probe both in the very small and the very big. Theoretically, there exists a quantum string it is the most fundamental elements of our universe, it also is ten dimensional, not within the dimensions that we can perceive. However, Closed Strings, some call these gravitrons and branes which can propagate through spacetime. The Anthropic priniciple states that out of the unfathomably man possible forms extra dimensions could take, only the ones compatible with the existence of humans need be taken into account for us to be here, or we wouldn't be around to talk about them. Gedanken experiments are experiments of pure thought. In September 2015, was the telltale signal of two black holes merging, we had no idea that black holes could merge with each other, let alone merge. Thanks to this signal it confirms that what we think of black holes corresponds with real ones."

I appreciated the list of topics covered by all chapters.However, I think the author should not be afraid and underestimate readers, by assuming that ""popularization"" means being limited both in vocabulary and in long-term passed knowledge. Carl Sagan, among others, proved that science can be accessible to all without sacrificing scientific (or literary, for that matter) language and information, becoming a best-seller in a decade where educational level was for sure one step behind today's. So, if the goal was to give the reader a sense of satisfaction and achievement having grasped some main concepts without much effort, then it's a success. But the wonderful reality behind science requires waking up souls and curious spirits, instead of only giving a color-by-numbers-type guide to our Universe."

I absolutely loved this book, this explained the recent developments in physics and clearly substantiates the facts of physics really well.Protons are made up of quarks while these are held together by a strong force which is generated by gluons. The further quarks are apart the more ferocious the strong force becomes. The carriers of the strongest force we know, the strong nuclear force, which keeps quarks confined, only allowing them to be free when they are holding close to one another, thus guaranteeing that the matter we are made of does not split apart. Quarks and gluons.These make up 99.97 % of our body mass. Two gluons bind to make a quark duet or a meson, which hold sthe nucleus together with the strong nuclear force. The nucleus is responsible for the lose of mass in the thermonuclear fusion reaction of the sun converts mass to energy.Particles that no one looks at do travel through all possible paths that space-time can offer. On it's way it splits into an infinite number of ghost images, or a wave, rippling in all directions through space-time. ""The very act of probing reality changes it's nature."" ""Just like all the thoughts you may or may not have on a given subject suddenly becomes reduced to one who hears you speak it out loud.""It goes into how John Dirac, created the idea of the quantum field and discovered antimatter by consequence. He expounds with an analogy, if an electron appeared out of nowhere this would mean that there has to be some sort of dormant energy according to E=mc^2. This anti-electron was discovered an called a positron, and there are other anti-particles that are related to other elementary particles (quarks, gluons, photons etc.).The quest to understand reality is a personal one, when all is said and done, and neither the supercomputer nor I should impose our views upon you. It's your right to have ideas of your own.-GalfordThis books starts out going from the absolute in physics to dubious, providing a firm foundation to the exploration of the mysteries of the universe which is later in the book.One can argue there are three kinds of mysteries in physics. The first ones are inherent to the theories themselves; they are theoretical. The second ones are rooted in observations and experiments. These are the ones that usually, but not always, drive research. The third type of mystery arises when no one understands anything anymore. - GalfordSome believe that gravity is a force of particles called gravitons, even though despite gravitons having no known reason to interact with one another were they to exist and being elementary they should be able to appear everywhere, this leading to a collapse in pretty much everywhere from gravity. Scientists believe that gravitons do exist, at least to as a part of the bigger theory that everybody is looking for.Quantum Superposition is how a particle when undetected is in all possible places at once, kind of like a wave. When detected this particle stops, and this is called quantum wave collapse. Heisenberg Uncertainty principle is you can never know where the particle is (position) or it's velocity. The Schrodinger's cat experiment demonstrates quantum superposition macroscopically, by placing a cat in a box that you cannot see. Then place a radioactive element in it (1/2 of radioactive decay), then place an vial of poison in the box and smash it. Since you cannot see the cat this means it is both dead and alive at the same time. Hugh Everett III said because of this quantum superposition, everything even our universe should be thought of as a quantum wave with parallel universes around us existing out of all the possibilities that could have been in our own universe.Adding the mass of every star, dust cloud, and everything else of the Milky Way. There is not enough matter to keep any star from shooting away, given the velocity. There should be about five times more matter than what you can see, Jan Oort discovered this and called it Dark Matter. Hubble's Law is when galaxies twice as far away from each other moves away twice as fast. This lead to the discovery of an anti-gravitational force, repelling matter and energy instead of attracting them. This is called Dark Energy and to account for its observed effects there must be lots of it (3 times more than dark matter). This leaves Dark Energy (72%), Dark Matter (23%), and the matter we know including light (4.6%). Singularities are when there are too much mass, or energy, in too small a volume, leading to the collapse of space-time. This is supposedly how black holes start and how our universe and space time was formed. The Inflationary period, the was a field filling the universe with a repulsive anti-gravity force. That field was so powerful that it triggered a period of extreme expansion, an extreme expansion that blew apart different parts of the early universe at a rate much faster that the speed of light, allowing for places that today seem to far apart to have ever been in touch to actually have been in the past. (This is no contradiction to limit for speed of light, because space-time itself expanded.) This also explains how the universe is isotropic, not including aniotropies (which are tiny temperature differences). This expansion released an extraordinary amt of energy, and this is what is thought to be the catalyst of the Big Bang. The No boundary proposal by hawking-hartle proposed that the universe has no beginning as we would understand it, they mathematically proved this.From the Earth we have a foreseeable radius of 13.8 billion years, the Planck's scale is the limit to what we can probe both in the very small and the very big. Theoretically, there exists a quantum string it is the most fundamental elements of our universe, it also is ten dimensional, not within the dimensions that we can perceive. However, Closed Strings, some call these gravitrons and branes which can propagate through spacetime. The Anthropic priniciple states that out of the unfathomably man possible forms extra dimensions could take, only the ones compatible with the existence of humans need be taken into account for us to be here, or we wouldn't be around to talk about them. Gedanken experiments are experiments of pure thought. In September 2015, was the telltale signal of two black holes merging, we had no idea that black holes could merge with each other, let alone merge. Thanks to this signal it confirms that what we think of black holes corresponds with real ones."

I appreciated the list of topics covered by all chapters.However, I think the author should not be afraid and underestimate readers, by assuming that ""popularization"" means being limited both in vocabulary and in long-term passed knowledge. Carl Sagan, among others, proved that science can be accessible to all without sacrificing scientific (or literary, for that matter) language and information, becoming a best-seller in a decade where educational level was for sure one step behind today's. So, if the goal was to give the reader a sense of satisfaction and achievement having grasped some main concepts without much effort, then it's a success. But the wonderful reality behind science requires waking up souls and curious spirits, instead of only giving a color-by-numbers-type guide to our Universe."
207,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49160575-kris,2,"I wanted to like this book, but I was annoyed by the imagined visualizations. I had already read Brian Greene’s Fabric of the Cosmos which I found to be an engaging and straightforward description of physics. Because he came after that text, Galford’s just didn’t measure up to my expectations.If you have never read a general account of physics, this work will certainly help you understand this fascinating subject."
208,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59872036-milo,5,the book was really intresting and fun to read but it was very complicated and took a while to get through
209,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46101008-aidan,2,I only read about 50% of this book. I gave up because it's been weirdly written. This is a children's science book.

211,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39453356-katie,5,"I loved every single word of this, beginning to end. This is exactly the space/science/physics book I was looking for. It takes such huge concepts and explains them in ways that you can really understand, but never in a manner that is condescending or overly simplistic. I read about things that I already found interesting (black holes, the beginning of the universe, cosmological concepts, parallel universe theories) and managed to understand them in more depth. And I also read about things that I haven’t looked into in that much depth, and found them absolutely fascinating – for instance, quantum and particle physics which I never, ever managed to grasp at school. The author’s writing is so evocative and engaging too. Sometimes, with science books, the concepts are totally intriguing and that is what makes the book so interesting to read, but in this one, it was the combination of his style and the subject. It was so warm and descriptive, breaking down these complex topics and allowing you to visualise them in a succession of thought experiments – travelling through the universe to the surface of last scattering, going beyond the event horizons of black holes, and down to the very, very small with quantum fields. The author effortlessly and seamlessly goes between the known and the unknown and the very, very and the very, very tiny and summarises everything so beautifully. I knew it was going to be good from the first chapter with the gorgeous and chilling description of the death of the sun, placing the reader in the midst of this massive cosmic event. The chapters and parts were set out so well and clearly, breaking it down into nice, digestible chunks. I highly, highly recommend this book to anyone just getting into these scientific concepts or wanting to know about them in more depth. I overshot with diving straight into Brian Cox’s Universal (although I am just listening to the audiobook of his The Planets and it is wonderful), but this was exactly the kind of book I was looking for. And it was great to read the Epilogue with all the hopes for the future of science and understanding the universe. Science is such a bedrock of our world and incredibly important, especially in these times of deniers. The ending on the note of the LIGO and VIRGO gravitational wave detectors was a great point to conclude on, drawing together all the knowledge thus far and showing how it has built upon itself. This was only three years before the very first picture of the M-87 black hole was taken, also, so it is exciting to think what is coming. This was absolutely my favourite non-fiction science book so far! Thank you for the wonderful journey, Christophe Galfard!"
212,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3073125-jon-ure-a,5,"At first, I thought I wouldn't like it much. The information was framed in a sort of narrative which initially took too much space. Although it did distract at times, astronomy, and many of the natural forces, are very visual and easier to understand that way. Still, I probably could have done without most/all of the references to the ""great-auntie"" character.I thought this book did an exceptional job making you understand why scientists thought there were holes in the theories of that time and what would fill them. It clarified aspects of quantum field theory that were muddled for me, such as how did the particles pop up to life and which were related to which forces. It earned extra points for showing how the universe would look when travelling at near light speed, and the temporal distortion related to general relativity.It reminded me that there's so much to find out yet. Dark matter and energy are out there according to the current theories, but they might be imaginary placeholders for whole aspects of reality we don't understand. General relativity and quantum field theory don't speak to each other, meaning there's likely an underlying theory that would connect both but that scientists can barely hypothesize about. Although black holes probably hold the key, no information seems to survive falling in. There was a bit about string theory at the end; given that it hasn't produced any proof, I became disillusioned about it years ago.Always nice to read about quantum mechanics, although I wish it could have gone deeper into its weirdness: nonlocality and entanglement, the observer effect, quantum tunnelling and the wave-particle duality, for example, but there are plenty of books focusing on that particular subject out there.In general, a fantastic book lacking in formulas (thankfully, because I'm abysmal in math) that shows how science can explain the universe in 2017 and what remains to be understood."
213,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62639477-taylor-woodson,3,"For me this book was extremely interesting as long as I was reading about General and Special Relativity. Gravity is amazing and what causes gravity is even more phenomenal. As long as this was the topic then I was loving this book. But as soon as the book switches over to quantum field theory(about halfway through the book) I got lost and confused haha. I understand this isn’t the authors fault, it’s just that quantum physics is THAT hard to understand as a concept. Quarks, Gluons, Positrons, the disappearing of particles and reappearing again, the wall of last scattering, string theory, plank dimensions...it’s all very hard to mentally picture and that makes it hard to grasp. A nod to the author though for giving it his best to make such difficult concepts easy(or easier) to read."
214,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82471363-emmanouil,5,"Very interesting book. It touches on many of the prevalent theories and ideas behind our understanding of the universe, its past, present, and future. As such, it risked being overly complex and hard to follow, something that the authirs works around perfectly. His anecdotes and presentation of each topic are simple so that people like myself without a strong background in physis can understand most of it fairly easily(some concepts are inherently harder to grasp), while also being educational enough to give one a good introduction to many extremely interesting ideas.A MUST read for anyone interested in learning a few things about our universe but is not armed with the proper theoretical background."
215,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35045797-iris-alvino,5,Well that was epic. The overall tone of the book was witty and good humored. You can tell the author loves the subject of the book and is excited to share his findings and those before him. I did learn a lot and am amazed by the brilliant minds that have helped us to understand the universe as we can in the now. It’s amazing how much we know that we didn’t only 100 years ago. I’m excited to see what our new eye in the sky can detect and hope we get proof of multiverses and wormholes and even life on other planets and within other universes. Man that would be amazing to have proven in my lifetime. I definitely will keep my ear out for everything that is soon to be discovered.

Having different people explain the same things in different ways really helps to grasp these complicsted and difficult concepts. Galfard takes you on thought experiment after thought experiment to help you understand thebuniverse, both the large and the small. You imagine being in black hole and you imagine riding electomagnetic waves. This is how phsics has mainly progressed since Einstein and Galfard lets you pretend you are the physicist. He even leads you to an answer and then commends your for figuring it out, even discovering it. The book felt like being part of The Magic School Bus. This book also covers some more recent discoveries such as the detection of gravitational waves when two black holes collided. Lastly, he takes you where physics isnheaded. He takes you on though experiments to what things are likenif some of the leading theories are true.A great book.

These are the ones that usually, but not always, drive research. The third type of mystery arises when no one understands anything anymore. - GalfordSome believe that gravity is a force of particles called gravitons, even though despite gravitons having no known reason to interact with one another were they to exist and being elementary they should be able to appear everywhere, this leading to a collapse in pretty much everywhere from gravity. Scientists believe that gravitons do exist, at least to as a part of the bigger theory that everybody is looking for.Quantum Superposition is how a particle when undetected is in all possible places at once, kind of like a wave. When detected this particle stops, and this is called quantum wave collapse. Heisenberg Uncertainty principle is you can never know where the particle is (position) or it's velocity.

Then place a radioactive element in it (1/2 of radioactive decay), then place an vial of poison in the box and smash it.

This lead to the discovery of an anti-gravitational force, repelling matter and energy instead of attracting them. This is called Dark Energy and to account for its observed effects there must be lots of it (3 times more than dark matter). This leaves Dark Energy (72%), Dark Matter (23%), and the matter we know including light (4.6%).

This is supposedly how black holes start and how our universe and space time was formed. The Inflationary period, the was a field filling the universe with a repulsive anti-gravity force. That field was so powerful that it triggered a period of extreme expansion, an extreme expansion that blew apart different parts of the early universe at a rate much faster that the speed of light, allowing for places that today seem to far apart to have ever been in touch to actually have been in the past. (This is no contradiction to limit for speed of light, because space-time itself expanded.)

240,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,2,The author was doing something with words and letters but wasn't exactly writing
241,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39453356-katie,5,"I loved every single word of this, beginning to end. This is exactly the space/science/physics book I was looking for. It takes such huge concepts and explains them in ways that you can really understand, but never in a manner that is condescending or overly simplistic. I read about things that I already found interesting (black holes, the beginning of the universe, cosmological concepts, parallel universe theories) and managed to understand them in more depth. And I also read about things that I haven’t looked into in that much depth, and found them absolutely fascinating – for instance, quantum and particle physics which I never, ever managed to grasp at school. The author’s writing is so evocative and engaging too. Sometimes, with science books, the concepts are totally intriguing and that is what makes the book so interesting to read, but in this one, it was the combination of his style and the subject. It was so warm and descriptive, breaking down these complex topics and allowing you to visualise them in a succession of thought experiments – travelling through the universe to the surface of last scattering, going beyond the event horizons of black holes, and down to the very, very small with quantum fields. The author effortlessly and seamlessly goes between the known and the unknown and the very, very and the very, very tiny and summarises everything so beautifully. I knew it was going to be good from the first chapter with the gorgeous and chilling description of the death of the sun, placing the reader in the midst of this massive cosmic event. The chapters and parts were set out so well and clearly, breaking it down into nice, digestible chunks. I highly, highly recommend this book to anyone just getting into these scientific concepts or wanting to know about them in more depth. I overshot with diving straight into Brian Cox’s Universal (although I am just listening to the audiobook of his The Planets and it is wonderful), but this was exactly the kind of book I was looking for. And it was great to read the Epilogue with all the hopes for the future of science and understanding the universe. Science is such a bedrock of our world and incredibly important, especially in these times of deniers. The ending on the note of the LIGO and VIRGO gravitational wave detectors was a great point to conclude on, drawing together all the knowledge thus far and showing how it has built upon itself. This was only three years before the very first picture of the M-87 black hole was taken, also, so it is exciting to think what is coming. This was absolutely my favourite non-fiction science book so far! Thank you for the wonderful journey, Christophe Galfard!"
242,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3073125-jon-ure-a,5,"At first, I thought I wouldn't like it much. The information was framed in a sort of narrative which initially took too much space. Although it did distract at times, astronomy, and many of the natural forces, are very visual and easier to understand that way. Still, I probably could have done without most/all of the references to the ""great-auntie"" character.I thought this book did an exceptional job making you understand why scientists thought there were holes in the theories of that time and what would fill them. It clarified aspects of quantum field theory that were muddled for me, such as how did the particles pop up to life and which were related to which forces. It earned extra points for showing how the universe would look when travelling at near light speed, and the temporal distortion related to general relativity.It reminded me that there's so much to find out yet. Dark matter and energy are out there according to the current theories, but they might be imaginary placeholders for whole aspects of reality we don't understand. General relativity and quantum field theory don't speak to each other, meaning there's likely an underlying theory that would connect both but that scientists can barely hypothesize about. Although black holes probably hold the key, no information seems to survive falling in. There was a bit about string theory at the end; given that it hasn't produced any proof, I became disillusioned about it years ago.Always nice to read about quantum mechanics, although I wish it could have gone deeper into its weirdness: nonlocality and entanglement, the observer effect, quantum tunnelling and the wave-particle duality, for example, but there are plenty of books focusing on that particular subject out there.In general, a fantastic book lacking in formulas (thankfully, because I'm abysmal in math) that shows how science can explain the universe in 2017 and what remains to be understood."
243,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62639477-taylor-woodson,3,"For me this book was extremely interesting as long as I was reading about General and Special Relativity. Gravity is amazing and what causes gravity is even more phenomenal. As long as this was the topic then I was loving this book. But as soon as the book switches over to quantum field theory(about halfway through the book) I got lost and confused haha. I understand this isn’t the authors fault, it’s just that quantum physics is THAT hard to understand as a concept. Quarks, Gluons, Positrons, the disappearing of particles and reappearing again, the wall of last scattering, string theory, plank dimensions...it’s all very hard to mentally picture and that makes it hard to grasp. A nod to the author though for giving it his best to make such difficult concepts easy(or easier) to read."
244,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82471363-emmanouil,5,"Very interesting book. It touches on many of the prevalent theories and ideas behind our understanding of the universe, its past, present, and future. As such, it risked being overly complex and hard to follow, something that the authirs works around perfectly. His anecdotes and presentation of each topic are simple so that people like myself without a strong background in physis can understand most of it fairly easily(some concepts are inherently harder to grasp), while also being educational enough to give one a good introduction to many extremely interesting ideas.A MUST read for anyone interested in learning a few things about our universe but is not armed with the proper theoretical background."
245,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35045797-iris-alvino,5,Well that was epic. The overall tone of the book was witty and good humored. You can tell the author loves the subject of the book and is excited to share his findings and those before him. I did learn a lot and am amazed by the brilliant minds that have helped us to understand the universe as we can in the now. It’s amazing how much we know that we didn’t only 100 years ago. I’m excited to see what our new eye in the sky can detect and hope we get proof of multiverses and wormholes and even life on other planets and within other universes. Man that would be amazing to have proven in my lifetime. I definitely will keep my ear out for everything that is soon to be discovered. 
246,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25999818-jason-oliver,5,"I love reading about physics and this book is one of the best Ive read. Having different people explain the same things in different ways really helps to grasp these complicsted and difficult concepts. Galfard takes you on thought experiment after thought experiment to help you understand thebuniverse, both the large and the small. You imagine being in black hole and you imagine riding electomagnetic waves. This is how phsics has mainly progressed since Einstein and Galfard lets you pretend you are the physicist. He even leads you to an answer and then commends your for figuring it out, even discovering it. The book felt like being part of The Magic School Bus. This book also covers some more recent discoveries such as the detection of gravitational waves when two black holes collided. Lastly, he takes you where physics isnheaded. He takes you on though experiments to what things are likenif some of the leading theories are true.A great book. The author obtained his PHD under Dtephen Hawking and worked with Hawking on black holes and the origin of the universe. But imaginary time still confises me. I dont grasp that concept. Maybe the next explination will work."
247,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4196-bobby,5,"A wonderful, basic introduction to topics like gravity, quantum theory, Einstein's theories, and the like. This book is likely too superficial for physics majors, but I think it's an excellent first book for most others. I recommend starting with this one, before moving on to Brian Greene, Stephen Hawking, etc. The writing style is breezy, conversational style, and as the author states in the intro, the only equation in the whole book is E=mc2. I do think the book would have benefited from some illustrations but this is a minor issue."
248,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467608-serro,2,"Mr Galfard brings nothing new to the table. Maybe just the approach of a journey through space as a mind to explore general relativity and as a mini-you to explore the quantum world, which honestly at times was rather silly.Yet as a whole it is a good introduction to the world of the very big and the very small projected at first timers of these realms. I didn't really test the sense of humour in it and I think that should Mr Galfard have an aunt she wouldn't be too pleased either, especially if she likes vases. Those who start reading this book will know what I mean."
249,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93676995-ashleigh-trickett,4,"This book is beautifully written, surprisingly poetic in parts, with an unexpected vein of humour threaded throughout! The opening chapters capture your imagination and attention, followed by many moments of drama and theatrics. This series of gedanken experiments are fun, interesting and more importantly, accessible. Galfard lives up to his ambition/promise in chapter 1 -he leaves no one behind."
250,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74056738-corry-sweet,5,"I like this book because the author doesn't just throw maths down your throat. The only equation in the entire book is Einstein's E=mc2 so you don't need a first class in physics from Cambridge to understand most of it. For anyone that is bored of being stuck on Earth during lockdown, I highly recommend this."

Can't lie, I found this book hard work.Whilst all the concepts are there, and the explanations are throughly dealt with, I agree with reviews which cite them as over simplified. Not that this isn't useful to a none scientist like me, just that it is repetitive and ends up a little annoying."
261,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5861984-judyta-szaci-o,3,"I quite enjoyed my time with this book even though the tone of its narrative did not always agree with me. I've seen that other people called it 'condescending' and 'patronising' in their reviews. I wouldn't go as far. I didn't feel patronised while reading it. I just felt I wasn't the target audience, that's all. The book is clearly thought to address the beginners while I - ignorant as I am in this field - can't call myself a beginner, having devoured several books by other authors on the same matters.In places, Galfard made some issues easier for me to visualise. In other instances, he confused me about the things I though I had already grasped. Overall, sadly, I don't think I've learnt anything new. However, with Michio Kaku's Parallel Worlds: A Journey through Creation, Higher Dimensions, and the Future of the Cosmos getting more and more dated with every passing year, Galfard's book may be the one I'd recommend to those who want to start on a journey through modern physics."
262,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,4,"I'm a bit uncertain on how to rate, or even review, this book. On the one hand, the explanations of physics, quantum mechanics, general relativity, astrophysics, cosmology, gravity, etc are pretty good and, most importantly, understandable without requiring a physics degree.* On the other hand, the imaginary adventurous travels (i.e. thought experiments) to such things as the inside of atoms and the cosmos in general just didn't really work for me, though I did eventually get used to it. Maybe this sort of thing works better for people who have pictures and movies pop up in their heads when they read books, but that simply isn't me. Otherwise, an interesting introductiory book that makes mind-bending subjects not so complicated, while managing to be entertaining at the same time.~~~~*Except String Theory. I think you need to have ingested a substantial quantity of magic mushrooms for that to make any sense."

271,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39453356-katie,5,"I loved every single word of this, beginning to end. This is exactly the space/science/physics book I was looking for. It takes such huge concepts and explains them in ways that you can really understand, but never in a manner that is condescending or overly simplistic. I read about things that I already found interesting (black holes, the beginning of the universe, cosmological concepts, parallel universe theories) and managed to understand them in more depth. And I also read about things that I haven’t looked into in that much depth, and found them absolutely fascinating – for instance, quantum and particle physics which I never, ever managed to grasp at school. The author’s writing is so evocative and engaging too. Sometimes, with science books, the concepts are totally intriguing and that is what makes the book so interesting to read, but in this one, it was the combination of his style and the subject. It was so warm and descriptive, breaking down these complex topics and allowing you to visualise them in a succession of thought experiments – travelling through the universe to the surface of last scattering, going beyond the event horizons of black holes, and down to the very, very small with quantum fields. The author effortlessly and seamlessly goes between the known and the unknown and the very, very and the very, very tiny and summarises everything so beautifully. I knew it was going to be good from the first chapter with the gorgeous and chilling description of the death of the sun, placing the reader in the midst of this massive cosmic event. The chapters and parts were set out so well and clearly, breaking it down into nice, digestible chunks. I highly, highly recommend this book to anyone just getting into these scientific concepts or wanting to know about them in more depth. I overshot with diving straight into Brian Cox’s Universal (although I am just listening to the audiobook of his The Planets and it is wonderful), but this was exactly the kind of book I was looking for. And it was great to read the Epilogue with all the hopes for the future of science and understanding the universe. Science is such a bedrock of our world and incredibly important, especially in these times of deniers. The ending on the note of the LIGO and VIRGO gravitational wave detectors was a great point to conclude on, drawing together all the knowledge thus far and showing how it has built upon itself. This was only three years before the very first picture of the M-87 black hole was taken, also, so it is exciting to think what is coming. This was absolutely my favourite non-fiction science book so far! Thank you for the wonderful journey, Christophe Galfard!"
272,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3073125-jon-ure-a,5,"At first, I thought I wouldn't like it much. The information was framed in a sort of narrative which initially took too much space. Although it did distract at times, astronomy, and many of the natural forces, are very visual and easier to understand that way. Still, I probably could have done without most/all of the references to the ""great-auntie"" character.I thought this book did an exceptional job making you understand why scientists thought there were holes in the theories of that time and what would fill them. It clarified aspects of quantum field theory that were muddled for me, such as how did the particles pop up to life and which were related to which forces. It earned extra points for showing how the universe would look when travelling at near light speed, and the temporal distortion related to general relativity.It reminded me that there's so much to find out yet. Dark matter and energy are out there according to the current theories, but they might be imaginary placeholders for whole aspects of reality we don't understand. General relativity and quantum field theory don't speak to each other, meaning there's likely an underlying theory that would connect both but that scientists can barely hypothesize about. Although black holes probably hold the key, no information seems to survive falling in. There was a bit about string theory at the end; given that it hasn't produced any proof, I became disillusioned about it years ago.Always nice to read about quantum mechanics, although I wish it could have gone deeper into its weirdness: nonlocality and entanglement, the observer effect, quantum tunnelling and the wave-particle duality, for example, but there are plenty of books focusing on that particular subject out there.In general, a fantastic book lacking in formulas (thankfully, because I'm abysmal in math) that shows how science can explain the universe in 2017 and what remains to be understood."
273,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62639477-taylor-woodson,3,"For me this book was extremely interesting as long as I was reading about General and Special Relativity. Gravity is amazing and what causes gravity is even more phenomenal. As long as this was the topic then I was loving this book. But as soon as the book switches over to quantum field theory(about halfway through the book) I got lost and confused haha. I understand this isn’t the authors fault, it’s just that quantum physics is THAT hard to understand as a concept. Quarks, Gluons, Positrons, the disappearing of particles and reappearing again, the wall of last scattering, string theory, plank dimensions...it’s all very hard to mentally picture and that makes it hard to grasp. A nod to the author though for giving it his best to make such difficult concepts easy(or easier) to read."
274,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82471363-emmanouil,5,"Very interesting book. It touches on many of the prevalent theories and ideas behind our understanding of the universe, its past, present, and future. As such, it risked being overly complex and hard to follow, something that the authirs works around perfectly. His anecdotes and presentation of each topic are simple so that people like myself without a strong background in physis can understand most of it fairly easily(some concepts are inherently harder to grasp), while also being educational enough to give one a good introduction to many extremely interesting ideas.A MUST read for anyone interested in learning a few things about our universe but is not armed with the proper theoretical background."
275,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35045797-iris-alvino,5,Well that was epic. The overall tone of the book was witty and good humored. You can tell the author loves the subject of the book and is excited to share his findings and those before him. I did learn a lot and am amazed by the brilliant minds that have helped us to understand the universe as we can in the now. It’s amazing how much we know that we didn’t only 100 years ago. I’m excited to see what our new eye in the sky can detect and hope we get proof of multiverses and wormholes and even life on other planets and within other universes. Man that would be amazing to have proven in my lifetime. I definitely will keep my ear out for everything that is soon to be discovered. 
276,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25999818-jason-oliver,5,"I love reading about physics and this book is one of the best Ive read. Having different people explain the same things in different ways really helps to grasp these complicsted and difficult concepts. Galfard takes you on thought experiment after thought experiment to help you understand thebuniverse, both the large and the small. You imagine being in black hole and you imagine riding electomagnetic waves. This is how phsics has mainly progressed since Einstein and Galfard lets you pretend you are the physicist. He even leads you to an answer and then commends your for figuring it out, even discovering it. The book felt like being part of The Magic School Bus. This book also covers some more recent discoveries such as the detection of gravitational waves when two black holes collided. Lastly, he takes you where physics isnheaded. He takes you on though experiments to what things are likenif some of the leading theories are true.A great book. The author obtained his PHD under Dtephen Hawking and worked with Hawking on black holes and the origin of the universe. But imaginary time still confises me. I dont grasp that concept. Maybe the next explination will work."
277,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4196-bobby,5,"A wonderful, basic introduction to topics like gravity, quantum theory, Einstein's theories, and the like. This book is likely too superficial for physics majors, but I think it's an excellent first book for most others. I recommend starting with this one, before moving on to Brian Greene, Stephen Hawking, etc. The writing style is breezy, conversational style, and as the author states in the intro, the only equation in the whole book is E=mc2. I do think the book would have benefited from some illustrations but this is a minor issue."
278,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467608-serro,2,"Mr Galfard brings nothing new to the table. Maybe just the approach of a journey through space as a mind to explore general relativity and as a mini-you to explore the quantum world, which honestly at times was rather silly.Yet as a whole it is a good introduction to the world of the very big and the very small projected at first timers of these realms. I didn't really test the sense of humour in it and I think that should Mr Galfard have an aunt she wouldn't be too pleased either, especially if she likes vases. Those who start reading this book will know what I mean."
279,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93676995-ashleigh-trickett,4,"This book is beautifully written, surprisingly poetic in parts, with an unexpected vein of humour threaded throughout! The opening chapters capture your imagination and attention, followed by many moments of drama and theatrics. This series of gedanken experiments are fun, interesting and more importantly, accessible. Galfard lives up to his ambition/promise in chapter 1 -he leaves no one behind."
280,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74056738-corry-sweet,5,"I like this book because the author doesn't just throw maths down your throat. The only equation in the entire book is Einstein's E=mc2 so you don't need a first class in physics from Cambridge to understand most of it. For anyone that is bored of being stuck on Earth during lockdown, I highly recommend this."

287,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46621828-alex,4,Very informative and thought-provoking. Galfard provides the reader with an amazingly detailed perspective of the various fields that surround us and make up our universe.

289,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9300518-arielle,4,A fun listen. Lots of visualization and immersion and the language isn’t too confusing tho there were still plenty of concepts I was like “durrrr what?”. Recommended if you want a brief look at the craziness that is space.
290,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53483800-alyson-walton,4,"This was a book I was expecting to love . . .yet I didn't. Can't lie, I found this book hard work.Whilst all the concepts are there, and the explanations are throughly dealt with, I agree with reviews which cite them as over simplified. Not that this isn't useful to a none scientist like me, just that it is repetitive and ends up a little annoying."
291,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5861984-judyta-szaci-o,3,"I quite enjoyed my time with this book even though the tone of its narrative did not always agree with me. I've seen that other people called it 'condescending' and 'patronising' in their reviews. I wouldn't go as far. I didn't feel patronised while reading it. I just felt I wasn't the target audience, that's all. The book is clearly thought to address the beginners while I - ignorant as I am in this field - can't call myself a beginner, having devoured several books by other authors on the same matters.In places, Galfard made some issues easier for me to visualise. In other instances, he confused me about the things I though I had already grasped. Overall, sadly, I don't think I've learnt anything new. However, with Michio Kaku's Parallel Worlds: A Journey through Creation, Higher Dimensions, and the Future of the Cosmos getting more and more dated with every passing year, Galfard's book may be the one I'd recommend to those who want to start on a journey through modern physics."
292,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,4,"I'm a bit uncertain on how to rate, or even review, this book. On the one hand, the explanations of physics, quantum mechanics, general relativity, astrophysics, cosmology, gravity, etc are pretty good and, most importantly, understandable without requiring a physics degree.* On the other hand, the imaginary adventurous travels (i.e. thought experiments) to such things as the inside of atoms and the cosmos in general just didn't really work for me, though I did eventually get used to it. Maybe this sort of thing works better for people who have pictures and movies pop up in their heads when they read books, but that simply isn't me. Otherwise, an interesting introductiory book that makes mind-bending subjects not so complicated, while managing to be entertaining at the same time.~~~~*Except String Theory. I think you need to have ingested a substantial quantity of magic mushrooms for that to make any sense."

I absolutely loved this book, this explained the recent developments in physics and clearly substantiates the facts of physics really well.Protons are made up of quarks while these are held together by a strong force which is generated by gluons. The further quarks are apart the more ferocious the strong force becomes. The carriers of the strongest force we know, the strong nuclear force, which keeps quarks confined, only allowing them to be free when they are holding close to one another, thus guaranteeing that the matter we are made of does not split apart. Quarks and gluons.These make up 99.97 % of our body mass. Two gluons bind to make a quark duet or a meson, which hold sthe nucleus together with the strong nuclear force. The nucleus is responsible for the lose of mass in the thermonuclear fusion reaction of the sun converts mass to energy.Particles that no one looks at do travel through all possible paths that space-time can offer. On it's way it splits into an infinite number of ghost images, or a wave, rippling in all directions through space-time. ""The very act of probing reality changes it's nature."" ""Just like all the thoughts you may or may not have on a given subject suddenly becomes reduced to one who hears you speak it out loud.""It goes into how John Dirac, created the idea of the quantum field and discovered antimatter by consequence. He expounds with an analogy, if an electron appeared out of nowhere this would mean that there has to be some sort of dormant energy according to E=mc^2. This anti-electron was discovered an called a positron, and there are other anti-particles that are related to other elementary particles (quarks, gluons, photons etc.).The quest to understand reality is a personal one, when all is said and done, and neither the supercomputer nor I should impose our views upon you. It's your right to have ideas of your own.-GalfordThis books starts out going from the absolute in physics to dubious, providing a firm foundation to the exploration of the mysteries of the universe which is later in the book.One can argue there are three kinds of mysteries in physics. The first ones are inherent to the theories themselves; they are theoretical. The second ones are rooted in observations and experiments. These are the ones that usually, but not always, drive research. The third type of mystery arises when no one understands anything anymore. - GalfordSome believe that gravity is a force of particles called gravitons, even though despite gravitons having no known reason to interact with one another were they to exist and being elementary they should be able to appear everywhere, this leading to a collapse in pretty much everywhere from gravity. Scientists believe that gravitons do exist, at least to as a part of the bigger theory that everybody is looking for.Quantum Superposition is how a particle when undetected is in all possible places at once, kind of like a wave. When detected this particle stops, and this is called quantum wave collapse. Heisenberg Uncertainty principle is you can never know where the particle is (position) or it's velocity. The Schrodinger's cat experiment demonstrates quantum superposition macroscopically, by placing a cat in a box that you cannot see. Then place a radioactive element in it (1/2 of radioactive decay), then place an vial of poison in the box and smash it. Since you cannot see the cat this means it is both dead and alive at the same time. Hugh Everett III said because of this quantum superposition, everything even our universe should be thought of as a quantum wave with parallel universes around us existing out of all the possibilities that could have been in our own universe.Adding the mass of every star, dust cloud, and everything else of the Milky Way. There is not enough matter to keep any star from shooting away, given the velocity. There should be about five times more matter than what you can see, Jan Oort discovered this and called it Dark Matter. Hubble's Law is when galaxies twice as far away from each other moves away twice as fast. This lead to the discovery of an anti-gravitational force, repelling matter and energy instead of attracting them. This is called Dark Energy and to account for its observed effects there must be lots of it (3 times more than dark matter). This leaves Dark Energy (72%), Dark Matter (23%), and the matter we know including light (4.6%). Singularities are when there are too much mass, or energy, in too small a volume, leading to the collapse of space-time. This is supposedly how black holes start and how our universe and space time was formed. The Inflationary period, the was a field filling the universe with a repulsive anti-gravity force. That field was so powerful that it triggered a period of extreme expansion, an extreme expansion that blew apart different parts of the early universe at a rate much faster that the speed of light, allowing for places that today seem to far apart to have ever been in touch to actually have been in the past. (This is no contradiction to limit for speed of light, because space-time itself expanded.) This also explains how the universe is isotropic, not including aniotropies (which are tiny temperature differences). This expansion released an extraordinary amt of energy, and this is what is thought to be the catalyst of the Big Bang. The No boundary proposal by hawking-hartle proposed that the universe has no beginning as we would understand it, they mathematically proved this.From the Earth we have a foreseeable radius of 13.8 billion years, the Planck's scale is the limit to what we can probe both in the very small and the very big. Theoretically, there exists a quantum string it is the most fundamental elements of our universe, it also is ten dimensional, not within the dimensions that we can perceive. However, Closed Strings, some call these gravitrons and branes which can propagate through spacetime. The Anthropic priniciple states that out of the unfathomably man possible forms extra dimensions could take, only the ones compatible with the existence of humans need be taken into account for us to be here, or we wouldn't be around to talk about them. Gedanken experiments are experiments of pure thought. In September 2015, was the telltale signal of two black holes merging, we had no idea that black holes could merge with each other, let alone merge. Thanks to this signal it confirms that what we think of black holes corresponds with real ones."

I appreciated the list of topics covered by all chapters.However, I think the author should not be afraid and underestimate readers, by assuming that ""popularization"" means being limited both in vocabulary and in long-term passed knowledge. Carl Sagan, among others, proved that science can be accessible to all without sacrificing scientific (or literary, for that matter) language and information, becoming a best-seller in a decade where educational level was for sure one step behind today's. So, if the goal was to give the reader a sense of satisfaction and achievement having grasped some main concepts without much effort, then it's a success. But the wonderful reality behind science requires waking up souls and curious spirits, instead of only giving a color-by-numbers-type guide to our Universe."
297,125006953X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49160575-kris,2,"I wanted to like this book, but I was annoyed by the imagined visualizations. I had already read Brian Greene’s Fabric of the Cosmos which I found to be an engaging and straightforward description of physics. Because he came after that text, Galford’s just didn’t measure up to my expectations.If you have never read a general account of physics, this work will certainly help you understand this fascinating subject."
