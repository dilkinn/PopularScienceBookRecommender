0,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33325227-meta-brown,3,"What a disappointment.Christin Rudder's OK Trends blog featured lots of analytics news you can use, or at least imagine using. He explained, with data, why men should consider dating older women (http://bit.ly/bestprospects) and what polite question to ask on a first date to get the odds on the impolite question you really want to ask (http://bit.ly/bestquest). He shared specific, actionable information. And he gave us all inspiration to use our own data in practical ways. His work wasn't exactly scientific grade, but neither is most business data analysis.So I was hoping for more, juicier and deeper goodies in Dataclysm. I wanted to read this book so much that I bought an advance copy from a used book dealer before the book's release. Big Data isn't valuable just because there is a lot of it. The reward for plowing through masses of data is in getting detail, new and focused information that conventional data sources can't reveal. So, for example, it only takes a small sample of data to know what book is most popular with people who read Steven King's last book, but it takes a whole heckuva lot of data to predict which few products each and every Amazon customer is most likely to buy this week. That kind of detail makes the difference between one-size-fits-all marketing and effective personalized marketing. But does this book show us how to reach that level of detailed use for data? Or even that it is possible, and useful, and why? It does not.The book gives many examples of how Big Data tells us things that we already know from small data and often, plain old personal experience. For example, many pages are devoted to showing evidence that people of some races are less desired as dating partners than people of other races. This is not a discovery that required Big Data. The book also tells us that attractive people get more job interviews, and that since people of some races are viewed as less attractive than others, that means they are at a disadvantage in the job market due to their race. All of this is significant information, but it's not something we need Big Data to know, and none of it is news. In fact, Rudder cites many research papers which draw the same conclusions with a whole lot less data. He's really just telling us that he sees the same patterns in his data, and that of some other online sources, that published research has already identified.In pushing to show the broad reaching implications of Big Data, Rudder has actually ended up giving us less news than he did in his blog posts. The examples in the book lack the rich detail and value for personal use that made his posts so much fun."
1,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"Historians like Braudel can only dream of the kind of history that can be written now. Now that we have minute and granular data on billions of individuals, on how they are living, of what they like, what they search for, who they prefer to be with, what they enjoy reading and watching, where they spend their time, how they react to political events, what their fears are, etc. -- a veritable flood of data -- a dataclysm.This book is an early, tentative, and often highly constrained attempt at creating the sort of narrative that this flood of data allows. It is restricted to the data collected from a dating site and hence comes with all the constrains and conditions that would imply (the sample would tend to be young, unmarried, middle-class and mostly male, for instance).Event though the book does not have any revelations about who we are (when no one is looking -- or at least, when we think so!), it does attempt to corroborate some of the social research that usually reaches us as anecdotes with hard data, and that is its real value -- as a trend-setter. 
If you read a lot of popular nonfiction, there are a couple things in Dataclysm that you might find unusual. The first is the color red. The second is that the book deals in aggregates and big numbers, and that makes for a curious absence in a story supposedly about people: there are very few individuals here. Graphs and charts and tables appear in abundance, but there are almost no names. It’s become a cliché of pop science to use something small and quirky as a lens for big events—to tell the history of the world via a turnip, to trace a war back to a fish, to shine a penlight through a prism just so and cast the whole pretty rainbow on your bedroom wall. I’m going in the opposite direction. I’m taking something big—an enormous set of what people are doing and thinking and saying, terabytes of data—and filtering from it many small things: what your network of friends says about the stability of your marriage, how Asians (and whites and blacks and Latinos) are least likely to describe themselves, where and why gay people stay in the closet, how writing has changed in the last ten years, and how anger hasn’t. The idea is to move our understanding of ourselves away from narratives and toward numbers, or, rather, to think in such a way that numbers are the narrative.
That is why the author says that he likes to think of his book a sort of Anti-Outliers. The exciting stories are not limited to what a few exceptional individuals are doing, but also in the aggregated activities of millions of Joes. No anecdotes for you, but here are some fun graphs."
2,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10035473-john-cooper,3,"A few weeks ago there was a mild furor after Facebook admitted that they’d run an experiment on some users, adjusting their news feeds to include more positive or more negative items than the norm, and recording how the emotional tone of the users’ own posts changed in result. After a week or so of media discussion, Christian Rudder, a founder of the online dating site OkCupid, volunteered that his site had done something similar. He’d deliberately matched OkCupid customers with people rated as being poorly compatible and monitored reports about the resulting in-person dates.He accepted interviews to explain himself, and in them he was absolutely unapologetic. Not only does he not see an ethical problem in defying user’s expectations about the site’s behavior, he says that an online company that does not engage in this kind of experimentation is irresponsible, because it is foregoing opportunities to learn how to improve its customer-aiding algorithms. He is convinced that every online company engages in similar tests, and asserts that they do as a fact.This is the context into which Rudder’s new book, Dataclysm, is released. In it, Rudder reveals himself as an enthusiast for both data and people—at least when considered in the abstract. His thesis is that the Internet has made it possible, for the first time in history, to obtain (almost as a side effect) massive amounts of data about what people are really like—how they behave and what they think in secret. The fourteen chapters are based around broad themes and contain many interesting maps, graphs, and charts, startlingly illustrating what the data tells us. The charts are like salted peanuts. It’s hard to find the will to stop consuming them.Rudder presents the data in an engagingly enthusiastic, casual way. At times he achieves a little poetry, such as when discussing a map showing the density of reactions on Twitter to an earthquake, overlaying a map showing the epicenter: “Here we see contours of surprise laid over the shifting earth.” At other times he seems clueless, even crude. This is nowhere more true than in the first chapter, which is devoted to the hoary truth that young women remain equally attractive to men throughout men’s lives. Rudder treats the depressing data with a glib tone, and troublingly, doesn’t pause to consider that when older men date older women, an explanation may be that older men have learned that sexual attraction is only one ingredient in a healthy relationship. He seems to prefer the explanation than men are simply hypocrites, pretending to desire that which they do not.It’s a shame that he leads with this chapter, because the rest are better. Did you know that you’ll tend to date more frequently and successfully if people either love you or hate you than if everybody just thinks you’re kind of cute? That people in Mississippi bathe more often than people in any other state? And what does it mean that women are more “race-loyal” than men, preferring more strongly than men do to date people of the same race?In addition to presenting interesting data, Rudder discusses what kinds of data about your life is being collected by various types of sites and agencies, and demonstrates the surprising ways they can use the information. Facebook and the NSA, of course, are part of the discussion. In fact, I’d go so far as to say that if you have any interest at all in the data that is being collected and shared about you, you’ll want to read Chapter 14. Rudder isn’t completely deaf to the implications of data mining, including the ethical implications. He just thinks he falls on the right side of the line. Others disagree."
3,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1686269-j,4,"I received this book through the First Reads program. Goodreads probably was not aware that they sent this book about big data to someone with a professional background in data analytics and an academic background in the social sciences. As such, I could not wait to write my review. The information being provided is from Christian Rudder, president and co founder of OKCupid. He analyzes data from his site as well as other social media websites. The premise is that Dataclysm is ""An unprecedented deluge of digital information reshaping our view of the world.""In my professional experience I saw enormous strategic decisions based on available data. The actions of our customers online indicated that their interests lay beyond the scope of what we had been providing. Knowing their attitude toward certain content was indeed positive, made it possible for programming strategy to move in a different direction.This book contains a lot of interesting data: disparities between what people say that want in a relationship and what they actually do. He uses the OKCupid to examine the gaps between what races say about one another, and also how his users feel about sex, filtered by Geolocation.These types of analyses are just part of the internet landscape now. We have more data than we know what to do with, and as vendors continue to integrate online analytics with real life purchasing data, or actual behavioral data our conclusions will become more robust.It took a while to get through the book despite the material. The chapters seemed disjointed to me and I was expecting every chapter to support a central narrative. However, I found myself staring at graphs that were interesting but not hugely significant. That’s the problem with big data…narrowing it all to what is really essential."
4,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,2,"On its face this book sounds good: data guru uses the information people share online, particularly on the dating website OkCupid, to reveal demographic trends. There is some interesting information here, along with fun graphs and charts. But while Rudder may be a good statistician, he’s a poor sociologist, and the book is riddled with eyebrow-raising assumptions and conclusions. It also hangs together poorly, jumping from one disconnected subject to another, with chapters that share a fairly simple finding padded by repetitive discussions of the author’s methods and rhapsodizing about the scope of his data. For a better book on what Big Data says about us, I recommend the more recent Everybody Lies.Unfortunately, Rudder begins the book with random, skewed guessing. In describing OkCupid, he confidently asserts that “[t]onight, some thirty thousand couples will have their first date because of OkCupid. Roughly three thousand of them will end up together long-term. Two hundred of those will get married[.]” This caught my attention immediately: 10% of online first dates leading to long-term relationships is a fantastic success rate, but less than 7% of long-term relationships ending in marriage seems awfully low for the 20’s-and-up crowd. Curious what definition of “long-term” Rudder was using, I flipped to the notes at the back, only to find that he made it all up based on the fact that the site has 4 million active users and 300 couples per day reporting that they are leaving OkCupid because they found someone on the site. Plus his intuition that fewer than 1 in 10 long-term couples get married: “How many serious relationships did you have before you found the person you settled down with? I imagine the average number is roughly 10.” My own experience of the world is very different (I don’t think I know anyone who’s had 10+ long-term, serious relationships). And since the average American woman marries at 27 and man at 29, and according to the CDC, the average adult woman reports 4 lifetime sexual partners while the average man reports 6-7, Rudder’s impression seems the more likely to be skewed. The author’s conclusions are equally questionable. He observes that men seem to find 20-year-old women the most attractive (at least on a site evidently without teenagers) throughout their lives, while women’s view of male attractiveness changes to accommodate their own age, and concludes that middle-aged men don’t contact young women for fear of rejection and social judgment. This overlooks the fact that there’s much more to a relationship than physical attractiveness; how many 50-year-old men want to live in a world of exam stress and frat parties, with a partner who has comparatively little life experience?Another chapter seems to confuse correlation and causation. In “You’ve Gotta be the Glue,” Rudder explains that couples who each have multiple clusters of Facebook connections from different areas of their lives, and are the only person connected to each other’s various tribes, last longer than couples who are connected to all the same people, who all know each other. This makes sense: if you belong to several social groups (co-workers, college friends, book club, etc.) and your partner has gotten to know all of them, your relationship is well-established and likely serious. But if you belong to a tight-knit community and start dating someone within your group, your Facebook connections provide no indication of how serious you are. Rudder, however, interprets the data as proving causation, concluding that the “specialness” of the couple in being the “glue” between different social groups somehow boosts the relationship. He fails to explain how “connecting” his gaming buddies to his wife’s extended family strengthens their marriage – presumably if these social groups cared to mingle much, they’d befriend each other on Facebook and then what happens to the couple’s “specialness”?When the book moves away from dating-related data, it becomes a series of disconnected one-off chapters. There’s a discourse about group rage on the Internet that involves little data analysis and seems to be included because the author is interested in group rage on the Internet. There’s a chapter about the language used in Twitter posts, concluding that Twitter definitely isn’t killing sophisticated thought because “a,” “and,” and “the” are among the top 10 words used in English both on Twitter and off of it. There’s an equation meant to demonstrate that multiplying a word’s frequency rank in a text by its number of uses will result in a constant, but the chart meant to illustrate this point with Ulysses displays a “constant” ranging from 20,000 to 29,055.All that said, there is some interesting material here, particularly the data on race. The chapter on racist Google searches is less relevant now that the author of that study has written his own book (the aforementioned Everybody Lies); and Dataclysm, published in 2014, has a rosier view of this than the 2017, Trump-era version. But the study showing massive racial differences in how people rate one another’s attractiveness is still quite relevant: key findings include the fact that people tend to view members of their own race as more attractive than others, but black Americans take a major hit in the ratings from everybody (including other black people, though to a lesser degree). My first reaction on reading this was that it’s hard to judge people for preferring cultural commonalities in their most intimate relationships. But the data isn’t so simple: it’s based on how people rate a photo, not whom they choose to contact, and attractiveness doesn’t only affect one’s dating prospects, but employment too (there’s a chart on that). And in-group biases in American society are hardly limited to dating; while our neighborhoods, schools, workplaces, churches, and friend groups are still largely separate, I’m inclined to believe that Rudder’s data does show hidden bias.Overall, while there are interesting nuggets in here, I wouldn’t recommend the book. A few interesting data points are padded into book-length by ill-conceived interpretations and rambling. By the end I was simply tired of it – the writing didn’t engage me when unaccompanied by charts, the book lacks cohesion and the author had lost far too much credibility. Try Everybody Lies instead."
5,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1811115-matt-lieberman,5,"Belle and Sebastian is the least black band in existence. ""6'4"" and ""Truck Driver"" are the words least likely to be used by Asians in dating profiles. Do these factoids illustrate some kind of fundamental truths regarding human nature? Not really. Are they fascinating (albeit perhaps a little obvious in the case of our melanin-repellent Glaswegian twee pop friends) enough to sustain an entire book? I certainly think so. In Dataclysm, Christian Rudder leverages vast reserves of data of over 185 million people from sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and OkCupid to pose some illuminating and entertaining theories and findings regarding social behavior. Some discoveries, such as the ones I mentioned at the start of this review, are merely compelling factoids. Others offer a bit more practical application and understanding of our society. All make for a very worthwhile read.While ""big data"" has been hijacked by businesspeople to basically cover any data set that would cause a performance slowdown in Excel (i.e. anything with more than 10 rows), there really is quite a bit of data that businesses, governments, and pop social science authors can utilize. According to Facebook Power Editor's reach estimator tool, advertisers targeting 24 year-old Spanish-speaking women in the market for new economy cars have approximately 1,380 lucky users to serve their ads to. Sabermetricians can determine Dante Bichette's OBPS in the seventh inning of games on Tuesdays on cut fastballs on the inside of the plate in 1998. However, these massive reams of highly-specific data are pretty useless unless you are able to pose interesting questions about their contents and possess the statistical acumen to properly answer them. Author Christian Rudder thankfully possesses both qualities, and is an acerbic and skilled writer to boot. He is a co-founder of the popular dating site OkCupid.com and SparkNotes and also maintained the blog OkTrends which included posts debunking dating profile photo myths and what white people truly like (evidently a lot of Tom Clancy and Phish). Rudder is a capable and engaging guide through the data and peppers his analysis with pop-culture references, amusing asides, and even some insightful comments.If you found either of those blog posts intriguing I suggest you pick up this book immediately, because Dataclysm is basically a longer collection of such material. The book seems to have grown out from Rudder's blog and the book reads like a series of extended blog posts on human behavior. While Rudder came from an online dating site and there is plenty of (e)ink devoted to the topic of romance, he examines much more than just what big data tells us about relationships. Dataclysm is structured into three major divisions: what data tells us about sex and relationships, what data tells us about our broader culture, and finally what data tells us about how individuals identify themselves. This allows him to investigate phenomena such as how word lengths in tweets show that Twitter might be improving society's writing ability and how Facebook likes can accurately predict users' demographics.Readers do not need any real knowledge of statistics to fully enjoy the book. While the analysis certainly seems well thought out and thorough, Rudder spares his audience any mentioning of p-values or Spearman correlation tests and instead just focuses on the social learnings that result from his number crunching. He presents all of his findings clearly and cogently and is generous with the charts and infographics. Rudder strikes a nice balance between keeping the book moving at a fast pace and fully exploring his topics and Dataclysm held my interest the entire time. I finished the book in two days and my only real complaint is that I wish it was longer and that he explored more topics. I really enjoyed the book and think that Dataclysm narrowly edges out Gabriel Sherman's The Loudest Voice in the Room as my favorite book of 2014 thus far.In SumAny users interested in the usual pop social science suspects (Levitt, Gladwell, the Heath Brothers, etc.), Nate Silver's data analysis, or Chuck Klosterman's cultural musings should really pick this up. Dataclysm isn't going to provide you with the one secret insight that will guarantee financial and romantic success (which is good because that magic bullet doesn't actually exist), but it does offer some truly fascinating discoveries about our society and online behavior in a quick and easy read. Highly recommended. 9/10Review originally posted on: http://www.batsarenotbugs.com/2014/06..."

7,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,1,"The premise is interesting, but Rudder's presentation just wasn't working for me. The introduction was long enough that I felt a few additional facts would have made it a perfectly acceptable book. While I'm sure he knows his business (analytics for OKCupid, a company he & several others founded) he didn't present it well. Part of that was the media - there are too many lists & charts that are difficult & painful to listen to in an audio. He's simply introducing this concept & the data isn't really all there yet. The Internet & many of the data collection sites (Facebook, Google, et al) are young. FB's only really been a hit for less than a decade. What happens when a kid's history is documented from birth through death via the deathless statistics & posts? That's dataclysm, when it all comes together, so he is just sketching the foreword of what is to come. Still, it's a lot better than the tiny bits that history has left us (old diaries) or social experiments which are usually too small & not representative samples. They're WEIRD (http://www.slate.com/articles/health_...) I get that. Still, his premises & conclusions were often too fuzzy to be meaningful. For instance, an early example comparing the 'attractiveness' of ages by sex. He doesn't define 'attractiveness', though. Isn't it a moving target depending on the circumstances? Women tend to like men close to their own age. Men find women in their early 20's the most attractive, yet when actually looking for a date contact women closer to their own age. He says this might be due to social conventions & then hares off on to another subject. What did I learn from this? Nothing new, that's certain. Attractive how? Evolution & animal instinct vote for the younger ones, but I sure as hell wouldn't want - probably couldn't have - a romantic relationship with a girl younger than my baby girl. Sex is an important part of a relationship, but just one part. Societal mores aside, any relationship requires commonality of experience & Rudder completely skipped even mentioning this.I gave this a couple of hours, about 1/3 of the book, but it never really grabbed me with any points I haven't read about before & was just too fuzzy. Maybe he should have waited a decade or two."
8,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2335975-liza,4,"Full disclosure: I'm a graduate student in a doctoral Information Studies program. This means I've read a lot of different books about data and the internet. I've also done a little of my own research into social media and, specifically, OKCupid.Dataclysm's author, Christian Rudder, was one of the founders of OKCupid, and has turned data mined from the site's millions of interactions into an interesting view of the patterns of behavior of the online dater.The book is informative, intriguing, and at times pretty funny. Rudder's writing style is accessible and conversational, bringing trends and statistics from the academic set to the casual reader.Much of the data is focused on heterosexual coupling, which was a bit disappointing, but Rudder indicates late in the book that there were few differences when you looked at data about gay or bisexual users. That in itself is interesting, because if, like straight men, gay men prefer younger partners, how does that translate? Obviously both halves of a couple cannot be younger.(My other disappointment is that the advance ebook didn't properly display most of the graphs, though Rudder's descriptions were clear enough that I was able to understand what they were showing.)In the middle of the book, Rudder discussed some rather interesting and controversial topics like race and body image. His coverage of the way online daters view race was pretty comprehensive and a little disturbing -- well, his coverage isn't what was disturbing, it was more that he found that people are more discriminating than they would ever admit to. The discussion of body image was brief, however, and mainly focused on Tumblr's #proana controversy. I wish he would have looked at some data relating to weight -- specifically fat -- and online dating. Overall, however, this book was fascinating and really pleasant to read. Beyond my own nerdy and intellectual interest in the subject of social media use and data, this is a must-read for anyone who wants a look at the habits of online dating site users and those with concerns for internet privacy."
9,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2447855-jason-gordon,3,"The good1). The book actually uses metadata in the aggregate to test sociological/cultural narratives. It's good to know that internet data can be used to show that we live in a incredibly racist culture and that the ideology of white supremacy actually informs much of our behaviour. 2). The book also demonstrates how metadata can be used to discover who exactly an individual is (i.e. their narrative). This is important as it puts to rest the denials of the government when they state that they can't determine anything about you from metadata.The bad1). Rudder really overstates his case. He writes that the large numbers of internet users don't prove that he has a complete picture of anything, but it suggests that such a picture is coming. It's hard to see that this is the case when the internet is galloping toward a panopticon and industrial civilization, the civilization that provides the large numbers he's talking about, is plummeting towards decline. There's also the fact that industrial civilization and the globalized economy is increasingly homogenizing whole cultures and peoples, in effect rendering some of the cultural narratives discovered by this data rather cheap and trivial.2). The last chapter is probably the most painful thing I've read in a while, more painful than the philosopher John Gray's solution to hand the oceans over to private energy companies to resolve the climate crisis and more painful than Ellul's racist rants against Muslims. It's like the poor boy came down with schizophrenia. Axciom is a terrible company, but Google is leading the way in turning data towards the public good. Absurd doesn't even begin to describe it, as these comments and others reflect an almost serious mental illness.Very irritating, very tiring and marginally insightful. "
10,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1353392-emily,4,"Christian Rudder is one of the founders of the dating site OKCupid. His degree from Harvard is in mathematics. He combines a conversational and humorously worded style with an extensive knowledge of data manipulation and presentation to deliver this treatise, which is both informative and enjoyable to read. His witty turns of phrase and common vernacular suck in the lay reader as he presents fascinating tidbits about how we utilize online services to seek a mate or communicate with friends. In addition to data from his vast OKCupid store, he also draws from Facebook, Google, Twitter and others to present a nuanced picture of what we can glean from the aggregate words and numbers. The chapters on race and location are particularly engaging. Rudder's use of charts and graphs are also particularly effective. He is comparing and contrasting several sets of information and doing so in a way that is understandable and illuminating. A person with a particular interest in race, gender and women's studies might find his conclusions particularly disturbing, as it seems that men only find young women attractive, no matter how old they are, and no one wants to date black women at all. Also, there's not really any such thing as bisexuality, as almost everyone who declares him or herself bisexual on OKCupid interacts almost exclusively with just one gender. Rudder's place here is not necessarily to moralize about or psychoanalyze his subjects, but his delivery of some of these facts seems rather glib. Whereas throughout most of the text, his humor and wit are welcome, taking the dryness out of the subject, here he seems to not be concerned about the implications of his findings.He also seems less concerned than most people about the uses that Big Data can be put to by governments and corporations in order to control and/or monetize the citizenry. In the final chapter he does discuss the danger of all of this information and the predictive and inferential tools utilized by these entities, but considers this a ""trade-off"" wherein users gain access to ""free"" tools like Google and Facebook, and the country is more secure from terrorists. Overall, this book is quite engaging and easy to read. The sections are well-organized and present topics of interest in a cohesive and relational way. I would recommend it to anyone interested in Big Data, but not well versed in it as of yet. One small complaint, and probably not valid as this is an ARC, is that he mentions a tool he set up on the book's website, dataclysm.org/relationshiptest. It is supposed to tell you how good your relationship is based on the intersection of your Facebook friends with that of your partner's. Unfortunately, the site is not yet present on the Internet. After emailing the author (on August 6th) he said it would be up ""later in the month"". I've checked frequently and as of today, August 23rd, it's still not there. I'm a bit disappointed, because I really want to check on my relationship! Although, I do have to say that Mr. Rudder did reply to my email rather quickly, which was encouraging. The book is due to be released September 9, so I will be checking again closer to that date."
11,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17687337-christine-varga,3,"To start: The description posted for this book really does NOT explain what this book is about and it gave me little insight in terms of what to expect. It wasn’t until I actually opened the book, saw the data displayed in the blood-red-on-standard-black graphics that I even had an idea of what I was up against. Don’t let the cover fool you. There are no rainbow sprinkles here. This stuff is dark. I should disclose that I received the Advance Reader’s Edition of the book through the Goodreads First Reads program, so that is what I am reviewing here. I didn’t know who Christian Rudder was prior to now, and I’m not an OkCupid user or a fan of the site in any way. It was a bit of an unpleasant surprise to me to find out that the main source of information used was Rudder’s own site. However, OkCupid does seem to have a fairly diverse, population-reflective group of (internet) users in most categories, so letting that slide allowed me to get some valuable insight into the online dating world. It might be helpful to point out here that only certain types of people tend to online date though. But of course, an online dating site such as OkCupid would do well to refute that idea. The real core of this book is honestly depressing. So if you were here for the rainbow sprinkles, this isn’t for you. All that stuff we always argue about that people say we can’t quantify –like how important appearance, race and gender still is or is not— is proven here in some terrifying graphics. These are numbers that will make you want to laugh and cry. I threw the book a couple of times, but that’s something that happens with me. I’d be concerned if I didn’t throw the book. I don’t want to spoil any of the conclusions that are made, but the numbers we look at here are scary. I wish I could have absorbed this more slowly, at a pace of a chapter per night. But free time now and busyness later meant that wasn’t the case. Reading Dataclysm is a bit like drinking medicine that tastes awful, except it’s the real world you’re drinking in. And finding out answers is curing your ignorance and uncertainty.Rudder’s writing is good. His voice is confident but generally doesn’t veer too far into sounding vain. The way the book is written makes it easy to understand what is going on in the graphics. We get them explained to us; we take a glance at them and then hear more about what the numbers really mean –and it works. Rudder’s conclusions for his data sets are solid overall. They made me angry, but they were right. There’s nothing controversial here, just sad stuff.This wouldn’t be the usual type of book I’d go for. It seems to be written to appeal to a niche market. I’m giving it 3.5 out of 5. However, for those people out there who love gathering information, who spend hours on Wikipedia jumping from article to article, who look up English word usage over time just for fun and who love analyzing the world from behind the comfort of a book or a computer screen, this is the one for you! For me, it just might have been a little too creepy . . ."
12,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21047175-pubudu-wariyapola,4,"Interesting book (collection of blog posts) about data analysis. The sections about OkCupid are interesting (the author worked there and had access to all data). The rest of the analyses are his picks from other sources - somewhat interesting, but nothing new or eye-opening. He tries to combine the posts into a book, but not very successfully. If you read as a collection of interesting tidbits/analyses you will find value. Don't expect a cohesive whole."
13,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13614926-caidyn-he-him-his,2,"To be honest, this wasn't terribly interesting to me. It's full of interesting information, that's for sure, but not really interesting to me. I spaced out a lot while listening to this book at work. It's very repetitive with similar information given in each chapter. Stuff that wasn't very surprising. I'm sure that someone besides me would find it fascinating and full of relevant information, just not for me. It wasn't my kind of book.The thing I latched onto the most was how absolutely terrifying it is to know that companies are using data to track interest on me. Like, GR, right now, is looking at the books I've read and rated highly to recommend me other books. Such as, when I read a book in a series and suddenly get recommended a book that's the third one in a series.... that I've never read. Or, how when I'm at work and am looking up things for Ebay (since I'm Ebay Coordinator and I know shit about the stuff we sell, so I have to educate myself on it) suddenly I get ads for skates. To me, that's terrifying. I don't like it. The book reminded me of The Circle (which I didn't like for various reasons) and not in a good way. It just confirmed that it's only so far until we get to a world like one in that book. If we aren't already in it."
14,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7193120-aussiescribbler-aussiescribbler,5,"Christian Rudder was one of the founders of the dating site OkCupid. Running a site like that involves making decisions based on observations of people's behaviour gathered from their computer data - what works or doesn't work when it comes to helping people hook up? The concept of studying the kind of data which can be gathered from social media and search engines in order to build a better picture of the society in which we live became an obsession for him and he began sharing what he discovered on his blog. This book provides an overview of this topic. It asks the question : ""Who are we when we think no one is looking?"" In the past we have been dependent on surveys for much of our sociological information and they are limited by the size of the sample and the possibility that those responding to them may not always tell the truth even in situations which guarantee anonymity.This is very much a book aimed at a popular audience and it does what such a book should do - it entertains, it informs and it encourages thought. Rudder doesn't take a rigorous scientific approach. He is content to let his personality and life philosophy shine through in his presentation and interpretation of the data. This is one reason why the book is so entertaining. Rudder comes across as a witty, likeable guy and there are times when his book is laugh-out-loud funny.But interpretations of data are only as good as the depth of reasoning the interpreter has put into them. It is easy to jump to conclusions. For instance, Rudder presents data which shows that the percentage of searches for gay porn to porn as a whole on Google is relatively even across the United States, and concludes that this ""frustrates the argument that homosexuality is anything but genetic"". While it is true that it argues against the paranoid view that people are ""recruited"" to homosexuality, I'm not sure he has thought through the full breadth of the debate about genetic vs. environmental factors in the generation of sexuality. Firstly, a genetic origin doesn't necessarily mean an even spread. Dark skin is definitely genetic, and there are some countries where the majority are dark skinned and others where light skinned people predominate. When we say that something is genetic we are essentially saying that it travels in bloodlines. This doesn't mean that it can't be an underlying tendency passed on by those in whom it is not active of course. But there are socially-arising phenomena which, because they go so deep into the nature of what it means to be human, are fairly evenly spread through different societies. My own belief is that we are all born with the potential to be ""polymorphously perverse"" bisexuals and that our ""love map"" (to use a term coined by psychologist John Money) - the filter of fixations and inhibitions which determines what turns us on and what turns us off - is formed by environmental factors, many of which are very subtle. As with chaotic systems, small events early in life can lead to major changes in the human psyche. Rudder implies that we should expect a variation in the prevalence of gayness in different states based on their relative tendency toward liberality vs. conservatism on the topic. It is true that growing up in a homophobic environment would tend to lead to inhibitions about male-male sex, but since we also have a tendency to fixate on those aspects of our nature we feel least able to simply accept (the tongue in the sore tooth effect), we might expect these two things to balance each other. Also, it has to be said that even those who support gay marriage may sometimes subtly express a sense that it is preferable to be straight, which could have an effect on the forming sexuality of a young person. One needn't live across from the Westboro Baptist Church to feel nervous about kissing your same sex partner in public. And, even if homosexuality were inborn, this needn't mean that it is genetic. Some have suggested that it may be related to the mix of hormones provided to the fetus, something which can be effected by stress. It would not be surprising to find that stress is fairly evenly spread across U.S. states.The book reads like a mystery story where the collective human psyche - or sometimes the collective psyche of a race, gender or sexual orientation - is the culprit being stalked. Around every corner is more descriptive evidence. Sometimes it can be funny when a study of the words most typical of a race or gender or sexual orientation backs up well-known stereotypes. It can also be a little depressing. We long to be surprised about some aspect of human nature, but statistical norms are probably not where we are likely to find such surprises. It is worth remembering that major change can begin with an individual, and individuals are invisible in this kind of mass data. If the internet had existed in 600 AD, and so this kind of data collection had been possible, the tweets and Google searches of a guy named Muhammed would have been an invisible drop in the bucket drowned out by the masses talking about that era's equivalent of Lady Gaga or Justin Bieber. But today one of the big statistics we may be gathering is how many people follow the religion that he established. These tools are extremely useful in tracking changes in society, but the birth of those changes is the place where we may still be surprised.Another limitation, as Rudder acknowledges, is that this kind of information can tell us the ""whats"" but not the ""whys"". We can see what people are doing, but we can't see their motives or know whether the motives behind a shared behaviour are also shared or are diverse. The data is grist to the mill but not an end in itself.Sometimes the information raises as many questions as it answers. Rudder places a lot of emphasis on the discovery, from beauty rating statistics on OkCupid, that non-blacks tend to rate blacks as less attractive than whites, asians or hispanics. He presents this as evidence of, possibly unconscious, racism. For me this raises a number of interesting questions. If I tended to rate black women as less attractive than white women, for example, would this be because a racist low opinion of black women was causing me to see them as less attractive? Or is it possible that a tendency to find black women less attractive, which might be purely biological and have nothing to do with my opinion of their worth, cause me to subconsciously see them as less worthy? Rudder refers to studies which have shown that women who are viewed as attractive are more likely to be successful with job interviews regardless of whether the interviewer is a man or woman, thus how attractive we are judged to be can lead to social injustice, and if perceived attractiveness is distributed unequally to the various races this could have a similar effect to conceptual racism. I'm not sure where this leaves us, but part of me wants to know if it isn't enough that I view someone else as my equal. Do I really have to find them physically attractive as well? Do we even have any control over who we do or do not find attractive?The book doesn't only deal with aggregated statistics. It is often at it's most compelling when dealing with aspects of internet culture itself. There is an account of the origin and spread of the concept of ""personal branding"", some hilarious anecdotes about internet marketing campaigns gone wrong and some horror stories about the phenomenon of the Twitter mob. I'm sure most of us have seen examples of this. The two examples Rudder concentrates on are one in which a teenager made a joke about the age of the earth and was viciously attacked by a mob who apparently believed she was serious. The other was of a woman who made a racially insensitive joke, found that it spread very quickly, leading to a mob salivating over the prospect of her losing her job, which is what happened. Why does this kind of thing happen? The structure of the phenomenon is an ancient one - it was there behind the ""witch"" burnings and the Crusades, and is still with us wherever a woman is stoned for adultery, wherever someone is lynched, wherever anyone launches a ""Holy War"" against ""evil""... There are multiple layers to our psyche. The most superficial layer is our ego, which compromises the public face we show the world as well as our private self-image. Below that is what Sigmund Freud dubbed ""the Id"", the dark and turbulent repository of feelings we have repressed or disowned. Below that again, I believe, is our deepest nature, one of pure love and kindness. The ego can be a fragile thing. Faced with the turbulence of what lies beneath we can feel very insecure about own self worth. This can lead us to try to establish our identity as ""the good guy"" by singling someone else out as an ""evil-doer"" and attacking them. Not only do we reinforce our self-image but we get to drain off some of the scary aggressive feelings that otherwise might threaten us. This can be such a seductive strategy that once one person puts it into action there will tend to be plenty of others ready to join the ""Jihad"".This is an immensely entertaining book and one which I think will play an important role by inspiring interest in a field of enquiry which shows great promise of helping to enlighten us about ourselves."
15,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11188049-jordan,3,"Find this review at Forever Lost in Literature!**I received a copy of Dataclysm for review courtesy of Blogging for Books**Dataclysm is a social snapshot of society drawing on data from Facebook, Twitter, and OkCupid, a popular dating site created by the author, Christian Rudder. This book explores how the things people ""like"" on Facebook can reveal very specific details about our lives - such as our sexual orientation, - how people describe themselves online versus how they actually act in person, as well as how to deduce the approximate amount of homosexuals live in each state, whether they are open about it or not. The data Rudder draws from a majority of the time is relatively slim, considering most of it is from OkCupid, a dating site. He admits that much of his data will be skewed as a result of this, but it still lends a bigger question of how much we should really take stock in what he says representing everyone versus how much we should just take for purely entertainment's sake. Since OkCupid is a what it is - a dating site - it's obvious that there's going to be a skewed sample of people that are generally single, middle-class, and more likely to be male than female. It's important to realize that this information is largely applicable mainly to the United States, as there are different cultural and societal norms in other countries, and some countries don't have nearly as much access to the internet and social media sites.I do think that Rudder's information lends itself to a bigger picture of how people interact with one another and act online versus how they act in real life. The actual real-world picture may be different from Rudder's limited sample, but it still creates the same overall idea, which is really what I think Rudder is trying to point out. It's very thought-provoking, and I think Rudder brings up some really interesting points through his research. For example, his deductions revealed about attitudes on race and sexuality seem to be rather representative of the United States as a whole, and I feel that this can lead to intriguing discussions on how people change their views or attitudes based upon what is socially acceptable. Rudder's writing is wonderfully engaging. He has a strong sense of humour and wit that makes this novel both enjoyable and easy to read. In fact, I finished it extremely quickly because of this: I would sit down to read, only to look up a while later and realize that an hour had passed and I didn't even realize it. Whether the information presented was enlightening and groundbreaking or not, it's still a highly amusing and interesting book. I did really, really love the graphs, though. I love looking at graphs and statistics, so I had a delightful time looking at all of them, even if they weren't very interesting or necessary to what he was saying. There were a few graphs that didn't really add to the discussion, but they still fit in well enough with what Rudder discussed. The format of the book was interesting. There were large categories that housed chapters within each; I both liked and disliked this method. It was nice to have more brief, to-the-point chapters, but it also felt a bit disjointed and rushed as well. Personally, I feel like each chapter could have been a separate blog post on Rudder's blog, which I had never previously read, but I've heard that the book is basically just a really, really long blog post. So if you like Rudder's blog, you are most likely sure to enjoy this book. I'll be honest, I was expecting more from this book. While Rudder provided a large amount of interesting statistics and insight, I was expecting to learn something much deeper and juicier than what I really learned, which is basically that people aren't what they appear to be on the internet. Overall, I feel as though Dataclysm deserves three-and-a-half stars; it was wonderfully entertaining, but I think it really lacked the overall cohesion or depth that I was really craving. "
16,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/767304-ezra,3,"Maybe really 2.5 stars, but I rounded up. I have read the OkTrends blog since its inception. Human behavior fascinates me, so I take any opportunity to read on it. The We Experiment On Human Beings post ensnared my attention since it flubs its nose at academic sensibilities at what is ethical experimentation. But, this review is not about Rudder's ethics, so I will move on to the book.The writing engaged a technologist interested in Big Data, interesting links, and how data can be used in interesting ways. (Hardly surprising.) Many references made me laugh out loud. I highlighted 32 places according to my Kindle stats. Much more were worthy. The writing alone would make me give it 5 stars.My first problem manifested in the lack of details in the main text. Where I expected to read about how conclusions were reached, the details were light. Where it all fell apart for me fell in the Coda section where he delved further into the methods used. Suddenly the assumptions, based on nothing but super wild ass guesses (SWAGs) came into complete view. For example, his conservative estimate is that active OkCupid users go on at least one date every two months and uses this with active users/month to arrive at 30,000 dates will happen tonight because of OkCupid. This number is used for other calculations. I would give this aspect no stars.So an average of 2.5 stars rounded up is the reviewed 3. "
17,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6490545-vicki,2,"I feel bad giving this book two stars because I've met the author in person and he's a nice guy and I know how much bad reviews suck. But, reading this book as a person who works in data gave me a very bad feeling. All of the notes indicate that he didn't pull the data himself, nor work on any of the charts, but did so with the help of James Dowdell, who did the heavy lifting in the stats and visualization, and two other guys from OKCupid who pulled the data at Rudder's request. What was Rudder's actual role at OKCupid? The details are vague there, as well. Where is the GitHub for the code for this book? It should be available. All of the conclusions are kind of cool and I do give him credit for coming up with some of the theories he wanted to explore, but I'd much rather a sociologist or statistician take me through the implications of racism, etc, rather than Rudder, who seems to merely be speculating and grandstanding about what his Theory of the Internet is. It's kind of like sitting in some hipster bar next to a guy who wants you to know how cool he is. A lot of the anecdotes can be found simply by having kept up with internet culture over the past 5 years. Overall, a VERY pop book that does not do good data analysis credit. Very pretty charts, though. "
18,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury,3,"So I'm on OKCupid and I like pulling data apart so I thought this was worth a look. And it is. Even if it's better taken in bits than it is all put together as a whole, a problem with this type of nonfiction generally. The chapters are very tidy, with nice little introductions and anecdotes, but Rudder is pretty straightforward about the fact that this is not going to be a book based on anecdotes. He is a numbers guy and I appreciate that. It's why I read the book in the first place. But things can still get less interesting when he tries to parse out what the numbers mean.Interesting for the armchair psychologist. Depressing for the online dating community. (People are even more shallow than you think they are!) Worth a bit of your casual perusing time."
19,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444762-jill,4,"I loved this book, and I want to say at the outset, that if you need “fodder” for starting conversations at social gatherings, this book is replete with it! The author, Christian Rudder, is President and Co-founder of the dating site, OKCupid. He began collating and charting data from his own site, and then expanded his database by looking at comparative data from “rival” dating sites, Facebook, twitter and other social media sites. What he has found out is just amazing. The underlying theme is that, no matter what people claim about themselves and how they express themselves in surveys, what they actually believe and do is often quite different, but can be discovered by their online interactions. Even in the privacy of one’s own home, what one searches for in Google is revelatory.I think my favorite aspect of this book is how it demonstrates the remarkable revolution in sociological research. It makes me gnash my teeth in regret that I did my own studies before this sort of data had become available - what fun it would have been! (Not that I didn’t have fun, in a bizarre, pedantic sort of way, but just saying….) For example, you can analyze tweets to see which people celebrate certain traditions, and how closely these mirror political borders. Using the program DOLLY (Digital Online Life and You) - to cite just one example, researchers found that the Dutch holiday of Sint Maarten is not only celebrated in the northern Netherlands, but also in Western Belgium: “the tweets reconnect old Holland to Flanders, its cultural cousin.” As the author observes: “Thus we watch an animated visualization of GPS-enabled data points, and see shadows of the Hapburgs."" Just imagine, he says, if we could have tracked the tweets in Alsace-Lorraine over the years as it changed hands from German to French to German to French, with each government trying to impose its culture and language on the people. [When we traveled to that area, it was clear the mix was still trying to sort itself out!]Other entertaining discoveries: research on Facebook has now verified that most of us are in fact connected by six degrees of separation; the majority of searches for “missed connections” are from sightings at Walmart (and most of those are in the South); when white men write essays about themselves for dating sites, the most commonly used word after “the” is “pizza”; the most antithetically used words (words most used by everyone else but least used by specific groups) for Asian men include “layed back” [spelled wrong] and ”6’4” (oddly, the second most typical phrase for Asian women is “tall for an asian”); and that the Center for Disease Control coordinates with Google to track epidemics because when people are getting sick, they search for symptoms and remedies.Far and away the most revelatory data have to do with race and gender preference. The author explains, for instance, that a variety of indications (searches, friend connections, etc.) suggest the figure of 5% of the population being gay is pretty accurate and holds true across the states. But the number of self-reporting gays varies by the level of acceptance by states. So for example, if you see a state in which only 1.5% of respondents self-report as gay, you can probably pretty safely assume that 3.5% are in the closet. (He provides a lot of documentation to substantiate this.)The details on race are the saddest, and show the extent to which race still is in fact a problem in the U.S. (in case you could possibly doubt it). Rudder reports data (not only from OKCupid but also DateHookup and match.com - a total of around 20 million Americans) on ratings of each group (white, black, Asian, and Hispanic) for each sex by each group, ranking the attractiveness of the other sex by race alone. Every single category and sex rates black women the lowest. Claiming to be part white elevates one’s rating substantially. Perhaps most significantly, data outside the U.S. reveal no such bias! He also talks about spikes in Google for searches like jokes about [the “n” word] that correspond precisely to peaks in Obama’s presidential campaign cycle.In addition, as the author explains, you can find out a lot about peoples’ prejudices by watching the operation of Google’s sentence completion function. Google will fill in the most popular responses as you begin questions like, “Why do all blacks….” “Why do all gays….” “Why do husbands….,” etc.Finally, the author includes a very thorough discussion about privacy, even bringing the Edward Snowden revelations to bear.Discussion: I could have a couple of small quibbles. As one illustration, the author made a chart correlating the age at which a woman looks “most attractive” to a man by the age of the man. As the age of the man increases, the age of the woman by and large does not. But does that mean men find aging unattractive, or could there be a conscious or subconscious consideration that older women either might already have children (a.k.a. “baggage”) or conversely, might not be able to have children, which the man might want? [Or am I just trying to come up with reasons why aging women aren't really seen as less attractive?]And speaking of the constraints of the data, the way questions are formulated doesn’t necessarily allow for all possible variables that might come into play. [Example from a recent Facebook “test” I took: “Do you prefer acid rock, pop, or rap? Those were all the choices; no “other”; no “none of the above”. I was forced to make a choice and provide an answer that wasn’t at all accurate.]In other words, I sometimes want more “data” to understand the data. (Rudder says in the Afterword that he deliberately omitted statistical details to make the book more readable, because “mathematical wonkiness” wasn’t what he was trying to get across.) He does add references in the back whenever possible for further study.Another small criticism I have is that the author presents so many arresting data findings that he sometimes goes from one to the other without full elucidation.On the other hand, I am confident the author is aware of all of this. He acknowledges an intellectual debt to Edward Tufte, who is a (perhaps “the”) leading authority on the uses, misuses, ambiguities, and deceptiveness of data, and Rudder acknowledges:"" …behind every number there ’s a person making decisions: what to analyze, what to exclude, what frame to set around whatever pictures the numbers paint.”As he concludes, this science of data analysis is just in its beginning stages; he is trying to give us a taste of what is already out there, and what is to come. It is aggregate data, he cautions; we still have to account for individual differences and quirks. But it sure is fascinating to find out what the numbers show about broad trends.Evaluation: This book is full of stunning and provocative information about who we are, as well as who we want to be (but aren’t, at least not yet). Learning “sociology” has never been this fun!"
20,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45948505-allison-riding,5,"As a single 25 year old who has lightly dabbled in dating apps, this book successfully has me swearing them off forever. Mostly because I'm clearly past my 20 year old female prime. Also because (as many studies have shown) we repeatedly select differently than we say we desire. With that said: what a fun book!!!!!!! For a data-centric, behavioral psychology treasure trove of information, it read like a guilty pleasure. Highly recommend! Danced through in one sitting on a flight.I also thought it was interesting how our writing has not declined with Twitter and other short form- but improved. Creativity loves limits!"
21,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1890871-bonnie-blu,2,"I agree with Rudder's main thesis that each of us is being tracked much more than we think we are, and that this data will change forever how we live, whether we want it to or not. However, I have serious misgivings about many of the conclusions that he draws. My main misgiving is that since most of his data comes from members of OKCupid, his data is highly skewed by using this very limited group. Another issue I have with the information presented in the book, is how Rudder cherry picks certain results without investigating more deeply or widely. For example, he uses the data to show that white racism is still deeply embedded in America. I agree that racism exists on all levels of American society, even though overt racism is generally hidden, but he stops there and doesn't pursue the data further. Rather than simply taking the easy way out and highlighting white racism, he could have used the data to show that racism exists on many levels and in many different forms. America's horrible history of slavery makes racism a complicated and deep-seated issue, but by only focusing on one result in his data, Rudder does a disservice to his readers by not using all of the data to examine how racism functions in other groups.His analysis of governmental surveillance is another area in which I found his analysis specious. After reviewing the breadth of governmental surveillance, he states: ""Does surveillance make us safe? Is the security apparatus a blanket? Well, there haven't been any terror attacks on American civilians since 2001 - at least, not ones by the syndicates. That's not meaningless, certainly not to a New Yorker. But an argument from absence isn't very strong, and at least until we're allowed to know the threats that were thwarted as opposed to those never planned, it's hard to trust what we're told."" I disagree with two main points in this quote. First, I believe an argument from absence is a rather strong argument in this particular case. The lack of attacks is a good indication that the surveillance is working, at least to an extent. Secondly, telling the public about thwarted attacks could alert extremists as to our methods, and thereby, hamper those efforts. Is the concept of ""big brother"" cause for trepidation? Yes, but considering the current world situation, quite a bit of big-brotherism is, unfortunately, necessary. How can we decide when it goes too far? That is a decision that must be made by each society, and it will most likely come after the surveillance goes much too far, and a nation's citizens join together to rein in the surveillance.""Dataclysm"" could have been a important work. Instead, I feel that it was superficial and misleading."
22,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4528663-bandit,3,"The social psychologist in me requested this one. All that social data just seemed irresistible. And it is, particularly for a person who abhors social media and is naturally suspicious/cautious/wary of any form of data collecting. And yet, it is unavoidable, every time we make a purchase, take a quiz, log onto a website. So the internet knows us, it really does, the real us, the paranoid worriors (it’s my word and I like it, accept it, Word), the obsessive googlers, the compulsive shoppers. And Rudder is really a perfect candidate to write a book like this, with his Ivy League math degree and OkCupid’s cofounder credentials, the guy knows the data behind the avatars and best of the bunch photos and stock description phrases. So it does make for some very interesting reading and he makes a valid case for and against data collecting, the pros and cons (and both exist) are very much a real part of our lives very fabric, although that always makes me think of those old cotton commercials. By largely abstaining from having online presence (Goodreads being the exception, because if you read you just gotta) I’m probably not actively factoring into this book’s various researches, but then again just reading a book of the science of Data makes me some sort of a statistic and my brain does enjoy the neat orderliness of slotting persons and personalities into their neat orderly boxes. Rudder comes across as a hip nerd, clever and erudite, but the man is a mathematician by education and the book reads like it’s written by one and relies heavily on graphs and charts, so be forewarned. You don’t need a math degree to get through it by any means, it is still after all a work of pop science, but it helps to have a certain predisposition for numbers. And it’s a quick read for what it is, owning in no small way due to the fact that less than 60% of the book is the main text, followed by extensive notes (which I actually read to look for some more factoids and minutiae and even found some) and even more extensive index. In fact, of all the nonfiction I’ve read and I try for at least one or two per month, this book might have had the least content to additional material ratio. Worked for me, because I pretty much got as much on the subject out of it as I cared to, a lot of it not all that surprising, a lot of it refreshers from a social psychology class and a few authentically new and interesting things. The author went with using general data as oppose to individual examples, an honorable choice given the availability of the latter at his fingertips, but it did lead to a more textbook narrative. Still plenty of information for self edifying purposes. And plenty of food for thought, particularly when it comes to surveillance, data collecting and analysis and so on."
23,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32911939-morris,4,"The copy I am reviewing was received through Netgalley from Crown publishing in exchange for an honest review.In “Dataclysm”, Christian Rudder embarks on the mission to bring Big Data to the masses. Big History and Big Economics are popular today, and I think this book is going to achieve the mission with great success.Math is not known for being embraced by many, so Rudder’s work was cut out for him. His subject choices and examples were well-chosen and interesting, and concepts are explained in a way not “dumbed down” too much, but easily understood by anyone wishing to put the effort into learning about them. At a few points it became a bit too dense with information, and that is why I give the book four stars instead of five. I wish four and a half were an option, because while it keeps it from having the ability to capture the attention of any reader who may pick it up, I believe that the author is respecting those who want to truly gain knowledge, thereby making the density not a necessarily bad thing.The facts and writing were both funny and horrifying. One minute I would be laughing at the idea that Belle and Sebastian are the whitest band in America, and the next I was completely uncomfortable with the racism that is inherent in the population as a whole. It’s easy to say “I am not racist”, but quite different when the patterns of a large group are put on display and analyzed and you recognize your own behaviors in there. It’s food for thought, and something most of us are not even conscious that occurs, so the hope that we can now see it on display and work to make changes in our thoughts is a very real one.The most unsettling question raised is whether or not the social gains are worth the privacy we are sacrificing. Since it’s a new field, it’s up to the people to set standards, so learning about it is more than educational or entertaining. Without knowing what is going on, we cannot object or consciously aid in what it’s used for.Also, please be sure to read the author’s notes at the end. He does an excellent job of explaining where and how he got the data, as well as the approaches and controls he used in his research. It’s fascinating and adds the legitimacy numbers often require.If you enjoy facts, data, charts and graphs (the ones in “Dataclysm” are excellent), or are inquisitive in any way I recommend you give this a try. The first couple of chapters may feel a bit overwhelming, but eventually the read becomes easier, and it is well worth the time."

The cofounder and president of OKCupid, has gathered data from that site and other sites, analyzed it, and compiled it into a fascinating book that examines what we share on social media. The result is Dataclysm: Who We Are When We Think No One's Looking.In my workplace, we talk about the fact that people tell us one thing, but their actions say something different. In fact, we're in the process of using a service similar to what stores use to actually examine the actions and behavior of our customers. So, Rudder's book showing analytics that actually tell what is happening, rather than surveying people to see what they say, is intriguing and right in line with what we're doing. Rudder uses all his data to tell ""the human story"", how people behave on sites such as OKCupid and Twitter when they think no one is watching. Before social media, universities studied their students, which slanted the results. Rudder says it even has a name, WEIRD research: white, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. Hardly a good judge of society. But, Rudder claims all of our networks present a better picture of society. He examines his own site to look at how people behave when it comes to sex. Rudder examines beauty and race in the book. The chapter ""Days of Rage"" and the mob reaction on Twitter to some comments was an intriguing chapter. There's discussion of government use of data, as well as the use merchants, banks, and social media makes of it. But, Rudder is an optimist, one who hopes data will ultimately be used for good, as a way to discover what we have in common as humans, as well as a way to reach us as individuals. It's this optimism, coupled with the research and data, that makes Dataclysm a fascinating book. His book ends with a wish, a hope for the future of social media data. ""To use data to know yet not manipulate, to explore but not to pry, to protect and not to smother, to see yet never expose, and, above all, to repay that priceless gift we bequeath to the world when we share our lives so that other lives might be better - and to fulfill for everyone that oldest of human hopes, from Gilgamesh to Ramses to today: that our names be remembered, not only in stone but as part of memory itself."""

Half of the book talks about communication and demographic trends, the other half talks about preferential trends in online dating. His thesis, ""big data is powerful, present, and can tell us more about ourselves,"" might have been revelatory in 2010 but is merely quotidian in 2015.Rudder also says nothing about the data besides how to do the interpretation. While leaving the reader to form his/her own opinion is a respectable editorial decision, it makes for a boring book.Also, this book is not built to last; a snapshot in time, it will become highly anachronistic in 2, 3 years as the data change - as social attitudes change.But I will admit... I appreciated the table on page 167 showing that Asian men really hate misspelling things."

Then they prefer men a few years younger. Men find 20 year old women to be the most attractive--refardless of age (from 20-50 men all find women between 20-24 the most attractive)• Polarizing people get more attention--someone ranked with both very high & beauty ratings will receive more messages than someone with an equal average, but of more middle numbers• The smell of shit is added to perfumes and flowers, making the whole actually smell better• 74 men died of nostalgia in the Civil War (according to army records)• Twitter may actually be improving its users' writing ability--in both word length and density & brevity of ideas• More will be written on Twitter in the next 2 years, than all books ever published• 'God' has been in steady decline since the early 1800s--the word is used only about a third as much now as it was then• The best digital messages are only 40 to 60 characters long• One of the best compatibility questions is 'Do you like scary movies?' Answering the same to this question is more predictive of a successful long term relationship than 'big issues' like religion, politics, and looks• Black and White Quarterbacks perform equally down to the decimal: 81.55 (qb rating)• Zodiac signs have no effect on compatibility at all. Race has less effect than religion, politics, or education• 85% of OkCupid users have gone to college• Women are more 'race-loyal' than men in regards to attraction & relationships• 'White sounding' names get 50% more interviews with the exact same résumé as 'black sounding' names like 'Lakisha or 'Jamal'• On Facebook, every percentile of attractiveness gives a man two friends. It gives a woman three.• Often parents want their daughters to be pretty...but 'not too pretty.' Does anyone imagine limitations on a son?• Obama's race probably cost him 3 to 5 percentage points of the popular vote. The most popular Google search for the n-word in history was in Nov 2008, after he won. • 'Rumor' was a winged roman godess with 100 eyes and 100 mouths who spoke only the most hurtful side of the truth...(at least according to rumor)• The agenda of spreading a rumor is directed more for an audience, rather than the subject of a rumor• The Internet makes us vile creatures (see the 'online disinhibition effect')• The government has the greatest invested interest in tracking negativity. Mathematical models exist which predict the otcome of war, how long it will last, who will win, and how many will die• In 1950, the dawn of television, the American Political Science Association called for more polarization in national politics--the parties had grown too close together, the electorate didn't have clear choices. What made good television then, makes good television now, with 100 times the channels.• We seem to define ourselves as much by what we hate as by what we love• Stereotypes are true: white people self-differentiate themselves by their looks, Asians by their origin country, and Latinos by their music• What we don't talk about can be as illuminating as that which we do• Sex is the single most important grouping humanity has. It has existed forever--long before race or creed. In the US, all men were able to vote before women were. With that said, we are all fundamentally similar, much more so than our differences• The United States is divided: all but 4 presidential elections since 1952 would've flipped had 5% of the electorate changed their minds. Any group of people representing that number is therefore very important politically.• Gay porn searches show homosexuality occurs at the same rate nationwide. In less tolerant places however, gays are just more likely to stay in the closet to avoid persecution• In the US, the most popular Google search that begins with 'Is my husband...' most commonly ends in 'gay?' 'Cheating' comes up 10% less, and 'an alcoholic' occurs 8 times less, 'depressed' 10 times less.• Google Search data is ineffective for estimating the number of lesbians in the country, because straight men looking for porn throw off the data• The government counts everyone who's not married as 'single,' regardless of their actual relationship status• Gay and Straight people are looking for the same things in a relationship according to the numbers• Sexuality is more fluid than we realize: 51% of women and 18% of men have bad, or would like to have a same-sex experience• Who we say we are and how we behave are two separate things• Any nation is an 'Imagined Community'--comprised mostly of fellow numbers you'll never meet, and may share little in common with• The relocation of individuals in india & Southeast Asia, as well as the industrialization reflect England circa 1950, and the US 50 years later--driven by the economy, farmers move to city jobs for higher pay• The UK has 5.9 million security cameras: 1 for every 11 citizens• Search data uncovered drug side effects before they were discovered by the FDA warning system, revealing paroxetine and paravastatin can cause hypoglycemia in patients• Facebook was collecting 500 terabytes of information everyday...back in 2012• If you've ever signed up for a website with a fake zip code or fake birthday, you're a criminal--in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act• A 12 year old visiting newyorktimes.com is a criminal as well--violating their Terms of Service and the working doctrine of the US Department of Justice• Twitter usage by high school grads vs college educated is equal (17 & 18% respectively). Black people have a disproportionate presence on Twitter (nearly two fold: 29% vs 16% among whites). They also have more followers as they tend to follow each other in a reciprocal circle of karma, where most whites use the service just to follow 'big names' that don't follow them back• Blind people are just as racist as the rest of us, showing bias after cueing in on speech patterns"
34,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2007216-peter-derk,3,"I'm an idiot. Because I listened to an audiobook version of a book with a lot of charts and visuals. Not my finest moment. Not my finest several hours.What I like about this book is that it's based on data that's not collected by people putting up fronts or creating a persona. Shit's real. My favorite piece of data was that, relative to other identities, black men talk very little online about Social Distortion. This is definitely a stereotype that should gain some momentum. "
35,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,5,"Summary: One of the best data-driven books I have read. I think the title might be why there are so many haters. He presents a lot of tough issues using a medium ""dating"" that is relatable. Also, you should not try to read this on audiobook. You need to see the graphs. There are a lot of haters that present their background as if that's relevant in some way. It's not. B/c while they typically seem to understand data, they seem to lack reading comprehension skills. What Rudder is presenting is not findings from data work. He's attempting to use data as a backdrop to talk about a host of issues that are relevant in the modern era. The data is simply a view of what one might see. Instead of presenting some other social scientist's work, he's using in-house research, which, incidentally is a larger, better joined, more carefully collected, and larger geographical grouping than what most people have.Even if you find him to be less enlightening than his blog (I don't use twitter)-as some mentioned- I would guess this long-form argument could not be divined from the constraints of that medium of communication. He would have to be even more brilliant than I think he is just from reading this book!! Maybe... the guy is a Harvard grad..... But in case I'm right, below are my notes....p. 14 - ""If Big Data's two running stories have been about surveillance and money, for the last three years I've been working on third: the human story."" ""...as a close second, they're demographers of an unprecedented reach."" P. 15 - He talks about the fact that his purpose is to generalize so he can do his job of bringing people together at scale (not with individual nonsensical exceptions as discussed by A LOT of the haters!). He's trying to understand and infer from the data. And his inference work is wonderful, presenting possible misinterpretations that were tested and reviewed. p. 46 - Actually this entire chapter of how they essentially created a series of studies to demonstrate that variation in attractiveness get you noticed as much as attractiveness does. Freakin' Brilliant!p. 47 - Did not know there was a name to it: ""the Pratfall Effect"" - ""As long as you're generally competent, making a small, occasional mistake makes people think you're more competent. Flaws call out good stuff all the more."" p. 48 - It's better to ""Purposely abandon the middle road."" p. 53 - Regarding NLP work on Twitter...I love the hypothesis that Twitter might be improving its users' writing. This is all amazing stuff as relates to transformations in human language and has application in ways that are ignored even today.""he calculated the typical world length in Hamlet (3.99) and in a collection of Wodehouse's stories (4.05)... both less than the length in his Twitter sample (4.80).""""Comparative linguistics have long traced groups of community through language."" p. 54 - The chart on changing characteristics of speech patterns. The idea being that tribe creation is no longer geographically constrained, AND ALSO, you can catch it in the language used... something that we were NEVER able to do in the past (think Chinese, Cantonese, Mandarin, and the 50+ other dialects). Super nerdy awesome point.p. 62 - ""Sitewide, the copy-and-paste, strategy underperforms the from-scratch messaging about 25%, but in terms of effort-in results-out - it always wins: measuring by replies received to compose a new message each time."" What an awesome thing to take look at. Intriguing when you think about marketing/scaled response composition. p. 82 - Confounders. This is a great way to present this material so often ignored or misunderstood in the field. Generally, this chapter does a great job presenting a series of charts with each of the appropriate analysis points you'd ask in a row. I did not need the written part, but I can see why he has it. I can also see why some who read via audiobooks struggled. It would be hard to understand this book if all you had was the audio.Chapter 7: The Beauty Myth - The whole way he presents it in the context of thinking about his daughter is great. The work that supports it is fantastic. On eating disorders, he describes a possible place to look for solutions to help others....p. 104 ""... but before the behavior was digitized, there was practically no way to get directly at this problem, at least not until visible damage had already occurred. There was only rumor - an ear at the bathroom door, perhaps a parent's sad suspicion.""Chapter 8: p. 106-107. He talks about how b/c people don't tell you their deepest thoughts, you had to really work hard (snoop, catch people unguarded, etc) to figure out what they thought. Then he talks about the truthfulness of search engines like Google. How the mechanism itself is far harder to trick. This is REALLY important to what we think of as the fundamental changes in the types of data we now are able to collect. Chapter 9: There were a number of criticisms I read that lead back to this chapter and I think it might just have been unclear how to read the charts as well to think about it. That's a fair point. I think what he's trying to say is even in words there is racial signaling on both sides. If we think about the words we use to attract others and identify tribe, in the context of dating it's super apparent. For me, then I think about how this relates to concepts like code-switching in the workplace. We focus a lot on the accent, and we know vocabulary matters. But this implies something far deeper. If you read each of the lists and you clearly identify with one group, it's likely, you are farther culturally from other groups than just skin color. This is quite profound on anyone working on things like ""How do we create a single human race without such aberrant division."" Word. p. 155 - If you care at all about gay rights, these stats are important and also very sad. If I've got him correct- and these are the footnotes, we're underestimating the gay population of the US by a lot and most are NOT dating b/c they are socially unable to do so, either because they are in the closet and scared to be themselves or there are structural reasons in their community that prevent them from self-expression. Chapter 12- Great segue into the work on migration, which covers not an only lifestyle choice but also works availability and more. This work is really relevant for - what is not mentioned, the dying cities phenomenon. p. 181 - He's arguing against things like Klout scores. This is why I do not understand the arguments that he doesn't want to drill in or he's missing some sort of causality.. he's not. This book is about what the general number are telling you out of various inferences that are possible.p. 184 - Mountain Dew Story. A great example of what not to crowdsource.p. 186 - ""If employers begin to use algorithms to infer how intelligent you are or whether you use drugs, then your only choice will be to game the system - or to borrow the wording from the previous chapter, 'manage your brand.' To beat the machine, you must act like a machine, which means you've lost to the machine. And that's assuming you can guess what you're supposed to do in the first place. Apparently, one of the strongest correlates to intelligence in the research was liking 'curly fries.' Who could reverse engineer that?p. 187 - very intersting comments on survellience and data use by the government. p. 193 - He talks about the pennies from personal data payments will not amount ot anything that actually helps people. Moreover, it is highly likely to just be passed back through to consumers."
36,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3925847-gerri-leen,3,"This book is super interesting but I wish there were a little more ""there"" there. I only got to 60% before the book was over and the notes began (and on a Kindle flipping back and forth is, for me, a pain). Also meat-wise, I was expecting something along the lines of Outlers, which of course this is the opposite of in theme since it looks at the trends of all and not the accomplishments of a few. But I wanted it to be a book I remembered long after. It's really not. Although it's an interesting read while you're in it. Big Data, when it matures, means so much info that will be longitudinal, something data analysts struggle with ever getting enough of, so in that sense this is very exciting, and it's amazing what we can tell already from the little we have.I do think the book suffered mightily by being read on a Kindle (or any e-reader, especially black and white). The graphs used red and it was not always easy to tell what was gray because it was red and what was gray because it was gray--or if anything was really gray. Since much of this book runs off the graphs, that it's a bad thing not to be able to fully read them (and at the size they were at on my Paperwhite, I also felt challenged to really dive in). I did love reading that the author was a disciple of sorts of Tufte. And I appreciated the amount of info given in the charts.I had a hard time getting through the first chapter. I think the author left out a primary reason male and female reactions to potential partners' age might change (or not) over time depending on gender--and normally I'd give him a break on this since it's from another field of study, but since he runs an online dating site and is reporting on that robust data set, then I'd expect him to understand the drives of men (be drawn to young and fertile no matter how old they get) and women (pick a good provider--until she reaches a certain age, realizes she is not going to need a provider (either because she does not have kids or because she provides just fine for herself), and then go for something young and fun). This behavior has been well documented and while I thought he was going to touch on it at one point, it really didn't happen enough for me to ever get that comfortable with the first example out of the gate. That said, I didn't have that issue with the rest of the book, so I did keep going and many of the sections were novel and interesting."
37,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24217018-matt,3,"This is a very quick read which, given the number of visuals, is not surprising. The visuals, though, are beautiful, always tell a story, and never waste a drop of ink on unnecessary information. These images reflect the book...for the most part. It's when the narrative steers away from its stated purpose (a data driven exploration of human nature) that I started to tire of Christian Rudders narrative voice. It's funny, irreverent, and insightful for most of the book and especially for the sections discussing OkCupid data. He writes best about the data he knows best and that's not surprising. But as the book advances Rudder starts to draw on unfamiliar datasets, make less rigorous assertions, and veer into both data fear-mongering and data evangelism. It was disappointing mostly because he promised to write a different kind of book than those which use data as a lens to prove the downfall of society or privacy, or predict incredible advances in technology and public intelligence. He asserts this book is special then proceeds to speculate about how invasive the NSA can be, how Twitter is unleashing our base instincts but also improving our vocabulary, and how online branding is the future of self evaluation. These parts were, in truth, boring compared to the insights about romantic relationship. In summary, I'm not sure where this book fits in the social science and statistics cannon. It's not the most insightful or the most fun, which leaves it somewhere in between and probably only worth picking up if you love the genre. "
38,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35538316-lindy,3,"I feel like I write this in every nonfiction book review, but I wished there was more depth! I also wished someone more, I don't know, anthropologically minded had given this book a once over before publication. For example, Rudder treats data showing that bisexual men are more likely to prefer/message other men on OkCupid when compared to older bisexual men as if it were longitudinal, and implies that bi men's sexual preferences change as they get older. However he does not take into account what these men may be doing off the service; a young bisexual man will probably hit on women at a bar, but is at a considerably greater risk of being decked in the face if he were to do so to men. As the dating pool grows smaller with age, he may turn to the internet to scope out both genders. (To be fair, Rudder  does responsibly account for a similar phenomenon showing that North Dakotans are surprisingly liberal when it comes to causual sex in the next chapter and why that isn't the case.) Likewise, Rudder says that ""yass,"" which turns up in a list of words distinctive of popular twitter users, is a contraction of ""your ass."" This is true, but it's definitely not the most popular use. Nonetheless, Dataclysm is an interesting and accessible book, and I imagine it would be especially so to someone with no background in statistics. I appreciated that the author had a sense of humor, and I don't think (reading in 2017) that it has aged poorly, although it would have been helpful if Rudder had cited years in the text rather than simply ""last year."""
39,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33131867-neha,3,"I had seen a significant portion of the material before on the blog, but it's still worth a read. I loved the informal voice, and the use of various graphs to illustrate new findings. It read like a collection of smaller articles with specific results.A lot of the OkCupid data revealed particular preferences of men and women in terms of age, attractiveness, and ethnicity. I can understand why the overall findings may be upsetting, and I think readers should be cautious about how this actually applies to their lives. This book is not trying to give insider tips for finding more dates. I think it's very important to remember that there is an inherent selection bias in the OkCupid data: it only represents people who have, for one reason or another, decided to try online dating.I thought the book was going to be more about OkCupid's dataset, but I appreciated the discussions about Google, Facebook, and Twitter data. The last chapter describes the ongoing conflict of privacy that is absent from earlier chapters. While giving users complete ownership of their data may seem to solve many problems, I tend to disagree that it's entirely possible. Services can certainly provide an option for users to remove their data from the site, but once data is on the Internet, I think it's safe to assume that it will never fully disappear."
40,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11500849-jen,1,"A sloppy and irresponsible introduction to big data analytics. Taking a popular science approach, the book glosses over key tenets of every day data science, like basic hypothesis testing. It also makes grand, sweeping generalizations about society as a whole where none can be made based on the population of the data (OK Cupid members hardly represent a random sampling of the US population).Some of the more egregious statements include ""There are times when a data set is so robust that if you set up your analysis right, you don't need to ask questions - it just tells you everything anyway"" and ""people are already compensated for their data: They get to use services like Facebook and Google...for free.""Putting the author's disregard of personal privacy aside, the narrative voice is filled with white male privilege. A few sections of the book made me generally uncomfortable in its approach to conversations about race, gender, and heterosexual relationships. We need a book about data science that highlights the process in a way that digital users can understand how their data is being analyzed and who is doing it responsibly. This is not it."
41,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1492668-mark,3,"You are concerned that the NSA is aggregating data and spying on you? If you check, or look at a picture of the NSA (Why does an office building need a radar dome on the roof?), you will see that has always been their job. But while you are worrying about that, you are telling scores of commercial data aggregators everything about yourself, just by what you search for on Google, what you like on Facebook and where you access the internet from. Your sex, your race, your sexual orientation, your income, your politics, your IQ (from the type of French fries you like), it's all an open book. This book is the story from one involved nerd, along with some nice graphics.People's activities are somewhat limited, so the use of this data is mostly to target you for repression or elimination in a repressive society, to sell you something in a capitalist society, or for law enforcement to find you. So if you're only getting targeted Amazon ads, be happy.Of course, I can only imagine what the data will be used for after Skynet becomes active."
42,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/140018-kyle,2,"Readable, with nice diagrams, this is a hard book to hate. It is easy to be irritated by it, however. The basis of the book is a dozen or so interesting statistical points, with a chapter of conversational description for each. I'm curious where these statistical insights actually come from. Did the author pore over data for months? It doesn't feel that way. They have the feeling of nuggets gleaned from interns working over a period of years, that never ended up being useful anywhere else. Certainly, the discussion the author offers almost no isights beyond the immediately obvious. It isn't clear enough to be a good introduction to statistics, nor in-depth enough to offer interest to statisticians.The best chapters are the early ones oriented towards anyone trying to game the system a little on dating sites. How long message should be, what the opposite sex is looking for for someone your age, etc. The later chapters, trying to offer larger insights about culture and language are ... not convincing. Problematic, even."
43,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78503-chris,3,"This book has some great perspective on human behavior derived from data sets culled from many websites. It celebrates the fact that the amount of data that we have on people's actual beliefs and desires (as opposed to their stated beliefs) and breaks down what a lot of these data sets mean. A lot of it is very funny, even while it may be disturbing in its implications.For the first two-thirds, it was really interesting to me and had a lot of, if not surprising, at least very relevant things to say about human behaviors.The last third kind of drifted off into parts of the data that I am not too concerned with personally and the author's thoughts on what the future will be. It is not necessarily bad, just not what I was looking for, and also, a bit more broad than the particulars of the earlier chapters. "

Race, identity and the many differences between women and men in their approach to sex and relationship are shown here through data from an online dating website (OkCupid). I think the book presents valuable insights about racism because it observes actually behavior rather than self-reported questions.Some of the interesting book's find is the following:* Both black men and black women are strongly rejected in online dating* The women who received more attention of men aren't the more beautiful but those who have the high variance in their ratings (men can't say if they are beautiful or not).* Most people (~90%) who declare themselves bisexual is indeed heterosexual or homosexual.* Straight women are less propense to search only casual sex in online datingA negative thing is that the book contains a lot of digressions."

The possibilities of big data seem scary and exciting at the same time. This book presents them in a very accessible way to the average reader. I was skeptical of some the conclusions that the author presented but there's a lot of good conversation starters here. However, I don't think much of it will stick with me in the long run.I probably didn't make the best choice by listening to this on audiobook where numbers in charts were read out for minutes hahaOverall, a short, enjoyable, and timely read if you want to delve into popular science books."
46,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3440334-fred-forbes,2,"Making my way through some interesting observations generated by ""OK Cupid"" and other ""big data"" sites, I hit a section marked ""Coda"" where he went on to comment on the process used to generate the data illustrations, followed by notes, acknowledgements, and an index. Thought I was halfway through the book but had actually finished. Note sure whether the lack of mathematical analysis is a blessing or not - I guess that would depend on how capable the writer is - but much of the content, while interesting is a ""firm grasp of the obvious."""

This was a highly enjoyable-to-read, interesting-to-think-about, pop-data/analytics book. I appreciated the author's voice and sense of humor, but he often ventured into preachy territory. For someone to write so extensively on data that illuminates our biases, I wish he could have taken more care to hide his own."

49,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8886042-michelle,2,"Dataclysm: Who We Are When We Think No One's Looking by Christian Rudder is an interesting and fact filled book. I received an Advance Reader's Copy from Crown Publishing, a division of Random House and my opinions were formed by my reading of this uncorrected proof. Author Christian Rudder is one of the founders of the dating website OKCupid and he draws his research for this book primarily from the data that has been collected from paying members who are looking for relationships. He additionally mines data from other social media resources, dating services like Match.com and websites, and his pool of subjects include a cross section of the population that he believes is an excellent barometer for the opinions of Americans today. This book is filled with charts and maps and images to help you easily understand the data he has sourced and how it applies to the ""everyman"" in all of us.This book approaches a wide variety of topics - relationships, personal preferences, age, gender, race and upbringing and tries to answer the question ""Who are we really?"" by examining what we say versus how we act. Although I felt like I came away with a bunch of quotable tidbits and an interesting peek into how the data that we so freely place on the internet is used, I'm not quite sure that I learned very much about myself from this book. Many of the observances seemed rational to me and not all that thought provoking, and although some applied to me I didn't walk away feeling like I had much personal insight. A few of the passages left me feeling uneasy, simply because I'm not sure all the members of OKCupid were willing test subjects in Mr. Rudder's data laboratory. In one memorable instance photos of users were shown in an illustration of women who had very high and very low scores from fellow users in terms of their appeal. Although he was using them to make a point about the importance of having a photo that provokes a strong reaction is better than having a commonly pretty picture (which he describes as ""meh"") and he expressly thanks the subjects for their consent to be included in the book and to have their photos discussed, it still felt mildly squicky. Although the many other charts and illustrations in the book didn't deal in this same very personal representation of data, I did question the author's use of the OKCupid site at times. Although it may all be perfectly legal it makes me ask ""do I need to know this?"" and ""is the use of this data justified in a bigger, insight gaining way that makes it important to a reader?"" I'm not sure I have the answer to those questions.  As a collection of facts and data there were definitely a few things I hadn't thought about before - for example, there is a chart showing the 100 most common words used in the English language today from the Oxford English Corpus (a collection of modern writing's approach to vocabulary and word use) versus the top 100 used to express yourself on Twitter in the form of the service's 140 character tweet posts. It showed that although you may think the language of Twitter would somewhat abbreviate or diminish your ideas to get your point across, actually a person composing a tweet is much more selective and thoughtful about what their words will convey. It may help us to write clearer and in a concise style that contributes to an overall awareness of language. That awareness filters into the speech and style of a Twitter user versus a non-user. I liked the idea that my tweeting may help me generate a better and more vivid use of language. Still I kept returning to the fact that this book didn't really live up to the ""portrait of our essential selves"" claim that it was intended to be. It isn't a bad book. I just wish that I had a greater takeaway as a reader.One thing that truly irked me about this book is the mention of a website link where you could go, punch in your own data (two Facebook usernames) and get a personal illustration to see one of the ideas in this book in action. In the fourth chapter titled ""You Gotta be the Glue"" there is an illustration showing the overlap of the author's Facebook friends and his wife's friend's. He explains in depth how we create clusters of people in our lives that know us from a specific point of view - our work friends, childhood acquaintances, family members etc. Our spouse or significant other can overlap our Facebook friendships in many categories. Perhaps you are both friends with your parents and share relationships with other couples you met while you both attended a ballroom dance lesson. The shared connections can illustrate the bonds we have as couples, and can show you the places in your relationships that have a strong and meaningful connection. I thought this sounded really cool and was happy to find an example that could be personalized to me and allowed me to be a willing participant in the experiment to see how it felt. Unfortunately this awesome personalized tool simply doesn't exist. I have tried the link dozens of times over the past few weeks and didn't post my thoughts on the book since I wanted to see this chart in action, but it still gives me a ""Page Not Found"" message. The book's publication date is set for Tuesday September 9th, and since this is Saturday the 6th I would think that it would be active. I hope it will go live on Tuesday at the very least. I contacted the author through his Twitter page about the lack of a working link and received no response, however another reviewer on Goodreads said that when they contacted him through email they received a response that it would be functional by the end of August. If I had paid for this book rather than receiving an ARC I would be even more disappointed. The one big opportunity to gain personal insight is so far, a bust.If you find the sort of data in this book interesting I would check it out of the library or wait for the book to be marked down. I wouldn't consider it a must read but I am thankful I had the opportunity to read it. I hope you find this useful information, and I will update my opinion if the link works on the publication date. For now I can only give this book 2 of 5 stars. "
50,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5177572-genevieve,4,"* Originally reviewed on the Night Owls Press blog here. *First, it was the Internet. The Internet was going to change how businesses and organized operated. It was going to change how people live. But now something else has enthralled our imagination: big data.What is big data? We couldn't have big data without the Web. Our shift to online activity has made it easier to record and document massive reams of data and data trails about seemingly everything: Where do we go when we're online? What do we do? What do we read? The idea behind big data is that scientists can analyze that activity and parse out that information, information that might predict what we would do in hypothetical situations, or what we would be likely to do in the future. This largely possible because of scale. It's not about analyzing a person, a hundred people, or a thousand people; it's about waves and waves of information, millions and millions of data points.Think about how far we've come. In the third century BC, the first great repository of human knowledge was the Library of Alexandria. Today information is available in the exabytes. (What is an exabyte? Um...it's really, really big.) Big data is about size, but it's more than that. It's the fact that we have computers and databases that will log and analyze micro-activities, actions as simple as Facebook ""likes,"" our location recorded by the GPS in our phones, and the ""number of seconds or minutes spent reading a web page.""Dataclysm Who We Are When We Think No One's Looking by Christian Rudder sheds light on what that kind of datafication looks like. Rudder himself is the cofounder of OkCupid, the online dating site, which lives and breathes on seemingly mystical algorithms that dice and chop up streams of data. No other person might be more qualified to give us an insider's account on what big data can do.Rudder dabbles in statistical, psychological, and sociological theories and drills the chapters with clever infographics and beautifully rendered scatterplots—and some of them are truly works of art. (I used to work in data so I have a soft spot for data scientists and their work.) But where Rudder really excels is in the smorgasbord of findings. Patterns emerge from the data. Stare into the matrix and you'll see...a mirror into your very soul. At least that's what Rudder wants us to believe.You might be put off by Rudder's focus on dating sites but that's his métier. The trove of information on social interactions alone on dating sites is weirdly fascinating. In one example, Rudder finds that dating profiles of women who have a polarizing physical appearance are more likely to be approached for dates than the conventionally attractive person. (Is it fascination with novelty? boredom with the same 'ole, same 'ole?) Aren't we all at our most earnest and neurotic when it comes to love and relationships?A downside of this book is that if you read or pay attention to the tech news cycle, you may find some of Rudder's examples ho-hum repeats. For example, we've seen Google Trends tackle the flu in a kind of digital epidemiology approach. Nothing new there. Rudder retells these stories not to just fill the pages though but to constantly keep the beat of this book, which is asking deeper questions about who are we as a culture?Another downside is that even with all the reams of data and stats Rudder throws at us, ultimately, these are just cool factoids. It's an impressive avalanche of interesting data tidbits, but still just tidbits. The next challenge for big data: figuring out what truly matters, narrowing it down, cutting the noise.The heart of what makes big data interesting is that it's research that isn't gathered merely from surveys or interviews or even randomized control trial experiments, which we all know can be biased for a variety of reasons: subjects don't understand the questions, subjects lie, people obfuscate, they unconsciously modify their behavior to please researchers. Here the data is based on actual behavior in situ. And we can learn something from it, we can see patterns and discern behaviors that were otherwise invisible. It's like studying people in the wild.Most books about data are dry and boring, but Dataclysm is one that makes a mark. Part of this is Rudder staying grounded in primary data and real analysis. But an even bigger part is Rudder's never-stale writing style. Yes, the book is still pop-social science. This might frustrate a few bona fide data scientists out there. But Dataclysm works. The amusing stories and asides sprinkled throughout the book are full of zest but are never fluffy. For a numbers person, a Harvard-honed math-y guy working in Silicon Valley, Dataclysm is a remarkably fluid and readable book.Big data isn't the answer to the universe, the meaning of life, or to your other burning existential questions, but you'll still become privy to some interesting discoveries about culture and society.[Disclaimer: I received this book from Blogging for Books for an honest and candid review.] "
51,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57978224-yanick-punter,2,"Life is short, so i read this fast ."
52,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16880570-khari,1,"Three months.Three months to listen to a book seven and a half hours long. Normally I can get one of those out in a week. Nope. Three months.I'm really tired of these books with fascinating titles that just disappoint.This book made me understand why people shout 'Science' at each other. It's because authors like this either underestimate their audience and dumb down what they have done, or they have terrible methodologies themselves and don't even realize it.For a book about data which necessarily must include statistics, there is a shocking dearth of statistic lingo in this book. He tries to justify himself in the end. His intention was to write a popular science book and he didn't want to clutter it with jargon like 'p', and 'confidence interval' and fun stuff like that. And, hey, I get it. I don't completely understand statistics yet, but even I know that words like 'significant' have a particular meaning that has to be defined in the world of numbers, but he never defines his terms. He says the methodology he used was 'rigorous' and it went through something 'like peer review' but never defines what his methodology was, and his 'peer review' was for his underling (who he knew btw) to check his numbers. That's not peer review. Hate to break it to you. Peer review is done by someone who does not know who wrote the paper, and they look over the whole paper, including the hypotheses and the conclusions as well as the number. It's not someone whose job is in your hands checking your math. But I know why he chose to do it this way. It's because there is no way on this planet that this atrocity would have ever been published in a good scientific journal....wait...let me rephrase that. Considering that there have been cases of complete hoax papers being published it is remotely possible that it could have been published in a badly edited, badly curated, motivated reasoning filled journal. Because that's what this was. Badly edited, badly curated, filled with motivated reasoning, and worst of all, terrible methodology that is never explained. This book couldn't hack it in the scientific publishing world so he had to go to a subsidiary of Penguin, Crown Publishing, that focuses on hobbies, memoirs, biographies, autobiographies, cooking, lifestyle, business and nonfiction. And honestly, that makes a ton of sense, because this reads more like a memoir than a book of scientific rigor. He makes unfounded claims, presents his interpretation as fact, and only considers one explanation for everything that he finds interesting.The part that absolutely killed me was he is talking about corpus linguistics. Corpus linguistics is gathering really large bodies of texts and making it searchable. There are a bunch of free ones out there, such as the Corpus of Contemporary American English (affectionately known as COCA), for your perusal. They have a bunch of ways of analyzing, you can look at the most used words, you can look at the collocations (the words immediately preceding and following a word), you can look at the word families that are used, the lexemes that are used, the type of word that most appears, the contexts in which words appear, which is a really good way to find out what a word actually means in use, in contrast to how it is defined in the dictionary. Corpus linguistics just happens to be my baby. It was my focus in my master's program and it's my focus in my PHD program. And guess what? I know nothing about it. I've already spent three years learning about it, and I'm going to go spend another 2-6, and I've read peer-reviewed articles about it, talked to experts, and read books about it, and I still know nothing, but I know enough to know that how he's using it is mind bogglingly bogus. He basically does character counting. He counts how many words show up in a tweet, calculates the mean character length, then compares it to the mean character length in Shakespeare and concludes that since the mean character length in tweets is longer, people today are using language in a more nuanced way than Shakespeare was....mean character length. Or his other technique was to make a word list of the most used words and show that it was similar to Shakespeare because 'the' and 'a' appeared at the top. No duh Sherlock, they're function words. They happen to be required every time you are referring to a singular noun. They would show up at the top of the word list of this review as well and that would mean nothing about the similarity between reviews and tweets. They are different registers who both follow the rules of the English language, ergo, functional words such as articles and pronouns and prepositions would occur more often simply because they are closed classes that are requisite for forming phrases that make sense.So there you go, a very brief, cogent rebuttal for one of his most important methods of analysis. But that rebuttal is actually rebutting his intention, not what he actually did. What he actually did was include, on his erstwhile 'word' list, things like 'the', 'a', ''s', 'Peru' 'my blue eyes', 'tall for an Asian', etc. .........How, in the name of all that is grounded in the study of linguistics, can those things be defined as 'words'?!?!? What definition is he using?!? He isn't using one! He's just conglomerating everything that he finds interesting together and calling it a 'word' while not even recognizing that what he finds interesting is subjective! It's not a parameter by which to define something! At first I was like, huh, is he using morphemes as the basis of his 'word'? ""'s"" would be the the third person possessive morpheme, I can see that, after all 'the' 'a' and 'Peru' are all single morpheme words. But then you have 'my blue eyes' that's not a word, that's a phrase! All of the words in that phrase aren't even single morpheme words! So why on earth does the third person possessive deserve its own place of glory but the plural 's' does not!?!This is the problem with popular 'science' books. People read them, feel like they are now informed and use the same arguments that they read about without ever realizing that the books aren't science. There is no scientific method in this book. He never defines his terms, he barely defines his variables. He has a million variables, and doesn't distinguish between them. It's not an experimental study so it's fine that he doesn't have a control group, but he should be trying to make the groups that he is splitting people into as uniform as possible and he doesn't even really attempt it. His variables are men and women, black, white, Asian, and Hispanic. He never even limited his findings to people from the USA. He just assumed that everyone was. He never factored in educational status which would have a huge impact, and that information actually is in the data set, so he could have, but he didn't. He didn't even mention it as a confound! And that's just the point. Everything is a conclusion for him. He argued that there are certain topics that are anathema to certain groups because the word denoting that topic only appears once. No. It does not mean that they are anathema to that group. I can think of a dozen reasons why someone would choose not to put something that they are interested in onto a public forum. I am pretty sure that an Otolaryngologist is not going to put that as their profession on OKCupid, simply because most people don't know what that means, they are just going to go with 'doctor' because it's simpler and gets the point across. That doesn't mean that otolarynogology is a taboo subject because it's only mentioned once. And besides, the fact that it is mentioned at all is already proof positive that it is not a taboo subject, taboo subjects are epitomized by never being mentioned at all and referred to circularly. So why didn't he mention all the other terms that are never mentioned, like muons and antileptons? (No, I don't know what those are either). The self-introductions on OKCupid (which is what he studied) are texts designed to elicit a certain response. They are a specific register, a register that each writer assumes will be the most likely to get them what they want, a date. As such they are inherently not generalizable to populations as a whole. They are only generalizable as 'the words that people use to try and present themselves as a satisfactory date'. There is a purpose behind it and it shows only a very small subset of language use, taking it to mean that it epitomizes someone's character and identity is horrifying. People change how they talk constantly. They talk differently when they write as compared to when they speak. They talk differently depending on if they know their audience or not. They talk differently depending on the power dynamics of the situation. They talk differently depending on how they are feeling at the moment. Studying the language used in self-introductory texts on OKCupid is very interesting and a worthwhile subject in and of itself, but you cannot generalize out to the public. The people on OKCupid are not a random selection of people, they are self-selected to be rather outgoing, not so privacy concerned, not willing to spend their money on web-dating, mostly singly people who are interested in romantic liaisons. They are, according to his own admission of the data, mostly liberal and progressive, mostly college educated, those account for 31% and 34% of the US population respectively. That is not even broken down by sex or race, if I were to spend the time doing that it would show an even smaller portion of the population for each, you can't generalize out to everyone else in the US based on a sub population. That would be like saying 50% of the population of the US are women, and women generally score higher in compassion, therefore the US is a compassionate nation...what? That doesn't even make sense.Finally, the thing that really just made me crack up was when he said ""and I say this as someone who is reflexively critical of the left."" That made me die. Why, why did that make me die? Because it doesn't mean what you think it means. It doesn't mean that he automatically looks at what people on the left say critically. It doesn't mean that his automatic response is to be skeptical. It means to embrace your subjective understandings of reality as a basis for analyzing social interactions. Being reflexively critical is a tenet of feminist post-structuralist analysis, or you could also argue that it is a postmodern, post-Marxist analysis as well. Regardless of who you decide is the ultimate progenitor of such an idea, it remains an ideology of the left. By using it he showed that he was on the left. By trying to present himself as a balanced and disinterested analyzer he showed himself to be controlled by a particular worldview."
53,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51602586-dominika,4,"A good soft introduction on data analysis, particularly in regards to human interaction. I thought it was fun and simple enough for the layman, but not simple to the point that it's lying about the capacity of what big data can do (as an example, I deal with a lot of research participants who do not have an email or do not use their email often). I really appreciated him talking about the limitations, as well as some qualitative methods and how they can be used. The whole point of all this is to see how our private, online behavior is actually a great insight into the human condition. Like how the rate of gay porn consumption is the same across every state, and what factors are important to each racial group. I know I made this sound super boring but it isn't. "

You might not even be too surprised, if they started to learn what music people probably like, by the way they dress, speak, or act (although it would be impressive). But, what if they had hundreds of thousands, or tens of millions of customers a day? How much would they learn about what music people like, if they could somehow deal with that many customers a day?What if, instead of a music store, people came to your store to find something more personal, like a girlfriend or boyfriend?Welcome to the book Dataclysm, where one of the founders of the website OkCupid shows us just what every website you ever use is able to tell about you. That's slightly an exaggeration, of course; dating websites do get a view of us that is a little different than most. But then, Amazon sees you when you put your money where your mouth is. Google sees what you're trying to find, or find out about, or where you're finding directions to. Facebook, of course, probably knows who your real friends are better than what you are willing to admit out loud.If you get creeped out easily by the loss of secrecy (otherwise known as ""privacy"", when it's secrecy that we like) that comes from using the Internet, this is probably not the book for you.However, if you like to leaven your opinions about topics like race (and racism) and sex (and sexism) with some actual data (not just your own personal experience), this book is a revelation. Here is a more or less randomly picked sampling of what you get in this book, not just presented as an assertion, but backed up with mountains of data:1) racism against blacks in America is not just real and enduring, but is equally rampant among Asians and Hispanic Americans as among Anglos2) Asian-Americans on dating sites use a uniquely low number of misspelled words compared to all other ethnicities3) men do not give up trying to date that 20-year old woman until they are over 30, whereas the man who looks best to a 20-year old woman is likely to be around 234) men do not give up trying to date that 30-year old woman until they are over 40, whereas the man who looks best to a 30-year old woman is likely to be around 305) of self-identified straight women on OkCupid, 26% said they had a sexual encounter with a woman, and enjoyed it (more than 3 times the analogous percentage of self-identified straight men)6) by just looking at your ""likes"" on Facebook, you can determine with 60% accuracy whether or not someone is the child of parents who got divorced before they turned 21 (this was in 2012, and the algorithms have probably gotten only better since then)7) women who get a lot of 1's and 5's (out of 5) on their picture, are more likely to get messaged, than women who get a lot of 3's, even though the average opinion of their looks is the sameIf you are online, there are servers (computers that serve up websites to your desktop, laptop, or smartphone) which know quite a lot about you and the others in the society you live in. The people you really don't want to have this kind of information, already have it. The only question is, will you? If knowledge is power, then right now there is a profound imbalance of power being created by this much data. Christian Rudder has done us the favor of showing us what he has (aggregated, of course, so that no individual is identifiable). Take a look."
55,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4579658-rob-kitchin,2,"The stated aim of Dataclysm is to introduce lay readers to the era of big data, the possibilities of such data, and the types of analysis used to make sense of them. The problems with the book start with the title and subtitle, neither of which, I think, make much sense. Dataclysm, Rudder explains, is a play on cataclysm: the wiping away of one era to be replaced by a new one. However, big data is set to complement small data, not wipe them away as small data are generated to answer specific questions rather than being a by-product that is then repurposed, and most big data are held by private corporations or government and are not readily open to researchers. All of the data that Rudder analyzes is from social media; they are data produced precisely because we think someone is looking (for a date, for conversation, for information, to provoke a reaction, etc). Uploading information to the internet is largely a process of the presentation of the self, as Goffman’s famous theory would frame the activity. Even if other people cannot see the answers to direct questions, as when filling in questions on a dating site, the answers shape the user profile and the process of matching -- something that users are aware of, consider and present to.The book then proceeds by discussing social media data and what they might reveal about human behaviour and society. Crucially, however, there is no systematic discussion of big data per se, its forms and characteristics, no discussion of data analytics, and only a cursory discussion of the many ethical, social and political implications of such data. There is no discussion of statistics, or statistical tests performed on the data presented, nor data mining, data analytics, machine learning, pattern recognition, profiling, prediction, etc. The irony here is that Rudder’s company – OkCupid – employs these techniques to be able to process and match potential partners, yet he never explains how this is achieved. Instead, the entire analysis is rooted in the empiricist form of data science, rather than data-driven science, and never proceeds beyond description. As such, the analysis of gender and race he presents are based on a ‘letting the data speak for themself’ approach and constitutes armchair interpretation. He barely engages with the vast academic literature on quantitative analysis of race and gender that has taken place for several decades using large data sets such as the census or public administration data. Rudder has access to an enormous set of very interesting data that could be used to conduct some fascinating sociological and psychological analysis. Instead what we get are a series of descriptive statistics and banal revelations, most of which are already well established. The result is a book that hints at the potential of big data and data science but undersells it substantially, and it under-estimates in my view the readership level of its potential audience by never progressing beyond mathematics and data visualisations used in junior school. In contrast, books such as The Signal and the Noise by Nate Silver provide a much wider and deeper discussion. This is a shame as Rudder is an engaging writer and he has privileged access to an extremely rich social data that could be used to conduct some wonderful and sophisticated social science research. Such rich research and its policy implications are barely hinted at."
56,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8684527-andra-n,5,"I postponed reading Dataclysm for some time, but I’m glad I took my time to read it. Its author, Christian Rudder first caught my attention in an article written after the Facebook scandal over the experiments made over its users, where he explained in a rather unapologetic manner, that this is the very nature of internet’s success and efficiency increase. His opinion is a consequence of his experience running the dating site OkCupid where decisions based on people’s behavior must be made in order to obtain optimal results. “It’s a delicate illusion, the Internet.”Dataclysm is a book about Big Data and Romantic behavior. However, it is definitely not a recipe for making a perfect profile or having more success on social networks. This book is rather a series of conclusions drawn from the aggregated data obtained from millions of interactions mainly from sites like OkCupid and other social networks or Google. This is not the story of the individual, it is the story of the collective. What distinguishes the work of Christian Rudder is that given his privileged position at OKCupid, he had in hand large amounts of data with which he could play and analyze freely. As opposed to other studies of human behavior that have as subjects mostly a bunch of students from well-known universities, his data sets contain personal information of people of all ages and races, from the US. This book has lots of pop-culture references, amusing and sometimes insightful comments. What is most intriguing about his studies is the fact that they are made over information that we rather think it is private. We get a glimpse of our rather politically incorrect behaviors as human beings.I found particularly interesting the comparison between woman preferences and man preferences when it comes to a potential partner’s age, attractiveness and race. Humor is not left out of the book, as the paragraph depicting women ratings of attractiveness of men: “Only one guy in six is “above average” in an absolute sense. Sex appeal isn’t something commonly quantified like this, so let me put it in a more familiar context: translate this plot to IQ, and you have a world where the women think 58 percent of men are brain damaged.”The comparison of words most commonly used by people on their dating profiles from different races or sexual orientation was also a chapter that I found quite interesting. The author shows via text analysis that several race related patterns emerge. “White people differentiate themselves mostly by their hair and eyes, Asians by their country of origin, Latinos by their music. But because of the way the math is set up, the three non-white lists are evidence of cultures that I, as a white man, am not supposed to know…the gay male list is very different from the other three. It’s full of pop culture and has comparatively few references to the user’s immediate person and family.”I would definitely recommend this book that tackles a wide range of topics to anyone who is interested in data science as well as those curious about the weirdness of human nature."
57,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18688-cody,4,"Much e-ink has been spilled--rightfully so--about the brave new world we live online. Targeted advertising, data breaches, the NSA; it’s easy to grow overwhelmed by the potential dangers of sharing personal information electronically. Practically everything we do on our phones and computers is tracked, often in an effort to sell us something or gain some upper hand (financially, politically, socially, etc.). Consequentially, there is now an unprecedented amount of detailed data about us that's ripe for the parsing.Beyond the obvious advantages for market research, is there a benefit to all of this data? Christian Rudder, co-founder of the online dating site OkCupid, thinks so. He’s been approaching the internet over the past decade as one big sociological experiment, and his new book, Dataclysm: Who We Are (When We Think No One’s Looking), explores his findings in depth, some of which are rather mind blowing.Penned in clear and witty prose and full of colorful charts and graphs, Dataclysm breezes by, though many of the insights linger, obsess, and often unsettle. We learn that if you apply network analysis to a couple’s groups of friends on Facebook, you can quite accurately predict how likely they are to stay together. And that Google searches beginning with the phrase “Is my husband…” most commonly end with “gay?” And that women tend to find men who are close to their age as the most attractive, whereas men, up until 50 years old, generally think that women in their early 20s look the best.Even in cases where the results reinforce long held views, what is new, Rudder asserts, “is our ability to test ideas, established ones, famous ones even, against the atomized actions of millions.” But the implications go beyond the sheer volume of the numbers. The ability we now have to track Google searches and site clicks provides us with much more accurate data, as these behaviors transcend the murkier self-reporting that plagues more traditional surveys, especially in regards to controversial topics. Rudder argues that the insights gleaned from all of this new data, even when the results are unflattering, are too beneficial to pass up, as they give us a far clearer and more accurate portrait of our true interests and behaviors.As Rudder frequently admits, the internet is still very young, which means that these data sets lack a long view. What Dataclysm does offer us, though, is another angle from which to consider our online lives. Whether you find the book’s content and approaches revelatory or creepy (at times I found them both), the results are fascinating and the ramifications huge. It reminds us that, as a sociological opportunity, we’re in the midst of a monumental sea change--one that is granting us astoundingly far-reaching insight into who we really are."

Then they prefer men a few years younger. Men find 20 year old women to be the most attractive--refardless of age (from 20-50 men all find women between 20-24 the most attractive)• Polarizing people get more attention--someone ranked with both very high & beauty ratings will receive more messages than someone with an equal average, but of more middle numbers• The smell of shit is added to perfumes and flowers, making the whole actually smell better• 74 men died of nostalgia in the Civil War (according to army records)• Twitter may actually be improving its users' writing ability--in both word length and density & brevity of ideas• More will be written on Twitter in the next 2 years, than all books ever published• 'God' has been in steady decline since the early 1800s--the word is used only about a third as much now as it was then• The best digital messages are only 40 to 60 characters long• One of the best compatibility questions is 'Do you like scary movies?' Answering the same to this question is more predictive of a successful long term relationship than 'big issues' like religion, politics, and looks• Black and White Quarterbacks perform equally down to the decimal: 81.55 (qb rating)• Zodiac signs have no effect on compatibility at all. Race has less effect than religion, politics, or education• 85% of OkCupid users have gone to college• Women are more 'race-loyal' than men in regards to attraction & relationships• 'White sounding' names get 50% more interviews with the exact same résumé as 'black sounding' names like 'Lakisha or 'Jamal'• On Facebook, every percentile of attractiveness gives a man two friends. It gives a woman three.• Often parents want their daughters to be pretty...but 'not too pretty.' Does anyone imagine limitations on a son?• Obama's race probably cost him 3 to 5 percentage points of the popular vote. The most popular Google search for the n-word in history was in Nov 2008, after he won. • 'Rumor' was a winged roman godess with 100 eyes and 100 mouths who spoke only the most hurtful side of the truth...(at least according to rumor)• The agenda of spreading a rumor is directed more for an audience, rather than the subject of a rumor• The Internet makes us vile creatures (see the 'online disinhibition effect')• The government has the greatest invested interest in tracking negativity. Mathematical models exist which predict the otcome of war, how long it will last, who will win, and how many will die• In 1950, the dawn of television, the American Political Science Association called for more polarization in national politics--the parties had grown too close together, the electorate didn't have clear choices. What made good television then, makes good television now, with 100 times the channels.• We seem to define ourselves as much by what we hate as by what we love• Stereotypes are true: white people self-differentiate themselves by their looks, Asians by their origin country, and Latinos by their music• What we don't talk about can be as illuminating as that which we do• Sex is the single most important grouping humanity has. It has existed forever--long before race or creed. In the US, all men were able to vote before women were. With that said, we are all fundamentally similar, much more so than our differences• The United States is divided: all but 4 presidential elections since 1952 would've flipped had 5% of the electorate changed their minds. Any group of people representing that number is therefore very important politically.• Gay porn searches show homosexuality occurs at the same rate nationwide. In less tolerant places however, gays are just more likely to stay in the closet to avoid persecution• In the US, the most popular Google search that begins with 'Is my husband...' most commonly ends in 'gay?' 'Cheating' comes up 10% less, and 'an alcoholic' occurs 8 times less, 'depressed' 10 times less.• Google Search data is ineffective for estimating the number of lesbians in the country, because straight men looking for porn throw off the data• The government counts everyone who's not married as 'single,' regardless of their actual relationship status• Gay and Straight people are looking for the same things in a relationship according to the numbers• Sexuality is more fluid than we realize: 51% of women and 18% of men have bad, or would like to have a same-sex experience• Who we say we are and how we behave are two separate things• Any nation is an 'Imagined Community'--comprised mostly of fellow numbers you'll never meet, and may share little in common with• The relocation of individuals in india & Southeast Asia, as well as the industrialization reflect England circa 1950, and the US 50 years later--driven by the economy, farmers move to city jobs for higher pay• The UK has 5.9 million security cameras: 1 for every 11 citizens• Search data uncovered drug side effects before they were discovered by the FDA warning system, revealing paroxetine and paravastatin can cause hypoglycemia in patients• Facebook was collecting 500 terabytes of information everyday...back in 2012• If you've ever signed up for a website with a fake zip code or fake birthday, you're a criminal--in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act• A 12 year old visiting newyorktimes.com is a criminal as well--violating their Terms of Service and the working doctrine of the US Department of Justice• Twitter usage by high school grads vs college educated is equal (17 & 18% respectively). Black people have a disproportionate presence on Twitter (nearly two fold: 29% vs 16% among whites).

Not my finest several hours.What I like about this book is that it's based on data that's not collected by people putting up fronts or creating a persona. Shit's real. My favorite piece of data was that, relative to other identities, black men talk very little online about Social Distortion. This is definitely a stereotype that should gain some momentum. "
65,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,5,"Summary: One of the best data-driven books I have read. I think the title might be why there are so many haters. He presents a lot of tough issues using a medium ""dating"" that is relatable. Also, you should not try to read this on audiobook. You need to see the graphs. There are a lot of haters that present their background as if that's relevant in some way. It's not. B/c while they typically seem to understand data, they seem to lack reading comprehension skills. What Rudder is presenting is not findings from data work. He's attempting to use data as a backdrop to talk about a host of issues that are relevant in the modern era. The data is simply a view of what one might see. Instead of presenting some other social scientist's work, he's using in-house research, which, incidentally is a larger, better joined, more carefully collected, and larger geographical grouping than what most people have.Even if you find him to be less enlightening than his blog (I don't use twitter)-as some mentioned- I would guess this long-form argument could not be divined from the constraints of that medium of communication. He would have to be even more brilliant than I think he is just from reading this book!! Maybe... the guy is a Harvard grad..... But in case I'm right, below are my notes....p. 14 - ""If Big Data's two running stories have been about surveillance and money, for the last three years I've been working on third: the human story."" ""...as a close second, they're demographers of an unprecedented reach."" P. 15 - He talks about the fact that his purpose is to generalize so he can do his job of bringing people together at scale (not with individual nonsensical exceptions as discussed by A LOT of the haters!). He's trying to understand and infer from the data. And his inference work is wonderful, presenting possible misinterpretations that were tested and reviewed. p. 46 - Actually this entire chapter of how they essentially created a series of studies to demonstrate that variation in attractiveness get you noticed as much as attractiveness does. Freakin' Brilliant!p. 47 - Did not know there was a name to it: ""the Pratfall Effect"" - ""As long as you're generally competent, making a small, occasional mistake makes people think you're more competent. Flaws call out good stuff all the more."" p. 48 - It's better to ""Purposely abandon the middle road."" p. 53 - Regarding NLP work on Twitter...I love the hypothesis that Twitter might be improving its users' writing. This is all amazing stuff as relates to transformations in human language and has application in ways that are ignored even today.""he calculated the typical world length in Hamlet (3.99) and in a collection of Wodehouse's stories (4.05)... both less than the length in his Twitter sample (4.80).""""Comparative linguistics have long traced groups of community through language."" p. 54 - The chart on changing characteristics of speech patterns. The idea being that tribe creation is no longer geographically constrained, AND ALSO, you can catch it in the language used... something that we were NEVER able to do in the past (think Chinese, Cantonese, Mandarin, and the 50+ other dialects). Super nerdy awesome point.p. 62 - ""Sitewide, the copy-and-paste, strategy underperforms the from-scratch messaging about 25%, but in terms of effort-in results-out - it always wins: measuring by replies received to compose a new message each time."" What an awesome thing to take look at. Intriguing when you think about marketing/scaled response composition. p. 82 - Confounders. This is a great way to present this material so often ignored or misunderstood in the field. Generally, this chapter does a great job presenting a series of charts with each of the appropriate analysis points you'd ask in a row. I did not need the written part, but I can see why he has it. I can also see why some who read via audiobooks struggled. It would be hard to understand this book if all you had was the audio.Chapter 7: The Beauty Myth - The whole way he presents it in the context of thinking about his daughter is great. The work that supports it is fantastic. On eating disorders, he describes a possible place to look for solutions to help others....p. 104 ""... but before the behavior was digitized, there was practically no way to get directly at this problem, at least not until visible damage had already occurred. There was only rumor - an ear at the bathroom door, perhaps a parent's sad suspicion.""Chapter 8: p. 106-107. He talks about how b/c people don't tell you their deepest thoughts, you had to really work hard (snoop, catch people unguarded, etc) to figure out what they thought. Then he talks about the truthfulness of search engines like Google. How the mechanism itself is far harder to trick. This is REALLY important to what we think of as the fundamental changes in the types of data we now are able to collect. Chapter 9: There were a number of criticisms I read that lead back to this chapter and I think it might just have been unclear how to read the charts as well to think about it. That's a fair point. I think what he's trying to say is even in words there is racial signaling on both sides. If we think about the words we use to attract others and identify tribe, in the context of dating it's super apparent. For me, then I think about how this relates to concepts like code-switching in the workplace. We focus a lot on the accent, and we know vocabulary matters. But this implies something far deeper. If you read each of the lists and you clearly identify with one group, it's likely, you are farther culturally from other groups than just skin color. This is quite profound on anyone working on things like ""How do we create a single human race without such aberrant division."" Word. p. 155 - If you care at all about gay rights, these stats are important and also very sad. If I've got him correct- and these are the footnotes, we're underestimating the gay population of the US by a lot and most are NOT dating b/c they are socially unable to do so, either because they are in the closet and scared to be themselves or there are structural reasons in their community that prevent them from self-expression. Chapter 12- Great segue into the work on migration, which covers not an only lifestyle choice but also works availability and more. This work is really relevant for - what is not mentioned, the dying cities phenomenon. p. 181 - He's arguing against things like Klout scores. This is why I do not understand the arguments that he doesn't want to drill in or he's missing some sort of causality.. he's not. This book is about what the general number are telling you out of various inferences that are possible.p. 184 - Mountain Dew Story. A great example of what not to crowdsource.p. 186 - ""If employers begin to use algorithms to infer how intelligent you are or whether you use drugs, then your only choice will be to game the system - or to borrow the wording from the previous chapter, 'manage your brand.' To beat the machine, you must act like a machine, which means you've lost to the machine. And that's assuming you can guess what you're supposed to do in the first place. Apparently, one of the strongest correlates to intelligence in the research was liking 'curly fries.' Who could reverse engineer that?p. 187 - very intersting comments on survellience and data use by the government. p. 193 - He talks about the pennies from personal data payments will not amount ot anything that actually helps people. Moreover, it is highly likely to just be passed back through to consumers."
66,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3925847-gerri-leen,3,"This book is super interesting but I wish there were a little more ""there"" there. I only got to 60% before the book was over and the notes began (and on a Kindle flipping back and forth is, for me, a pain). Also meat-wise, I was expecting something along the lines of Outlers, which of course this is the opposite of in theme since it looks at the trends of all and not the accomplishments of a few. But I wanted it to be a book I remembered long after. It's really not. Although it's an interesting read while you're in it. Big Data, when it matures, means so much info that will be longitudinal, something data analysts struggle with ever getting enough of, so in that sense this is very exciting, and it's amazing what we can tell already from the little we have.I do think the book suffered mightily by being read on a Kindle (or any e-reader, especially black and white). The graphs used red and it was not always easy to tell what was gray because it was red and what was gray because it was gray--or if anything was really gray. Since much of this book runs off the graphs, that it's a bad thing not to be able to fully read them (and at the size they were at on my Paperwhite, I also felt challenged to really dive in). I did love reading that the author was a disciple of sorts of Tufte. And I appreciated the amount of info given in the charts.I had a hard time getting through the first chapter. I think the author left out a primary reason male and female reactions to potential partners' age might change (or not) over time depending on gender--and normally I'd give him a break on this since it's from another field of study, but since he runs an online dating site and is reporting on that robust data set, then I'd expect him to understand the drives of men (be drawn to young and fertile no matter how old they get) and women (pick a good provider--until she reaches a certain age, realizes she is not going to need a provider (either because she does not have kids or because she provides just fine for herself), and then go for something young and fun). This behavior has been well documented and while I thought he was going to touch on it at one point, it really didn't happen enough for me to ever get that comfortable with the first example out of the gate. That said, I didn't have that issue with the rest of the book, so I did keep going and many of the sections were novel and interesting."
67,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24217018-matt,3,"This is a very quick read which, given the number of visuals, is not surprising. The visuals, though, are beautiful, always tell a story, and never waste a drop of ink on unnecessary information. These images reflect the book...for the most part. It's when the narrative steers away from its stated purpose (a data driven exploration of human nature) that I started to tire of Christian Rudders narrative voice. It's funny, irreverent, and insightful for most of the book and especially for the sections discussing OkCupid data. He writes best about the data he knows best and that's not surprising. But as the book advances Rudder starts to draw on unfamiliar datasets, make less rigorous assertions, and veer into both data fear-mongering and data evangelism. It was disappointing mostly because he promised to write a different kind of book than those which use data as a lens to prove the downfall of society or privacy, or predict incredible advances in technology and public intelligence. He asserts this book is special then proceeds to speculate about how invasive the NSA can be, how Twitter is unleashing our base instincts but also improving our vocabulary, and how online branding is the future of self evaluation. These parts were, in truth, boring compared to the insights about romantic relationship. In summary, I'm not sure where this book fits in the social science and statistics cannon. It's not the most insightful or the most fun, which leaves it somewhere in between and probably only worth picking up if you love the genre. "
68,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35538316-lindy,3,"I feel like I write this in every nonfiction book review, but I wished there was more depth! I also wished someone more, I don't know, anthropologically minded had given this book a once over before publication. For example, Rudder treats data showing that bisexual men are more likely to prefer/message other men on OkCupid when compared to older bisexual men as if it were longitudinal, and implies that bi men's sexual preferences change as they get older. However he does not take into account what these men may be doing off the service; a young bisexual man will probably hit on women at a bar, but is at a considerably greater risk of being decked in the face if he were to do so to men. As the dating pool grows smaller with age, he may turn to the internet to scope out both genders. (To be fair, Rudder  does responsibly account for a similar phenomenon showing that North Dakotans are surprisingly liberal when it comes to causual sex in the next chapter and why that isn't the case.) Likewise, Rudder says that ""yass,"" which turns up in a list of words distinctive of popular twitter users, is a contraction of ""your ass."" This is true, but it's definitely not the most popular use. Nonetheless, Dataclysm is an interesting and accessible book, and I imagine it would be especially so to someone with no background in statistics. I appreciated that the author had a sense of humor, and I don't think (reading in 2017) that it has aged poorly, although it would have been helpful if Rudder had cited years in the text rather than simply ""last year."""
69,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33131867-neha,3,"I had seen a significant portion of the material before on the blog, but it's still worth a read. I loved the informal voice, and the use of various graphs to illustrate new findings. It read like a collection of smaller articles with specific results.A lot of the OkCupid data revealed particular preferences of men and women in terms of age, attractiveness, and ethnicity. I can understand why the overall findings may be upsetting, and I think readers should be cautious about how this actually applies to their lives. This book is not trying to give insider tips for finding more dates. I think it's very important to remember that there is an inherent selection bias in the OkCupid data: it only represents people who have, for one reason or another, decided to try online dating.I thought the book was going to be more about OkCupid's dataset, but I appreciated the discussions about Google, Facebook, and Twitter data. The last chapter describes the ongoing conflict of privacy that is absent from earlier chapters. While giving users complete ownership of their data may seem to solve many problems, I tend to disagree that it's entirely possible. Services can certainly provide an option for users to remove their data from the site, but once data is on the Internet, I think it's safe to assume that it will never fully disappear."
70,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11500849-jen,1,"A sloppy and irresponsible introduction to big data analytics. Taking a popular science approach, the book glosses over key tenets of every day data science, like basic hypothesis testing. It also makes grand, sweeping generalizations about society as a whole where none can be made based on the population of the data (OK Cupid members hardly represent a random sampling of the US population).Some of the more egregious statements include ""There are times when a data set is so robust that if you set up your analysis right, you don't need to ask questions - it just tells you everything anyway"" and ""people are already compensated for their data: They get to use services like Facebook and Google...for free.""Putting the author's disregard of personal privacy aside, the narrative voice is filled with white male privilege. A few sections of the book made me generally uncomfortable in its approach to conversations about race, gender, and heterosexual relationships. We need a book about data science that highlights the process in a way that digital users can understand how their data is being analyzed and who is doing it responsibly. This is not it."

If you check, or look at a picture of the NSA (Why does an office building need a radar dome on the roof?), you will see that has always been their job. But while you are worrying about that, you are telling scores of commercial data aggregators everything about yourself, just by what you search for on Google, what you like on Facebook and where you access the internet from. Your sex, your race, your sexual orientation, your income, your politics, your IQ (from the type of French fries you like), it's all an open book. This book is the story from one involved nerd, along with some nice graphics.People's activities are somewhat limited, so the use of this data is mostly to target you for repression or elimination in a repressive society, to sell you something in a capitalist society, or for law enforcement to find you.

The basis of the book is a dozen or so interesting statistical points, with a chapter of conversational description for each. I'm curious where these statistical insights actually come from. Did the author pore over data for months? It doesn't feel that way. They have the feeling of nuggets gleaned from interns working over a period of years, that never ended up being useful anywhere else. Certainly, the discussion the author offers almost no isights beyond the immediately obvious. It isn't clear enough to be a good introduction to statistics, nor in-depth enough to offer interest to statisticians.The best chapters are the early ones oriented towards anyone trying to game the system a little on dating sites. How long message should be, what the opposite sex is looking for for someone your age, etc. The later chapters, trying to offer larger insights about culture and language are ... not convincing. Problematic, even."
73,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78503-chris,3,"This book has some great perspective on human behavior derived from data sets culled from many websites. It celebrates the fact that the amount of data that we have on people's actual beliefs and desires (as opposed to their stated beliefs) and breaks down what a lot of these data sets mean. A lot of it is very funny, even while it may be disturbing in its implications.For the first two-thirds, it was really interesting to me and had a lot of, if not surprising, at least very relevant things to say about human behaviors.The last third kind of drifted off into parts of the data that I am not too concerned with personally and the author's thoughts on what the future will be. It is not necessarily bad, just not what I was looking for, and also, a bit more broad than the particulars of the earlier chapters. "
74,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63344080-lucas,4,"This book offers a new look at old questions. Race, identity and the many differences between women and men in their approach to sex and relationship are shown here through data from an online dating website (OkCupid). I think the book presents valuable insights about racism because it observes actually behavior rather than self-reported questions.Some of the interesting book's find is the following:* Both black men and black women are strongly rejected in online dating* The women who received more attention of men aren't the more beautiful but those who have the high variance in their ratings (men can't say if they are beautiful or not).* Most people (~90%) who declare themselves bisexual is indeed heterosexual or homosexual.* Straight women are less propense to search only casual sex in online datingA negative thing is that the book contains a lot of digressions."

The possibilities of big data seem scary and exciting at the same time. This book presents them in a very accessible way to the average reader. I was skeptical of some the conclusions that the author presented but there's a lot of good conversation starters here. However, I don't think much of it will stick with me in the long run.I probably didn't make the best choice by listening to this on audiobook where numbers in charts were read out for minutes hahaOverall, a short, enjoyable, and timely read if you want to delve into popular science books."
76,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3440334-fred-forbes,2,"Making my way through some interesting observations generated by ""OK Cupid"" and other ""big data"" sites, I hit a section marked ""Coda"" where he went on to comment on the process used to generate the data illustrations, followed by notes, acknowledgements, and an index. Thought I was halfway through the book but had actually finished. Note sure whether the lack of mathematical analysis is a blessing or not - I guess that would depend on how capable the writer is - but much of the content, while interesting is a ""firm grasp of the obvious."""

This was a highly enjoyable-to-read, interesting-to-think-about, pop-data/analytics book. I appreciated the author's voice and sense of humor, but he often ventured into preachy territory. For someone to write so extensively on data that illuminates our biases, I wish he could have taken more care to hide his own."

79,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8886042-michelle,2,"Dataclysm: Who We Are When We Think No One's Looking by Christian Rudder is an interesting and fact filled book. I received an Advance Reader's Copy from Crown Publishing, a division of Random House and my opinions were formed by my reading of this uncorrected proof. Author Christian Rudder is one of the founders of the dating website OKCupid and he draws his research for this book primarily from the data that has been collected from paying members who are looking for relationships. He additionally mines data from other social media resources, dating services like Match.com and websites, and his pool of subjects include a cross section of the population that he believes is an excellent barometer for the opinions of Americans today. This book is filled with charts and maps and images to help you easily understand the data he has sourced and how it applies to the ""everyman"" in all of us.This book approaches a wide variety of topics - relationships, personal preferences, age, gender, race and upbringing and tries to answer the question ""Who are we really?"" by examining what we say versus how we act. Although I felt like I came away with a bunch of quotable tidbits and an interesting peek into how the data that we so freely place on the internet is used, I'm not quite sure that I learned very much about myself from this book. Many of the observances seemed rational to me and not all that thought provoking, and although some applied to me I didn't walk away feeling like I had much personal insight. A few of the passages left me feeling uneasy, simply because I'm not sure all the members of OKCupid were willing test subjects in Mr. Rudder's data laboratory. In one memorable instance photos of users were shown in an illustration of women who had very high and very low scores from fellow users in terms of their appeal. Although he was using them to make a point about the importance of having a photo that provokes a strong reaction is better than having a commonly pretty picture (which he describes as ""meh"") and he expressly thanks the subjects for their consent to be included in the book and to have their photos discussed, it still felt mildly squicky. Although the many other charts and illustrations in the book didn't deal in this same very personal representation of data, I did question the author's use of the OKCupid site at times. Although it may all be perfectly legal it makes me ask ""do I need to know this?"" and ""is the use of this data justified in a bigger, insight gaining way that makes it important to a reader?"" I'm not sure I have the answer to those questions.  As a collection of facts and data there were definitely a few things I hadn't thought about before - for example, there is a chart showing the 100 most common words used in the English language today from the Oxford English Corpus (a collection of modern writing's approach to vocabulary and word use) versus the top 100 used to express yourself on Twitter in the form of the service's 140 character tweet posts. It showed that although you may think the language of Twitter would somewhat abbreviate or diminish your ideas to get your point across, actually a person composing a tweet is much more selective and thoughtful about what their words will convey. It may help us to write clearer and in a concise style that contributes to an overall awareness of language. That awareness filters into the speech and style of a Twitter user versus a non-user. I liked the idea that my tweeting may help me generate a better and more vivid use of language. Still I kept returning to the fact that this book didn't really live up to the ""portrait of our essential selves"" claim that it was intended to be. It isn't a bad book. I just wish that I had a greater takeaway as a reader.One thing that truly irked me about this book is the mention of a website link where you could go, punch in your own data (two Facebook usernames) and get a personal illustration to see one of the ideas in this book in action. In the fourth chapter titled ""You Gotta be the Glue"" there is an illustration showing the overlap of the author's Facebook friends and his wife's friend's. He explains in depth how we create clusters of people in our lives that know us from a specific point of view - our work friends, childhood acquaintances, family members etc. Our spouse or significant other can overlap our Facebook friendships in many categories. Perhaps you are both friends with your parents and share relationships with other couples you met while you both attended a ballroom dance lesson. The shared connections can illustrate the bonds we have as couples, and can show you the places in your relationships that have a strong and meaningful connection. I thought this sounded really cool and was happy to find an example that could be personalized to me and allowed me to be a willing participant in the experiment to see how it felt. Unfortunately this awesome personalized tool simply doesn't exist. I have tried the link dozens of times over the past few weeks and didn't post my thoughts on the book since I wanted to see this chart in action, but it still gives me a ""Page Not Found"" message. The book's publication date is set for Tuesday September 9th, and since this is Saturday the 6th I would think that it would be active. I hope it will go live on Tuesday at the very least. I contacted the author through his Twitter page about the lack of a working link and received no response, however another reviewer on Goodreads said that when they contacted him through email they received a response that it would be functional by the end of August. If I had paid for this book rather than receiving an ARC I would be even more disappointed. The one big opportunity to gain personal insight is so far, a bust.If you find the sort of data in this book interesting I would check it out of the library or wait for the book to be marked down. I wouldn't consider it a must read but I am thankful I had the opportunity to read it. I hope you find this useful information, and I will update my opinion if the link works on the publication date. For now I can only give this book 2 of 5 stars. "
80,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5177572-genevieve,4,"* Originally reviewed on the Night Owls Press blog here. *First, it was the Internet. The Internet was going to change how businesses and organized operated. It was going to change how people live. But now something else has enthralled our imagination: big data.What is big data? We couldn't have big data without the Web. Our shift to online activity has made it easier to record and document massive reams of data and data trails about seemingly everything: Where do we go when we're online? What do we do? What do we read? The idea behind big data is that scientists can analyze that activity and parse out that information, information that might predict what we would do in hypothetical situations, or what we would be likely to do in the future. This largely possible because of scale. It's not about analyzing a person, a hundred people, or a thousand people; it's about waves and waves of information, millions and millions of data points.Think about how far we've come. In the third century BC, the first great repository of human knowledge was the Library of Alexandria. Today information is available in the exabytes. (What is an exabyte? Um...it's really, really big.) Big data is about size, but it's more than that. It's the fact that we have computers and databases that will log and analyze micro-activities, actions as simple as Facebook ""likes,"" our location recorded by the GPS in our phones, and the ""number of seconds or minutes spent reading a web page.""Dataclysm Who We Are When We Think No One's Looking by Christian Rudder sheds light on what that kind of datafication looks like. Rudder himself is the cofounder of OkCupid, the online dating site, which lives and breathes on seemingly mystical algorithms that dice and chop up streams of data. No other person might be more qualified to give us an insider's account on what big data can do.Rudder dabbles in statistical, psychological, and sociological theories and drills the chapters with clever infographics and beautifully rendered scatterplots—and some of them are truly works of art. (I used to work in data so I have a soft spot for data scientists and their work.) But where Rudder really excels is in the smorgasbord of findings. Patterns emerge from the data. Stare into the matrix and you'll see...a mirror into your very soul. At least that's what Rudder wants us to believe.You might be put off by Rudder's focus on dating sites but that's his métier. The trove of information on social interactions alone on dating sites is weirdly fascinating. In one example, Rudder finds that dating profiles of women who have a polarizing physical appearance are more likely to be approached for dates than the conventionally attractive person. (Is it fascination with novelty? boredom with the same 'ole, same 'ole?) Aren't we all at our most earnest and neurotic when it comes to love and relationships?A downside of this book is that if you read or pay attention to the tech news cycle, you may find some of Rudder's examples ho-hum repeats. For example, we've seen Google Trends tackle the flu in a kind of digital epidemiology approach. Nothing new there. Rudder retells these stories not to just fill the pages though but to constantly keep the beat of this book, which is asking deeper questions about who are we as a culture?Another downside is that even with all the reams of data and stats Rudder throws at us, ultimately, these are just cool factoids. It's an impressive avalanche of interesting data tidbits, but still just tidbits. The next challenge for big data: figuring out what truly matters, narrowing it down, cutting the noise.The heart of what makes big data interesting is that it's research that isn't gathered merely from surveys or interviews or even randomized control trial experiments, which we all know can be biased for a variety of reasons: subjects don't understand the questions, subjects lie, people obfuscate, they unconsciously modify their behavior to please researchers. Here the data is based on actual behavior in situ. And we can learn something from it, we can see patterns and discern behaviors that were otherwise invisible. It's like studying people in the wild.Most books about data are dry and boring, but Dataclysm is one that makes a mark. Part of this is Rudder staying grounded in primary data and real analysis. But an even bigger part is Rudder's never-stale writing style. Yes, the book is still pop-social science. This might frustrate a few bona fide data scientists out there. But Dataclysm works. The amusing stories and asides sprinkled throughout the book are full of zest but are never fluffy. For a numbers person, a Harvard-honed math-y guy working in Silicon Valley, Dataclysm is a remarkably fluid and readable book.Big data isn't the answer to the universe, the meaning of life, or to your other burning existential questions, but you'll still become privy to some interesting discoveries about culture and society.[Disclaimer: I received this book from Blogging for Books for an honest and candid review.] "

82,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16880570-khari,1,"Three months.Three months to listen to a book seven and a half hours long. Normally I can get one of those out in a week. Nope. Three months.I'm really tired of these books with fascinating titles that just disappoint.This book made me understand why people shout 'Science' at each other. It's because authors like this either underestimate their audience and dumb down what they have done, or they have terrible methodologies themselves and don't even realize it.For a book about data which necessarily must include statistics, there is a shocking dearth of statistic lingo in this book. He tries to justify himself in the end. His intention was to write a popular science book and he didn't want to clutter it with jargon like 'p', and 'confidence interval' and fun stuff like that. And, hey, I get it. I don't completely understand statistics yet, but even I know that words like 'significant' have a particular meaning that has to be defined in the world of numbers, but he never defines his terms. He says the methodology he used was 'rigorous' and it went through something 'like peer review' but never defines what his methodology was, and his 'peer review' was for his underling (who he knew btw) to check his numbers. That's not peer review. Hate to break it to you. Peer review is done by someone who does not know who wrote the paper, and they look over the whole paper, including the hypotheses and the conclusions as well as the number. It's not someone whose job is in your hands checking your math. But I know why he chose to do it this way. It's because there is no way on this planet that this atrocity would have ever been published in a good scientific journal....wait...let me rephrase that. Considering that there have been cases of complete hoax papers being published it is remotely possible that it could have been published in a badly edited, badly curated, motivated reasoning filled journal. Because that's what this was. Badly edited, badly curated, filled with motivated reasoning, and worst of all, terrible methodology that is never explained. This book couldn't hack it in the scientific publishing world so he had to go to a subsidiary of Penguin, Crown Publishing, that focuses on hobbies, memoirs, biographies, autobiographies, cooking, lifestyle, business and nonfiction. And honestly, that makes a ton of sense, because this reads more like a memoir than a book of scientific rigor. He makes unfounded claims, presents his interpretation as fact, and only considers one explanation for everything that he finds interesting.The part that absolutely killed me was he is talking about corpus linguistics. Corpus linguistics is gathering really large bodies of texts and making it searchable. There are a bunch of free ones out there, such as the Corpus of Contemporary American English (affectionately known as COCA), for your perusal. They have a bunch of ways of analyzing, you can look at the most used words, you can look at the collocations (the words immediately preceding and following a word), you can look at the word families that are used, the lexemes that are used, the type of word that most appears, the contexts in which words appear, which is a really good way to find out what a word actually means in use, in contrast to how it is defined in the dictionary. Corpus linguistics just happens to be my baby. It was my focus in my master's program and it's my focus in my PHD program. And guess what? I know nothing about it. I've already spent three years learning about it, and I'm going to go spend another 2-6, and I've read peer-reviewed articles about it, talked to experts, and read books about it, and I still know nothing, but I know enough to know that how he's using it is mind bogglingly bogus. He basically does character counting. He counts how many words show up in a tweet, calculates the mean character length, then compares it to the mean character length in Shakespeare and concludes that since the mean character length in tweets is longer, people today are using language in a more nuanced way than Shakespeare was....mean character length. Or his other technique was to make a word list of the most used words and show that it was similar to Shakespeare because 'the' and 'a' appeared at the top. No duh Sherlock, they're function words. They happen to be required every time you are referring to a singular noun. They would show up at the top of the word list of this review as well and that would mean nothing about the similarity between reviews and tweets. They are different registers who both follow the rules of the English language, ergo, functional words such as articles and pronouns and prepositions would occur more often simply because they are closed classes that are requisite for forming phrases that make sense.So there you go, a very brief, cogent rebuttal for one of his most important methods of analysis. But that rebuttal is actually rebutting his intention, not what he actually did. What he actually did was include, on his erstwhile 'word' list, things like 'the', 'a', ''s', 'Peru' 'my blue eyes', 'tall for an Asian', etc. .........How, in the name of all that is grounded in the study of linguistics, can those things be defined as 'words'?!?!? What definition is he using?!? He isn't using one! He's just conglomerating everything that he finds interesting together and calling it a 'word' while not even recognizing that what he finds interesting is subjective! It's not a parameter by which to define something! At first I was like, huh, is he using morphemes as the basis of his 'word'? ""'s"" would be the the third person possessive morpheme, I can see that, after all 'the' 'a' and 'Peru' are all single morpheme words. But then you have 'my blue eyes' that's not a word, that's a phrase! All of the words in that phrase aren't even single morpheme words! So why on earth does the third person possessive deserve its own place of glory but the plural 's' does not!?!This is the problem with popular 'science' books. People read them, feel like they are now informed and use the same arguments that they read about without ever realizing that the books aren't science. There is no scientific method in this book. He never defines his terms, he barely defines his variables. He has a million variables, and doesn't distinguish between them. It's not an experimental study so it's fine that he doesn't have a control group, but he should be trying to make the groups that he is splitting people into as uniform as possible and he doesn't even really attempt it. His variables are men and women, black, white, Asian, and Hispanic. He never even limited his findings to people from the USA. He just assumed that everyone was. He never factored in educational status which would have a huge impact, and that information actually is in the data set, so he could have, but he didn't. He didn't even mention it as a confound! And that's just the point. Everything is a conclusion for him. He argued that there are certain topics that are anathema to certain groups because the word denoting that topic only appears once. No. It does not mean that they are anathema to that group. I can think of a dozen reasons why someone would choose not to put something that they are interested in onto a public forum. I am pretty sure that an Otolaryngologist is not going to put that as their profession on OKCupid, simply because most people don't know what that means, they are just going to go with 'doctor' because it's simpler and gets the point across. That doesn't mean that otolarynogology is a taboo subject because it's only mentioned once. And besides, the fact that it is mentioned at all is already proof positive that it is not a taboo subject, taboo subjects are epitomized by never being mentioned at all and referred to circularly. So why didn't he mention all the other terms that are never mentioned, like muons and antileptons? (No, I don't know what those are either). The self-introductions on OKCupid (which is what he studied) are texts designed to elicit a certain response. They are a specific register, a register that each writer assumes will be the most likely to get them what they want, a date. As such they are inherently not generalizable to populations as a whole. They are only generalizable as 'the words that people use to try and present themselves as a satisfactory date'. There is a purpose behind it and it shows only a very small subset of language use, taking it to mean that it epitomizes someone's character and identity is horrifying. People change how they talk constantly. They talk differently when they write as compared to when they speak. They talk differently depending on if they know their audience or not. They talk differently depending on the power dynamics of the situation. They talk differently depending on how they are feeling at the moment. Studying the language used in self-introductory texts on OKCupid is very interesting and a worthwhile subject in and of itself, but you cannot generalize out to the public. The people on OKCupid are not a random selection of people, they are self-selected to be rather outgoing, not so privacy concerned, not willing to spend their money on web-dating, mostly singly people who are interested in romantic liaisons. They are, according to his own admission of the data, mostly liberal and progressive, mostly college educated, those account for 31% and 34% of the US population respectively. That is not even broken down by sex or race, if I were to spend the time doing that it would show an even smaller portion of the population for each, you can't generalize out to everyone else in the US based on a sub population. That would be like saying 50% of the population of the US are women, and women generally score higher in compassion, therefore the US is a compassionate nation...what? That doesn't even make sense.Finally, the thing that really just made me crack up was when he said ""and I say this as someone who is reflexively critical of the left."" That made me die. Why, why did that make me die? Because it doesn't mean what you think it means. It doesn't mean that he automatically looks at what people on the left say critically. It doesn't mean that his automatic response is to be skeptical. It means to embrace your subjective understandings of reality as a basis for analyzing social interactions. Being reflexively critical is a tenet of feminist post-structuralist analysis, or you could also argue that it is a postmodern, post-Marxist analysis as well. Regardless of who you decide is the ultimate progenitor of such an idea, it remains an ideology of the left. By using it he showed that he was on the left. By trying to present himself as a balanced and disinterested analyzer he showed himself to be controlled by a particular worldview."
83,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51602586-dominika,4,"A good soft introduction on data analysis, particularly in regards to human interaction. I thought it was fun and simple enough for the layman, but not simple to the point that it's lying about the capacity of what big data can do (as an example, I deal with a lot of research participants who do not have an email or do not use their email often). I really appreciated him talking about the limitations, as well as some qualitative methods and how they can be used. The whole point of all this is to see how our private, online behavior is actually a great insight into the human condition. Like how the rate of gay porn consumption is the same across every state, and what factors are important to each racial group. I know I made this sound super boring but it isn't. "

You might not even be too surprised, if they started to learn what music people probably like, by the way they dress, speak, or act (although it would be impressive). But, what if they had hundreds of thousands, or tens of millions of customers a day? How much would they learn about what music people like, if they could somehow deal with that many customers a day?What if, instead of a music store, people came to your store to find something more personal, like a girlfriend or boyfriend?Welcome to the book Dataclysm, where one of the founders of the website OkCupid shows us just what every website you ever use is able to tell about you. That's slightly an exaggeration, of course; dating websites do get a view of us that is a little different than most. But then, Amazon sees you when you put your money where your mouth is. Google sees what you're trying to find, or find out about, or where you're finding directions to. Facebook, of course, probably knows who your real friends are better than what you are willing to admit out loud.If you get creeped out easily by the loss of secrecy (otherwise known as ""privacy"", when it's secrecy that we like) that comes from using the Internet, this is probably not the book for you.However, if you like to leaven your opinions about topics like race (and racism) and sex (and sexism) with some actual data (not just your own personal experience), this book is a revelation. Here is a more or less randomly picked sampling of what you get in this book, not just presented as an assertion, but backed up with mountains of data:1) racism against blacks in America is not just real and enduring, but is equally rampant among Asians and Hispanic Americans as among Anglos2) Asian-Americans on dating sites use a uniquely low number of misspelled words compared to all other ethnicities3) men do not give up trying to date that 20-year old woman until they are over 30, whereas the man who looks best to a 20-year old woman is likely to be around 234) men do not give up trying to date that 30-year old woman until they are over 40, whereas the man who looks best to a 30-year old woman is likely to be around 305) of self-identified straight women on OkCupid, 26% said they had a sexual encounter with a woman, and enjoyed it (more than 3 times the analogous percentage of self-identified straight men)6) by just looking at your ""likes"" on Facebook, you can determine with 60% accuracy whether or not someone is the child of parents who got divorced before they turned 21 (this was in 2012, and the algorithms have probably gotten only better since then)7) women who get a lot of 1's and 5's (out of 5) on their picture, are more likely to get messaged, than women who get a lot of 3's, even though the average opinion of their looks is the sameIf you are online, there are servers (computers that serve up websites to your desktop, laptop, or smartphone) which know quite a lot about you and the others in the society you live in. The people you really don't want to have this kind of information, already have it. The only question is, will you? If knowledge is power, then right now there is a profound imbalance of power being created by this much data. Christian Rudder has done us the favor of showing us what he has (aggregated, of course, so that no individual is identifiable). Take a look."
85,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4579658-rob-kitchin,2,"The stated aim of Dataclysm is to introduce lay readers to the era of big data, the possibilities of such data, and the types of analysis used to make sense of them. The problems with the book start with the title and subtitle, neither of which, I think, make much sense. Dataclysm, Rudder explains, is a play on cataclysm: the wiping away of one era to be replaced by a new one. However, big data is set to complement small data, not wipe them away as small data are generated to answer specific questions rather than being a by-product that is then repurposed, and most big data are held by private corporations or government and are not readily open to researchers. All of the data that Rudder analyzes is from social media; they are data produced precisely because we think someone is looking (for a date, for conversation, for information, to provoke a reaction, etc). Uploading information to the internet is largely a process of the presentation of the self, as Goffman’s famous theory would frame the activity. Even if other people cannot see the answers to direct questions, as when filling in questions on a dating site, the answers shape the user profile and the process of matching -- something that users are aware of, consider and present to.The book then proceeds by discussing social media data and what they might reveal about human behaviour and society. Crucially, however, there is no systematic discussion of big data per se, its forms and characteristics, no discussion of data analytics, and only a cursory discussion of the many ethical, social and political implications of such data. There is no discussion of statistics, or statistical tests performed on the data presented, nor data mining, data analytics, machine learning, pattern recognition, profiling, prediction, etc. The irony here is that Rudder’s company – OkCupid – employs these techniques to be able to process and match potential partners, yet he never explains how this is achieved. Instead, the entire analysis is rooted in the empiricist form of data science, rather than data-driven science, and never proceeds beyond description. As such, the analysis of gender and race he presents are based on a ‘letting the data speak for themself’ approach and constitutes armchair interpretation. He barely engages with the vast academic literature on quantitative analysis of race and gender that has taken place for several decades using large data sets such as the census or public administration data. Rudder has access to an enormous set of very interesting data that could be used to conduct some fascinating sociological and psychological analysis. Instead what we get are a series of descriptive statistics and banal revelations, most of which are already well established. The result is a book that hints at the potential of big data and data science but undersells it substantially, and it under-estimates in my view the readership level of its potential audience by never progressing beyond mathematics and data visualisations used in junior school. In contrast, books such as The Signal and the Noise by Nate Silver provide a much wider and deeper discussion. This is a shame as Rudder is an engaging writer and he has privileged access to an extremely rich social data that could be used to conduct some wonderful and sophisticated social science research. Such rich research and its policy implications are barely hinted at."
86,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8684527-andra-n,5,"I postponed reading Dataclysm for some time, but I’m glad I took my time to read it. Its author, Christian Rudder first caught my attention in an article written after the Facebook scandal over the experiments made over its users, where he explained in a rather unapologetic manner, that this is the very nature of internet’s success and efficiency increase. His opinion is a consequence of his experience running the dating site OkCupid where decisions based on people’s behavior must be made in order to obtain optimal results. “It’s a delicate illusion, the Internet.”Dataclysm is a book about Big Data and Romantic behavior. However, it is definitely not a recipe for making a perfect profile or having more success on social networks. This book is rather a series of conclusions drawn from the aggregated data obtained from millions of interactions mainly from sites like OkCupid and other social networks or Google. This is not the story of the individual, it is the story of the collective. What distinguishes the work of Christian Rudder is that given his privileged position at OKCupid, he had in hand large amounts of data with which he could play and analyze freely. As opposed to other studies of human behavior that have as subjects mostly a bunch of students from well-known universities, his data sets contain personal information of people of all ages and races, from the US. This book has lots of pop-culture references, amusing and sometimes insightful comments. What is most intriguing about his studies is the fact that they are made over information that we rather think it is private. We get a glimpse of our rather politically incorrect behaviors as human beings.I found particularly interesting the comparison between woman preferences and man preferences when it comes to a potential partner’s age, attractiveness and race. Humor is not left out of the book, as the paragraph depicting women ratings of attractiveness of men: “Only one guy in six is “above average” in an absolute sense. Sex appeal isn’t something commonly quantified like this, so let me put it in a more familiar context: translate this plot to IQ, and you have a world where the women think 58 percent of men are brain damaged.”The comparison of words most commonly used by people on their dating profiles from different races or sexual orientation was also a chapter that I found quite interesting. The author shows via text analysis that several race related patterns emerge. “White people differentiate themselves mostly by their hair and eyes, Asians by their country of origin, Latinos by their music. But because of the way the math is set up, the three non-white lists are evidence of cultures that I, as a white man, am not supposed to know…the gay male list is very different from the other three. It’s full of pop culture and has comparatively few references to the user’s immediate person and family.”I would definitely recommend this book that tackles a wide range of topics to anyone who is interested in data science as well as those curious about the weirdness of human nature."
87,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18688-cody,4,"Much e-ink has been spilled--rightfully so--about the brave new world we live online. Targeted advertising, data breaches, the NSA; it’s easy to grow overwhelmed by the potential dangers of sharing personal information electronically. Practically everything we do on our phones and computers is tracked, often in an effort to sell us something or gain some upper hand (financially, politically, socially, etc.). Consequentially, there is now an unprecedented amount of detailed data about us that's ripe for the parsing.Beyond the obvious advantages for market research, is there a benefit to all of this data? Christian Rudder, co-founder of the online dating site OkCupid, thinks so. He’s been approaching the internet over the past decade as one big sociological experiment, and his new book, Dataclysm: Who We Are (When We Think No One’s Looking), explores his findings in depth, some of which are rather mind blowing.Penned in clear and witty prose and full of colorful charts and graphs, Dataclysm breezes by, though many of the insights linger, obsess, and often unsettle. We learn that if you apply network analysis to a couple’s groups of friends on Facebook, you can quite accurately predict how likely they are to stay together. And that Google searches beginning with the phrase “Is my husband…” most commonly end with “gay?” And that women tend to find men who are close to their age as the most attractive, whereas men, up until 50 years old, generally think that women in their early 20s look the best.Even in cases where the results reinforce long held views, what is new, Rudder asserts, “is our ability to test ideas, established ones, famous ones even, against the atomized actions of millions.” But the implications go beyond the sheer volume of the numbers. The ability we now have to track Google searches and site clicks provides us with much more accurate data, as these behaviors transcend the murkier self-reporting that plagues more traditional surveys, especially in regards to controversial topics. Rudder argues that the insights gleaned from all of this new data, even when the results are unflattering, are too beneficial to pass up, as they give us a far clearer and more accurate portrait of our true interests and behaviors.As Rudder frequently admits, the internet is still very young, which means that these data sets lack a long view. What Dataclysm does offer us, though, is another angle from which to consider our online lives. Whether you find the book’s content and approaches revelatory or creepy (at times I found them both), the results are fascinating and the ramifications huge. It reminds us that, as a sociological opportunity, we’re in the midst of a monumental sea change--one that is granting us astoundingly far-reaching insight into who we really are."

Then they prefer men a few years younger. Men find 20 year old women to be the most attractive--refardless of age (from 20-50 men all find women between 20-24 the most attractive)• Polarizing people get more attention--someone ranked with both very high & beauty ratings will receive more messages than someone with an equal average, but of more middle numbers• The smell of shit is added to perfumes and flowers, making the whole actually smell better• 74 men died of nostalgia in the Civil War (according to army records)• Twitter may actually be improving its users' writing ability--in both word length and density & brevity of ideas• More will be written on Twitter in the next 2 years, than all books ever published• 'God' has been in steady decline since the early 1800s--the word is used only about a third as much now as it was then• The best digital messages are only 40 to 60 characters long• One of the best compatibility questions is 'Do you like scary movies?' Answering the same to this question is more predictive of a successful long term relationship than 'big issues' like religion, politics, and looks• Black and White Quarterbacks perform equally down to the decimal: 81.55 (qb rating)• Zodiac signs have no effect on compatibility at all. Race has less effect than religion, politics, or education• 85% of OkCupid users have gone to college• Women are more 'race-loyal' than men in regards to attraction & relationships• 'White sounding' names get 50% more interviews with the exact same résumé as 'black sounding' names like 'Lakisha or 'Jamal'• On Facebook, every percentile of attractiveness gives a man two friends. It gives a woman three.• Often parents want their daughters to be pretty...but 'not too pretty.' Does anyone imagine limitations on a son?• Obama's race probably cost him 3 to 5 percentage points of the popular vote. The most popular Google search for the n-word in history was in Nov 2008, after he won. • 'Rumor' was a winged roman godess with 100 eyes and 100 mouths who spoke only the most hurtful side of the truth...(at least according to rumor)• The agenda of spreading a rumor is directed more for an audience, rather than the subject of a rumor• The Internet makes us vile creatures (see the 'online disinhibition effect')• The government has the greatest invested interest in tracking negativity. Mathematical models exist which predict the otcome of war, how long it will last, who will win, and how many will die• In 1950, the dawn of television, the American Political Science Association called for more polarization in national politics--the parties had grown too close together, the electorate didn't have clear choices. What made good television then, makes good television now, with 100 times the channels.• We seem to define ourselves as much by what we hate as by what we love• Stereotypes are true: white people self-differentiate themselves by their looks, Asians by their origin country, and Latinos by their music• What we don't talk about can be as illuminating as that which we do• Sex is the single most important grouping humanity has. It has existed forever--long before race or creed. In the US, all men were able to vote before women were. With that said, we are all fundamentally similar, much more so than our differences• The United States is divided: all but 4 presidential elections since 1952 would've flipped had 5% of the electorate changed their minds. Any group of people representing that number is therefore very important politically.• Gay porn searches show homosexuality occurs at the same rate nationwide. In less tolerant places however, gays are just more likely to stay in the closet to avoid persecution• In the US, the most popular Google search that begins with 'Is my husband...' most commonly ends in 'gay?' 'Cheating' comes up 10% less, and 'an alcoholic' occurs 8 times less, 'depressed' 10 times less.• Google Search data is ineffective for estimating the number of lesbians in the country, because straight men looking for porn throw off the data• The government counts everyone who's not married as 'single,' regardless of their actual relationship status• Gay and Straight people are looking for the same things in a relationship according to the numbers• Sexuality is more fluid than we realize: 51% of women and 18% of men have bad, or would like to have a same-sex experience• Who we say we are and how we behave are two separate things• Any nation is an 'Imagined Community'--comprised mostly of fellow numbers you'll never meet, and may share little in common with• The relocation of individuals in india & Southeast Asia, as well as the industrialization reflect England circa 1950, and the US 50 years later--driven by the economy, farmers move to city jobs for higher pay• The UK has 5.9 million security cameras: 1 for every 11 citizens• Search data uncovered drug side effects before they were discovered by the FDA warning system, revealing paroxetine and paravastatin can cause hypoglycemia in patients• Facebook was collecting 500 terabytes of information everyday...back in 2012• If you've ever signed up for a website with a fake zip code or fake birthday, you're a criminal--in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act• A 12 year old visiting newyorktimes.com is a criminal as well--violating their Terms of Service and the working doctrine of the US Department of Justice• Twitter usage by high school grads vs college educated is equal (17 & 18% respectively).

Not my finest several hours.What I like about this book is that it's based on data that's not collected by people putting up fronts or creating a persona. Shit's real. My favorite piece of data was that, relative to other identities, black men talk very little online about Social Distortion. This is definitely a stereotype that should gain some momentum. "
95,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,5,"Summary: One of the best data-driven books I have read. I think the title might be why there are so many haters. He presents a lot of tough issues using a medium ""dating"" that is relatable. Also, you should not try to read this on audiobook. You need to see the graphs. There are a lot of haters that present their background as if that's relevant in some way. It's not. B/c while they typically seem to understand data, they seem to lack reading comprehension skills. What Rudder is presenting is not findings from data work. He's attempting to use data as a backdrop to talk about a host of issues that are relevant in the modern era. The data is simply a view of what one might see. Instead of presenting some other social scientist's work, he's using in-house research, which, incidentally is a larger, better joined, more carefully collected, and larger geographical grouping than what most people have.Even if you find him to be less enlightening than his blog (I don't use twitter)-as some mentioned- I would guess this long-form argument could not be divined from the constraints of that medium of communication. He would have to be even more brilliant than I think he is just from reading this book!! Maybe... the guy is a Harvard grad..... But in case I'm right, below are my notes....p. 14 - ""If Big Data's two running stories have been about surveillance and money, for the last three years I've been working on third: the human story."" ""...as a close second, they're demographers of an unprecedented reach."" P. 15 - He talks about the fact that his purpose is to generalize so he can do his job of bringing people together at scale (not with individual nonsensical exceptions as discussed by A LOT of the haters!). He's trying to understand and infer from the data. And his inference work is wonderful, presenting possible misinterpretations that were tested and reviewed. p. 46 - Actually this entire chapter of how they essentially created a series of studies to demonstrate that variation in attractiveness get you noticed as much as attractiveness does. Freakin' Brilliant!p. 47 - Did not know there was a name to it: ""the Pratfall Effect"" - ""As long as you're generally competent, making a small, occasional mistake makes people think you're more competent. Flaws call out good stuff all the more."" p. 48 - It's better to ""Purposely abandon the middle road."" p. 53 - Regarding NLP work on Twitter...I love the hypothesis that Twitter might be improving its users' writing. This is all amazing stuff as relates to transformations in human language and has application in ways that are ignored even today.""he calculated the typical world length in Hamlet (3.99) and in a collection of Wodehouse's stories (4.05)... both less than the length in his Twitter sample (4.80).""""Comparative linguistics have long traced groups of community through language."" p. 54 - The chart on changing characteristics of speech patterns. The idea being that tribe creation is no longer geographically constrained, AND ALSO, you can catch it in the language used... something that we were NEVER able to do in the past (think Chinese, Cantonese, Mandarin, and the 50+ other dialects). Super nerdy awesome point.p. 62 - ""Sitewide, the copy-and-paste, strategy underperforms the from-scratch messaging about 25%, but in terms of effort-in results-out - it always wins: measuring by replies received to compose a new message each time."" What an awesome thing to take look at. Intriguing when you think about marketing/scaled response composition. p. 82 - Confounders. This is a great way to present this material so often ignored or misunderstood in the field. Generally, this chapter does a great job presenting a series of charts with each of the appropriate analysis points you'd ask in a row. I did not need the written part, but I can see why he has it. I can also see why some who read via audiobooks struggled. It would be hard to understand this book if all you had was the audio.Chapter 7: The Beauty Myth - The whole way he presents it in the context of thinking about his daughter is great. The work that supports it is fantastic. On eating disorders, he describes a possible place to look for solutions to help others....p. 104 ""... but before the behavior was digitized, there was practically no way to get directly at this problem, at least not until visible damage had already occurred. There was only rumor - an ear at the bathroom door, perhaps a parent's sad suspicion.""Chapter 8: p. 106-107. He talks about how b/c people don't tell you their deepest thoughts, you had to really work hard (snoop, catch people unguarded, etc) to figure out what they thought. Then he talks about the truthfulness of search engines like Google. How the mechanism itself is far harder to trick. This is REALLY important to what we think of as the fundamental changes in the types of data we now are able to collect. Chapter 9: There were a number of criticisms I read that lead back to this chapter and I think it might just have been unclear how to read the charts as well to think about it. That's a fair point. I think what he's trying to say is even in words there is racial signaling on both sides. If we think about the words we use to attract others and identify tribe, in the context of dating it's super apparent. For me, then I think about how this relates to concepts like code-switching in the workplace. We focus a lot on the accent, and we know vocabulary matters. But this implies something far deeper. If you read each of the lists and you clearly identify with one group, it's likely, you are farther culturally from other groups than just skin color. This is quite profound on anyone working on things like ""How do we create a single human race without such aberrant division."" Word. p. 155 - If you care at all about gay rights, these stats are important and also very sad. If I've got him correct- and these are the footnotes, we're underestimating the gay population of the US by a lot and most are NOT dating b/c they are socially unable to do so, either because they are in the closet and scared to be themselves or there are structural reasons in their community that prevent them from self-expression. Chapter 12- Great segue into the work on migration, which covers not an only lifestyle choice but also works availability and more. This work is really relevant for - what is not mentioned, the dying cities phenomenon. p. 181 - He's arguing against things like Klout scores. This is why I do not understand the arguments that he doesn't want to drill in or he's missing some sort of causality.. he's not. This book is about what the general number are telling you out of various inferences that are possible.p. 184 - Mountain Dew Story. A great example of what not to crowdsource.p. 186 - ""If employers begin to use algorithms to infer how intelligent you are or whether you use drugs, then your only choice will be to game the system - or to borrow the wording from the previous chapter, 'manage your brand.' To beat the machine, you must act like a machine, which means you've lost to the machine. And that's assuming you can guess what you're supposed to do in the first place. Apparently, one of the strongest correlates to intelligence in the research was liking 'curly fries.' Who could reverse engineer that?p. 187 - very intersting comments on survellience and data use by the government. p. 193 - He talks about the pennies from personal data payments will not amount ot anything that actually helps people. Moreover, it is highly likely to just be passed back through to consumers."

I only got to 60% before the book was over and the notes began (and on a Kindle flipping back and forth is, for me, a pain). Also meat-wise, I was expecting something along the lines of Outlers, which of course this is the opposite of in theme since it looks at the trends of all and not the accomplishments of a few. But I wanted it to be a book I remembered long after. It's really not. Although it's an interesting read while you're in it. Big Data, when it matures, means so much info that will be longitudinal, something data analysts struggle with ever getting enough of, so in that sense this is very exciting, and it's amazing what we can tell already from the little we have.I do think the book suffered mightily by being read on a Kindle (or any e-reader, especially black and white). The graphs used red and it was not always easy to tell what was gray because it was red and what was gray because it was gray--or if anything was really gray. Since much of this book runs off the graphs, that it's a bad thing not to be able to fully read them (and at the size they were at on my Paperwhite, I also felt challenged to really dive in). I did love reading that the author was a disciple of sorts of Tufte. And I appreciated the amount of info given in the charts.I had a hard time getting through the first chapter. I think the author left out a primary reason male and female reactions to potential partners' age might change (or not) over time depending on gender--and normally I'd give him a break on this since it's from another field of study, but since he runs an online dating site and is reporting on that robust data set, then I'd expect him to understand the drives of men (be drawn to young and fertile no matter how old they get) and women (pick a good provider--until she reaches a certain age, realizes she is not going to need a provider (either because she does not have kids or because she provides just fine for herself), and then go for something young and fun). This behavior has been well documented and while I thought he was going to touch on it at one point, it really didn't happen enough for me to ever get that comfortable with the first example out of the gate. That said, I didn't have that issue with the rest of the book, so I did keep going and many of the sections were novel and interesting."
97,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24217018-matt,3,"This is a very quick read which, given the number of visuals, is not surprising. The visuals, though, are beautiful, always tell a story, and never waste a drop of ink on unnecessary information. These images reflect the book...for the most part. It's when the narrative steers away from its stated purpose (a data driven exploration of human nature) that I started to tire of Christian Rudders narrative voice. It's funny, irreverent, and insightful for most of the book and especially for the sections discussing OkCupid data. He writes best about the data he knows best and that's not surprising. But as the book advances Rudder starts to draw on unfamiliar datasets, make less rigorous assertions, and veer into both data fear-mongering and data evangelism. It was disappointing mostly because he promised to write a different kind of book than those which use data as a lens to prove the downfall of society or privacy, or predict incredible advances in technology and public intelligence. He asserts this book is special then proceeds to speculate about how invasive the NSA can be, how Twitter is unleashing our base instincts but also improving our vocabulary, and how online branding is the future of self evaluation. These parts were, in truth, boring compared to the insights about romantic relationship. In summary, I'm not sure where this book fits in the social science and statistics cannon. It's not the most insightful or the most fun, which leaves it somewhere in between and probably only worth picking up if you love the genre. "
98,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35538316-lindy,3,"I feel like I write this in every nonfiction book review, but I wished there was more depth! I also wished someone more, I don't know, anthropologically minded had given this book a once over before publication. For example, Rudder treats data showing that bisexual men are more likely to prefer/message other men on OkCupid when compared to older bisexual men as if it were longitudinal, and implies that bi men's sexual preferences change as they get older. However he does not take into account what these men may be doing off the service; a young bisexual man will probably hit on women at a bar, but is at a considerably greater risk of being decked in the face if he were to do so to men. As the dating pool grows smaller with age, he may turn to the internet to scope out both genders. (To be fair, Rudder  does responsibly account for a similar phenomenon showing that North Dakotans are surprisingly liberal when it comes to causual sex in the next chapter and why that isn't the case.) Likewise, Rudder says that ""yass,"" which turns up in a list of words distinctive of popular twitter users, is a contraction of ""your ass."" This is true, but it's definitely not the most popular use. Nonetheless, Dataclysm is an interesting and accessible book, and I imagine it would be especially so to someone with no background in statistics. I appreciated that the author had a sense of humor, and I don't think (reading in 2017) that it has aged poorly, although it would have been helpful if Rudder had cited years in the text rather than simply ""last year."""
99,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33131867-neha,3,"I had seen a significant portion of the material before on the blog, but it's still worth a read. I loved the informal voice, and the use of various graphs to illustrate new findings. It read like a collection of smaller articles with specific results.A lot of the OkCupid data revealed particular preferences of men and women in terms of age, attractiveness, and ethnicity. I can understand why the overall findings may be upsetting, and I think readers should be cautious about how this actually applies to their lives. This book is not trying to give insider tips for finding more dates. I think it's very important to remember that there is an inherent selection bias in the OkCupid data: it only represents people who have, for one reason or another, decided to try online dating.I thought the book was going to be more about OkCupid's dataset, but I appreciated the discussions about Google, Facebook, and Twitter data. The last chapter describes the ongoing conflict of privacy that is absent from earlier chapters. While giving users complete ownership of their data may seem to solve many problems, I tend to disagree that it's entirely possible. Services can certainly provide an option for users to remove their data from the site, but once data is on the Internet, I think it's safe to assume that it will never fully disappear."
100,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11500849-jen,1,"A sloppy and irresponsible introduction to big data analytics. Taking a popular science approach, the book glosses over key tenets of every day data science, like basic hypothesis testing. It also makes grand, sweeping generalizations about society as a whole where none can be made based on the population of the data (OK Cupid members hardly represent a random sampling of the US population).Some of the more egregious statements include ""There are times when a data set is so robust that if you set up your analysis right, you don't need to ask questions - it just tells you everything anyway"" and ""people are already compensated for their data: They get to use services like Facebook and Google...for free.""Putting the author's disregard of personal privacy aside, the narrative voice is filled with white male privilege. A few sections of the book made me generally uncomfortable in its approach to conversations about race, gender, and heterosexual relationships. We need a book about data science that highlights the process in a way that digital users can understand how their data is being analyzed and who is doing it responsibly. This is not it."

If you check, or look at a picture of the NSA (Why does an office building need a radar dome on the roof?), you will see that has always been their job.

Your sex, your race, your sexual orientation, your income, your politics, your IQ (from the type of French fries you like), it's all an open book. This book is the story from one involved nerd, along with some nice graphics.People's activities are somewhat limited, so the use of this data is mostly to target you for repression or elimination in a repressive society, to sell you something in a capitalist society, or for law enforcement to find you.

The basis of the book is a dozen or so interesting statistical points, with a chapter of conversational description for each. I'm curious where these statistical insights actually come from. Did the author pore over data for months? It doesn't feel that way. They have the feeling of nuggets gleaned from interns working over a period of years, that never ended up being useful anywhere else. Certainly, the discussion the author offers almost no isights beyond the immediately obvious. It isn't clear enough to be a good introduction to statistics, nor in-depth enough to offer interest to statisticians.The best chapters are the early ones oriented towards anyone trying to game the system a little on dating sites. How long message should be, what the opposite sex is looking for for someone your age, etc. The later chapters, trying to offer larger insights about culture and language are ... not convincing. Problematic, even."

It celebrates the fact that the amount of data that we have on people's actual beliefs and desires (as opposed to their stated beliefs) and breaks down what a lot of these data sets mean. A lot of it is very funny, even while it may be disturbing in its implications.For the first two-thirds, it was really interesting to me and had a lot of, if not surprising, at least very relevant things to say about human behaviors.The last third kind of drifted off into parts of the data that I am not too concerned with personally and the author's thoughts on what the future will be. It is not necessarily bad, just not what I was looking for, and also, a bit more broad than the particulars of the earlier chapters. "

Race, identity and the many differences between women and men in their approach to sex and relationship are shown here through data from an online dating website (OkCupid). I think the book presents valuable insights about racism because it observes actually behavior rather than self-reported questions.Some of the interesting book's find is the following:* Both black men and black women are strongly rejected in online dating* The women who received more attention of men aren't the more beautiful but those who have the high variance in their ratings (men can't say if they are beautiful or not).* Most people (~90%) who declare themselves bisexual is indeed heterosexual or homosexual.* Straight women are less propense to search only casual sex in online datingA negative thing is that the book contains a lot of digressions."

The possibilities of big data seem scary and exciting at the same time. This book presents them in a very accessible way to the average reader. I was skeptical of some the conclusions that the author presented but there's a lot of good conversation starters here. However, I don't think much of it will stick with me in the long run.I probably didn't make the best choice by listening to this on audiobook where numbers in charts were read out for minutes hahaOverall, a short, enjoyable, and timely read if you want to delve into popular science books."

Note sure whether the lack of mathematical analysis is a blessing or not - I guess that would depend on how capable the writer is - but much of the content, while interesting is a ""firm grasp of the obvious."""

109,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8886042-michelle,2,"Dataclysm: Who We Are When We Think No One's Looking by Christian Rudder is an interesting and fact filled book. I received an Advance Reader's Copy from Crown Publishing, a division of Random House and my opinions were formed by my reading of this uncorrected proof. Author Christian Rudder is one of the founders of the dating website OKCupid and he draws his research for this book primarily from the data that has been collected from paying members who are looking for relationships. He additionally mines data from other social media resources, dating services like Match.com and websites, and his pool of subjects include a cross section of the population that he believes is an excellent barometer for the opinions of Americans today. This book is filled with charts and maps and images to help you easily understand the data he has sourced and how it applies to the ""everyman"" in all of us.This book approaches a wide variety of topics - relationships, personal preferences, age, gender, race and upbringing and tries to answer the question ""Who are we really?"" by examining what we say versus how we act. Although I felt like I came away with a bunch of quotable tidbits and an interesting peek into how the data that we so freely place on the internet is used, I'm not quite sure that I learned very much about myself from this book. Many of the observances seemed rational to me and not all that thought provoking, and although some applied to me I didn't walk away feeling like I had much personal insight. A few of the passages left me feeling uneasy, simply because I'm not sure all the members of OKCupid were willing test subjects in Mr. Rudder's data laboratory. In one memorable instance photos of users were shown in an illustration of women who had very high and very low scores from fellow users in terms of their appeal. Although he was using them to make a point about the importance of having a photo that provokes a strong reaction is better than having a commonly pretty picture (which he describes as ""meh"") and he expressly thanks the subjects for their consent to be included in the book and to have their photos discussed, it still felt mildly squicky. Although the many other charts and illustrations in the book didn't deal in this same very personal representation of data, I did question the author's use of the OKCupid site at times. Although it may all be perfectly legal it makes me ask ""do I need to know this?"" and ""is the use of this data justified in a bigger, insight gaining way that makes it important to a reader?"" I'm not sure I have the answer to those questions.  As a collection of facts and data there were definitely a few things I hadn't thought about before - for example, there is a chart showing the 100 most common words used in the English language today from the Oxford English Corpus (a collection of modern writing's approach to vocabulary and word use) versus the top 100 used to express yourself on Twitter in the form of the service's 140 character tweet posts. It showed that although you may think the language of Twitter would somewhat abbreviate or diminish your ideas to get your point across, actually a person composing a tweet is much more selective and thoughtful about what their words will convey. It may help us to write clearer and in a concise style that contributes to an overall awareness of language. That awareness filters into the speech and style of a Twitter user versus a non-user. I liked the idea that my tweeting may help me generate a better and more vivid use of language. Still I kept returning to the fact that this book didn't really live up to the ""portrait of our essential selves"" claim that it was intended to be. It isn't a bad book. I just wish that I had a greater takeaway as a reader.One thing that truly irked me about this book is the mention of a website link where you could go, punch in your own data (two Facebook usernames) and get a personal illustration to see one of the ideas in this book in action. In the fourth chapter titled ""You Gotta be the Glue"" there is an illustration showing the overlap of the author's Facebook friends and his wife's friend's. He explains in depth how we create clusters of people in our lives that know us from a specific point of view - our work friends, childhood acquaintances, family members etc. Our spouse or significant other can overlap our Facebook friendships in many categories. Perhaps you are both friends with your parents and share relationships with other couples you met while you both attended a ballroom dance lesson. The shared connections can illustrate the bonds we have as couples, and can show you the places in your relationships that have a strong and meaningful connection. I thought this sounded really cool and was happy to find an example that could be personalized to me and allowed me to be a willing participant in the experiment to see how it felt. Unfortunately this awesome personalized tool simply doesn't exist. I have tried the link dozens of times over the past few weeks and didn't post my thoughts on the book since I wanted to see this chart in action, but it still gives me a ""Page Not Found"" message. The book's publication date is set for Tuesday September 9th, and since this is Saturday the 6th I would think that it would be active. I hope it will go live on Tuesday at the very least. I contacted the author through his Twitter page about the lack of a working link and received no response, however another reviewer on Goodreads said that when they contacted him through email they received a response that it would be functional by the end of August. If I had paid for this book rather than receiving an ARC I would be even more disappointed. The one big opportunity to gain personal insight is so far, a bust.If you find the sort of data in this book interesting I would check it out of the library or wait for the book to be marked down. I wouldn't consider it a must read but I am thankful I had the opportunity to read it. I hope you find this useful information, and I will update my opinion if the link works on the publication date. For now I can only give this book 2 of 5 stars. "
110,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5177572-genevieve,4,"* Originally reviewed on the Night Owls Press blog here. *First, it was the Internet. The Internet was going to change how businesses and organized operated. It was going to change how people live. But now something else has enthralled our imagination: big data.What is big data? We couldn't have big data without the Web. Our shift to online activity has made it easier to record and document massive reams of data and data trails about seemingly everything: Where do we go when we're online? What do we do? What do we read? The idea behind big data is that scientists can analyze that activity and parse out that information, information that might predict what we would do in hypothetical situations, or what we would be likely to do in the future. This largely possible because of scale. It's not about analyzing a person, a hundred people, or a thousand people; it's about waves and waves of information, millions and millions of data points.Think about how far we've come. In the third century BC, the first great repository of human knowledge was the Library of Alexandria. Today information is available in the exabytes. (What is an exabyte? Um...it's really, really big.) Big data is about size, but it's more than that. It's the fact that we have computers and databases that will log and analyze micro-activities, actions as simple as Facebook ""likes,"" our location recorded by the GPS in our phones, and the ""number of seconds or minutes spent reading a web page.""Dataclysm Who We Are When We Think No One's Looking by Christian Rudder sheds light on what that kind of datafication looks like. Rudder himself is the cofounder of OkCupid, the online dating site, which lives and breathes on seemingly mystical algorithms that dice and chop up streams of data. No other person might be more qualified to give us an insider's account on what big data can do.Rudder dabbles in statistical, psychological, and sociological theories and drills the chapters with clever infographics and beautifully rendered scatterplots—and some of them are truly works of art. (I used to work in data so I have a soft spot for data scientists and their work.) But where Rudder really excels is in the smorgasbord of findings. Patterns emerge from the data. Stare into the matrix and you'll see...a mirror into your very soul. At least that's what Rudder wants us to believe.You might be put off by Rudder's focus on dating sites but that's his métier. The trove of information on social interactions alone on dating sites is weirdly fascinating. In one example, Rudder finds that dating profiles of women who have a polarizing physical appearance are more likely to be approached for dates than the conventionally attractive person. (Is it fascination with novelty? boredom with the same 'ole, same 'ole?) Aren't we all at our most earnest and neurotic when it comes to love and relationships?A downside of this book is that if you read or pay attention to the tech news cycle, you may find some of Rudder's examples ho-hum repeats. For example, we've seen Google Trends tackle the flu in a kind of digital epidemiology approach. Nothing new there. Rudder retells these stories not to just fill the pages though but to constantly keep the beat of this book, which is asking deeper questions about who are we as a culture?Another downside is that even with all the reams of data and stats Rudder throws at us, ultimately, these are just cool factoids. It's an impressive avalanche of interesting data tidbits, but still just tidbits. The next challenge for big data: figuring out what truly matters, narrowing it down, cutting the noise.The heart of what makes big data interesting is that it's research that isn't gathered merely from surveys or interviews or even randomized control trial experiments, which we all know can be biased for a variety of reasons: subjects don't understand the questions, subjects lie, people obfuscate, they unconsciously modify their behavior to please researchers. Here the data is based on actual behavior in situ. And we can learn something from it, we can see patterns and discern behaviors that were otherwise invisible. It's like studying people in the wild.Most books about data are dry and boring, but Dataclysm is one that makes a mark. Part of this is Rudder staying grounded in primary data and real analysis. But an even bigger part is Rudder's never-stale writing style. Yes, the book is still pop-social science. This might frustrate a few bona fide data scientists out there. But Dataclysm works. The amusing stories and asides sprinkled throughout the book are full of zest but are never fluffy. For a numbers person, a Harvard-honed math-y guy working in Silicon Valley, Dataclysm is a remarkably fluid and readable book.Big data isn't the answer to the universe, the meaning of life, or to your other burning existential questions, but you'll still become privy to some interesting discoveries about culture and society.[Disclaimer: I received this book from Blogging for Books for an honest and candid review.] "

112,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16880570-khari,1,"Three months.Three months to listen to a book seven and a half hours long. Normally I can get one of those out in a week. Nope. Three months.I'm really tired of these books with fascinating titles that just disappoint.This book made me understand why people shout 'Science' at each other. It's because authors like this either underestimate their audience and dumb down what they have done, or they have terrible methodologies themselves and don't even realize it.For a book about data which necessarily must include statistics, there is a shocking dearth of statistic lingo in this book. He tries to justify himself in the end. His intention was to write a popular science book and he didn't want to clutter it with jargon like 'p', and 'confidence interval' and fun stuff like that. And, hey, I get it. I don't completely understand statistics yet, but even I know that words like 'significant' have a particular meaning that has to be defined in the world of numbers, but he never defines his terms. He says the methodology he used was 'rigorous' and it went through something 'like peer review' but never defines what his methodology was, and his 'peer review' was for his underling (who he knew btw) to check his numbers. That's not peer review. Hate to break it to you. Peer review is done by someone who does not know who wrote the paper, and they look over the whole paper, including the hypotheses and the conclusions as well as the number. It's not someone whose job is in your hands checking your math. But I know why he chose to do it this way. It's because there is no way on this planet that this atrocity would have ever been published in a good scientific journal....wait...let me rephrase that. Considering that there have been cases of complete hoax papers being published it is remotely possible that it could have been published in a badly edited, badly curated, motivated reasoning filled journal. Because that's what this was. Badly edited, badly curated, filled with motivated reasoning, and worst of all, terrible methodology that is never explained. This book couldn't hack it in the scientific publishing world so he had to go to a subsidiary of Penguin, Crown Publishing, that focuses on hobbies, memoirs, biographies, autobiographies, cooking, lifestyle, business and nonfiction. And honestly, that makes a ton of sense, because this reads more like a memoir than a book of scientific rigor. He makes unfounded claims, presents his interpretation as fact, and only considers one explanation for everything that he finds interesting.The part that absolutely killed me was he is talking about corpus linguistics. Corpus linguistics is gathering really large bodies of texts and making it searchable. There are a bunch of free ones out there, such as the Corpus of Contemporary American English (affectionately known as COCA), for your perusal. They have a bunch of ways of analyzing, you can look at the most used words, you can look at the collocations (the words immediately preceding and following a word), you can look at the word families that are used, the lexemes that are used, the type of word that most appears, the contexts in which words appear, which is a really good way to find out what a word actually means in use, in contrast to how it is defined in the dictionary. Corpus linguistics just happens to be my baby. It was my focus in my master's program and it's my focus in my PHD program. And guess what? I know nothing about it. I've already spent three years learning about it, and I'm going to go spend another 2-6, and I've read peer-reviewed articles about it, talked to experts, and read books about it, and I still know nothing, but I know enough to know that how he's using it is mind bogglingly bogus. He basically does character counting. He counts how many words show up in a tweet, calculates the mean character length, then compares it to the mean character length in Shakespeare and concludes that since the mean character length in tweets is longer, people today are using language in a more nuanced way than Shakespeare was....mean character length. Or his other technique was to make a word list of the most used words and show that it was similar to Shakespeare because 'the' and 'a' appeared at the top. No duh Sherlock, they're function words. They happen to be required every time you are referring to a singular noun. They would show up at the top of the word list of this review as well and that would mean nothing about the similarity between reviews and tweets. They are different registers who both follow the rules of the English language, ergo, functional words such as articles and pronouns and prepositions would occur more often simply because they are closed classes that are requisite for forming phrases that make sense.So there you go, a very brief, cogent rebuttal for one of his most important methods of analysis. But that rebuttal is actually rebutting his intention, not what he actually did. What he actually did was include, on his erstwhile 'word' list, things like 'the', 'a', ''s', 'Peru' 'my blue eyes', 'tall for an Asian', etc. .........How, in the name of all that is grounded in the study of linguistics, can those things be defined as 'words'?!?!? What definition is he using?!? He isn't using one! He's just conglomerating everything that he finds interesting together and calling it a 'word' while not even recognizing that what he finds interesting is subjective! It's not a parameter by which to define something! At first I was like, huh, is he using morphemes as the basis of his 'word'? ""'s"" would be the the third person possessive morpheme, I can see that, after all 'the' 'a' and 'Peru' are all single morpheme words. But then you have 'my blue eyes' that's not a word, that's a phrase! All of the words in that phrase aren't even single morpheme words! So why on earth does the third person possessive deserve its own place of glory but the plural 's' does not!?!This is the problem with popular 'science' books. People read them, feel like they are now informed and use the same arguments that they read about without ever realizing that the books aren't science. There is no scientific method in this book. He never defines his terms, he barely defines his variables. He has a million variables, and doesn't distinguish between them. It's not an experimental study so it's fine that he doesn't have a control group, but he should be trying to make the groups that he is splitting people into as uniform as possible and he doesn't even really attempt it. His variables are men and women, black, white, Asian, and Hispanic. He never even limited his findings to people from the USA. He just assumed that everyone was. He never factored in educational status which would have a huge impact, and that information actually is in the data set, so he could have, but he didn't. He didn't even mention it as a confound! And that's just the point. Everything is a conclusion for him. He argued that there are certain topics that are anathema to certain groups because the word denoting that topic only appears once. No. It does not mean that they are anathema to that group. I can think of a dozen reasons why someone would choose not to put something that they are interested in onto a public forum. I am pretty sure that an Otolaryngologist is not going to put that as their profession on OKCupid, simply because most people don't know what that means, they are just going to go with 'doctor' because it's simpler and gets the point across. That doesn't mean that otolarynogology is a taboo subject because it's only mentioned once. And besides, the fact that it is mentioned at all is already proof positive that it is not a taboo subject, taboo subjects are epitomized by never being mentioned at all and referred to circularly. So why didn't he mention all the other terms that are never mentioned, like muons and antileptons? (No, I don't know what those are either). The self-introductions on OKCupid (which is what he studied) are texts designed to elicit a certain response. They are a specific register, a register that each writer assumes will be the most likely to get them what they want, a date. As such they are inherently not generalizable to populations as a whole. They are only generalizable as 'the words that people use to try and present themselves as a satisfactory date'. There is a purpose behind it and it shows only a very small subset of language use, taking it to mean that it epitomizes someone's character and identity is horrifying. People change how they talk constantly. They talk differently when they write as compared to when they speak. They talk differently depending on if they know their audience or not. They talk differently depending on the power dynamics of the situation. They talk differently depending on how they are feeling at the moment. Studying the language used in self-introductory texts on OKCupid is very interesting and a worthwhile subject in and of itself, but you cannot generalize out to the public. The people on OKCupid are not a random selection of people, they are self-selected to be rather outgoing, not so privacy concerned, not willing to spend their money on web-dating, mostly singly people who are interested in romantic liaisons. They are, according to his own admission of the data, mostly liberal and progressive, mostly college educated, those account for 31% and 34% of the US population respectively. That is not even broken down by sex or race, if I were to spend the time doing that it would show an even smaller portion of the population for each, you can't generalize out to everyone else in the US based on a sub population. That would be like saying 50% of the population of the US are women, and women generally score higher in compassion, therefore the US is a compassionate nation...what? That doesn't even make sense.Finally, the thing that really just made me crack up was when he said ""and I say this as someone who is reflexively critical of the left."" That made me die. Why, why did that make me die? Because it doesn't mean what you think it means. It doesn't mean that he automatically looks at what people on the left say critically. It doesn't mean that his automatic response is to be skeptical. It means to embrace your subjective understandings of reality as a basis for analyzing social interactions. Being reflexively critical is a tenet of feminist post-structuralist analysis, or you could also argue that it is a postmodern, post-Marxist analysis as well. Regardless of who you decide is the ultimate progenitor of such an idea, it remains an ideology of the left. By using it he showed that he was on the left. By trying to present himself as a balanced and disinterested analyzer he showed himself to be controlled by a particular worldview."
113,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51602586-dominika,4,"A good soft introduction on data analysis, particularly in regards to human interaction. I thought it was fun and simple enough for the layman, but not simple to the point that it's lying about the capacity of what big data can do (as an example, I deal with a lot of research participants who do not have an email or do not use their email often). I really appreciated him talking about the limitations, as well as some qualitative methods and how they can be used. The whole point of all this is to see how our private, online behavior is actually a great insight into the human condition. Like how the rate of gay porn consumption is the same across every state, and what factors are important to each racial group. I know I made this sound super boring but it isn't. "

But, what if they had hundreds of thousands, or tens of millions of customers a day? How much would they learn about what music people like, if they could somehow deal with that many customers a day?What if, instead of a music store, people came to your store to find something more personal, like a girlfriend or boyfriend?Welcome to the book Dataclysm, where one of the founders of the website OkCupid shows us just what every website you ever use is able to tell about you. That's slightly an exaggeration, of course; dating websites do get a view of us that is a little different than most. But then, Amazon sees you when you put your money where your mouth is. Google sees what you're trying to find, or find out about, or where you're finding directions to. Facebook, of course, probably knows who your real friends are better than what you are willing to admit out loud.If you get creeped out easily by the loss of secrecy (otherwise known as ""privacy"", when it's secrecy that we like) that comes from using the Internet, this is probably not the book for you.However, if you like to leaven your opinions about topics like race (and racism) and sex (and sexism) with some actual data (not just your own personal experience), this book is a revelation.

115,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4579658-rob-kitchin,2,"The stated aim of Dataclysm is to introduce lay readers to the era of big data, the possibilities of such data, and the types of analysis used to make sense of them. The problems with the book start with the title and subtitle, neither of which, I think, make much sense. Dataclysm, Rudder explains, is a play on cataclysm: the wiping away of one era to be replaced by a new one. However, big data is set to complement small data, not wipe them away as small data are generated to answer specific questions rather than being a by-product that is then repurposed, and most big data are held by private corporations or government and are not readily open to researchers. All of the data that Rudder analyzes is from social media; they are data produced precisely because we think someone is looking (for a date, for conversation, for information, to provoke a reaction, etc). Uploading information to the internet is largely a process of the presentation of the self, as Goffman’s famous theory would frame the activity. Even if other people cannot see the answers to direct questions, as when filling in questions on a dating site, the answers shape the user profile and the process of matching -- something that users are aware of, consider and present to.The book then proceeds by discussing social media data and what they might reveal about human behaviour and society. Crucially, however, there is no systematic discussion of big data per se, its forms and characteristics, no discussion of data analytics, and only a cursory discussion of the many ethical, social and political implications of such data. There is no discussion of statistics, or statistical tests performed on the data presented, nor data mining, data analytics, machine learning, pattern recognition, profiling, prediction, etc. The irony here is that Rudder’s company – OkCupid – employs these techniques to be able to process and match potential partners, yet he never explains how this is achieved. Instead, the entire analysis is rooted in the empiricist form of data science, rather than data-driven science, and never proceeds beyond description. As such, the analysis of gender and race he presents are based on a ‘letting the data speak for themself’ approach and constitutes armchair interpretation. He barely engages with the vast academic literature on quantitative analysis of race and gender that has taken place for several decades using large data sets such as the census or public administration data. Rudder has access to an enormous set of very interesting data that could be used to conduct some fascinating sociological and psychological analysis. Instead what we get are a series of descriptive statistics and banal revelations, most of which are already well established. The result is a book that hints at the potential of big data and data science but undersells it substantially, and it under-estimates in my view the readership level of its potential audience by never progressing beyond mathematics and data visualisations used in junior school. In contrast, books such as The Signal and the Noise by Nate Silver provide a much wider and deeper discussion. This is a shame as Rudder is an engaging writer and he has privileged access to an extremely rich social data that could be used to conduct some wonderful and sophisticated social science research. Such rich research and its policy implications are barely hinted at."
116,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8684527-andra-n,5,"I postponed reading Dataclysm for some time, but I’m glad I took my time to read it. Its author, Christian Rudder first caught my attention in an article written after the Facebook scandal over the experiments made over its users, where he explained in a rather unapologetic manner, that this is the very nature of internet’s success and efficiency increase. His opinion is a consequence of his experience running the dating site OkCupid where decisions based on people’s behavior must be made in order to obtain optimal results. “It’s a delicate illusion, the Internet.”Dataclysm is a book about Big Data and Romantic behavior. However, it is definitely not a recipe for making a perfect profile or having more success on social networks. This book is rather a series of conclusions drawn from the aggregated data obtained from millions of interactions mainly from sites like OkCupid and other social networks or Google. This is not the story of the individual, it is the story of the collective. What distinguishes the work of Christian Rudder is that given his privileged position at OKCupid, he had in hand large amounts of data with which he could play and analyze freely. As opposed to other studies of human behavior that have as subjects mostly a bunch of students from well-known universities, his data sets contain personal information of people of all ages and races, from the US. This book has lots of pop-culture references, amusing and sometimes insightful comments. What is most intriguing about his studies is the fact that they are made over information that we rather think it is private. We get a glimpse of our rather politically incorrect behaviors as human beings.I found particularly interesting the comparison between woman preferences and man preferences when it comes to a potential partner’s age, attractiveness and race. Humor is not left out of the book, as the paragraph depicting women ratings of attractiveness of men: “Only one guy in six is “above average” in an absolute sense. Sex appeal isn’t something commonly quantified like this, so let me put it in a more familiar context: translate this plot to IQ, and you have a world where the women think 58 percent of men are brain damaged.”The comparison of words most commonly used by people on their dating profiles from different races or sexual orientation was also a chapter that I found quite interesting. The author shows via text analysis that several race related patterns emerge. “White people differentiate themselves mostly by their hair and eyes, Asians by their country of origin, Latinos by their music. But because of the way the math is set up, the three non-white lists are evidence of cultures that I, as a white man, am not supposed to know…the gay male list is very different from the other three. It’s full of pop culture and has comparatively few references to the user’s immediate person and family.”I would definitely recommend this book that tackles a wide range of topics to anyone who is interested in data science as well as those curious about the weirdness of human nature."
117,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18688-cody,4,"Much e-ink has been spilled--rightfully so--about the brave new world we live online. Targeted advertising, data breaches, the NSA; it’s easy to grow overwhelmed by the potential dangers of sharing personal information electronically. Practically everything we do on our phones and computers is tracked, often in an effort to sell us something or gain some upper hand (financially, politically, socially, etc.). Consequentially, there is now an unprecedented amount of detailed data about us that's ripe for the parsing.Beyond the obvious advantages for market research, is there a benefit to all of this data? Christian Rudder, co-founder of the online dating site OkCupid, thinks so. He’s been approaching the internet over the past decade as one big sociological experiment, and his new book, Dataclysm: Who We Are (When We Think No One’s Looking), explores his findings in depth, some of which are rather mind blowing.Penned in clear and witty prose and full of colorful charts and graphs, Dataclysm breezes by, though many of the insights linger, obsess, and often unsettle. We learn that if you apply network analysis to a couple’s groups of friends on Facebook, you can quite accurately predict how likely they are to stay together. And that Google searches beginning with the phrase “Is my husband…” most commonly end with “gay?” And that women tend to find men who are close to their age as the most attractive, whereas men, up until 50 years old, generally think that women in their early 20s look the best.Even in cases where the results reinforce long held views, what is new, Rudder asserts, “is our ability to test ideas, established ones, famous ones even, against the atomized actions of millions.” But the implications go beyond the sheer volume of the numbers. The ability we now have to track Google searches and site clicks provides us with much more accurate data, as these behaviors transcend the murkier self-reporting that plagues more traditional surveys, especially in regards to controversial topics. Rudder argues that the insights gleaned from all of this new data, even when the results are unflattering, are too beneficial to pass up, as they give us a far clearer and more accurate portrait of our true interests and behaviors.As Rudder frequently admits, the internet is still very young, which means that these data sets lack a long view. What Dataclysm does offer us, though, is another angle from which to consider our online lives. Whether you find the book’s content and approaches revelatory or creepy (at times I found them both), the results are fascinating and the ramifications huge. It reminds us that, as a sociological opportunity, we’re in the midst of a monumental sea change--one that is granting us astoundingly far-reaching insight into who we really are."

Then they prefer men a few years younger. Men find 20 year old women to be the most attractive--refardless of age (from 20-50 men all find women between 20-24 the most attractive)• Polarizing people get more attention--someone ranked with both very high & beauty ratings will receive more messages than someone with an equal average, but of more middle numbers• The smell of shit is added to perfumes and flowers, making the whole actually smell better• 74 men died of nostalgia in the Civil War (according to army records)• Twitter may actually be improving its users' writing ability--in both word length and density & brevity of ideas• More will be written on Twitter in the next 2 years, than all books ever published• 'God' has been in steady decline since the early 1800s--the word is used only about a third as much now as it was then• The best digital messages are only 40 to 60 characters long• One of the best compatibility questions is 'Do you like scary movies?' Answering the same to this question is more predictive of a successful long term relationship than 'big issues' like religion, politics, and looks• Black and White Quarterbacks perform equally down to the decimal: 81.55 (qb rating)• Zodiac signs have no effect on compatibility at all. Race has less effect than religion, politics, or education• 85% of OkCupid users have gone to college• Women are more 'race-loyal' than men in regards to attraction & relationships• 'White sounding' names get 50% more interviews with the exact same résumé as 'black sounding' names like 'Lakisha or 'Jamal'• On Facebook, every percentile of attractiveness gives a man two friends. It gives a woman three.• Often parents want their daughters to be pretty...but 'not too pretty.' Does anyone imagine limitations on a son?• Obama's race probably cost him 3 to 5 percentage points of the popular vote.

Mathematical models exist which predict the otcome of war, how long it will last, who will win, and how many will die• In 1950, the dawn of television, the American Political Science Association called for more polarization in national politics--the parties had grown too close together, the electorate didn't have clear choices. What made good television then, makes good television now, with 100 times the channels.• We seem to define ourselves as much by what we hate as by what we love• Stereotypes are true: white people self-differentiate themselves by their looks, Asians by their origin country, and Latinos by their music• What we don't talk about can be as illuminating as that which we do• Sex is the single most important grouping humanity has. It has existed forever--long before race or creed. In the US, all men were able to vote before women were. With that said, we are all fundamentally similar, much more so than our differences• The United States is divided: all but 4 presidential elections since 1952 would've flipped had 5% of the electorate changed their minds. Any group of people representing that number is therefore very important politically.• Gay porn searches show homosexuality occurs at the same rate nationwide. In less tolerant places however, gays are just more likely to stay in the closet to avoid persecution• In the US, the most popular Google search that begins with 'Is my husband...' most commonly ends in 'gay?' 'Cheating' comes up 10% less, and 'an alcoholic' occurs 8 times less, 'depressed' 10 times less.• Google Search data is ineffective for estimating the number of lesbians in the country, because straight men looking for porn throw off the data• The government counts everyone who's not married as 'single,' regardless of their actual relationship status• Gay and Straight people are looking for the same things in a relationship according to the numbers• Sexuality is more fluid than we realize: 51% of women and 18% of men have bad, or would like to have a same-sex experience• Who we say we are and how we behave are two separate things• Any nation is an 'Imagined Community'--comprised mostly of fellow numbers you'll never meet, and may share little in common with• The relocation of individuals in india & Southeast Asia, as well as the industrialization reflect England circa 1950, and the US 50 years later--driven by the economy, farmers move to city jobs for higher pay• The UK has 5.9 million security cameras: 1 for every 11 citizens• Search data uncovered drug side effects before they were discovered by the FDA warning system, revealing paroxetine and paravastatin can cause hypoglycemia in patients• Facebook was collecting 500 terabytes of information everyday...back in 2012• If you've ever signed up for a website with a fake zip code or fake birthday, you're a criminal--in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act• A 12 year old visiting newyorktimes.com is a criminal as well--violating their Terms of Service and the working doctrine of the US Department of Justice• Twitter usage by high school grads vs college educated is equal (17 & 18% respectively).

Not my finest several hours.What I like about this book is that it's based on data that's not collected by people putting up fronts or creating a persona. Shit's real. My favorite piece of data was that, relative to other identities, black men talk very little online about Social Distortion. This is definitely a stereotype that should gain some momentum. "
125,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,5,"Summary: One of the best data-driven books I have read. I think the title might be why there are so many haters. He presents a lot of tough issues using a medium ""dating"" that is relatable. Also, you should not try to read this on audiobook. You need to see the graphs. There are a lot of haters that present their background as if that's relevant in some way. It's not. B/c while they typically seem to understand data, they seem to lack reading comprehension skills. What Rudder is presenting is not findings from data work. He's attempting to use data as a backdrop to talk about a host of issues that are relevant in the modern era. The data is simply a view of what one might see. Instead of presenting some other social scientist's work, he's using in-house research, which, incidentally is a larger, better joined, more carefully collected, and larger geographical grouping than what most people have.Even if you find him to be less enlightening than his blog (I don't use twitter)-as some mentioned- I would guess this long-form argument could not be divined from the constraints of that medium of communication. He would have to be even more brilliant than I think he is just from reading this book!! Maybe... the guy is a Harvard grad..... But in case I'm right, below are my notes....p. 14 - ""If Big Data's two running stories have been about surveillance and money, for the last three years I've been working on third: the human story."" ""...as a close second, they're demographers of an unprecedented reach."" P. 15 - He talks about the fact that his purpose is to generalize so he can do his job of bringing people together at scale (not with individual nonsensical exceptions as discussed by A LOT of the haters!). He's trying to understand and infer from the data. And his inference work is wonderful, presenting possible misinterpretations that were tested and reviewed. p. 46 - Actually this entire chapter of how they essentially created a series of studies to demonstrate that variation in attractiveness get you noticed as much as attractiveness does. Freakin' Brilliant!p. 47 - Did not know there was a name to it: ""the Pratfall Effect"" - ""As long as you're generally competent, making a small, occasional mistake makes people think you're more competent. Flaws call out good stuff all the more."" p. 48 - It's better to ""Purposely abandon the middle road."" p. 53 - Regarding NLP work on Twitter...I love the hypothesis that Twitter might be improving its users' writing. This is all amazing stuff as relates to transformations in human language and has application in ways that are ignored even today.""he calculated the typical world length in Hamlet (3.99) and in a collection of Wodehouse's stories (4.05)... both less than the length in his Twitter sample (4.80).""""Comparative linguistics have long traced groups of community through language."" p. 54 - The chart on changing characteristics of speech patterns. The idea being that tribe creation is no longer geographically constrained, AND ALSO, you can catch it in the language used... something that we were NEVER able to do in the past (think Chinese, Cantonese, Mandarin, and the 50+ other dialects). Super nerdy awesome point.p. 62 - ""Sitewide, the copy-and-paste, strategy underperforms the from-scratch messaging about 25%, but in terms of effort-in results-out - it always wins: measuring by replies received to compose a new message each time."" What an awesome thing to take look at. Intriguing when you think about marketing/scaled response composition. p. 82 - Confounders. This is a great way to present this material so often ignored or misunderstood in the field. Generally, this chapter does a great job presenting a series of charts with each of the appropriate analysis points you'd ask in a row. I did not need the written part, but I can see why he has it. I can also see why some who read via audiobooks struggled. It would be hard to understand this book if all you had was the audio.Chapter 7: The Beauty Myth - The whole way he presents it in the context of thinking about his daughter is great. The work that supports it is fantastic. On eating disorders, he describes a possible place to look for solutions to help others....p. 104 ""... but before the behavior was digitized, there was practically no way to get directly at this problem, at least not until visible damage had already occurred. There was only rumor - an ear at the bathroom door, perhaps a parent's sad suspicion.""Chapter 8: p. 106-107. He talks about how b/c people don't tell you their deepest thoughts, you had to really work hard (snoop, catch people unguarded, etc) to figure out what they thought. Then he talks about the truthfulness of search engines like Google. How the mechanism itself is far harder to trick. This is REALLY important to what we think of as the fundamental changes in the types of data we now are able to collect. Chapter 9: There were a number of criticisms I read that lead back to this chapter and I think it might just have been unclear how to read the charts as well to think about it. That's a fair point. I think what he's trying to say is even in words there is racial signaling on both sides. If we think about the words we use to attract others and identify tribe, in the context of dating it's super apparent. For me, then I think about how this relates to concepts like code-switching in the workplace. We focus a lot on the accent, and we know vocabulary matters. But this implies something far deeper. If you read each of the lists and you clearly identify with one group, it's likely, you are farther culturally from other groups than just skin color. This is quite profound on anyone working on things like ""How do we create a single human race without such aberrant division."" Word. p. 155 - If you care at all about gay rights, these stats are important and also very sad. If I've got him correct- and these are the footnotes, we're underestimating the gay population of the US by a lot and most are NOT dating b/c they are socially unable to do so, either because they are in the closet and scared to be themselves or there are structural reasons in their community that prevent them from self-expression. Chapter 12- Great segue into the work on migration, which covers not an only lifestyle choice but also works availability and more. This work is really relevant for - what is not mentioned, the dying cities phenomenon. p. 181 - He's arguing against things like Klout scores. This is why I do not understand the arguments that he doesn't want to drill in or he's missing some sort of causality.. he's not. This book is about what the general number are telling you out of various inferences that are possible.p. 184 - Mountain Dew Story. A great example of what not to crowdsource.p. 186 - ""If employers begin to use algorithms to infer how intelligent you are or whether you use drugs, then your only choice will be to game the system - or to borrow the wording from the previous chapter, 'manage your brand.' To beat the machine, you must act like a machine, which means you've lost to the machine. And that's assuming you can guess what you're supposed to do in the first place. Apparently, one of the strongest correlates to intelligence in the research was liking 'curly fries.' Who could reverse engineer that?p. 187 - very intersting comments on survellience and data use by the government. p. 193 - He talks about the pennies from personal data payments will not amount ot anything that actually helps people. Moreover, it is highly likely to just be passed back through to consumers."
126,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3925847-gerri-leen,3,"This book is super interesting but I wish there were a little more ""there"" there. I only got to 60% before the book was over and the notes began (and on a Kindle flipping back and forth is, for me, a pain). Also meat-wise, I was expecting something along the lines of Outlers, which of course this is the opposite of in theme since it looks at the trends of all and not the accomplishments of a few. But I wanted it to be a book I remembered long after. It's really not. Although it's an interesting read while you're in it. Big Data, when it matures, means so much info that will be longitudinal, something data analysts struggle with ever getting enough of, so in that sense this is very exciting, and it's amazing what we can tell already from the little we have.I do think the book suffered mightily by being read on a Kindle (or any e-reader, especially black and white). The graphs used red and it was not always easy to tell what was gray because it was red and what was gray because it was gray--or if anything was really gray. Since much of this book runs off the graphs, that it's a bad thing not to be able to fully read them (and at the size they were at on my Paperwhite, I also felt challenged to really dive in). I did love reading that the author was a disciple of sorts of Tufte. And I appreciated the amount of info given in the charts.I had a hard time getting through the first chapter. I think the author left out a primary reason male and female reactions to potential partners' age might change (or not) over time depending on gender--and normally I'd give him a break on this since it's from another field of study, but since he runs an online dating site and is reporting on that robust data set, then I'd expect him to understand the drives of men (be drawn to young and fertile no matter how old they get) and women (pick a good provider--until she reaches a certain age, realizes she is not going to need a provider (either because she does not have kids or because she provides just fine for herself), and then go for something young and fun). This behavior has been well documented and while I thought he was going to touch on it at one point, it really didn't happen enough for me to ever get that comfortable with the first example out of the gate. That said, I didn't have that issue with the rest of the book, so I did keep going and many of the sections were novel and interesting."
127,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24217018-matt,3,"This is a very quick read which, given the number of visuals, is not surprising. The visuals, though, are beautiful, always tell a story, and never waste a drop of ink on unnecessary information. These images reflect the book...for the most part. It's when the narrative steers away from its stated purpose (a data driven exploration of human nature) that I started to tire of Christian Rudders narrative voice. It's funny, irreverent, and insightful for most of the book and especially for the sections discussing OkCupid data. He writes best about the data he knows best and that's not surprising. But as the book advances Rudder starts to draw on unfamiliar datasets, make less rigorous assertions, and veer into both data fear-mongering and data evangelism. It was disappointing mostly because he promised to write a different kind of book than those which use data as a lens to prove the downfall of society or privacy, or predict incredible advances in technology and public intelligence. He asserts this book is special then proceeds to speculate about how invasive the NSA can be, how Twitter is unleashing our base instincts but also improving our vocabulary, and how online branding is the future of self evaluation. These parts were, in truth, boring compared to the insights about romantic relationship. In summary, I'm not sure where this book fits in the social science and statistics cannon. It's not the most insightful or the most fun, which leaves it somewhere in between and probably only worth picking up if you love the genre. "
128,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35538316-lindy,3,"I feel like I write this in every nonfiction book review, but I wished there was more depth! I also wished someone more, I don't know, anthropologically minded had given this book a once over before publication. For example, Rudder treats data showing that bisexual men are more likely to prefer/message other men on OkCupid when compared to older bisexual men as if it were longitudinal, and implies that bi men's sexual preferences change as they get older. However he does not take into account what these men may be doing off the service; a young bisexual man will probably hit on women at a bar, but is at a considerably greater risk of being decked in the face if he were to do so to men. As the dating pool grows smaller with age, he may turn to the internet to scope out both genders. (To be fair, Rudder  does responsibly account for a similar phenomenon showing that North Dakotans are surprisingly liberal when it comes to causual sex in the next chapter and why that isn't the case.) Likewise, Rudder says that ""yass,"" which turns up in a list of words distinctive of popular twitter users, is a contraction of ""your ass."" This is true, but it's definitely not the most popular use. Nonetheless, Dataclysm is an interesting and accessible book, and I imagine it would be especially so to someone with no background in statistics. I appreciated that the author had a sense of humor, and I don't think (reading in 2017) that it has aged poorly, although it would have been helpful if Rudder had cited years in the text rather than simply ""last year."""
129,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33131867-neha,3,"I had seen a significant portion of the material before on the blog, but it's still worth a read. I loved the informal voice, and the use of various graphs to illustrate new findings. It read like a collection of smaller articles with specific results.A lot of the OkCupid data revealed particular preferences of men and women in terms of age, attractiveness, and ethnicity. I can understand why the overall findings may be upsetting, and I think readers should be cautious about how this actually applies to their lives. This book is not trying to give insider tips for finding more dates. I think it's very important to remember that there is an inherent selection bias in the OkCupid data: it only represents people who have, for one reason or another, decided to try online dating.I thought the book was going to be more about OkCupid's dataset, but I appreciated the discussions about Google, Facebook, and Twitter data. The last chapter describes the ongoing conflict of privacy that is absent from earlier chapters. While giving users complete ownership of their data may seem to solve many problems, I tend to disagree that it's entirely possible. Services can certainly provide an option for users to remove their data from the site, but once data is on the Internet, I think it's safe to assume that it will never fully disappear."
130,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11500849-jen,1,"A sloppy and irresponsible introduction to big data analytics. Taking a popular science approach, the book glosses over key tenets of every day data science, like basic hypothesis testing. It also makes grand, sweeping generalizations about society as a whole where none can be made based on the population of the data (OK Cupid members hardly represent a random sampling of the US population).Some of the more egregious statements include ""There are times when a data set is so robust that if you set up your analysis right, you don't need to ask questions - it just tells you everything anyway"" and ""people are already compensated for their data: They get to use services like Facebook and Google...for free.""Putting the author's disregard of personal privacy aside, the narrative voice is filled with white male privilege. A few sections of the book made me generally uncomfortable in its approach to conversations about race, gender, and heterosexual relationships. We need a book about data science that highlights the process in a way that digital users can understand how their data is being analyzed and who is doing it responsibly. This is not it."

If you check, or look at a picture of the NSA (Why does an office building need a radar dome on the roof?), you will see that has always been their job. But while you are worrying about that, you are telling scores of commercial data aggregators everything about yourself, just by what you search for on Google, what you like on Facebook and where you access the internet from. Your sex, your race, your sexual orientation, your income, your politics, your IQ (from the type of French fries you like), it's all an open book. This book is the story from one involved nerd, along with some nice graphics.People's activities are somewhat limited, so the use of this data is mostly to target you for repression or elimination in a repressive society, to sell you something in a capitalist society, or for law enforcement to find you. So if you're only getting targeted Amazon ads, be happy.Of course, I can only imagine what the data will be used for after Skynet becomes active."
132,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/140018-kyle,2,"Readable, with nice diagrams, this is a hard book to hate. It is easy to be irritated by it, however. The basis of the book is a dozen or so interesting statistical points, with a chapter of conversational description for each. I'm curious where these statistical insights actually come from. Did the author pore over data for months? It doesn't feel that way. They have the feeling of nuggets gleaned from interns working over a period of years, that never ended up being useful anywhere else. Certainly, the discussion the author offers almost no isights beyond the immediately obvious. It isn't clear enough to be a good introduction to statistics, nor in-depth enough to offer interest to statisticians.The best chapters are the early ones oriented towards anyone trying to game the system a little on dating sites. How long message should be, what the opposite sex is looking for for someone your age, etc. The later chapters, trying to offer larger insights about culture and language are ... not convincing. Problematic, even."
133,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78503-chris,3,"This book has some great perspective on human behavior derived from data sets culled from many websites. It celebrates the fact that the amount of data that we have on people's actual beliefs and desires (as opposed to their stated beliefs) and breaks down what a lot of these data sets mean. A lot of it is very funny, even while it may be disturbing in its implications.For the first two-thirds, it was really interesting to me and had a lot of, if not surprising, at least very relevant things to say about human behaviors.The last third kind of drifted off into parts of the data that I am not too concerned with personally and the author's thoughts on what the future will be. It is not necessarily bad, just not what I was looking for, and also, a bit more broad than the particulars of the earlier chapters. "
134,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63344080-lucas,4,"This book offers a new look at old questions. Race, identity and the many differences between women and men in their approach to sex and relationship are shown here through data from an online dating website (OkCupid). I think the book presents valuable insights about racism because it observes actually behavior rather than self-reported questions.Some of the interesting book's find is the following:* Both black men and black women are strongly rejected in online dating* The women who received more attention of men aren't the more beautiful but those who have the high variance in their ratings (men can't say if they are beautiful or not).* Most people (~90%) who declare themselves bisexual is indeed heterosexual or homosexual.* Straight women are less propense to search only casual sex in online datingA negative thing is that the book contains a lot of digressions."

The possibilities of big data seem scary and exciting at the same time. This book presents them in a very accessible way to the average reader. I was skeptical of some the conclusions that the author presented but there's a lot of good conversation starters here. However, I don't think much of it will stick with me in the long run.I probably didn't make the best choice by listening to this on audiobook where numbers in charts were read out for minutes hahaOverall, a short, enjoyable, and timely read if you want to delve into popular science books."
136,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3440334-fred-forbes,2,"Making my way through some interesting observations generated by ""OK Cupid"" and other ""big data"" sites, I hit a section marked ""Coda"" where he went on to comment on the process used to generate the data illustrations, followed by notes, acknowledgements, and an index. Thought I was halfway through the book but had actually finished. Note sure whether the lack of mathematical analysis is a blessing or not - I guess that would depend on how capable the writer is - but much of the content, while interesting is a ""firm grasp of the obvious."""

This was a highly enjoyable-to-read, interesting-to-think-about, pop-data/analytics book. I appreciated the author's voice and sense of humor, but he often ventured into preachy territory. For someone to write so extensively on data that illuminates our biases, I wish he could have taken more care to hide his own."

139,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8886042-michelle,2,"Dataclysm: Who We Are When We Think No One's Looking by Christian Rudder is an interesting and fact filled book. I received an Advance Reader's Copy from Crown Publishing, a division of Random House and my opinions were formed by my reading of this uncorrected proof. Author Christian Rudder is one of the founders of the dating website OKCupid and he draws his research for this book primarily from the data that has been collected from paying members who are looking for relationships. He additionally mines data from other social media resources, dating services like Match.com and websites, and his pool of subjects include a cross section of the population that he believes is an excellent barometer for the opinions of Americans today. This book is filled with charts and maps and images to help you easily understand the data he has sourced and how it applies to the ""everyman"" in all of us.This book approaches a wide variety of topics - relationships, personal preferences, age, gender, race and upbringing and tries to answer the question ""Who are we really?"" by examining what we say versus how we act. Although I felt like I came away with a bunch of quotable tidbits and an interesting peek into how the data that we so freely place on the internet is used, I'm not quite sure that I learned very much about myself from this book. Many of the observances seemed rational to me and not all that thought provoking, and although some applied to me I didn't walk away feeling like I had much personal insight. A few of the passages left me feeling uneasy, simply because I'm not sure all the members of OKCupid were willing test subjects in Mr. Rudder's data laboratory. In one memorable instance photos of users were shown in an illustration of women who had very high and very low scores from fellow users in terms of their appeal. Although he was using them to make a point about the importance of having a photo that provokes a strong reaction is better than having a commonly pretty picture (which he describes as ""meh"") and he expressly thanks the subjects for their consent to be included in the book and to have their photos discussed, it still felt mildly squicky. Although the many other charts and illustrations in the book didn't deal in this same very personal representation of data, I did question the author's use of the OKCupid site at times. Although it may all be perfectly legal it makes me ask ""do I need to know this?"" and ""is the use of this data justified in a bigger, insight gaining way that makes it important to a reader?"" I'm not sure I have the answer to those questions.  As a collection of facts and data there were definitely a few things I hadn't thought about before - for example, there is a chart showing the 100 most common words used in the English language today from the Oxford English Corpus (a collection of modern writing's approach to vocabulary and word use) versus the top 100 used to express yourself on Twitter in the form of the service's 140 character tweet posts. It showed that although you may think the language of Twitter would somewhat abbreviate or diminish your ideas to get your point across, actually a person composing a tweet is much more selective and thoughtful about what their words will convey. It may help us to write clearer and in a concise style that contributes to an overall awareness of language. That awareness filters into the speech and style of a Twitter user versus a non-user. I liked the idea that my tweeting may help me generate a better and more vivid use of language. Still I kept returning to the fact that this book didn't really live up to the ""portrait of our essential selves"" claim that it was intended to be. It isn't a bad book. I just wish that I had a greater takeaway as a reader.One thing that truly irked me about this book is the mention of a website link where you could go, punch in your own data (two Facebook usernames) and get a personal illustration to see one of the ideas in this book in action. In the fourth chapter titled ""You Gotta be the Glue"" there is an illustration showing the overlap of the author's Facebook friends and his wife's friend's. He explains in depth how we create clusters of people in our lives that know us from a specific point of view - our work friends, childhood acquaintances, family members etc. Our spouse or significant other can overlap our Facebook friendships in many categories. Perhaps you are both friends with your parents and share relationships with other couples you met while you both attended a ballroom dance lesson. The shared connections can illustrate the bonds we have as couples, and can show you the places in your relationships that have a strong and meaningful connection. I thought this sounded really cool and was happy to find an example that could be personalized to me and allowed me to be a willing participant in the experiment to see how it felt. Unfortunately this awesome personalized tool simply doesn't exist. I have tried the link dozens of times over the past few weeks and didn't post my thoughts on the book since I wanted to see this chart in action, but it still gives me a ""Page Not Found"" message. The book's publication date is set for Tuesday September 9th, and since this is Saturday the 6th I would think that it would be active. I hope it will go live on Tuesday at the very least. I contacted the author through his Twitter page about the lack of a working link and received no response, however another reviewer on Goodreads said that when they contacted him through email they received a response that it would be functional by the end of August. If I had paid for this book rather than receiving an ARC I would be even more disappointed. The one big opportunity to gain personal insight is so far, a bust.If you find the sort of data in this book interesting I would check it out of the library or wait for the book to be marked down. I wouldn't consider it a must read but I am thankful I had the opportunity to read it. I hope you find this useful information, and I will update my opinion if the link works on the publication date. For now I can only give this book 2 of 5 stars. "
140,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5177572-genevieve,4,"* Originally reviewed on the Night Owls Press blog here. *First, it was the Internet. The Internet was going to change how businesses and organized operated. It was going to change how people live. But now something else has enthralled our imagination: big data.What is big data? We couldn't have big data without the Web. Our shift to online activity has made it easier to record and document massive reams of data and data trails about seemingly everything: Where do we go when we're online? What do we do? What do we read? The idea behind big data is that scientists can analyze that activity and parse out that information, information that might predict what we would do in hypothetical situations, or what we would be likely to do in the future. This largely possible because of scale. It's not about analyzing a person, a hundred people, or a thousand people; it's about waves and waves of information, millions and millions of data points.Think about how far we've come. In the third century BC, the first great repository of human knowledge was the Library of Alexandria. Today information is available in the exabytes. (What is an exabyte? Um...it's really, really big.) Big data is about size, but it's more than that. It's the fact that we have computers and databases that will log and analyze micro-activities, actions as simple as Facebook ""likes,"" our location recorded by the GPS in our phones, and the ""number of seconds or minutes spent reading a web page.""Dataclysm Who We Are When We Think No One's Looking by Christian Rudder sheds light on what that kind of datafication looks like. Rudder himself is the cofounder of OkCupid, the online dating site, which lives and breathes on seemingly mystical algorithms that dice and chop up streams of data. No other person might be more qualified to give us an insider's account on what big data can do.Rudder dabbles in statistical, psychological, and sociological theories and drills the chapters with clever infographics and beautifully rendered scatterplots—and some of them are truly works of art. (I used to work in data so I have a soft spot for data scientists and their work.) But where Rudder really excels is in the smorgasbord of findings. Patterns emerge from the data. Stare into the matrix and you'll see...a mirror into your very soul. At least that's what Rudder wants us to believe.You might be put off by Rudder's focus on dating sites but that's his métier. The trove of information on social interactions alone on dating sites is weirdly fascinating. In one example, Rudder finds that dating profiles of women who have a polarizing physical appearance are more likely to be approached for dates than the conventionally attractive person. (Is it fascination with novelty? boredom with the same 'ole, same 'ole?) Aren't we all at our most earnest and neurotic when it comes to love and relationships?A downside of this book is that if you read or pay attention to the tech news cycle, you may find some of Rudder's examples ho-hum repeats. For example, we've seen Google Trends tackle the flu in a kind of digital epidemiology approach. Nothing new there. Rudder retells these stories not to just fill the pages though but to constantly keep the beat of this book, which is asking deeper questions about who are we as a culture?Another downside is that even with all the reams of data and stats Rudder throws at us, ultimately, these are just cool factoids. It's an impressive avalanche of interesting data tidbits, but still just tidbits. The next challenge for big data: figuring out what truly matters, narrowing it down, cutting the noise.The heart of what makes big data interesting is that it's research that isn't gathered merely from surveys or interviews or even randomized control trial experiments, which we all know can be biased for a variety of reasons: subjects don't understand the questions, subjects lie, people obfuscate, they unconsciously modify their behavior to please researchers. Here the data is based on actual behavior in situ. And we can learn something from it, we can see patterns and discern behaviors that were otherwise invisible. It's like studying people in the wild.Most books about data are dry and boring, but Dataclysm is one that makes a mark. Part of this is Rudder staying grounded in primary data and real analysis. But an even bigger part is Rudder's never-stale writing style. Yes, the book is still pop-social science. This might frustrate a few bona fide data scientists out there. But Dataclysm works. The amusing stories and asides sprinkled throughout the book are full of zest but are never fluffy. For a numbers person, a Harvard-honed math-y guy working in Silicon Valley, Dataclysm is a remarkably fluid and readable book.Big data isn't the answer to the universe, the meaning of life, or to your other burning existential questions, but you'll still become privy to some interesting discoveries about culture and society.[Disclaimer: I received this book from Blogging for Books for an honest and candid review.] "

142,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16880570-khari,1,"Three months.Three months to listen to a book seven and a half hours long. Normally I can get one of those out in a week. Nope. Three months.I'm really tired of these books with fascinating titles that just disappoint.This book made me understand why people shout 'Science' at each other. It's because authors like this either underestimate their audience and dumb down what they have done, or they have terrible methodologies themselves and don't even realize it.For a book about data which necessarily must include statistics, there is a shocking dearth of statistic lingo in this book. He tries to justify himself in the end. His intention was to write a popular science book and he didn't want to clutter it with jargon like 'p', and 'confidence interval' and fun stuff like that. And, hey, I get it. I don't completely understand statistics yet, but even I know that words like 'significant' have a particular meaning that has to be defined in the world of numbers, but he never defines his terms. He says the methodology he used was 'rigorous' and it went through something 'like peer review' but never defines what his methodology was, and his 'peer review' was for his underling (who he knew btw) to check his numbers. That's not peer review. Hate to break it to you. Peer review is done by someone who does not know who wrote the paper, and they look over the whole paper, including the hypotheses and the conclusions as well as the number. It's not someone whose job is in your hands checking your math. But I know why he chose to do it this way. It's because there is no way on this planet that this atrocity would have ever been published in a good scientific journal....wait...let me rephrase that. Considering that there have been cases of complete hoax papers being published it is remotely possible that it could have been published in a badly edited, badly curated, motivated reasoning filled journal. Because that's what this was. Badly edited, badly curated, filled with motivated reasoning, and worst of all, terrible methodology that is never explained. This book couldn't hack it in the scientific publishing world so he had to go to a subsidiary of Penguin, Crown Publishing, that focuses on hobbies, memoirs, biographies, autobiographies, cooking, lifestyle, business and nonfiction. And honestly, that makes a ton of sense, because this reads more like a memoir than a book of scientific rigor. He makes unfounded claims, presents his interpretation as fact, and only considers one explanation for everything that he finds interesting.The part that absolutely killed me was he is talking about corpus linguistics. Corpus linguistics is gathering really large bodies of texts and making it searchable. There are a bunch of free ones out there, such as the Corpus of Contemporary American English (affectionately known as COCA), for your perusal. They have a bunch of ways of analyzing, you can look at the most used words, you can look at the collocations (the words immediately preceding and following a word), you can look at the word families that are used, the lexemes that are used, the type of word that most appears, the contexts in which words appear, which is a really good way to find out what a word actually means in use, in contrast to how it is defined in the dictionary. Corpus linguistics just happens to be my baby. It was my focus in my master's program and it's my focus in my PHD program. And guess what? I know nothing about it. I've already spent three years learning about it, and I'm going to go spend another 2-6, and I've read peer-reviewed articles about it, talked to experts, and read books about it, and I still know nothing, but I know enough to know that how he's using it is mind bogglingly bogus. He basically does character counting. He counts how many words show up in a tweet, calculates the mean character length, then compares it to the mean character length in Shakespeare and concludes that since the mean character length in tweets is longer, people today are using language in a more nuanced way than Shakespeare was....mean character length. Or his other technique was to make a word list of the most used words and show that it was similar to Shakespeare because 'the' and 'a' appeared at the top. No duh Sherlock, they're function words. They happen to be required every time you are referring to a singular noun. They would show up at the top of the word list of this review as well and that would mean nothing about the similarity between reviews and tweets. They are different registers who both follow the rules of the English language, ergo, functional words such as articles and pronouns and prepositions would occur more often simply because they are closed classes that are requisite for forming phrases that make sense.So there you go, a very brief, cogent rebuttal for one of his most important methods of analysis. But that rebuttal is actually rebutting his intention, not what he actually did. What he actually did was include, on his erstwhile 'word' list, things like 'the', 'a', ''s', 'Peru' 'my blue eyes', 'tall for an Asian', etc. .........How, in the name of all that is grounded in the study of linguistics, can those things be defined as 'words'?!?!? What definition is he using?!? He isn't using one! He's just conglomerating everything that he finds interesting together and calling it a 'word' while not even recognizing that what he finds interesting is subjective! It's not a parameter by which to define something! At first I was like, huh, is he using morphemes as the basis of his 'word'? ""'s"" would be the the third person possessive morpheme, I can see that, after all 'the' 'a' and 'Peru' are all single morpheme words. But then you have 'my blue eyes' that's not a word, that's a phrase! All of the words in that phrase aren't even single morpheme words! So why on earth does the third person possessive deserve its own place of glory but the plural 's' does not!?!This is the problem with popular 'science' books. People read them, feel like they are now informed and use the same arguments that they read about without ever realizing that the books aren't science. There is no scientific method in this book. He never defines his terms, he barely defines his variables. He has a million variables, and doesn't distinguish between them. It's not an experimental study so it's fine that he doesn't have a control group, but he should be trying to make the groups that he is splitting people into as uniform as possible and he doesn't even really attempt it. His variables are men and women, black, white, Asian, and Hispanic. He never even limited his findings to people from the USA. He just assumed that everyone was. He never factored in educational status which would have a huge impact, and that information actually is in the data set, so he could have, but he didn't. He didn't even mention it as a confound! And that's just the point. Everything is a conclusion for him. He argued that there are certain topics that are anathema to certain groups because the word denoting that topic only appears once. No. It does not mean that they are anathema to that group. I can think of a dozen reasons why someone would choose not to put something that they are interested in onto a public forum. I am pretty sure that an Otolaryngologist is not going to put that as their profession on OKCupid, simply because most people don't know what that means, they are just going to go with 'doctor' because it's simpler and gets the point across. That doesn't mean that otolarynogology is a taboo subject because it's only mentioned once. And besides, the fact that it is mentioned at all is already proof positive that it is not a taboo subject, taboo subjects are epitomized by never being mentioned at all and referred to circularly. So why didn't he mention all the other terms that are never mentioned, like muons and antileptons? (No, I don't know what those are either). The self-introductions on OKCupid (which is what he studied) are texts designed to elicit a certain response. They are a specific register, a register that each writer assumes will be the most likely to get them what they want, a date. As such they are inherently not generalizable to populations as a whole. They are only generalizable as 'the words that people use to try and present themselves as a satisfactory date'. There is a purpose behind it and it shows only a very small subset of language use, taking it to mean that it epitomizes someone's character and identity is horrifying. People change how they talk constantly. They talk differently when they write as compared to when they speak. They talk differently depending on if they know their audience or not. They talk differently depending on the power dynamics of the situation. They talk differently depending on how they are feeling at the moment. Studying the language used in self-introductory texts on OKCupid is very interesting and a worthwhile subject in and of itself, but you cannot generalize out to the public. The people on OKCupid are not a random selection of people, they are self-selected to be rather outgoing, not so privacy concerned, not willing to spend their money on web-dating, mostly singly people who are interested in romantic liaisons. They are, according to his own admission of the data, mostly liberal and progressive, mostly college educated, those account for 31% and 34% of the US population respectively. That is not even broken down by sex or race, if I were to spend the time doing that it would show an even smaller portion of the population for each, you can't generalize out to everyone else in the US based on a sub population. That would be like saying 50% of the population of the US are women, and women generally score higher in compassion, therefore the US is a compassionate nation...what? That doesn't even make sense.Finally, the thing that really just made me crack up was when he said ""and I say this as someone who is reflexively critical of the left."" That made me die. Why, why did that make me die? Because it doesn't mean what you think it means. It doesn't mean that he automatically looks at what people on the left say critically. It doesn't mean that his automatic response is to be skeptical. It means to embrace your subjective understandings of reality as a basis for analyzing social interactions. Being reflexively critical is a tenet of feminist post-structuralist analysis, or you could also argue that it is a postmodern, post-Marxist analysis as well. Regardless of who you decide is the ultimate progenitor of such an idea, it remains an ideology of the left. By using it he showed that he was on the left. By trying to present himself as a balanced and disinterested analyzer he showed himself to be controlled by a particular worldview."
143,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51602586-dominika,4,"A good soft introduction on data analysis, particularly in regards to human interaction. I thought it was fun and simple enough for the layman, but not simple to the point that it's lying about the capacity of what big data can do (as an example, I deal with a lot of research participants who do not have an email or do not use their email often). I really appreciated him talking about the limitations, as well as some qualitative methods and how they can be used. The whole point of all this is to see how our private, online behavior is actually a great insight into the human condition. Like how the rate of gay porn consumption is the same across every state, and what factors are important to each racial group. I know I made this sound super boring but it isn't. "

But, what if they had hundreds of thousands, or tens of millions of customers a day? How much would they learn about what music people like, if they could somehow deal with that many customers a day?What if, instead of a music store, people came to your store to find something more personal, like a girlfriend or boyfriend?Welcome to the book Dataclysm, where one of the founders of the website OkCupid shows us just what every website you ever use is able to tell about you. That's slightly an exaggeration, of course; dating websites do get a view of us that is a little different than most. But then, Amazon sees you when you put your money where your mouth is. Google sees what you're trying to find, or find out about, or where you're finding directions to. Facebook, of course, probably knows who your real friends are better than what you are willing to admit out loud.If you get creeped out easily by the loss of secrecy (otherwise known as ""privacy"", when it's secrecy that we like) that comes from using the Internet, this is probably not the book for you.However, if you like to leaven your opinions about topics like race (and racism) and sex (and sexism) with some actual data (not just your own personal experience), this book is a revelation.

The people you really don't want to have this kind of information, already have it. The only question is, will you? If knowledge is power, then right now there is a profound imbalance of power being created by this much data. Christian Rudder has done us the favor of showing us what he has (aggregated, of course, so that no individual is identifiable). Take a look."
145,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4579658-rob-kitchin,2,"The stated aim of Dataclysm is to introduce lay readers to the era of big data, the possibilities of such data, and the types of analysis used to make sense of them. The problems with the book start with the title and subtitle, neither of which, I think, make much sense. Dataclysm, Rudder explains, is a play on cataclysm: the wiping away of one era to be replaced by a new one. However, big data is set to complement small data, not wipe them away as small data are generated to answer specific questions rather than being a by-product that is then repurposed, and most big data are held by private corporations or government and are not readily open to researchers. All of the data that Rudder analyzes is from social media; they are data produced precisely because we think someone is looking (for a date, for conversation, for information, to provoke a reaction, etc). Uploading information to the internet is largely a process of the presentation of the self, as Goffman’s famous theory would frame the activity. Even if other people cannot see the answers to direct questions, as when filling in questions on a dating site, the answers shape the user profile and the process of matching -- something that users are aware of, consider and present to.The book then proceeds by discussing social media data and what they might reveal about human behaviour and society. Crucially, however, there is no systematic discussion of big data per se, its forms and characteristics, no discussion of data analytics, and only a cursory discussion of the many ethical, social and political implications of such data. There is no discussion of statistics, or statistical tests performed on the data presented, nor data mining, data analytics, machine learning, pattern recognition, profiling, prediction, etc. The irony here is that Rudder’s company – OkCupid – employs these techniques to be able to process and match potential partners, yet he never explains how this is achieved. Instead, the entire analysis is rooted in the empiricist form of data science, rather than data-driven science, and never proceeds beyond description. As such, the analysis of gender and race he presents are based on a ‘letting the data speak for themself’ approach and constitutes armchair interpretation. He barely engages with the vast academic literature on quantitative analysis of race and gender that has taken place for several decades using large data sets such as the census or public administration data. Rudder has access to an enormous set of very interesting data that could be used to conduct some fascinating sociological and psychological analysis. Instead what we get are a series of descriptive statistics and banal revelations, most of which are already well established. The result is a book that hints at the potential of big data and data science but undersells it substantially, and it under-estimates in my view the readership level of its potential audience by never progressing beyond mathematics and data visualisations used in junior school. In contrast, books such as The Signal and the Noise by Nate Silver provide a much wider and deeper discussion. This is a shame as Rudder is an engaging writer and he has privileged access to an extremely rich social data that could be used to conduct some wonderful and sophisticated social science research. Such rich research and its policy implications are barely hinted at."
146,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8684527-andra-n,5,"I postponed reading Dataclysm for some time, but I’m glad I took my time to read it. Its author, Christian Rudder first caught my attention in an article written after the Facebook scandal over the experiments made over its users, where he explained in a rather unapologetic manner, that this is the very nature of internet’s success and efficiency increase. His opinion is a consequence of his experience running the dating site OkCupid where decisions based on people’s behavior must be made in order to obtain optimal results. “It’s a delicate illusion, the Internet.”Dataclysm is a book about Big Data and Romantic behavior. However, it is definitely not a recipe for making a perfect profile or having more success on social networks. This book is rather a series of conclusions drawn from the aggregated data obtained from millions of interactions mainly from sites like OkCupid and other social networks or Google. This is not the story of the individual, it is the story of the collective. What distinguishes the work of Christian Rudder is that given his privileged position at OKCupid, he had in hand large amounts of data with which he could play and analyze freely. As opposed to other studies of human behavior that have as subjects mostly a bunch of students from well-known universities, his data sets contain personal information of people of all ages and races, from the US. This book has lots of pop-culture references, amusing and sometimes insightful comments. What is most intriguing about his studies is the fact that they are made over information that we rather think it is private. We get a glimpse of our rather politically incorrect behaviors as human beings.I found particularly interesting the comparison between woman preferences and man preferences when it comes to a potential partner’s age, attractiveness and race. Humor is not left out of the book, as the paragraph depicting women ratings of attractiveness of men: “Only one guy in six is “above average” in an absolute sense. Sex appeal isn’t something commonly quantified like this, so let me put it in a more familiar context: translate this plot to IQ, and you have a world where the women think 58 percent of men are brain damaged.”The comparison of words most commonly used by people on their dating profiles from different races or sexual orientation was also a chapter that I found quite interesting. The author shows via text analysis that several race related patterns emerge. “White people differentiate themselves mostly by their hair and eyes, Asians by their country of origin, Latinos by their music. But because of the way the math is set up, the three non-white lists are evidence of cultures that I, as a white man, am not supposed to know…the gay male list is very different from the other three. It’s full of pop culture and has comparatively few references to the user’s immediate person and family.”I would definitely recommend this book that tackles a wide range of topics to anyone who is interested in data science as well as those curious about the weirdness of human nature."
147,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18688-cody,4,"Much e-ink has been spilled--rightfully so--about the brave new world we live online. Targeted advertising, data breaches, the NSA; it’s easy to grow overwhelmed by the potential dangers of sharing personal information electronically. Practically everything we do on our phones and computers is tracked, often in an effort to sell us something or gain some upper hand (financially, politically, socially, etc.). Consequentially, there is now an unprecedented amount of detailed data about us that's ripe for the parsing.Beyond the obvious advantages for market research, is there a benefit to all of this data? Christian Rudder, co-founder of the online dating site OkCupid, thinks so. He’s been approaching the internet over the past decade as one big sociological experiment, and his new book, Dataclysm: Who We Are (When We Think No One’s Looking), explores his findings in depth, some of which are rather mind blowing.Penned in clear and witty prose and full of colorful charts and graphs, Dataclysm breezes by, though many of the insights linger, obsess, and often unsettle. We learn that if you apply network analysis to a couple’s groups of friends on Facebook, you can quite accurately predict how likely they are to stay together. And that Google searches beginning with the phrase “Is my husband…” most commonly end with “gay?” And that women tend to find men who are close to their age as the most attractive, whereas men, up until 50 years old, generally think that women in their early 20s look the best.Even in cases where the results reinforce long held views, what is new, Rudder asserts, “is our ability to test ideas, established ones, famous ones even, against the atomized actions of millions.” But the implications go beyond the sheer volume of the numbers. The ability we now have to track Google searches and site clicks provides us with much more accurate data, as these behaviors transcend the murkier self-reporting that plagues more traditional surveys, especially in regards to controversial topics. Rudder argues that the insights gleaned from all of this new data, even when the results are unflattering, are too beneficial to pass up, as they give us a far clearer and more accurate portrait of our true interests and behaviors.As Rudder frequently admits, the internet is still very young, which means that these data sets lack a long view. What Dataclysm does offer us, though, is another angle from which to consider our online lives. Whether you find the book’s content and approaches revelatory or creepy (at times I found them both), the results are fascinating and the ramifications huge. It reminds us that, as a sociological opportunity, we’re in the midst of a monumental sea change--one that is granting us astoundingly far-reaching insight into who we really are."

I felt like I read this constantly having to pick my jaw up off the floor, but that it had no major takeaways: we are all more racist than we think.

Then they prefer men a few years younger. Men find 20 year old women to be the most attractive--refardless of age (from 20-50 men all find women between 20-24 the most attractive)• Polarizing people get more attention--someone ranked with both very high & beauty ratings will receive more messages than someone with an equal average, but of more middle numbers• The smell of shit is added to perfumes and flowers, making the whole actually smell better• 74 men died of nostalgia in the Civil War (according to army records)• Twitter may actually be improving its users' writing ability--in both word length and density & brevity of ideas• More will be written on Twitter in the next 2 years, than all books ever published• 'God' has been in steady decline since the early 1800s--the word is used only about a third as much now as it was then• The best digital messages are only 40 to 60 characters long• One of the best compatibility questions is 'Do you like scary movies?' Answering the same to this question is more predictive of a successful long term relationship than 'big issues' like religion, politics, and looks• Black and White Quarterbacks perform equally down to the decimal: 81.55 (qb rating)• Zodiac signs have no effect on compatibility at all. Race has less effect than religion, politics, or education• 85% of OkCupid users have gone to college• Women are more 'race-loyal' than men in regards to attraction & relationships• 'White sounding' names get 50% more interviews with the exact same résumé as 'black sounding' names like 'Lakisha or 'Jamal'• On Facebook, every percentile of attractiveness gives a man two friends. It gives a woman three.• Often parents want their daughters to be pretty...but 'not too pretty.' Does anyone imagine limitations on a son?• Obama's race probably cost him 3 to 5 percentage points of the popular vote. The most popular Google search for the n-word in history was in Nov 2008, after he won. • 'Rumor' was a winged roman godess with 100 eyes and 100 mouths who spoke only the most hurtful side of the truth...(at least according to rumor)• The agenda of spreading a rumor is directed more for an audience, rather than the subject of a rumor• The Internet makes us vile creatures (see the 'online disinhibition effect')• The government has the greatest invested interest in tracking negativity. Mathematical models exist which predict the otcome of war, how long it will last, who will win, and how many will die• In 1950, the dawn of television, the American Political Science Association called for more polarization in national politics--the parties had grown too close together, the electorate didn't have clear choices. What made good television then, makes good television now, with 100 times the channels.• We seem to define ourselves as much by what we hate as by what we love• Stereotypes are true: white people self-differentiate themselves by their looks, Asians by their origin country, and Latinos by their music• What we don't talk about can be as illuminating as that which we do• Sex is the single most important grouping humanity has. It has existed forever--long before race or creed. In the US, all men were able to vote before women were. With that said, we are all fundamentally similar, much more so than our differences• The United States is divided: all but 4 presidential elections since 1952 would've flipped had 5% of the electorate changed their minds. Any group of people representing that number is therefore very important politically.• Gay porn searches show homosexuality occurs at the same rate nationwide. In less tolerant places however, gays are just more likely to stay in the closet to avoid persecution• In the US, the most popular Google search that begins with 'Is my husband...' most commonly ends in 'gay?' 'Cheating' comes up 10% less, and 'an alcoholic' occurs 8 times less, 'depressed' 10 times less.• Google Search data is ineffective for estimating the number of lesbians in the country, because straight men looking for porn throw off the data• The government counts everyone who's not married as 'single,' regardless of their actual relationship status• Gay and Straight people are looking for the same things in a relationship according to the numbers• Sexuality is more fluid than we realize: 51% of women and 18% of men have bad, or would like to have a same-sex experience• Who we say we are and how we behave are two separate things• Any nation is an 'Imagined Community'--comprised mostly of fellow numbers you'll never meet, and may share little in common with• The relocation of individuals in india & Southeast Asia, as well as the industrialization reflect England circa 1950, and the US 50 years later--driven by the economy, farmers move to city jobs for higher pay• The UK has 5.9 million security cameras: 1 for every 11 citizens• Search data uncovered drug side effects before they were discovered by the FDA warning system, revealing paroxetine and paravastatin can cause hypoglycemia in patients• Facebook was collecting 500 terabytes of information everyday...back in 2012• If you've ever signed up for a website with a fake zip code or fake birthday, you're a criminal--in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act• A 12 year old visiting newyorktimes.com is a criminal as well--violating their Terms of Service and the working doctrine of the US Department of Justice• Twitter usage by high school grads vs college educated is equal (17 & 18% respectively). Black people have a disproportionate presence on Twitter (nearly two fold: 29% vs 16% among whites).

Not my finest several hours.What I like about this book is that it's based on data that's not collected by people putting up fronts or creating a persona. Shit's real. My favorite piece of data was that, relative to other identities, black men talk very little online about Social Distortion. This is definitely a stereotype that should gain some momentum. "
155,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,5,"Summary: One of the best data-driven books I have read. I think the title might be why there are so many haters. He presents a lot of tough issues using a medium ""dating"" that is relatable. Also, you should not try to read this on audiobook. You need to see the graphs. There are a lot of haters that present their background as if that's relevant in some way. It's not. B/c while they typically seem to understand data, they seem to lack reading comprehension skills. What Rudder is presenting is not findings from data work. He's attempting to use data as a backdrop to talk about a host of issues that are relevant in the modern era. The data is simply a view of what one might see. Instead of presenting some other social scientist's work, he's using in-house research, which, incidentally is a larger, better joined, more carefully collected, and larger geographical grouping than what most people have.Even if you find him to be less enlightening than his blog (I don't use twitter)-as some mentioned- I would guess this long-form argument could not be divined from the constraints of that medium of communication. He would have to be even more brilliant than I think he is just from reading this book!! Maybe... the guy is a Harvard grad..... But in case I'm right, below are my notes....p. 14 - ""If Big Data's two running stories have been about surveillance and money, for the last three years I've been working on third: the human story."" ""...as a close second, they're demographers of an unprecedented reach."" P. 15 - He talks about the fact that his purpose is to generalize so he can do his job of bringing people together at scale (not with individual nonsensical exceptions as discussed by A LOT of the haters!). He's trying to understand and infer from the data. And his inference work is wonderful, presenting possible misinterpretations that were tested and reviewed. p. 46 - Actually this entire chapter of how they essentially created a series of studies to demonstrate that variation in attractiveness get you noticed as much as attractiveness does. Freakin' Brilliant!p. 47 - Did not know there was a name to it: ""the Pratfall Effect"" - ""As long as you're generally competent, making a small, occasional mistake makes people think you're more competent. Flaws call out good stuff all the more."" p. 48 - It's better to ""Purposely abandon the middle road."" p. 53 - Regarding NLP work on Twitter...I love the hypothesis that Twitter might be improving its users' writing. This is all amazing stuff as relates to transformations in human language and has application in ways that are ignored even today.""he calculated the typical world length in Hamlet (3.99) and in a collection of Wodehouse's stories (4.05)... both less than the length in his Twitter sample (4.80).""""Comparative linguistics have long traced groups of community through language."" p. 54 - The chart on changing characteristics of speech patterns. The idea being that tribe creation is no longer geographically constrained, AND ALSO, you can catch it in the language used... something that we were NEVER able to do in the past (think Chinese, Cantonese, Mandarin, and the 50+ other dialects). Super nerdy awesome point.p. 62 - ""Sitewide, the copy-and-paste, strategy underperforms the from-scratch messaging about 25%, but in terms of effort-in results-out - it always wins: measuring by replies received to compose a new message each time."" What an awesome thing to take look at. Intriguing when you think about marketing/scaled response composition. p. 82 - Confounders. This is a great way to present this material so often ignored or misunderstood in the field. Generally, this chapter does a great job presenting a series of charts with each of the appropriate analysis points you'd ask in a row. I did not need the written part, but I can see why he has it. I can also see why some who read via audiobooks struggled. It would be hard to understand this book if all you had was the audio.Chapter 7: The Beauty Myth - The whole way he presents it in the context of thinking about his daughter is great. The work that supports it is fantastic. On eating disorders, he describes a possible place to look for solutions to help others....p. 104 ""... but before the behavior was digitized, there was practically no way to get directly at this problem, at least not until visible damage had already occurred. There was only rumor - an ear at the bathroom door, perhaps a parent's sad suspicion.""Chapter 8: p. 106-107. He talks about how b/c people don't tell you their deepest thoughts, you had to really work hard (snoop, catch people unguarded, etc) to figure out what they thought. Then he talks about the truthfulness of search engines like Google. How the mechanism itself is far harder to trick. This is REALLY important to what we think of as the fundamental changes in the types of data we now are able to collect. Chapter 9: There were a number of criticisms I read that lead back to this chapter and I think it might just have been unclear how to read the charts as well to think about it. That's a fair point. I think what he's trying to say is even in words there is racial signaling on both sides. If we think about the words we use to attract others and identify tribe, in the context of dating it's super apparent. For me, then I think about how this relates to concepts like code-switching in the workplace. We focus a lot on the accent, and we know vocabulary matters. But this implies something far deeper. If you read each of the lists and you clearly identify with one group, it's likely, you are farther culturally from other groups than just skin color. This is quite profound on anyone working on things like ""How do we create a single human race without such aberrant division."" Word. p. 155 - If you care at all about gay rights, these stats are important and also very sad. If I've got him correct- and these are the footnotes, we're underestimating the gay population of the US by a lot and most are NOT dating b/c they are socially unable to do so, either because they are in the closet and scared to be themselves or there are structural reasons in their community that prevent them from self-expression. Chapter 12- Great segue into the work on migration, which covers not an only lifestyle choice but also works availability and more. This work is really relevant for - what is not mentioned, the dying cities phenomenon. p. 181 - He's arguing against things like Klout scores. This is why I do not understand the arguments that he doesn't want to drill in or he's missing some sort of causality.. he's not. This book is about what the general number are telling you out of various inferences that are possible.p. 184 - Mountain Dew Story. A great example of what not to crowdsource.p. 186 - ""If employers begin to use algorithms to infer how intelligent you are or whether you use drugs, then your only choice will be to game the system - or to borrow the wording from the previous chapter, 'manage your brand.' To beat the machine, you must act like a machine, which means you've lost to the machine. And that's assuming you can guess what you're supposed to do in the first place. Apparently, one of the strongest correlates to intelligence in the research was liking 'curly fries.' Who could reverse engineer that?p. 187 - very intersting comments on survellience and data use by the government. p. 193 - He talks about the pennies from personal data payments will not amount ot anything that actually helps people. Moreover, it is highly likely to just be passed back through to consumers."
156,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3925847-gerri-leen,3,"This book is super interesting but I wish there were a little more ""there"" there. I only got to 60% before the book was over and the notes began (and on a Kindle flipping back and forth is, for me, a pain). Also meat-wise, I was expecting something along the lines of Outlers, which of course this is the opposite of in theme since it looks at the trends of all and not the accomplishments of a few. But I wanted it to be a book I remembered long after. It's really not. Although it's an interesting read while you're in it. Big Data, when it matures, means so much info that will be longitudinal, something data analysts struggle with ever getting enough of, so in that sense this is very exciting, and it's amazing what we can tell already from the little we have.I do think the book suffered mightily by being read on a Kindle (or any e-reader, especially black and white). The graphs used red and it was not always easy to tell what was gray because it was red and what was gray because it was gray--or if anything was really gray. Since much of this book runs off the graphs, that it's a bad thing not to be able to fully read them (and at the size they were at on my Paperwhite, I also felt challenged to really dive in). I did love reading that the author was a disciple of sorts of Tufte. And I appreciated the amount of info given in the charts.I had a hard time getting through the first chapter. I think the author left out a primary reason male and female reactions to potential partners' age might change (or not) over time depending on gender--and normally I'd give him a break on this since it's from another field of study, but since he runs an online dating site and is reporting on that robust data set, then I'd expect him to understand the drives of men (be drawn to young and fertile no matter how old they get) and women (pick a good provider--until she reaches a certain age, realizes she is not going to need a provider (either because she does not have kids or because she provides just fine for herself), and then go for something young and fun). This behavior has been well documented and while I thought he was going to touch on it at one point, it really didn't happen enough for me to ever get that comfortable with the first example out of the gate. That said, I didn't have that issue with the rest of the book, so I did keep going and many of the sections were novel and interesting."
157,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24217018-matt,3,"This is a very quick read which, given the number of visuals, is not surprising. The visuals, though, are beautiful, always tell a story, and never waste a drop of ink on unnecessary information. These images reflect the book...for the most part. It's when the narrative steers away from its stated purpose (a data driven exploration of human nature) that I started to tire of Christian Rudders narrative voice. It's funny, irreverent, and insightful for most of the book and especially for the sections discussing OkCupid data. He writes best about the data he knows best and that's not surprising. But as the book advances Rudder starts to draw on unfamiliar datasets, make less rigorous assertions, and veer into both data fear-mongering and data evangelism. It was disappointing mostly because he promised to write a different kind of book than those which use data as a lens to prove the downfall of society or privacy, or predict incredible advances in technology and public intelligence. He asserts this book is special then proceeds to speculate about how invasive the NSA can be, how Twitter is unleashing our base instincts but also improving our vocabulary, and how online branding is the future of self evaluation. These parts were, in truth, boring compared to the insights about romantic relationship. In summary, I'm not sure where this book fits in the social science and statistics cannon. It's not the most insightful or the most fun, which leaves it somewhere in between and probably only worth picking up if you love the genre. "
158,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35538316-lindy,3,"I feel like I write this in every nonfiction book review, but I wished there was more depth! I also wished someone more, I don't know, anthropologically minded had given this book a once over before publication. For example, Rudder treats data showing that bisexual men are more likely to prefer/message other men on OkCupid when compared to older bisexual men as if it were longitudinal, and implies that bi men's sexual preferences change as they get older. However he does not take into account what these men may be doing off the service; a young bisexual man will probably hit on women at a bar, but is at a considerably greater risk of being decked in the face if he were to do so to men. As the dating pool grows smaller with age, he may turn to the internet to scope out both genders. (To be fair, Rudder  does responsibly account for a similar phenomenon showing that North Dakotans are surprisingly liberal when it comes to causual sex in the next chapter and why that isn't the case.) Likewise, Rudder says that ""yass,"" which turns up in a list of words distinctive of popular twitter users, is a contraction of ""your ass."" This is true, but it's definitely not the most popular use. Nonetheless, Dataclysm is an interesting and accessible book, and I imagine it would be especially so to someone with no background in statistics. I appreciated that the author had a sense of humor, and I don't think (reading in 2017) that it has aged poorly, although it would have been helpful if Rudder had cited years in the text rather than simply ""last year."""
159,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33131867-neha,3,"I had seen a significant portion of the material before on the blog, but it's still worth a read. I loved the informal voice, and the use of various graphs to illustrate new findings. It read like a collection of smaller articles with specific results.A lot of the OkCupid data revealed particular preferences of men and women in terms of age, attractiveness, and ethnicity. I can understand why the overall findings may be upsetting, and I think readers should be cautious about how this actually applies to their lives. This book is not trying to give insider tips for finding more dates. I think it's very important to remember that there is an inherent selection bias in the OkCupid data: it only represents people who have, for one reason or another, decided to try online dating.I thought the book was going to be more about OkCupid's dataset, but I appreciated the discussions about Google, Facebook, and Twitter data. The last chapter describes the ongoing conflict of privacy that is absent from earlier chapters. While giving users complete ownership of their data may seem to solve many problems, I tend to disagree that it's entirely possible. Services can certainly provide an option for users to remove their data from the site, but once data is on the Internet, I think it's safe to assume that it will never fully disappear."
160,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11500849-jen,1,"A sloppy and irresponsible introduction to big data analytics. Taking a popular science approach, the book glosses over key tenets of every day data science, like basic hypothesis testing. It also makes grand, sweeping generalizations about society as a whole where none can be made based on the population of the data (OK Cupid members hardly represent a random sampling of the US population).Some of the more egregious statements include ""There are times when a data set is so robust that if you set up your analysis right, you don't need to ask questions - it just tells you everything anyway"" and ""people are already compensated for their data: They get to use services like Facebook and Google...for free.""Putting the author's disregard of personal privacy aside, the narrative voice is filled with white male privilege. A few sections of the book made me generally uncomfortable in its approach to conversations about race, gender, and heterosexual relationships. We need a book about data science that highlights the process in a way that digital users can understand how their data is being analyzed and who is doing it responsibly. This is not it."

If you check, or look at a picture of the NSA (Why does an office building need a radar dome on the roof?), you will see that has always been their job. But while you are worrying about that, you are telling scores of commercial data aggregators everything about yourself, just by what you search for on Google, what you like on Facebook and where you access the internet from. Your sex, your race, your sexual orientation, your income, your politics, your IQ (from the type of French fries you like), it's all an open book. This book is the story from one involved nerd, along with some nice graphics.People's activities are somewhat limited, so the use of this data is mostly to target you for repression or elimination in a repressive society, to sell you something in a capitalist society, or for law enforcement to find you. So if you're only getting targeted Amazon ads, be happy.Of course, I can only imagine what the data will be used for after Skynet becomes active."
162,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/140018-kyle,2,"Readable, with nice diagrams, this is a hard book to hate. It is easy to be irritated by it, however. The basis of the book is a dozen or so interesting statistical points, with a chapter of conversational description for each. I'm curious where these statistical insights actually come from. Did the author pore over data for months? It doesn't feel that way. They have the feeling of nuggets gleaned from interns working over a period of years, that never ended up being useful anywhere else. Certainly, the discussion the author offers almost no isights beyond the immediately obvious. It isn't clear enough to be a good introduction to statistics, nor in-depth enough to offer interest to statisticians.The best chapters are the early ones oriented towards anyone trying to game the system a little on dating sites. How long message should be, what the opposite sex is looking for for someone your age, etc. The later chapters, trying to offer larger insights about culture and language are ... not convincing. Problematic, even."
163,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78503-chris,3,"This book has some great perspective on human behavior derived from data sets culled from many websites. It celebrates the fact that the amount of data that we have on people's actual beliefs and desires (as opposed to their stated beliefs) and breaks down what a lot of these data sets mean. A lot of it is very funny, even while it may be disturbing in its implications.For the first two-thirds, it was really interesting to me and had a lot of, if not surprising, at least very relevant things to say about human behaviors.The last third kind of drifted off into parts of the data that I am not too concerned with personally and the author's thoughts on what the future will be. It is not necessarily bad, just not what I was looking for, and also, a bit more broad than the particulars of the earlier chapters. "
164,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63344080-lucas,4,"This book offers a new look at old questions. Race, identity and the many differences between women and men in their approach to sex and relationship are shown here through data from an online dating website (OkCupid). I think the book presents valuable insights about racism because it observes actually behavior rather than self-reported questions.Some of the interesting book's find is the following:* Both black men and black women are strongly rejected in online dating* The women who received more attention of men aren't the more beautiful but those who have the high variance in their ratings (men can't say if they are beautiful or not).* Most people (~90%) who declare themselves bisexual is indeed heterosexual or homosexual.* Straight women are less propense to search only casual sex in online datingA negative thing is that the book contains a lot of digressions."

The possibilities of big data seem scary and exciting at the same time. This book presents them in a very accessible way to the average reader. I was skeptical of some the conclusions that the author presented but there's a lot of good conversation starters here. However, I don't think much of it will stick with me in the long run.I probably didn't make the best choice by listening to this on audiobook where numbers in charts were read out for minutes hahaOverall, a short, enjoyable, and timely read if you want to delve into popular science books."

Thought I was halfway through the book but had actually finished. Note sure whether the lack of mathematical analysis is a blessing or not - I guess that would depend on how capable the writer is - but much of the content, while interesting is a ""firm grasp of the obvious."""

This was a highly enjoyable-to-read, interesting-to-think-about, pop-data/analytics book. I appreciated the author's voice and sense of humor, but he often ventured into preachy territory. For someone to write so extensively on data that illuminates our biases, I wish he could have taken more care to hide his own."

169,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8886042-michelle,2,"Dataclysm: Who We Are When We Think No One's Looking by Christian Rudder is an interesting and fact filled book. I received an Advance Reader's Copy from Crown Publishing, a division of Random House and my opinions were formed by my reading of this uncorrected proof. Author Christian Rudder is one of the founders of the dating website OKCupid and he draws his research for this book primarily from the data that has been collected from paying members who are looking for relationships. He additionally mines data from other social media resources, dating services like Match.com and websites, and his pool of subjects include a cross section of the population that he believes is an excellent barometer for the opinions of Americans today. This book is filled with charts and maps and images to help you easily understand the data he has sourced and how it applies to the ""everyman"" in all of us.This book approaches a wide variety of topics - relationships, personal preferences, age, gender, race and upbringing and tries to answer the question ""Who are we really?"" by examining what we say versus how we act. Although I felt like I came away with a bunch of quotable tidbits and an interesting peek into how the data that we so freely place on the internet is used, I'm not quite sure that I learned very much about myself from this book. Many of the observances seemed rational to me and not all that thought provoking, and although some applied to me I didn't walk away feeling like I had much personal insight. A few of the passages left me feeling uneasy, simply because I'm not sure all the members of OKCupid were willing test subjects in Mr. Rudder's data laboratory. In one memorable instance photos of users were shown in an illustration of women who had very high and very low scores from fellow users in terms of their appeal. Although he was using them to make a point about the importance of having a photo that provokes a strong reaction is better than having a commonly pretty picture (which he describes as ""meh"") and he expressly thanks the subjects for their consent to be included in the book and to have their photos discussed, it still felt mildly squicky. Although the many other charts and illustrations in the book didn't deal in this same very personal representation of data, I did question the author's use of the OKCupid site at times. Although it may all be perfectly legal it makes me ask ""do I need to know this?"" and ""is the use of this data justified in a bigger, insight gaining way that makes it important to a reader?"" I'm not sure I have the answer to those questions.  As a collection of facts and data there were definitely a few things I hadn't thought about before - for example, there is a chart showing the 100 most common words used in the English language today from the Oxford English Corpus (a collection of modern writing's approach to vocabulary and word use) versus the top 100 used to express yourself on Twitter in the form of the service's 140 character tweet posts. It showed that although you may think the language of Twitter would somewhat abbreviate or diminish your ideas to get your point across, actually a person composing a tweet is much more selective and thoughtful about what their words will convey. It may help us to write clearer and in a concise style that contributes to an overall awareness of language. That awareness filters into the speech and style of a Twitter user versus a non-user. I liked the idea that my tweeting may help me generate a better and more vivid use of language. Still I kept returning to the fact that this book didn't really live up to the ""portrait of our essential selves"" claim that it was intended to be. It isn't a bad book. I just wish that I had a greater takeaway as a reader.One thing that truly irked me about this book is the mention of a website link where you could go, punch in your own data (two Facebook usernames) and get a personal illustration to see one of the ideas in this book in action. In the fourth chapter titled ""You Gotta be the Glue"" there is an illustration showing the overlap of the author's Facebook friends and his wife's friend's. He explains in depth how we create clusters of people in our lives that know us from a specific point of view - our work friends, childhood acquaintances, family members etc. Our spouse or significant other can overlap our Facebook friendships in many categories. Perhaps you are both friends with your parents and share relationships with other couples you met while you both attended a ballroom dance lesson. The shared connections can illustrate the bonds we have as couples, and can show you the places in your relationships that have a strong and meaningful connection. I thought this sounded really cool and was happy to find an example that could be personalized to me and allowed me to be a willing participant in the experiment to see how it felt. Unfortunately this awesome personalized tool simply doesn't exist. I have tried the link dozens of times over the past few weeks and didn't post my thoughts on the book since I wanted to see this chart in action, but it still gives me a ""Page Not Found"" message. The book's publication date is set for Tuesday September 9th, and since this is Saturday the 6th I would think that it would be active. I hope it will go live on Tuesday at the very least. I contacted the author through his Twitter page about the lack of a working link and received no response, however another reviewer on Goodreads said that when they contacted him through email they received a response that it would be functional by the end of August. If I had paid for this book rather than receiving an ARC I would be even more disappointed. The one big opportunity to gain personal insight is so far, a bust.If you find the sort of data in this book interesting I would check it out of the library or wait for the book to be marked down. I wouldn't consider it a must read but I am thankful I had the opportunity to read it. I hope you find this useful information, and I will update my opinion if the link works on the publication date. For now I can only give this book 2 of 5 stars. "
170,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5177572-genevieve,4,"* Originally reviewed on the Night Owls Press blog here. *First, it was the Internet. The Internet was going to change how businesses and organized operated. It was going to change how people live. But now something else has enthralled our imagination: big data.What is big data? We couldn't have big data without the Web. Our shift to online activity has made it easier to record and document massive reams of data and data trails about seemingly everything: Where do we go when we're online? What do we do? What do we read? The idea behind big data is that scientists can analyze that activity and parse out that information, information that might predict what we would do in hypothetical situations, or what we would be likely to do in the future. This largely possible because of scale. It's not about analyzing a person, a hundred people, or a thousand people; it's about waves and waves of information, millions and millions of data points.Think about how far we've come. In the third century BC, the first great repository of human knowledge was the Library of Alexandria. Today information is available in the exabytes. (What is an exabyte? Um...it's really, really big.) Big data is about size, but it's more than that. It's the fact that we have computers and databases that will log and analyze micro-activities, actions as simple as Facebook ""likes,"" our location recorded by the GPS in our phones, and the ""number of seconds or minutes spent reading a web page.""Dataclysm Who We Are When We Think No One's Looking by Christian Rudder sheds light on what that kind of datafication looks like. Rudder himself is the cofounder of OkCupid, the online dating site, which lives and breathes on seemingly mystical algorithms that dice and chop up streams of data. No other person might be more qualified to give us an insider's account on what big data can do.Rudder dabbles in statistical, psychological, and sociological theories and drills the chapters with clever infographics and beautifully rendered scatterplots—and some of them are truly works of art. (I used to work in data so I have a soft spot for data scientists and their work.) But where Rudder really excels is in the smorgasbord of findings. Patterns emerge from the data. Stare into the matrix and you'll see...a mirror into your very soul. At least that's what Rudder wants us to believe.You might be put off by Rudder's focus on dating sites but that's his métier. The trove of information on social interactions alone on dating sites is weirdly fascinating. In one example, Rudder finds that dating profiles of women who have a polarizing physical appearance are more likely to be approached for dates than the conventionally attractive person. (Is it fascination with novelty? boredom with the same 'ole, same 'ole?) Aren't we all at our most earnest and neurotic when it comes to love and relationships?A downside of this book is that if you read or pay attention to the tech news cycle, you may find some of Rudder's examples ho-hum repeats. For example, we've seen Google Trends tackle the flu in a kind of digital epidemiology approach. Nothing new there. Rudder retells these stories not to just fill the pages though but to constantly keep the beat of this book, which is asking deeper questions about who are we as a culture?Another downside is that even with all the reams of data and stats Rudder throws at us, ultimately, these are just cool factoids. It's an impressive avalanche of interesting data tidbits, but still just tidbits. The next challenge for big data: figuring out what truly matters, narrowing it down, cutting the noise.The heart of what makes big data interesting is that it's research that isn't gathered merely from surveys or interviews or even randomized control trial experiments, which we all know can be biased for a variety of reasons: subjects don't understand the questions, subjects lie, people obfuscate, they unconsciously modify their behavior to please researchers. Here the data is based on actual behavior in situ. And we can learn something from it, we can see patterns and discern behaviors that were otherwise invisible. It's like studying people in the wild.Most books about data are dry and boring, but Dataclysm is one that makes a mark. Part of this is Rudder staying grounded in primary data and real analysis. But an even bigger part is Rudder's never-stale writing style. Yes, the book is still pop-social science. This might frustrate a few bona fide data scientists out there. But Dataclysm works. The amusing stories and asides sprinkled throughout the book are full of zest but are never fluffy. For a numbers person, a Harvard-honed math-y guy working in Silicon Valley, Dataclysm is a remarkably fluid and readable book.Big data isn't the answer to the universe, the meaning of life, or to your other burning existential questions, but you'll still become privy to some interesting discoveries about culture and society.[Disclaimer: I received this book from Blogging for Books for an honest and candid review.] "

172,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16880570-khari,1,"Three months.Three months to listen to a book seven and a half hours long. Normally I can get one of those out in a week. Nope. Three months.I'm really tired of these books with fascinating titles that just disappoint.This book made me understand why people shout 'Science' at each other. It's because authors like this either underestimate their audience and dumb down what they have done, or they have terrible methodologies themselves and don't even realize it.For a book about data which necessarily must include statistics, there is a shocking dearth of statistic lingo in this book. He tries to justify himself in the end. His intention was to write a popular science book and he didn't want to clutter it with jargon like 'p', and 'confidence interval' and fun stuff like that. And, hey, I get it. I don't completely understand statistics yet, but even I know that words like 'significant' have a particular meaning that has to be defined in the world of numbers, but he never defines his terms. He says the methodology he used was 'rigorous' and it went through something 'like peer review' but never defines what his methodology was, and his 'peer review' was for his underling (who he knew btw) to check his numbers. That's not peer review. Hate to break it to you. Peer review is done by someone who does not know who wrote the paper, and they look over the whole paper, including the hypotheses and the conclusions as well as the number. It's not someone whose job is in your hands checking your math. But I know why he chose to do it this way. It's because there is no way on this planet that this atrocity would have ever been published in a good scientific journal....wait...let me rephrase that. Considering that there have been cases of complete hoax papers being published it is remotely possible that it could have been published in a badly edited, badly curated, motivated reasoning filled journal. Because that's what this was. Badly edited, badly curated, filled with motivated reasoning, and worst of all, terrible methodology that is never explained. This book couldn't hack it in the scientific publishing world so he had to go to a subsidiary of Penguin, Crown Publishing, that focuses on hobbies, memoirs, biographies, autobiographies, cooking, lifestyle, business and nonfiction. And honestly, that makes a ton of sense, because this reads more like a memoir than a book of scientific rigor. He makes unfounded claims, presents his interpretation as fact, and only considers one explanation for everything that he finds interesting.The part that absolutely killed me was he is talking about corpus linguistics. Corpus linguistics is gathering really large bodies of texts and making it searchable. There are a bunch of free ones out there, such as the Corpus of Contemporary American English (affectionately known as COCA), for your perusal. They have a bunch of ways of analyzing, you can look at the most used words, you can look at the collocations (the words immediately preceding and following a word), you can look at the word families that are used, the lexemes that are used, the type of word that most appears, the contexts in which words appear, which is a really good way to find out what a word actually means in use, in contrast to how it is defined in the dictionary. Corpus linguistics just happens to be my baby. It was my focus in my master's program and it's my focus in my PHD program. And guess what? I know nothing about it. I've already spent three years learning about it, and I'm going to go spend another 2-6, and I've read peer-reviewed articles about it, talked to experts, and read books about it, and I still know nothing, but I know enough to know that how he's using it is mind bogglingly bogus. He basically does character counting. He counts how many words show up in a tweet, calculates the mean character length, then compares it to the mean character length in Shakespeare and concludes that since the mean character length in tweets is longer, people today are using language in a more nuanced way than Shakespeare was....mean character length. Or his other technique was to make a word list of the most used words and show that it was similar to Shakespeare because 'the' and 'a' appeared at the top. No duh Sherlock, they're function words. They happen to be required every time you are referring to a singular noun. They would show up at the top of the word list of this review as well and that would mean nothing about the similarity between reviews and tweets. They are different registers who both follow the rules of the English language, ergo, functional words such as articles and pronouns and prepositions would occur more often simply because they are closed classes that are requisite for forming phrases that make sense.So there you go, a very brief, cogent rebuttal for one of his most important methods of analysis. But that rebuttal is actually rebutting his intention, not what he actually did. What he actually did was include, on his erstwhile 'word' list, things like 'the', 'a', ''s', 'Peru' 'my blue eyes', 'tall for an Asian', etc. .........How, in the name of all that is grounded in the study of linguistics, can those things be defined as 'words'?!?!? What definition is he using?!? He isn't using one! He's just conglomerating everything that he finds interesting together and calling it a 'word' while not even recognizing that what he finds interesting is subjective! It's not a parameter by which to define something! At first I was like, huh, is he using morphemes as the basis of his 'word'? ""'s"" would be the the third person possessive morpheme, I can see that, after all 'the' 'a' and 'Peru' are all single morpheme words. But then you have 'my blue eyes' that's not a word, that's a phrase! All of the words in that phrase aren't even single morpheme words! So why on earth does the third person possessive deserve its own place of glory but the plural 's' does not!?!This is the problem with popular 'science' books. People read them, feel like they are now informed and use the same arguments that they read about without ever realizing that the books aren't science. There is no scientific method in this book. He never defines his terms, he barely defines his variables. He has a million variables, and doesn't distinguish between them. It's not an experimental study so it's fine that he doesn't have a control group, but he should be trying to make the groups that he is splitting people into as uniform as possible and he doesn't even really attempt it. His variables are men and women, black, white, Asian, and Hispanic. He never even limited his findings to people from the USA. He just assumed that everyone was. He never factored in educational status which would have a huge impact, and that information actually is in the data set, so he could have, but he didn't. He didn't even mention it as a confound! And that's just the point. Everything is a conclusion for him. He argued that there are certain topics that are anathema to certain groups because the word denoting that topic only appears once. No. It does not mean that they are anathema to that group. I can think of a dozen reasons why someone would choose not to put something that they are interested in onto a public forum. I am pretty sure that an Otolaryngologist is not going to put that as their profession on OKCupid, simply because most people don't know what that means, they are just going to go with 'doctor' because it's simpler and gets the point across. That doesn't mean that otolarynogology is a taboo subject because it's only mentioned once. And besides, the fact that it is mentioned at all is already proof positive that it is not a taboo subject, taboo subjects are epitomized by never being mentioned at all and referred to circularly. So why didn't he mention all the other terms that are never mentioned, like muons and antileptons? (No, I don't know what those are either). The self-introductions on OKCupid (which is what he studied) are texts designed to elicit a certain response. They are a specific register, a register that each writer assumes will be the most likely to get them what they want, a date. As such they are inherently not generalizable to populations as a whole. They are only generalizable as 'the words that people use to try and present themselves as a satisfactory date'. There is a purpose behind it and it shows only a very small subset of language use, taking it to mean that it epitomizes someone's character and identity is horrifying. People change how they talk constantly. They talk differently when they write as compared to when they speak. They talk differently depending on if they know their audience or not. They talk differently depending on the power dynamics of the situation. They talk differently depending on how they are feeling at the moment. Studying the language used in self-introductory texts on OKCupid is very interesting and a worthwhile subject in and of itself, but you cannot generalize out to the public. The people on OKCupid are not a random selection of people, they are self-selected to be rather outgoing, not so privacy concerned, not willing to spend their money on web-dating, mostly singly people who are interested in romantic liaisons. They are, according to his own admission of the data, mostly liberal and progressive, mostly college educated, those account for 31% and 34% of the US population respectively. That is not even broken down by sex or race, if I were to spend the time doing that it would show an even smaller portion of the population for each, you can't generalize out to everyone else in the US based on a sub population. That would be like saying 50% of the population of the US are women, and women generally score higher in compassion, therefore the US is a compassionate nation...what? That doesn't even make sense.Finally, the thing that really just made me crack up was when he said ""and I say this as someone who is reflexively critical of the left."" That made me die. Why, why did that make me die? Because it doesn't mean what you think it means. It doesn't mean that he automatically looks at what people on the left say critically. It doesn't mean that his automatic response is to be skeptical. It means to embrace your subjective understandings of reality as a basis for analyzing social interactions. Being reflexively critical is a tenet of feminist post-structuralist analysis, or you could also argue that it is a postmodern, post-Marxist analysis as well. Regardless of who you decide is the ultimate progenitor of such an idea, it remains an ideology of the left. By using it he showed that he was on the left. By trying to present himself as a balanced and disinterested analyzer he showed himself to be controlled by a particular worldview."
173,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51602586-dominika,4,"A good soft introduction on data analysis, particularly in regards to human interaction. I thought it was fun and simple enough for the layman, but not simple to the point that it's lying about the capacity of what big data can do (as an example, I deal with a lot of research participants who do not have an email or do not use their email often). I really appreciated him talking about the limitations, as well as some qualitative methods and how they can be used. The whole point of all this is to see how our private, online behavior is actually a great insight into the human condition. Like how the rate of gay porn consumption is the same across every state, and what factors are important to each racial group. I know I made this sound super boring but it isn't. "

You might not even be too surprised, if they started to learn what music people probably like, by the way they dress, speak, or act (although it would be impressive). But, what if they had hundreds of thousands, or tens of millions of customers a day? How much would they learn about what music people like, if they could somehow deal with that many customers a day?What if, instead of a music store, people came to your store to find something more personal, like a girlfriend or boyfriend?Welcome to the book Dataclysm, where one of the founders of the website OkCupid shows us just what every website you ever use is able to tell about you. That's slightly an exaggeration, of course; dating websites do get a view of us that is a little different than most. But then, Amazon sees you when you put your money where your mouth is. Google sees what you're trying to find, or find out about, or where you're finding directions to. Facebook, of course, probably knows who your real friends are better than what you are willing to admit out loud.If you get creeped out easily by the loss of secrecy (otherwise known as ""privacy"", when it's secrecy that we like) that comes from using the Internet, this is probably not the book for you.However, if you like to leaven your opinions about topics like race (and racism) and sex (and sexism) with some actual data (not just your own personal experience), this book is a revelation. Here is a more or less randomly picked sampling of what you get in this book, not just presented as an assertion, but backed up with mountains of data:1) racism against blacks in America is not just real and enduring, but is equally rampant among Asians and Hispanic Americans as among Anglos2) Asian-Americans on dating sites use a uniquely low number of misspelled words compared to all other ethnicities3) men do not give up trying to date that 20-year old woman until they are over 30, whereas the man who looks best to a 20-year old woman is likely to be around 234) men do not give up trying to date that 30-year old woman until they are over 40, whereas the man who looks best to a 30-year old woman is likely to be around 305) of self-identified straight women on OkCupid, 26% said they had a sexual encounter with a woman, and enjoyed it (more than 3 times the analogous percentage of self-identified straight men)6) by just looking at your ""likes"" on Facebook, you can determine with 60% accuracy whether or not someone is the child of parents who got divorced before they turned 21 (this was in 2012, and the algorithms have probably gotten only better since then)7) women who get a lot of 1's and 5's (out of 5) on their picture, are more likely to get messaged, than women who get a lot of 3's, even though the average opinion of their looks is the sameIf you are online, there are servers (computers that serve up websites to your desktop, laptop, or smartphone) which know quite a lot about you and the others in the society you live in. The people you really don't want to have this kind of information, already have it. The only question is, will you? If knowledge is power, then right now there is a profound imbalance of power being created by this much data. Christian Rudder has done us the favor of showing us what he has (aggregated, of course, so that no individual is identifiable). Take a look."
175,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4579658-rob-kitchin,2,"The stated aim of Dataclysm is to introduce lay readers to the era of big data, the possibilities of such data, and the types of analysis used to make sense of them. The problems with the book start with the title and subtitle, neither of which, I think, make much sense. Dataclysm, Rudder explains, is a play on cataclysm: the wiping away of one era to be replaced by a new one. However, big data is set to complement small data, not wipe them away as small data are generated to answer specific questions rather than being a by-product that is then repurposed, and most big data are held by private corporations or government and are not readily open to researchers. All of the data that Rudder analyzes is from social media; they are data produced precisely because we think someone is looking (for a date, for conversation, for information, to provoke a reaction, etc). Uploading information to the internet is largely a process of the presentation of the self, as Goffman’s famous theory would frame the activity. Even if other people cannot see the answers to direct questions, as when filling in questions on a dating site, the answers shape the user profile and the process of matching -- something that users are aware of, consider and present to.The book then proceeds by discussing social media data and what they might reveal about human behaviour and society. Crucially, however, there is no systematic discussion of big data per se, its forms and characteristics, no discussion of data analytics, and only a cursory discussion of the many ethical, social and political implications of such data. There is no discussion of statistics, or statistical tests performed on the data presented, nor data mining, data analytics, machine learning, pattern recognition, profiling, prediction, etc. The irony here is that Rudder’s company – OkCupid – employs these techniques to be able to process and match potential partners, yet he never explains how this is achieved. Instead, the entire analysis is rooted in the empiricist form of data science, rather than data-driven science, and never proceeds beyond description. As such, the analysis of gender and race he presents are based on a ‘letting the data speak for themself’ approach and constitutes armchair interpretation. He barely engages with the vast academic literature on quantitative analysis of race and gender that has taken place for several decades using large data sets such as the census or public administration data. Rudder has access to an enormous set of very interesting data that could be used to conduct some fascinating sociological and psychological analysis. Instead what we get are a series of descriptive statistics and banal revelations, most of which are already well established. The result is a book that hints at the potential of big data and data science but undersells it substantially, and it under-estimates in my view the readership level of its potential audience by never progressing beyond mathematics and data visualisations used in junior school. In contrast, books such as The Signal and the Noise by Nate Silver provide a much wider and deeper discussion. This is a shame as Rudder is an engaging writer and he has privileged access to an extremely rich social data that could be used to conduct some wonderful and sophisticated social science research. Such rich research and its policy implications are barely hinted at."
176,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8684527-andra-n,5,"I postponed reading Dataclysm for some time, but I’m glad I took my time to read it. Its author, Christian Rudder first caught my attention in an article written after the Facebook scandal over the experiments made over its users, where he explained in a rather unapologetic manner, that this is the very nature of internet’s success and efficiency increase. His opinion is a consequence of his experience running the dating site OkCupid where decisions based on people’s behavior must be made in order to obtain optimal results. “It’s a delicate illusion, the Internet.”Dataclysm is a book about Big Data and Romantic behavior. However, it is definitely not a recipe for making a perfect profile or having more success on social networks. This book is rather a series of conclusions drawn from the aggregated data obtained from millions of interactions mainly from sites like OkCupid and other social networks or Google. This is not the story of the individual, it is the story of the collective. What distinguishes the work of Christian Rudder is that given his privileged position at OKCupid, he had in hand large amounts of data with which he could play and analyze freely. As opposed to other studies of human behavior that have as subjects mostly a bunch of students from well-known universities, his data sets contain personal information of people of all ages and races, from the US. This book has lots of pop-culture references, amusing and sometimes insightful comments. What is most intriguing about his studies is the fact that they are made over information that we rather think it is private. We get a glimpse of our rather politically incorrect behaviors as human beings.I found particularly interesting the comparison between woman preferences and man preferences when it comes to a potential partner’s age, attractiveness and race. Humor is not left out of the book, as the paragraph depicting women ratings of attractiveness of men: “Only one guy in six is “above average” in an absolute sense. Sex appeal isn’t something commonly quantified like this, so let me put it in a more familiar context: translate this plot to IQ, and you have a world where the women think 58 percent of men are brain damaged.”The comparison of words most commonly used by people on their dating profiles from different races or sexual orientation was also a chapter that I found quite interesting. The author shows via text analysis that several race related patterns emerge. “White people differentiate themselves mostly by their hair and eyes, Asians by their country of origin, Latinos by their music. But because of the way the math is set up, the three non-white lists are evidence of cultures that I, as a white man, am not supposed to know…the gay male list is very different from the other three. It’s full of pop culture and has comparatively few references to the user’s immediate person and family.”I would definitely recommend this book that tackles a wide range of topics to anyone who is interested in data science as well as those curious about the weirdness of human nature."
177,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18688-cody,4,"Much e-ink has been spilled--rightfully so--about the brave new world we live online. Targeted advertising, data breaches, the NSA; it’s easy to grow overwhelmed by the potential dangers of sharing personal information electronically. Practically everything we do on our phones and computers is tracked, often in an effort to sell us something or gain some upper hand (financially, politically, socially, etc.). Consequentially, there is now an unprecedented amount of detailed data about us that's ripe for the parsing.Beyond the obvious advantages for market research, is there a benefit to all of this data? Christian Rudder, co-founder of the online dating site OkCupid, thinks so. He’s been approaching the internet over the past decade as one big sociological experiment, and his new book, Dataclysm: Who We Are (When We Think No One’s Looking), explores his findings in depth, some of which are rather mind blowing.Penned in clear and witty prose and full of colorful charts and graphs, Dataclysm breezes by, though many of the insights linger, obsess, and often unsettle. We learn that if you apply network analysis to a couple’s groups of friends on Facebook, you can quite accurately predict how likely they are to stay together. And that Google searches beginning with the phrase “Is my husband…” most commonly end with “gay?” And that women tend to find men who are close to their age as the most attractive, whereas men, up until 50 years old, generally think that women in their early 20s look the best.Even in cases where the results reinforce long held views, what is new, Rudder asserts, “is our ability to test ideas, established ones, famous ones even, against the atomized actions of millions.” But the implications go beyond the sheer volume of the numbers. The ability we now have to track Google searches and site clicks provides us with much more accurate data, as these behaviors transcend the murkier self-reporting that plagues more traditional surveys, especially in regards to controversial topics. Rudder argues that the insights gleaned from all of this new data, even when the results are unflattering, are too beneficial to pass up, as they give us a far clearer and more accurate portrait of our true interests and behaviors.As Rudder frequently admits, the internet is still very young, which means that these data sets lack a long view. What Dataclysm does offer us, though, is another angle from which to consider our online lives. Whether you find the book’s content and approaches revelatory or creepy (at times I found them both), the results are fascinating and the ramifications huge. It reminds us that, as a sociological opportunity, we’re in the midst of a monumental sea change--one that is granting us astoundingly far-reaching insight into who we really are."

I felt like I read this constantly having to pick my jaw up off the floor, but that it had no major takeaways: we are all more racist than we think.

Six degrees of separation is the idea that all living things and everything else in the world are six or fewer steps away from each other so that a chain of ""a friend of a friend"" statements can be made to connect any two people in a maximum of six steps.)I learned this term in English in this book: pratfall effect.(In social psychology, the pratfall effect is the tendency for attractiveness to increase or decrease after an individual makes a mistake, depending on the individual's perceived ability to perform well in a general sense. A perceived highly-competent individual would be, on average, more likable after committing a blunder, while the opposite would occur if a perceived average person makes a mistake.)If you got polar evaluation from dating website. ave. 3 (1/1/1/5/5/5) you will get more private messages than those who get (3/3/3/3/3/3), means someone dislikes you, someone surely likes you!On Facebook, from the ""like"" you clicked, one can know if this person isgay or not ( 88%) ....shocking!lesbian or not (75%).....but how?white or African american (95%).junkies or not (65%) If parents are divorced before you are 21.

Then they prefer men a few years younger. Men find 20 year old women to be the most attractive--refardless of age (from 20-50 men all find women between 20-24 the most attractive)• Polarizing people get more attention--someone ranked with both very high & beauty ratings will receive more messages than someone with an equal average, but of more middle numbers• The smell of shit is added to perfumes and flowers, making the whole actually smell better• 74 men died of nostalgia in the Civil War (according to army records)• Twitter may actually be improving its users' writing ability--in both word length and density & brevity of ideas• More will be written on Twitter in the next 2 years, than all books ever published• 'God' has been in steady decline since the early 1800s--the word is used only about a third as much now as it was then• The best digital messages are only 40 to 60 characters long• One of the best compatibility questions is 'Do you like scary movies?' Answering the same to this question is more predictive of a successful long term relationship than 'big issues' like religion, politics, and looks• Black and White Quarterbacks perform equally down to the decimal: 81.55 (qb rating)• Zodiac signs have no effect on compatibility at all. Race has less effect than religion, politics, or education• 85% of OkCupid users have gone to college• Women are more 'race-loyal' than men in regards to attraction & relationships• 'White sounding' names get 50% more interviews with the exact same résumé as 'black sounding' names like 'Lakisha or 'Jamal'• On Facebook, every percentile of attractiveness gives a man two friends. It gives a woman three.• Often parents want their daughters to be pretty...but 'not too pretty.' Does anyone imagine limitations on a son?• Obama's race probably cost him 3 to 5 percentage points of the popular vote. The most popular Google search for the n-word in history was in Nov 2008, after he won. • 'Rumor' was a winged roman godess with 100 eyes and 100 mouths who spoke only the most hurtful side of the truth...(at least according to rumor)• The agenda of spreading a rumor is directed more for an audience, rather than the subject of a rumor• The Internet makes us vile creatures (see the 'online disinhibition effect')• The government has the greatest invested interest in tracking negativity. Mathematical models exist which predict the otcome of war, how long it will last, who will win, and how many will die• In 1950, the dawn of television, the American Political Science Association called for more polarization in national politics--the parties had grown too close together, the electorate didn't have clear choices. What made good television then, makes good television now, with 100 times the channels.• We seem to define ourselves as much by what we hate as by what we love• Stereotypes are true: white people self-differentiate themselves by their looks, Asians by their origin country, and Latinos by their music• What we don't talk about can be as illuminating as that which we do• Sex is the single most important grouping humanity has. It has existed forever--long before race or creed. In the US, all men were able to vote before women were. With that said, we are all fundamentally similar, much more so than our differences• The United States is divided: all but 4 presidential elections since 1952 would've flipped had 5% of the electorate changed their minds. Any group of people representing that number is therefore very important politically.• Gay porn searches show homosexuality occurs at the same rate nationwide. In less tolerant places however, gays are just more likely to stay in the closet to avoid persecution• In the US, the most popular Google search that begins with 'Is my husband...' most commonly ends in 'gay?' 'Cheating' comes up 10% less, and 'an alcoholic' occurs 8 times less, 'depressed' 10 times less.• Google Search data is ineffective for estimating the number of lesbians in the country, because straight men looking for porn throw off the data• The government counts everyone who's not married as 'single,' regardless of their actual relationship status• Gay and Straight people are looking for the same things in a relationship according to the numbers• Sexuality is more fluid than we realize: 51% of women and 18% of men have bad, or would like to have a same-sex experience• Who we say we are and how we behave are two separate things• Any nation is an 'Imagined Community'--comprised mostly of fellow numbers you'll never meet, and may share little in common with• The relocation of individuals in india & Southeast Asia, as well as the industrialization reflect England circa 1950, and the US 50 years later--driven by the economy, farmers move to city jobs for higher pay• The UK has 5.9 million security cameras: 1 for every 11 citizens• Search data uncovered drug side effects before they were discovered by the FDA warning system, revealing paroxetine and paravastatin can cause hypoglycemia in patients• Facebook was collecting 500 terabytes of information everyday...back in 2012• If you've ever signed up for a website with a fake zip code or fake birthday, you're a criminal--in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act• A 12 year old visiting newyorktimes.com is a criminal as well--violating their Terms of Service and the working doctrine of the US Department of Justice• Twitter usage by high school grads vs college educated is equal (17 & 18% respectively). Black people have a disproportionate presence on Twitter (nearly two fold: 29% vs 16% among whites).

Not my finest several hours.What I like about this book is that it's based on data that's not collected by people putting up fronts or creating a persona. Shit's real. My favorite piece of data was that, relative to other identities, black men talk very little online about Social Distortion. This is definitely a stereotype that should gain some momentum. "
185,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,5,"Summary: One of the best data-driven books I have read. I think the title might be why there are so many haters. He presents a lot of tough issues using a medium ""dating"" that is relatable. Also, you should not try to read this on audiobook. You need to see the graphs. There are a lot of haters that present their background as if that's relevant in some way. It's not. B/c while they typically seem to understand data, they seem to lack reading comprehension skills. What Rudder is presenting is not findings from data work. He's attempting to use data as a backdrop to talk about a host of issues that are relevant in the modern era. The data is simply a view of what one might see. Instead of presenting some other social scientist's work, he's using in-house research, which, incidentally is a larger, better joined, more carefully collected, and larger geographical grouping than what most people have.Even if you find him to be less enlightening than his blog (I don't use twitter)-as some mentioned- I would guess this long-form argument could not be divined from the constraints of that medium of communication. He would have to be even more brilliant than I think he is just from reading this book!! Maybe... the guy is a Harvard grad..... But in case I'm right, below are my notes....p. 14 - ""If Big Data's two running stories have been about surveillance and money, for the last three years I've been working on third: the human story."" ""...as a close second, they're demographers of an unprecedented reach."" P. 15 - He talks about the fact that his purpose is to generalize so he can do his job of bringing people together at scale (not with individual nonsensical exceptions as discussed by A LOT of the haters!). He's trying to understand and infer from the data. And his inference work is wonderful, presenting possible misinterpretations that were tested and reviewed. p. 46 - Actually this entire chapter of how they essentially created a series of studies to demonstrate that variation in attractiveness get you noticed as much as attractiveness does. Freakin' Brilliant!p. 47 - Did not know there was a name to it: ""the Pratfall Effect"" - ""As long as you're generally competent, making a small, occasional mistake makes people think you're more competent. Flaws call out good stuff all the more."" p. 48 - It's better to ""Purposely abandon the middle road."" p. 53 - Regarding NLP work on Twitter...I love the hypothesis that Twitter might be improving its users' writing. This is all amazing stuff as relates to transformations in human language and has application in ways that are ignored even today.""he calculated the typical world length in Hamlet (3.99) and in a collection of Wodehouse's stories (4.05)... both less than the length in his Twitter sample (4.80).""""Comparative linguistics have long traced groups of community through language."" p. 54 - The chart on changing characteristics of speech patterns. The idea being that tribe creation is no longer geographically constrained, AND ALSO, you can catch it in the language used... something that we were NEVER able to do in the past (think Chinese, Cantonese, Mandarin, and the 50+ other dialects). Super nerdy awesome point.p. 62 - ""Sitewide, the copy-and-paste, strategy underperforms the from-scratch messaging about 25%, but in terms of effort-in results-out - it always wins: measuring by replies received to compose a new message each time."" What an awesome thing to take look at. Intriguing when you think about marketing/scaled response composition. p. 82 - Confounders. This is a great way to present this material so often ignored or misunderstood in the field. Generally, this chapter does a great job presenting a series of charts with each of the appropriate analysis points you'd ask in a row. I did not need the written part, but I can see why he has it. I can also see why some who read via audiobooks struggled. It would be hard to understand this book if all you had was the audio.Chapter 7: The Beauty Myth - The whole way he presents it in the context of thinking about his daughter is great. The work that supports it is fantastic. On eating disorders, he describes a possible place to look for solutions to help others....p. 104 ""... but before the behavior was digitized, there was practically no way to get directly at this problem, at least not until visible damage had already occurred. There was only rumor - an ear at the bathroom door, perhaps a parent's sad suspicion.""Chapter 8: p. 106-107. He talks about how b/c people don't tell you their deepest thoughts, you had to really work hard (snoop, catch people unguarded, etc) to figure out what they thought. Then he talks about the truthfulness of search engines like Google. How the mechanism itself is far harder to trick. This is REALLY important to what we think of as the fundamental changes in the types of data we now are able to collect. Chapter 9: There were a number of criticisms I read that lead back to this chapter and I think it might just have been unclear how to read the charts as well to think about it. That's a fair point. I think what he's trying to say is even in words there is racial signaling on both sides. If we think about the words we use to attract others and identify tribe, in the context of dating it's super apparent. For me, then I think about how this relates to concepts like code-switching in the workplace. We focus a lot on the accent, and we know vocabulary matters. But this implies something far deeper. If you read each of the lists and you clearly identify with one group, it's likely, you are farther culturally from other groups than just skin color. This is quite profound on anyone working on things like ""How do we create a single human race without such aberrant division."" Word. p. 155 - If you care at all about gay rights, these stats are important and also very sad. If I've got him correct- and these are the footnotes, we're underestimating the gay population of the US by a lot and most are NOT dating b/c they are socially unable to do so, either because they are in the closet and scared to be themselves or there are structural reasons in their community that prevent them from self-expression. Chapter 12- Great segue into the work on migration, which covers not an only lifestyle choice but also works availability and more. This work is really relevant for - what is not mentioned, the dying cities phenomenon. p. 181 - He's arguing against things like Klout scores. This is why I do not understand the arguments that he doesn't want to drill in or he's missing some sort of causality.. he's not. This book is about what the general number are telling you out of various inferences that are possible.p. 184 - Mountain Dew Story. A great example of what not to crowdsource.p. 186 - ""If employers begin to use algorithms to infer how intelligent you are or whether you use drugs, then your only choice will be to game the system - or to borrow the wording from the previous chapter, 'manage your brand.' To beat the machine, you must act like a machine, which means you've lost to the machine. And that's assuming you can guess what you're supposed to do in the first place. Apparently, one of the strongest correlates to intelligence in the research was liking 'curly fries.' Who could reverse engineer that?p. 187 - very intersting comments on survellience and data use by the government. p. 193 - He talks about the pennies from personal data payments will not amount ot anything that actually helps people. Moreover, it is highly likely to just be passed back through to consumers."

I only got to 60% before the book was over and the notes began (and on a Kindle flipping back and forth is, for me, a pain). Also meat-wise, I was expecting something along the lines of Outlers, which of course this is the opposite of in theme since it looks at the trends of all and not the accomplishments of a few. But I wanted it to be a book I remembered long after. It's really not. Although it's an interesting read while you're in it. Big Data, when it matures, means so much info that will be longitudinal, something data analysts struggle with ever getting enough of, so in that sense this is very exciting, and it's amazing what we can tell already from the little we have.I do think the book suffered mightily by being read on a Kindle (or any e-reader, especially black and white). The graphs used red and it was not always easy to tell what was gray because it was red and what was gray because it was gray--or if anything was really gray. Since much of this book runs off the graphs, that it's a bad thing not to be able to fully read them (and at the size they were at on my Paperwhite, I also felt challenged to really dive in). I did love reading that the author was a disciple of sorts of Tufte. And I appreciated the amount of info given in the charts.I had a hard time getting through the first chapter. I think the author left out a primary reason male and female reactions to potential partners' age might change (or not) over time depending on gender--and normally I'd give him a break on this since it's from another field of study, but since he runs an online dating site and is reporting on that robust data set, then I'd expect him to understand the drives of men (be drawn to young and fertile no matter how old they get) and women (pick a good provider--until she reaches a certain age, realizes she is not going to need a provider (either because she does not have kids or because she provides just fine for herself), and then go for something young and fun). This behavior has been well documented and while I thought he was going to touch on it at one point, it really didn't happen enough for me to ever get that comfortable with the first example out of the gate. That said, I didn't have that issue with the rest of the book, so I did keep going and many of the sections were novel and interesting."

The visuals, though, are beautiful, always tell a story, and never waste a drop of ink on unnecessary information. These images reflect the book...for the most part. It's when the narrative steers away from its stated purpose (a data driven exploration of human nature) that I started to tire of Christian Rudders narrative voice. It's funny, irreverent, and insightful for most of the book and especially for the sections discussing OkCupid data. He writes best about the data he knows best and that's not surprising. But as the book advances Rudder starts to draw on unfamiliar datasets, make less rigorous assertions, and veer into both data fear-mongering and data evangelism. It was disappointing mostly because he promised to write a different kind of book than those which use data as a lens to prove the downfall of society or privacy, or predict incredible advances in technology and public intelligence. He asserts this book is special then proceeds to speculate about how invasive the NSA can be, how Twitter is unleashing our base instincts but also improving our vocabulary, and how online branding is the future of self evaluation. These parts were, in truth, boring compared to the insights about romantic relationship. In summary, I'm not sure where this book fits in the social science and statistics cannon. It's not the most insightful or the most fun, which leaves it somewhere in between and probably only worth picking up if you love the genre. "
188,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35538316-lindy,3,"I feel like I write this in every nonfiction book review, but I wished there was more depth! I also wished someone more, I don't know, anthropologically minded had given this book a once over before publication. For example, Rudder treats data showing that bisexual men are more likely to prefer/message other men on OkCupid when compared to older bisexual men as if it were longitudinal, and implies that bi men's sexual preferences change as they get older. However he does not take into account what these men may be doing off the service; a young bisexual man will probably hit on women at a bar, but is at a considerably greater risk of being decked in the face if he were to do so to men. As the dating pool grows smaller with age, he may turn to the internet to scope out both genders. (To be fair, Rudder  does responsibly account for a similar phenomenon showing that North Dakotans are surprisingly liberal when it comes to causual sex in the next chapter and why that isn't the case.) Likewise, Rudder says that ""yass,"" which turns up in a list of words distinctive of popular twitter users, is a contraction of ""your ass."" This is true, but it's definitely not the most popular use. Nonetheless, Dataclysm is an interesting and accessible book, and I imagine it would be especially so to someone with no background in statistics. I appreciated that the author had a sense of humor, and I don't think (reading in 2017) that it has aged poorly, although it would have been helpful if Rudder had cited years in the text rather than simply ""last year."""
189,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33131867-neha,3,"I had seen a significant portion of the material before on the blog, but it's still worth a read. I loved the informal voice, and the use of various graphs to illustrate new findings. It read like a collection of smaller articles with specific results.A lot of the OkCupid data revealed particular preferences of men and women in terms of age, attractiveness, and ethnicity. I can understand why the overall findings may be upsetting, and I think readers should be cautious about how this actually applies to their lives. This book is not trying to give insider tips for finding more dates. I think it's very important to remember that there is an inherent selection bias in the OkCupid data: it only represents people who have, for one reason or another, decided to try online dating.I thought the book was going to be more about OkCupid's dataset, but I appreciated the discussions about Google, Facebook, and Twitter data. The last chapter describes the ongoing conflict of privacy that is absent from earlier chapters. While giving users complete ownership of their data may seem to solve many problems, I tend to disagree that it's entirely possible. Services can certainly provide an option for users to remove their data from the site, but once data is on the Internet, I think it's safe to assume that it will never fully disappear."
190,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11500849-jen,1,"A sloppy and irresponsible introduction to big data analytics. Taking a popular science approach, the book glosses over key tenets of every day data science, like basic hypothesis testing. It also makes grand, sweeping generalizations about society as a whole where none can be made based on the population of the data (OK Cupid members hardly represent a random sampling of the US population).Some of the more egregious statements include ""There are times when a data set is so robust that if you set up your analysis right, you don't need to ask questions - it just tells you everything anyway"" and ""people are already compensated for their data: They get to use services like Facebook and Google...for free.""Putting the author's disregard of personal privacy aside, the narrative voice is filled with white male privilege. A few sections of the book made me generally uncomfortable in its approach to conversations about race, gender, and heterosexual relationships. We need a book about data science that highlights the process in a way that digital users can understand how their data is being analyzed and who is doing it responsibly. This is not it."
191,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1492668-mark,3,"You are concerned that the NSA is aggregating data and spying on you? If you check, or look at a picture of the NSA (Why does an office building need a radar dome on the roof?), you will see that has always been their job. But while you are worrying about that, you are telling scores of commercial data aggregators everything about yourself, just by what you search for on Google, what you like on Facebook and where you access the internet from. Your sex, your race, your sexual orientation, your income, your politics, your IQ (from the type of French fries you like), it's all an open book. This book is the story from one involved nerd, along with some nice graphics.People's activities are somewhat limited, so the use of this data is mostly to target you for repression or elimination in a repressive society, to sell you something in a capitalist society, or for law enforcement to find you. So if you're only getting targeted Amazon ads, be happy.Of course, I can only imagine what the data will be used for after Skynet becomes active."
192,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/140018-kyle,2,"Readable, with nice diagrams, this is a hard book to hate. It is easy to be irritated by it, however. The basis of the book is a dozen or so interesting statistical points, with a chapter of conversational description for each. I'm curious where these statistical insights actually come from. Did the author pore over data for months? It doesn't feel that way. They have the feeling of nuggets gleaned from interns working over a period of years, that never ended up being useful anywhere else. Certainly, the discussion the author offers almost no isights beyond the immediately obvious. It isn't clear enough to be a good introduction to statistics, nor in-depth enough to offer interest to statisticians.The best chapters are the early ones oriented towards anyone trying to game the system a little on dating sites. How long message should be, what the opposite sex is looking for for someone your age, etc. The later chapters, trying to offer larger insights about culture and language are ... not convincing. Problematic, even."
193,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78503-chris,3,"This book has some great perspective on human behavior derived from data sets culled from many websites. It celebrates the fact that the amount of data that we have on people's actual beliefs and desires (as opposed to their stated beliefs) and breaks down what a lot of these data sets mean. A lot of it is very funny, even while it may be disturbing in its implications.For the first two-thirds, it was really interesting to me and had a lot of, if not surprising, at least very relevant things to say about human behaviors.The last third kind of drifted off into parts of the data that I am not too concerned with personally and the author's thoughts on what the future will be. It is not necessarily bad, just not what I was looking for, and also, a bit more broad than the particulars of the earlier chapters. "
194,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63344080-lucas,4,"This book offers a new look at old questions. Race, identity and the many differences between women and men in their approach to sex and relationship are shown here through data from an online dating website (OkCupid). I think the book presents valuable insights about racism because it observes actually behavior rather than self-reported questions.Some of the interesting book's find is the following:* Both black men and black women are strongly rejected in online dating* The women who received more attention of men aren't the more beautiful but those who have the high variance in their ratings (men can't say if they are beautiful or not).* Most people (~90%) who declare themselves bisexual is indeed heterosexual or homosexual.* Straight women are less propense to search only casual sex in online datingA negative thing is that the book contains a lot of digressions."

The possibilities of big data seem scary and exciting at the same time. This book presents them in a very accessible way to the average reader. I was skeptical of some the conclusions that the author presented but there's a lot of good conversation starters here. However, I don't think much of it will stick with me in the long run.I probably didn't make the best choice by listening to this on audiobook where numbers in charts were read out for minutes hahaOverall, a short, enjoyable, and timely read if you want to delve into popular science books."

Thought I was halfway through the book but had actually finished. Note sure whether the lack of mathematical analysis is a blessing or not - I guess that would depend on how capable the writer is - but much of the content, while interesting is a ""firm grasp of the obvious."""

This was a highly enjoyable-to-read, interesting-to-think-about, pop-data/analytics book. I appreciated the author's voice and sense of humor, but he often ventured into preachy territory. For someone to write so extensively on data that illuminates our biases, I wish he could have taken more care to hide his own."

199,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8886042-michelle,2,"Dataclysm: Who We Are When We Think No One's Looking by Christian Rudder is an interesting and fact filled book. I received an Advance Reader's Copy from Crown Publishing, a division of Random House and my opinions were formed by my reading of this uncorrected proof. Author Christian Rudder is one of the founders of the dating website OKCupid and he draws his research for this book primarily from the data that has been collected from paying members who are looking for relationships. He additionally mines data from other social media resources, dating services like Match.com and websites, and his pool of subjects include a cross section of the population that he believes is an excellent barometer for the opinions of Americans today. This book is filled with charts and maps and images to help you easily understand the data he has sourced and how it applies to the ""everyman"" in all of us.This book approaches a wide variety of topics - relationships, personal preferences, age, gender, race and upbringing and tries to answer the question ""Who are we really?"" by examining what we say versus how we act. Although I felt like I came away with a bunch of quotable tidbits and an interesting peek into how the data that we so freely place on the internet is used, I'm not quite sure that I learned very much about myself from this book. Many of the observances seemed rational to me and not all that thought provoking, and although some applied to me I didn't walk away feeling like I had much personal insight. A few of the passages left me feeling uneasy, simply because I'm not sure all the members of OKCupid were willing test subjects in Mr. Rudder's data laboratory. In one memorable instance photos of users were shown in an illustration of women who had very high and very low scores from fellow users in terms of their appeal. Although he was using them to make a point about the importance of having a photo that provokes a strong reaction is better than having a commonly pretty picture (which he describes as ""meh"") and he expressly thanks the subjects for their consent to be included in the book and to have their photos discussed, it still felt mildly squicky. Although the many other charts and illustrations in the book didn't deal in this same very personal representation of data, I did question the author's use of the OKCupid site at times. Although it may all be perfectly legal it makes me ask ""do I need to know this?"" and ""is the use of this data justified in a bigger, insight gaining way that makes it important to a reader?"" I'm not sure I have the answer to those questions.  As a collection of facts and data there were definitely a few things I hadn't thought about before - for example, there is a chart showing the 100 most common words used in the English language today from the Oxford English Corpus (a collection of modern writing's approach to vocabulary and word use) versus the top 100 used to express yourself on Twitter in the form of the service's 140 character tweet posts. It showed that although you may think the language of Twitter would somewhat abbreviate or diminish your ideas to get your point across, actually a person composing a tweet is much more selective and thoughtful about what their words will convey. It may help us to write clearer and in a concise style that contributes to an overall awareness of language. That awareness filters into the speech and style of a Twitter user versus a non-user. I liked the idea that my tweeting may help me generate a better and more vivid use of language. Still I kept returning to the fact that this book didn't really live up to the ""portrait of our essential selves"" claim that it was intended to be. It isn't a bad book. I just wish that I had a greater takeaway as a reader.One thing that truly irked me about this book is the mention of a website link where you could go, punch in your own data (two Facebook usernames) and get a personal illustration to see one of the ideas in this book in action. In the fourth chapter titled ""You Gotta be the Glue"" there is an illustration showing the overlap of the author's Facebook friends and his wife's friend's. He explains in depth how we create clusters of people in our lives that know us from a specific point of view - our work friends, childhood acquaintances, family members etc. Our spouse or significant other can overlap our Facebook friendships in many categories. Perhaps you are both friends with your parents and share relationships with other couples you met while you both attended a ballroom dance lesson. The shared connections can illustrate the bonds we have as couples, and can show you the places in your relationships that have a strong and meaningful connection. I thought this sounded really cool and was happy to find an example that could be personalized to me and allowed me to be a willing participant in the experiment to see how it felt. Unfortunately this awesome personalized tool simply doesn't exist. I have tried the link dozens of times over the past few weeks and didn't post my thoughts on the book since I wanted to see this chart in action, but it still gives me a ""Page Not Found"" message. The book's publication date is set for Tuesday September 9th, and since this is Saturday the 6th I would think that it would be active. I hope it will go live on Tuesday at the very least. I contacted the author through his Twitter page about the lack of a working link and received no response, however another reviewer on Goodreads said that when they contacted him through email they received a response that it would be functional by the end of August. If I had paid for this book rather than receiving an ARC I would be even more disappointed. The one big opportunity to gain personal insight is so far, a bust.If you find the sort of data in this book interesting I would check it out of the library or wait for the book to be marked down. I wouldn't consider it a must read but I am thankful I had the opportunity to read it. I hope you find this useful information, and I will update my opinion if the link works on the publication date. For now I can only give this book 2 of 5 stars. "
200,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5177572-genevieve,4,"* Originally reviewed on the Night Owls Press blog here. *First, it was the Internet. The Internet was going to change how businesses and organized operated. It was going to change how people live. But now something else has enthralled our imagination: big data.What is big data? We couldn't have big data without the Web. Our shift to online activity has made it easier to record and document massive reams of data and data trails about seemingly everything: Where do we go when we're online? What do we do? What do we read? The idea behind big data is that scientists can analyze that activity and parse out that information, information that might predict what we would do in hypothetical situations, or what we would be likely to do in the future. This largely possible because of scale. It's not about analyzing a person, a hundred people, or a thousand people; it's about waves and waves of information, millions and millions of data points.Think about how far we've come. In the third century BC, the first great repository of human knowledge was the Library of Alexandria. Today information is available in the exabytes. (What is an exabyte? Um...it's really, really big.) Big data is about size, but it's more than that. It's the fact that we have computers and databases that will log and analyze micro-activities, actions as simple as Facebook ""likes,"" our location recorded by the GPS in our phones, and the ""number of seconds or minutes spent reading a web page.""Dataclysm Who We Are When We Think No One's Looking by Christian Rudder sheds light on what that kind of datafication looks like. Rudder himself is the cofounder of OkCupid, the online dating site, which lives and breathes on seemingly mystical algorithms that dice and chop up streams of data. No other person might be more qualified to give us an insider's account on what big data can do.Rudder dabbles in statistical, psychological, and sociological theories and drills the chapters with clever infographics and beautifully rendered scatterplots—and some of them are truly works of art. (I used to work in data so I have a soft spot for data scientists and their work.) But where Rudder really excels is in the smorgasbord of findings. Patterns emerge from the data. Stare into the matrix and you'll see...a mirror into your very soul. At least that's what Rudder wants us to believe.You might be put off by Rudder's focus on dating sites but that's his métier. The trove of information on social interactions alone on dating sites is weirdly fascinating. In one example, Rudder finds that dating profiles of women who have a polarizing physical appearance are more likely to be approached for dates than the conventionally attractive person. (Is it fascination with novelty? boredom with the same 'ole, same 'ole?) Aren't we all at our most earnest and neurotic when it comes to love and relationships?A downside of this book is that if you read or pay attention to the tech news cycle, you may find some of Rudder's examples ho-hum repeats. For example, we've seen Google Trends tackle the flu in a kind of digital epidemiology approach. Nothing new there. Rudder retells these stories not to just fill the pages though but to constantly keep the beat of this book, which is asking deeper questions about who are we as a culture?Another downside is that even with all the reams of data and stats Rudder throws at us, ultimately, these are just cool factoids. It's an impressive avalanche of interesting data tidbits, but still just tidbits. The next challenge for big data: figuring out what truly matters, narrowing it down, cutting the noise.The heart of what makes big data interesting is that it's research that isn't gathered merely from surveys or interviews or even randomized control trial experiments, which we all know can be biased for a variety of reasons: subjects don't understand the questions, subjects lie, people obfuscate, they unconsciously modify their behavior to please researchers. Here the data is based on actual behavior in situ. And we can learn something from it, we can see patterns and discern behaviors that were otherwise invisible. It's like studying people in the wild.Most books about data are dry and boring, but Dataclysm is one that makes a mark. Part of this is Rudder staying grounded in primary data and real analysis. But an even bigger part is Rudder's never-stale writing style. Yes, the book is still pop-social science. This might frustrate a few bona fide data scientists out there. But Dataclysm works. The amusing stories and asides sprinkled throughout the book are full of zest but are never fluffy. For a numbers person, a Harvard-honed math-y guy working in Silicon Valley, Dataclysm is a remarkably fluid and readable book.Big data isn't the answer to the universe, the meaning of life, or to your other burning existential questions, but you'll still become privy to some interesting discoveries about culture and society.[Disclaimer: I received this book from Blogging for Books for an honest and candid review.] "

202,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16880570-khari,1,"Three months.Three months to listen to a book seven and a half hours long. Normally I can get one of those out in a week. Nope. Three months.I'm really tired of these books with fascinating titles that just disappoint.This book made me understand why people shout 'Science' at each other. It's because authors like this either underestimate their audience and dumb down what they have done, or they have terrible methodologies themselves and don't even realize it.For a book about data which necessarily must include statistics, there is a shocking dearth of statistic lingo in this book. He tries to justify himself in the end. His intention was to write a popular science book and he didn't want to clutter it with jargon like 'p', and 'confidence interval' and fun stuff like that. And, hey, I get it. I don't completely understand statistics yet, but even I know that words like 'significant' have a particular meaning that has to be defined in the world of numbers, but he never defines his terms. He says the methodology he used was 'rigorous' and it went through something 'like peer review' but never defines what his methodology was, and his 'peer review' was for his underling (who he knew btw) to check his numbers. That's not peer review. Hate to break it to you. Peer review is done by someone who does not know who wrote the paper, and they look over the whole paper, including the hypotheses and the conclusions as well as the number. It's not someone whose job is in your hands checking your math. But I know why he chose to do it this way. It's because there is no way on this planet that this atrocity would have ever been published in a good scientific journal....wait...let me rephrase that. Considering that there have been cases of complete hoax papers being published it is remotely possible that it could have been published in a badly edited, badly curated, motivated reasoning filled journal. Because that's what this was. Badly edited, badly curated, filled with motivated reasoning, and worst of all, terrible methodology that is never explained. This book couldn't hack it in the scientific publishing world so he had to go to a subsidiary of Penguin, Crown Publishing, that focuses on hobbies, memoirs, biographies, autobiographies, cooking, lifestyle, business and nonfiction. And honestly, that makes a ton of sense, because this reads more like a memoir than a book of scientific rigor. He makes unfounded claims, presents his interpretation as fact, and only considers one explanation for everything that he finds interesting.The part that absolutely killed me was he is talking about corpus linguistics. Corpus linguistics is gathering really large bodies of texts and making it searchable. There are a bunch of free ones out there, such as the Corpus of Contemporary American English (affectionately known as COCA), for your perusal. They have a bunch of ways of analyzing, you can look at the most used words, you can look at the collocations (the words immediately preceding and following a word), you can look at the word families that are used, the lexemes that are used, the type of word that most appears, the contexts in which words appear, which is a really good way to find out what a word actually means in use, in contrast to how it is defined in the dictionary. Corpus linguistics just happens to be my baby. It was my focus in my master's program and it's my focus in my PHD program. And guess what? I know nothing about it. I've already spent three years learning about it, and I'm going to go spend another 2-6, and I've read peer-reviewed articles about it, talked to experts, and read books about it, and I still know nothing, but I know enough to know that how he's using it is mind bogglingly bogus. He basically does character counting. He counts how many words show up in a tweet, calculates the mean character length, then compares it to the mean character length in Shakespeare and concludes that since the mean character length in tweets is longer, people today are using language in a more nuanced way than Shakespeare was....mean character length. Or his other technique was to make a word list of the most used words and show that it was similar to Shakespeare because 'the' and 'a' appeared at the top. No duh Sherlock, they're function words. They happen to be required every time you are referring to a singular noun. They would show up at the top of the word list of this review as well and that would mean nothing about the similarity between reviews and tweets. They are different registers who both follow the rules of the English language, ergo, functional words such as articles and pronouns and prepositions would occur more often simply because they are closed classes that are requisite for forming phrases that make sense.So there you go, a very brief, cogent rebuttal for one of his most important methods of analysis. But that rebuttal is actually rebutting his intention, not what he actually did. What he actually did was include, on his erstwhile 'word' list, things like 'the', 'a', ''s', 'Peru' 'my blue eyes', 'tall for an Asian', etc. .........How, in the name of all that is grounded in the study of linguistics, can those things be defined as 'words'?!?!? What definition is he using?!? He isn't using one! He's just conglomerating everything that he finds interesting together and calling it a 'word' while not even recognizing that what he finds interesting is subjective! It's not a parameter by which to define something! At first I was like, huh, is he using morphemes as the basis of his 'word'? ""'s"" would be the the third person possessive morpheme, I can see that, after all 'the' 'a' and 'Peru' are all single morpheme words. But then you have 'my blue eyes' that's not a word, that's a phrase! All of the words in that phrase aren't even single morpheme words! So why on earth does the third person possessive deserve its own place of glory but the plural 's' does not!?!This is the problem with popular 'science' books. People read them, feel like they are now informed and use the same arguments that they read about without ever realizing that the books aren't science. There is no scientific method in this book. He never defines his terms, he barely defines his variables. He has a million variables, and doesn't distinguish between them. It's not an experimental study so it's fine that he doesn't have a control group, but he should be trying to make the groups that he is splitting people into as uniform as possible and he doesn't even really attempt it. His variables are men and women, black, white, Asian, and Hispanic. He never even limited his findings to people from the USA. He just assumed that everyone was. He never factored in educational status which would have a huge impact, and that information actually is in the data set, so he could have, but he didn't. He didn't even mention it as a confound! And that's just the point. Everything is a conclusion for him. He argued that there are certain topics that are anathema to certain groups because the word denoting that topic only appears once. No. It does not mean that they are anathema to that group. I can think of a dozen reasons why someone would choose not to put something that they are interested in onto a public forum. I am pretty sure that an Otolaryngologist is not going to put that as their profession on OKCupid, simply because most people don't know what that means, they are just going to go with 'doctor' because it's simpler and gets the point across. That doesn't mean that otolarynogology is a taboo subject because it's only mentioned once. And besides, the fact that it is mentioned at all is already proof positive that it is not a taboo subject, taboo subjects are epitomized by never being mentioned at all and referred to circularly. So why didn't he mention all the other terms that are never mentioned, like muons and antileptons? (No, I don't know what those are either). The self-introductions on OKCupid (which is what he studied) are texts designed to elicit a certain response. They are a specific register, a register that each writer assumes will be the most likely to get them what they want, a date. As such they are inherently not generalizable to populations as a whole. They are only generalizable as 'the words that people use to try and present themselves as a satisfactory date'. There is a purpose behind it and it shows only a very small subset of language use, taking it to mean that it epitomizes someone's character and identity is horrifying. People change how they talk constantly. They talk differently when they write as compared to when they speak. They talk differently depending on if they know their audience or not. They talk differently depending on the power dynamics of the situation. They talk differently depending on how they are feeling at the moment. Studying the language used in self-introductory texts on OKCupid is very interesting and a worthwhile subject in and of itself, but you cannot generalize out to the public. The people on OKCupid are not a random selection of people, they are self-selected to be rather outgoing, not so privacy concerned, not willing to spend their money on web-dating, mostly singly people who are interested in romantic liaisons. They are, according to his own admission of the data, mostly liberal and progressive, mostly college educated, those account for 31% and 34% of the US population respectively. That is not even broken down by sex or race, if I were to spend the time doing that it would show an even smaller portion of the population for each, you can't generalize out to everyone else in the US based on a sub population. That would be like saying 50% of the population of the US are women, and women generally score higher in compassion, therefore the US is a compassionate nation...what? That doesn't even make sense.Finally, the thing that really just made me crack up was when he said ""and I say this as someone who is reflexively critical of the left."" That made me die. Why, why did that make me die? Because it doesn't mean what you think it means. It doesn't mean that he automatically looks at what people on the left say critically. It doesn't mean that his automatic response is to be skeptical. It means to embrace your subjective understandings of reality as a basis for analyzing social interactions. Being reflexively critical is a tenet of feminist post-structuralist analysis, or you could also argue that it is a postmodern, post-Marxist analysis as well. Regardless of who you decide is the ultimate progenitor of such an idea, it remains an ideology of the left. By using it he showed that he was on the left. By trying to present himself as a balanced and disinterested analyzer he showed himself to be controlled by a particular worldview."
203,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51602586-dominika,4,"A good soft introduction on data analysis, particularly in regards to human interaction. I thought it was fun and simple enough for the layman, but not simple to the point that it's lying about the capacity of what big data can do (as an example, I deal with a lot of research participants who do not have an email or do not use their email often). I really appreciated him talking about the limitations, as well as some qualitative methods and how they can be used. The whole point of all this is to see how our private, online behavior is actually a great insight into the human condition. Like how the rate of gay porn consumption is the same across every state, and what factors are important to each racial group. I know I made this sound super boring but it isn't. "

You might not even be too surprised, if they started to learn what music people probably like, by the way they dress, speak, or act (although it would be impressive). But, what if they had hundreds of thousands, or tens of millions of customers a day? How much would they learn about what music people like, if they could somehow deal with that many customers a day?What if, instead of a music store, people came to your store to find something more personal, like a girlfriend or boyfriend?Welcome to the book Dataclysm, where one of the founders of the website OkCupid shows us just what every website you ever use is able to tell about you. That's slightly an exaggeration, of course; dating websites do get a view of us that is a little different than most. But then, Amazon sees you when you put your money where your mouth is. Google sees what you're trying to find, or find out about, or where you're finding directions to. Facebook, of course, probably knows who your real friends are better than what you are willing to admit out loud.If you get creeped out easily by the loss of secrecy (otherwise known as ""privacy"", when it's secrecy that we like) that comes from using the Internet, this is probably not the book for you.However, if you like to leaven your opinions about topics like race (and racism) and sex (and sexism) with some actual data (not just your own personal experience), this book is a revelation. Here is a more or less randomly picked sampling of what you get in this book, not just presented as an assertion, but backed up with mountains of data:1) racism against blacks in America is not just real and enduring, but is equally rampant among Asians and Hispanic Americans as among Anglos2) Asian-Americans on dating sites use a uniquely low number of misspelled words compared to all other ethnicities3) men do not give up trying to date that 20-year old woman until they are over 30, whereas the man who looks best to a 20-year old woman is likely to be around 234) men do not give up trying to date that 30-year old woman until they are over 40, whereas the man who looks best to a 30-year old woman is likely to be around 305) of self-identified straight women on OkCupid, 26% said they had a sexual encounter with a woman, and enjoyed it (more than 3 times the analogous percentage of self-identified straight men)6) by just looking at your ""likes"" on Facebook, you can determine with 60% accuracy whether or not someone is the child of parents who got divorced before they turned 21 (this was in 2012, and the algorithms have probably gotten only better since then)7) women who get a lot of 1's and 5's (out of 5) on their picture, are more likely to get messaged, than women who get a lot of 3's, even though the average opinion of their looks is the sameIf you are online, there are servers (computers that serve up websites to your desktop, laptop, or smartphone) which know quite a lot about you and the others in the society you live in. The people you really don't want to have this kind of information, already have it. The only question is, will you? If knowledge is power, then right now there is a profound imbalance of power being created by this much data. Christian Rudder has done us the favor of showing us what he has (aggregated, of course, so that no individual is identifiable). Take a look."
205,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4579658-rob-kitchin,2,"The stated aim of Dataclysm is to introduce lay readers to the era of big data, the possibilities of such data, and the types of analysis used to make sense of them. The problems with the book start with the title and subtitle, neither of which, I think, make much sense. Dataclysm, Rudder explains, is a play on cataclysm: the wiping away of one era to be replaced by a new one. However, big data is set to complement small data, not wipe them away as small data are generated to answer specific questions rather than being a by-product that is then repurposed, and most big data are held by private corporations or government and are not readily open to researchers. All of the data that Rudder analyzes is from social media; they are data produced precisely because we think someone is looking (for a date, for conversation, for information, to provoke a reaction, etc). Uploading information to the internet is largely a process of the presentation of the self, as Goffman’s famous theory would frame the activity. Even if other people cannot see the answers to direct questions, as when filling in questions on a dating site, the answers shape the user profile and the process of matching -- something that users are aware of, consider and present to.The book then proceeds by discussing social media data and what they might reveal about human behaviour and society. Crucially, however, there is no systematic discussion of big data per se, its forms and characteristics, no discussion of data analytics, and only a cursory discussion of the many ethical, social and political implications of such data. There is no discussion of statistics, or statistical tests performed on the data presented, nor data mining, data analytics, machine learning, pattern recognition, profiling, prediction, etc. The irony here is that Rudder’s company – OkCupid – employs these techniques to be able to process and match potential partners, yet he never explains how this is achieved. Instead, the entire analysis is rooted in the empiricist form of data science, rather than data-driven science, and never proceeds beyond description. As such, the analysis of gender and race he presents are based on a ‘letting the data speak for themself’ approach and constitutes armchair interpretation. He barely engages with the vast academic literature on quantitative analysis of race and gender that has taken place for several decades using large data sets such as the census or public administration data. Rudder has access to an enormous set of very interesting data that could be used to conduct some fascinating sociological and psychological analysis. Instead what we get are a series of descriptive statistics and banal revelations, most of which are already well established. The result is a book that hints at the potential of big data and data science but undersells it substantially, and it under-estimates in my view the readership level of its potential audience by never progressing beyond mathematics and data visualisations used in junior school. In contrast, books such as The Signal and the Noise by Nate Silver provide a much wider and deeper discussion. This is a shame as Rudder is an engaging writer and he has privileged access to an extremely rich social data that could be used to conduct some wonderful and sophisticated social science research. Such rich research and its policy implications are barely hinted at."
206,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8684527-andra-n,5,"I postponed reading Dataclysm for some time, but I’m glad I took my time to read it. Its author, Christian Rudder first caught my attention in an article written after the Facebook scandal over the experiments made over its users, where he explained in a rather unapologetic manner, that this is the very nature of internet’s success and efficiency increase. His opinion is a consequence of his experience running the dating site OkCupid where decisions based on people’s behavior must be made in order to obtain optimal results. “It’s a delicate illusion, the Internet.”Dataclysm is a book about Big Data and Romantic behavior. However, it is definitely not a recipe for making a perfect profile or having more success on social networks. This book is rather a series of conclusions drawn from the aggregated data obtained from millions of interactions mainly from sites like OkCupid and other social networks or Google. This is not the story of the individual, it is the story of the collective. What distinguishes the work of Christian Rudder is that given his privileged position at OKCupid, he had in hand large amounts of data with which he could play and analyze freely. As opposed to other studies of human behavior that have as subjects mostly a bunch of students from well-known universities, his data sets contain personal information of people of all ages and races, from the US. This book has lots of pop-culture references, amusing and sometimes insightful comments. What is most intriguing about his studies is the fact that they are made over information that we rather think it is private. We get a glimpse of our rather politically incorrect behaviors as human beings.I found particularly interesting the comparison between woman preferences and man preferences when it comes to a potential partner’s age, attractiveness and race. Humor is not left out of the book, as the paragraph depicting women ratings of attractiveness of men: “Only one guy in six is “above average” in an absolute sense. Sex appeal isn’t something commonly quantified like this, so let me put it in a more familiar context: translate this plot to IQ, and you have a world where the women think 58 percent of men are brain damaged.”The comparison of words most commonly used by people on their dating profiles from different races or sexual orientation was also a chapter that I found quite interesting. The author shows via text analysis that several race related patterns emerge. “White people differentiate themselves mostly by their hair and eyes, Asians by their country of origin, Latinos by their music. But because of the way the math is set up, the three non-white lists are evidence of cultures that I, as a white man, am not supposed to know…the gay male list is very different from the other three. It’s full of pop culture and has comparatively few references to the user’s immediate person and family.”I would definitely recommend this book that tackles a wide range of topics to anyone who is interested in data science as well as those curious about the weirdness of human nature."
207,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18688-cody,4,"Much e-ink has been spilled--rightfully so--about the brave new world we live online. Targeted advertising, data breaches, the NSA; it’s easy to grow overwhelmed by the potential dangers of sharing personal information electronically. Practically everything we do on our phones and computers is tracked, often in an effort to sell us something or gain some upper hand (financially, politically, socially, etc.). Consequentially, there is now an unprecedented amount of detailed data about us that's ripe for the parsing.Beyond the obvious advantages for market research, is there a benefit to all of this data? Christian Rudder, co-founder of the online dating site OkCupid, thinks so. He’s been approaching the internet over the past decade as one big sociological experiment, and his new book, Dataclysm: Who We Are (When We Think No One’s Looking), explores his findings in depth, some of which are rather mind blowing.Penned in clear and witty prose and full of colorful charts and graphs, Dataclysm breezes by, though many of the insights linger, obsess, and often unsettle. We learn that if you apply network analysis to a couple’s groups of friends on Facebook, you can quite accurately predict how likely they are to stay together. And that Google searches beginning with the phrase “Is my husband…” most commonly end with “gay?” And that women tend to find men who are close to their age as the most attractive, whereas men, up until 50 years old, generally think that women in their early 20s look the best.Even in cases where the results reinforce long held views, what is new, Rudder asserts, “is our ability to test ideas, established ones, famous ones even, against the atomized actions of millions.” But the implications go beyond the sheer volume of the numbers. The ability we now have to track Google searches and site clicks provides us with much more accurate data, as these behaviors transcend the murkier self-reporting that plagues more traditional surveys, especially in regards to controversial topics. Rudder argues that the insights gleaned from all of this new data, even when the results are unflattering, are too beneficial to pass up, as they give us a far clearer and more accurate portrait of our true interests and behaviors.As Rudder frequently admits, the internet is still very young, which means that these data sets lack a long view. What Dataclysm does offer us, though, is another angle from which to consider our online lives. Whether you find the book’s content and approaches revelatory or creepy (at times I found them both), the results are fascinating and the ramifications huge. It reminds us that, as a sociological opportunity, we’re in the midst of a monumental sea change--one that is granting us astoundingly far-reaching insight into who we really are."

Then they prefer men a few years younger. Men find 20 year old women to be the most attractive--refardless of age (from 20-50 men all find women between 20-24 the most attractive)• Polarizing people get more attention--someone ranked with both very high & beauty ratings will receive more messages than someone with an equal average, but of more middle numbers• The smell of shit is added to perfumes and flowers, making the whole actually smell better• 74 men died of nostalgia in the Civil War (according to army records)• Twitter may actually be improving its users' writing ability--in both word length and density & brevity of ideas• More will be written on Twitter in the next 2 years, than all books ever published• 'God' has been in steady decline since the early 1800s--the word is used only about a third as much now as it was then• The best digital messages are only 40 to 60 characters long• One of the best compatibility questions is 'Do you like scary movies?' Answering the same to this question is more predictive of a successful long term relationship than 'big issues' like religion, politics, and looks• Black and White Quarterbacks perform equally down to the decimal: 81.55 (qb rating)• Zodiac signs have no effect on compatibility at all. Race has less effect than religion, politics, or education• 85% of OkCupid users have gone to college• Women are more 'race-loyal' than men in regards to attraction & relationships• 'White sounding' names get 50% more interviews with the exact same résumé as 'black sounding' names like 'Lakisha or 'Jamal'• On Facebook, every percentile of attractiveness gives a man two friends. It gives a woman three.• Often parents want their daughters to be pretty...but 'not too pretty.' Does anyone imagine limitations on a son?• Obama's race probably cost him 3 to 5 percentage points of the popular vote. The most popular Google search for the n-word in history was in Nov 2008, after he won. • 'Rumor' was a winged roman godess with 100 eyes and 100 mouths who spoke only the most hurtful side of the truth...(at least according to rumor)• The agenda of spreading a rumor is directed more for an audience, rather than the subject of a rumor• The Internet makes us vile creatures (see the 'online disinhibition effect')• The government has the greatest invested interest in tracking negativity. Mathematical models exist which predict the otcome of war, how long it will last, who will win, and how many will die• In 1950, the dawn of television, the American Political Science Association called for more polarization in national politics--the parties had grown too close together, the electorate didn't have clear choices. What made good television then, makes good television now, with 100 times the channels.• We seem to define ourselves as much by what we hate as by what we love• Stereotypes are true: white people self-differentiate themselves by their looks, Asians by their origin country, and Latinos by their music• What we don't talk about can be as illuminating as that which we do• Sex is the single most important grouping humanity has. It has existed forever--long before race or creed. In the US, all men were able to vote before women were. With that said, we are all fundamentally similar, much more so than our differences• The United States is divided: all but 4 presidential elections since 1952 would've flipped had 5% of the electorate changed their minds. Any group of people representing that number is therefore very important politically.• Gay porn searches show homosexuality occurs at the same rate nationwide. In less tolerant places however, gays are just more likely to stay in the closet to avoid persecution• In the US, the most popular Google search that begins with 'Is my husband...' most commonly ends in 'gay?' 'Cheating' comes up 10% less, and 'an alcoholic' occurs 8 times less, 'depressed' 10 times less.• Google Search data is ineffective for estimating the number of lesbians in the country, because straight men looking for porn throw off the data• The government counts everyone who's not married as 'single,' regardless of their actual relationship status• Gay and Straight people are looking for the same things in a relationship according to the numbers• Sexuality is more fluid than we realize: 51% of women and 18% of men have bad, or would like to have a same-sex experience• Who we say we are and how we behave are two separate things• Any nation is an 'Imagined Community'--comprised mostly of fellow numbers you'll never meet, and may share little in common with• The relocation of individuals in india & Southeast Asia, as well as the industrialization reflect England circa 1950, and the US 50 years later--driven by the economy, farmers move to city jobs for higher pay• The UK has 5.9 million security cameras: 1 for every 11 citizens• Search data uncovered drug side effects before they were discovered by the FDA warning system, revealing paroxetine and paravastatin can cause hypoglycemia in patients• Facebook was collecting 500 terabytes of information everyday...back in 2012• If you've ever signed up for a website with a fake zip code or fake birthday, you're a criminal--in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act• A 12 year old visiting newyorktimes.com is a criminal as well--violating their Terms of Service and the working doctrine of the US Department of Justice• Twitter usage by high school grads vs college educated is equal (17 & 18% respectively). Black people have a disproportionate presence on Twitter (nearly two fold: 29% vs 16% among whites). They also have more followers as they tend to follow each other in a reciprocal circle of karma, where most whites use the service just to follow 'big names' that don't follow them back• Blind people are just as racist as the rest of us, showing bias after cueing in on speech patterns"

Not my finest several hours.What I like about this book is that it's based on data that's not collected by people putting up fronts or creating a persona. Shit's real. My favorite piece of data was that, relative to other identities, black men talk very little online about Social Distortion. This is definitely a stereotype that should gain some momentum. "
215,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,5,"Summary: One of the best data-driven books I have read. I think the title might be why there are so many haters. He presents a lot of tough issues using a medium ""dating"" that is relatable. Also, you should not try to read this on audiobook. You need to see the graphs. There are a lot of haters that present their background as if that's relevant in some way. It's not. B/c while they typically seem to understand data, they seem to lack reading comprehension skills. What Rudder is presenting is not findings from data work. He's attempting to use data as a backdrop to talk about a host of issues that are relevant in the modern era. The data is simply a view of what one might see. Instead of presenting some other social scientist's work, he's using in-house research, which, incidentally is a larger, better joined, more carefully collected, and larger geographical grouping than what most people have.Even if you find him to be less enlightening than his blog (I don't use twitter)-as some mentioned- I would guess this long-form argument could not be divined from the constraints of that medium of communication. He would have to be even more brilliant than I think he is just from reading this book!! Maybe... the guy is a Harvard grad..... But in case I'm right, below are my notes....p. 14 - ""If Big Data's two running stories have been about surveillance and money, for the last three years I've been working on third: the human story."" ""...as a close second, they're demographers of an unprecedented reach."" P. 15 - He talks about the fact that his purpose is to generalize so he can do his job of bringing people together at scale (not with individual nonsensical exceptions as discussed by A LOT of the haters!). He's trying to understand and infer from the data. And his inference work is wonderful, presenting possible misinterpretations that were tested and reviewed. p. 46 - Actually this entire chapter of how they essentially created a series of studies to demonstrate that variation in attractiveness get you noticed as much as attractiveness does. Freakin' Brilliant!p. 47 - Did not know there was a name to it: ""the Pratfall Effect"" - ""As long as you're generally competent, making a small, occasional mistake makes people think you're more competent. Flaws call out good stuff all the more."" p. 48 - It's better to ""Purposely abandon the middle road."" p. 53 - Regarding NLP work on Twitter...I love the hypothesis that Twitter might be improving its users' writing. This is all amazing stuff as relates to transformations in human language and has application in ways that are ignored even today.""he calculated the typical world length in Hamlet (3.99) and in a collection of Wodehouse's stories (4.05)... both less than the length in his Twitter sample (4.80).""""Comparative linguistics have long traced groups of community through language."" p. 54 - The chart on changing characteristics of speech patterns. The idea being that tribe creation is no longer geographically constrained, AND ALSO, you can catch it in the language used... something that we were NEVER able to do in the past (think Chinese, Cantonese, Mandarin, and the 50+ other dialects). Super nerdy awesome point.p. 62 - ""Sitewide, the copy-and-paste, strategy underperforms the from-scratch messaging about 25%, but in terms of effort-in results-out - it always wins: measuring by replies received to compose a new message each time."" What an awesome thing to take look at. Intriguing when you think about marketing/scaled response composition. p. 82 - Confounders. This is a great way to present this material so often ignored or misunderstood in the field. Generally, this chapter does a great job presenting a series of charts with each of the appropriate analysis points you'd ask in a row. I did not need the written part, but I can see why he has it. I can also see why some who read via audiobooks struggled. It would be hard to understand this book if all you had was the audio.Chapter 7: The Beauty Myth - The whole way he presents it in the context of thinking about his daughter is great. The work that supports it is fantastic. On eating disorders, he describes a possible place to look for solutions to help others....p. 104 ""... but before the behavior was digitized, there was practically no way to get directly at this problem, at least not until visible damage had already occurred. There was only rumor - an ear at the bathroom door, perhaps a parent's sad suspicion.""Chapter 8: p. 106-107. He talks about how b/c people don't tell you their deepest thoughts, you had to really work hard (snoop, catch people unguarded, etc) to figure out what they thought. Then he talks about the truthfulness of search engines like Google. How the mechanism itself is far harder to trick. This is REALLY important to what we think of as the fundamental changes in the types of data we now are able to collect. Chapter 9: There were a number of criticisms I read that lead back to this chapter and I think it might just have been unclear how to read the charts as well to think about it. That's a fair point. I think what he's trying to say is even in words there is racial signaling on both sides. If we think about the words we use to attract others and identify tribe, in the context of dating it's super apparent. For me, then I think about how this relates to concepts like code-switching in the workplace. We focus a lot on the accent, and we know vocabulary matters. But this implies something far deeper. If you read each of the lists and you clearly identify with one group, it's likely, you are farther culturally from other groups than just skin color. This is quite profound on anyone working on things like ""How do we create a single human race without such aberrant division."" Word. p. 155 - If you care at all about gay rights, these stats are important and also very sad. If I've got him correct- and these are the footnotes, we're underestimating the gay population of the US by a lot and most are NOT dating b/c they are socially unable to do so, either because they are in the closet and scared to be themselves or there are structural reasons in their community that prevent them from self-expression. Chapter 12- Great segue into the work on migration, which covers not an only lifestyle choice but also works availability and more. This work is really relevant for - what is not mentioned, the dying cities phenomenon. p. 181 - He's arguing against things like Klout scores. This is why I do not understand the arguments that he doesn't want to drill in or he's missing some sort of causality.. he's not. This book is about what the general number are telling you out of various inferences that are possible.p. 184 - Mountain Dew Story. A great example of what not to crowdsource.p. 186 - ""If employers begin to use algorithms to infer how intelligent you are or whether you use drugs, then your only choice will be to game the system - or to borrow the wording from the previous chapter, 'manage your brand.' To beat the machine, you must act like a machine, which means you've lost to the machine. And that's assuming you can guess what you're supposed to do in the first place. Apparently, one of the strongest correlates to intelligence in the research was liking 'curly fries.' Who could reverse engineer that?p. 187 - very intersting comments on survellience and data use by the government. p. 193 - He talks about the pennies from personal data payments will not amount ot anything that actually helps people. Moreover, it is highly likely to just be passed back through to consumers."

I only got to 60% before the book was over and the notes began (and on a Kindle flipping back and forth is, for me, a pain). Also meat-wise, I was expecting something along the lines of Outlers, which of course this is the opposite of in theme since it looks at the trends of all and not the accomplishments of a few. But I wanted it to be a book I remembered long after. It's really not. Although it's an interesting read while you're in it. Big Data, when it matures, means so much info that will be longitudinal, something data analysts struggle with ever getting enough of, so in that sense this is very exciting, and it's amazing what we can tell already from the little we have.I do think the book suffered mightily by being read on a Kindle (or any e-reader, especially black and white). The graphs used red and it was not always easy to tell what was gray because it was red and what was gray because it was gray--or if anything was really gray. Since much of this book runs off the graphs, that it's a bad thing not to be able to fully read them (and at the size they were at on my Paperwhite, I also felt challenged to really dive in). I did love reading that the author was a disciple of sorts of Tufte. And I appreciated the amount of info given in the charts.I had a hard time getting through the first chapter. I think the author left out a primary reason male and female reactions to potential partners' age might change (or not) over time depending on gender--and normally I'd give him a break on this since it's from another field of study, but since he runs an online dating site and is reporting on that robust data set, then I'd expect him to understand the drives of men (be drawn to young and fertile no matter how old they get) and women (pick a good provider--until she reaches a certain age, realizes she is not going to need a provider (either because she does not have kids or because she provides just fine for herself), and then go for something young and fun). This behavior has been well documented and while I thought he was going to touch on it at one point, it really didn't happen enough for me to ever get that comfortable with the first example out of the gate. That said, I didn't have that issue with the rest of the book, so I did keep going and many of the sections were novel and interesting."
217,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24217018-matt,3,"This is a very quick read which, given the number of visuals, is not surprising. The visuals, though, are beautiful, always tell a story, and never waste a drop of ink on unnecessary information. These images reflect the book...for the most part. It's when the narrative steers away from its stated purpose (a data driven exploration of human nature) that I started to tire of Christian Rudders narrative voice. It's funny, irreverent, and insightful for most of the book and especially for the sections discussing OkCupid data. He writes best about the data he knows best and that's not surprising. But as the book advances Rudder starts to draw on unfamiliar datasets, make less rigorous assertions, and veer into both data fear-mongering and data evangelism. It was disappointing mostly because he promised to write a different kind of book than those which use data as a lens to prove the downfall of society or privacy, or predict incredible advances in technology and public intelligence. He asserts this book is special then proceeds to speculate about how invasive the NSA can be, how Twitter is unleashing our base instincts but also improving our vocabulary, and how online branding is the future of self evaluation. These parts were, in truth, boring compared to the insights about romantic relationship. In summary, I'm not sure where this book fits in the social science and statistics cannon. It's not the most insightful or the most fun, which leaves it somewhere in between and probably only worth picking up if you love the genre. "
218,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35538316-lindy,3,"I feel like I write this in every nonfiction book review, but I wished there was more depth! I also wished someone more, I don't know, anthropologically minded had given this book a once over before publication. For example, Rudder treats data showing that bisexual men are more likely to prefer/message other men on OkCupid when compared to older bisexual men as if it were longitudinal, and implies that bi men's sexual preferences change as they get older. However he does not take into account what these men may be doing off the service; a young bisexual man will probably hit on women at a bar, but is at a considerably greater risk of being decked in the face if he were to do so to men. As the dating pool grows smaller with age, he may turn to the internet to scope out both genders. (To be fair, Rudder  does responsibly account for a similar phenomenon showing that North Dakotans are surprisingly liberal when it comes to causual sex in the next chapter and why that isn't the case.) Likewise, Rudder says that ""yass,"" which turns up in a list of words distinctive of popular twitter users, is a contraction of ""your ass."" This is true, but it's definitely not the most popular use. Nonetheless, Dataclysm is an interesting and accessible book, and I imagine it would be especially so to someone with no background in statistics. I appreciated that the author had a sense of humor, and I don't think (reading in 2017) that it has aged poorly, although it would have been helpful if Rudder had cited years in the text rather than simply ""last year."""
219,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33131867-neha,3,"I had seen a significant portion of the material before on the blog, but it's still worth a read. I loved the informal voice, and the use of various graphs to illustrate new findings. It read like a collection of smaller articles with specific results.A lot of the OkCupid data revealed particular preferences of men and women in terms of age, attractiveness, and ethnicity. I can understand why the overall findings may be upsetting, and I think readers should be cautious about how this actually applies to their lives. This book is not trying to give insider tips for finding more dates. I think it's very important to remember that there is an inherent selection bias in the OkCupid data: it only represents people who have, for one reason or another, decided to try online dating.I thought the book was going to be more about OkCupid's dataset, but I appreciated the discussions about Google, Facebook, and Twitter data. The last chapter describes the ongoing conflict of privacy that is absent from earlier chapters. While giving users complete ownership of their data may seem to solve many problems, I tend to disagree that it's entirely possible. Services can certainly provide an option for users to remove their data from the site, but once data is on the Internet, I think it's safe to assume that it will never fully disappear."
220,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11500849-jen,1,"A sloppy and irresponsible introduction to big data analytics. Taking a popular science approach, the book glosses over key tenets of every day data science, like basic hypothesis testing. It also makes grand, sweeping generalizations about society as a whole where none can be made based on the population of the data (OK Cupid members hardly represent a random sampling of the US population).Some of the more egregious statements include ""There are times when a data set is so robust that if you set up your analysis right, you don't need to ask questions - it just tells you everything anyway"" and ""people are already compensated for their data: They get to use services like Facebook and Google...for free.""Putting the author's disregard of personal privacy aside, the narrative voice is filled with white male privilege. A few sections of the book made me generally uncomfortable in its approach to conversations about race, gender, and heterosexual relationships. We need a book about data science that highlights the process in a way that digital users can understand how their data is being analyzed and who is doing it responsibly. This is not it."
221,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1492668-mark,3,"You are concerned that the NSA is aggregating data and spying on you? If you check, or look at a picture of the NSA (Why does an office building need a radar dome on the roof?), you will see that has always been their job. But while you are worrying about that, you are telling scores of commercial data aggregators everything about yourself, just by what you search for on Google, what you like on Facebook and where you access the internet from. Your sex, your race, your sexual orientation, your income, your politics, your IQ (from the type of French fries you like), it's all an open book. This book is the story from one involved nerd, along with some nice graphics.People's activities are somewhat limited, so the use of this data is mostly to target you for repression or elimination in a repressive society, to sell you something in a capitalist society, or for law enforcement to find you. So if you're only getting targeted Amazon ads, be happy.Of course, I can only imagine what the data will be used for after Skynet becomes active."
222,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/140018-kyle,2,"Readable, with nice diagrams, this is a hard book to hate. It is easy to be irritated by it, however. The basis of the book is a dozen or so interesting statistical points, with a chapter of conversational description for each. I'm curious where these statistical insights actually come from. Did the author pore over data for months? It doesn't feel that way. They have the feeling of nuggets gleaned from interns working over a period of years, that never ended up being useful anywhere else. Certainly, the discussion the author offers almost no isights beyond the immediately obvious. It isn't clear enough to be a good introduction to statistics, nor in-depth enough to offer interest to statisticians.The best chapters are the early ones oriented towards anyone trying to game the system a little on dating sites. How long message should be, what the opposite sex is looking for for someone your age, etc. The later chapters, trying to offer larger insights about culture and language are ... not convincing. Problematic, even."
223,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78503-chris,3,"This book has some great perspective on human behavior derived from data sets culled from many websites. It celebrates the fact that the amount of data that we have on people's actual beliefs and desires (as opposed to their stated beliefs) and breaks down what a lot of these data sets mean. A lot of it is very funny, even while it may be disturbing in its implications.For the first two-thirds, it was really interesting to me and had a lot of, if not surprising, at least very relevant things to say about human behaviors.The last third kind of drifted off into parts of the data that I am not too concerned with personally and the author's thoughts on what the future will be. It is not necessarily bad, just not what I was looking for, and also, a bit more broad than the particulars of the earlier chapters. "
224,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63344080-lucas,4,"This book offers a new look at old questions. Race, identity and the many differences between women and men in their approach to sex and relationship are shown here through data from an online dating website (OkCupid). I think the book presents valuable insights about racism because it observes actually behavior rather than self-reported questions.Some of the interesting book's find is the following:* Both black men and black women are strongly rejected in online dating* The women who received more attention of men aren't the more beautiful but those who have the high variance in their ratings (men can't say if they are beautiful or not).* Most people (~90%) who declare themselves bisexual is indeed heterosexual or homosexual.* Straight women are less propense to search only casual sex in online datingA negative thing is that the book contains a lot of digressions."

The possibilities of big data seem scary and exciting at the same time. This book presents them in a very accessible way to the average reader. I was skeptical of some the conclusions that the author presented but there's a lot of good conversation starters here. However, I don't think much of it will stick with me in the long run.I probably didn't make the best choice by listening to this on audiobook where numbers in charts were read out for minutes hahaOverall, a short, enjoyable, and timely read if you want to delve into popular science books."
226,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3440334-fred-forbes,2,"Making my way through some interesting observations generated by ""OK Cupid"" and other ""big data"" sites, I hit a section marked ""Coda"" where he went on to comment on the process used to generate the data illustrations, followed by notes, acknowledgements, and an index. Thought I was halfway through the book but had actually finished. Note sure whether the lack of mathematical analysis is a blessing or not - I guess that would depend on how capable the writer is - but much of the content, while interesting is a ""firm grasp of the obvious."""

This was a highly enjoyable-to-read, interesting-to-think-about, pop-data/analytics book. I appreciated the author's voice and sense of humor, but he often ventured into preachy territory. For someone to write so extensively on data that illuminates our biases, I wish he could have taken more care to hide his own."

Enjoy."
229,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8886042-michelle,2,"Dataclysm: Who We Are When We Think No One's Looking by Christian Rudder is an interesting and fact filled book. I received an Advance Reader's Copy from Crown Publishing, a division of Random House and my opinions were formed by my reading of this uncorrected proof. Author Christian Rudder is one of the founders of the dating website OKCupid and he draws his research for this book primarily from the data that has been collected from paying members who are looking for relationships. He additionally mines data from other social media resources, dating services like Match.com and websites, and his pool of subjects include a cross section of the population that he believes is an excellent barometer for the opinions of Americans today. This book is filled with charts and maps and images to help you easily understand the data he has sourced and how it applies to the ""everyman"" in all of us.This book approaches a wide variety of topics - relationships, personal preferences, age, gender, race and upbringing and tries to answer the question ""Who are we really?"" by examining what we say versus how we act. Although I felt like I came away with a bunch of quotable tidbits and an interesting peek into how the data that we so freely place on the internet is used, I'm not quite sure that I learned very much about myself from this book. Many of the observances seemed rational to me and not all that thought provoking, and although some applied to me I didn't walk away feeling like I had much personal insight. A few of the passages left me feeling uneasy, simply because I'm not sure all the members of OKCupid were willing test subjects in Mr. Rudder's data laboratory. In one memorable instance photos of users were shown in an illustration of women who had very high and very low scores from fellow users in terms of their appeal. Although he was using them to make a point about the importance of having a photo that provokes a strong reaction is better than having a commonly pretty picture (which he describes as ""meh"") and he expressly thanks the subjects for their consent to be included in the book and to have their photos discussed, it still felt mildly squicky. Although the many other charts and illustrations in the book didn't deal in this same very personal representation of data, I did question the author's use of the OKCupid site at times. Although it may all be perfectly legal it makes me ask ""do I need to know this?"" and ""is the use of this data justified in a bigger, insight gaining way that makes it important to a reader?"" I'm not sure I have the answer to those questions.  As a collection of facts and data there were definitely a few things I hadn't thought about before - for example, there is a chart showing the 100 most common words used in the English language today from the Oxford English Corpus (a collection of modern writing's approach to vocabulary and word use) versus the top 100 used to express yourself on Twitter in the form of the service's 140 character tweet posts. It showed that although you may think the language of Twitter would somewhat abbreviate or diminish your ideas to get your point across, actually a person composing a tweet is much more selective and thoughtful about what their words will convey. It may help us to write clearer and in a concise style that contributes to an overall awareness of language. That awareness filters into the speech and style of a Twitter user versus a non-user. I liked the idea that my tweeting may help me generate a better and more vivid use of language. Still I kept returning to the fact that this book didn't really live up to the ""portrait of our essential selves"" claim that it was intended to be. It isn't a bad book. I just wish that I had a greater takeaway as a reader.One thing that truly irked me about this book is the mention of a website link where you could go, punch in your own data (two Facebook usernames) and get a personal illustration to see one of the ideas in this book in action. In the fourth chapter titled ""You Gotta be the Glue"" there is an illustration showing the overlap of the author's Facebook friends and his wife's friend's. He explains in depth how we create clusters of people in our lives that know us from a specific point of view - our work friends, childhood acquaintances, family members etc. Our spouse or significant other can overlap our Facebook friendships in many categories. Perhaps you are both friends with your parents and share relationships with other couples you met while you both attended a ballroom dance lesson. The shared connections can illustrate the bonds we have as couples, and can show you the places in your relationships that have a strong and meaningful connection. I thought this sounded really cool and was happy to find an example that could be personalized to me and allowed me to be a willing participant in the experiment to see how it felt. Unfortunately this awesome personalized tool simply doesn't exist. I have tried the link dozens of times over the past few weeks and didn't post my thoughts on the book since I wanted to see this chart in action, but it still gives me a ""Page Not Found"" message. The book's publication date is set for Tuesday September 9th, and since this is Saturday the 6th I would think that it would be active. I hope it will go live on Tuesday at the very least. I contacted the author through his Twitter page about the lack of a working link and received no response, however another reviewer on Goodreads said that when they contacted him through email they received a response that it would be functional by the end of August. If I had paid for this book rather than receiving an ARC I would be even more disappointed. The one big opportunity to gain personal insight is so far, a bust.If you find the sort of data in this book interesting I would check it out of the library or wait for the book to be marked down. I wouldn't consider it a must read but I am thankful I had the opportunity to read it. I hope you find this useful information, and I will update my opinion if the link works on the publication date. For now I can only give this book 2 of 5 stars. "
230,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5177572-genevieve,4,"* Originally reviewed on the Night Owls Press blog here. *First, it was the Internet. The Internet was going to change how businesses and organized operated. It was going to change how people live. But now something else has enthralled our imagination: big data.What is big data? We couldn't have big data without the Web. Our shift to online activity has made it easier to record and document massive reams of data and data trails about seemingly everything: Where do we go when we're online? What do we do? What do we read? The idea behind big data is that scientists can analyze that activity and parse out that information, information that might predict what we would do in hypothetical situations, or what we would be likely to do in the future. This largely possible because of scale. It's not about analyzing a person, a hundred people, or a thousand people; it's about waves and waves of information, millions and millions of data points.Think about how far we've come. In the third century BC, the first great repository of human knowledge was the Library of Alexandria. Today information is available in the exabytes. (What is an exabyte? Um...it's really, really big.) Big data is about size, but it's more than that. It's the fact that we have computers and databases that will log and analyze micro-activities, actions as simple as Facebook ""likes,"" our location recorded by the GPS in our phones, and the ""number of seconds or minutes spent reading a web page.""Dataclysm Who We Are When We Think No One's Looking by Christian Rudder sheds light on what that kind of datafication looks like. Rudder himself is the cofounder of OkCupid, the online dating site, which lives and breathes on seemingly mystical algorithms that dice and chop up streams of data. No other person might be more qualified to give us an insider's account on what big data can do.Rudder dabbles in statistical, psychological, and sociological theories and drills the chapters with clever infographics and beautifully rendered scatterplots—and some of them are truly works of art. (I used to work in data so I have a soft spot for data scientists and their work.) But where Rudder really excels is in the smorgasbord of findings. Patterns emerge from the data. Stare into the matrix and you'll see...a mirror into your very soul. At least that's what Rudder wants us to believe.You might be put off by Rudder's focus on dating sites but that's his métier. The trove of information on social interactions alone on dating sites is weirdly fascinating. In one example, Rudder finds that dating profiles of women who have a polarizing physical appearance are more likely to be approached for dates than the conventionally attractive person. (Is it fascination with novelty? boredom with the same 'ole, same 'ole?) Aren't we all at our most earnest and neurotic when it comes to love and relationships?A downside of this book is that if you read or pay attention to the tech news cycle, you may find some of Rudder's examples ho-hum repeats. For example, we've seen Google Trends tackle the flu in a kind of digital epidemiology approach. Nothing new there. Rudder retells these stories not to just fill the pages though but to constantly keep the beat of this book, which is asking deeper questions about who are we as a culture?Another downside is that even with all the reams of data and stats Rudder throws at us, ultimately, these are just cool factoids. It's an impressive avalanche of interesting data tidbits, but still just tidbits. The next challenge for big data: figuring out what truly matters, narrowing it down, cutting the noise.The heart of what makes big data interesting is that it's research that isn't gathered merely from surveys or interviews or even randomized control trial experiments, which we all know can be biased for a variety of reasons: subjects don't understand the questions, subjects lie, people obfuscate, they unconsciously modify their behavior to please researchers. Here the data is based on actual behavior in situ. And we can learn something from it, we can see patterns and discern behaviors that were otherwise invisible. It's like studying people in the wild.Most books about data are dry and boring, but Dataclysm is one that makes a mark. Part of this is Rudder staying grounded in primary data and real analysis. But an even bigger part is Rudder's never-stale writing style. Yes, the book is still pop-social science. This might frustrate a few bona fide data scientists out there. But Dataclysm works. The amusing stories and asides sprinkled throughout the book are full of zest but are never fluffy. For a numbers person, a Harvard-honed math-y guy working in Silicon Valley, Dataclysm is a remarkably fluid and readable book.Big data isn't the answer to the universe, the meaning of life, or to your other burning existential questions, but you'll still become privy to some interesting discoveries about culture and society.[Disclaimer: I received this book from Blogging for Books for an honest and candid review.] "

232,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16880570-khari,1,"Three months.Three months to listen to a book seven and a half hours long. Normally I can get one of those out in a week. Nope. Three months.I'm really tired of these books with fascinating titles that just disappoint.This book made me understand why people shout 'Science' at each other. It's because authors like this either underestimate their audience and dumb down what they have done, or they have terrible methodologies themselves and don't even realize it.For a book about data which necessarily must include statistics, there is a shocking dearth of statistic lingo in this book. He tries to justify himself in the end. His intention was to write a popular science book and he didn't want to clutter it with jargon like 'p', and 'confidence interval' and fun stuff like that. And, hey, I get it. I don't completely understand statistics yet, but even I know that words like 'significant' have a particular meaning that has to be defined in the world of numbers, but he never defines his terms. He says the methodology he used was 'rigorous' and it went through something 'like peer review' but never defines what his methodology was, and his 'peer review' was for his underling (who he knew btw) to check his numbers. That's not peer review. Hate to break it to you. Peer review is done by someone who does not know who wrote the paper, and they look over the whole paper, including the hypotheses and the conclusions as well as the number. It's not someone whose job is in your hands checking your math. But I know why he chose to do it this way. It's because there is no way on this planet that this atrocity would have ever been published in a good scientific journal....wait...let me rephrase that. Considering that there have been cases of complete hoax papers being published it is remotely possible that it could have been published in a badly edited, badly curated, motivated reasoning filled journal. Because that's what this was. Badly edited, badly curated, filled with motivated reasoning, and worst of all, terrible methodology that is never explained. This book couldn't hack it in the scientific publishing world so he had to go to a subsidiary of Penguin, Crown Publishing, that focuses on hobbies, memoirs, biographies, autobiographies, cooking, lifestyle, business and nonfiction. And honestly, that makes a ton of sense, because this reads more like a memoir than a book of scientific rigor. He makes unfounded claims, presents his interpretation as fact, and only considers one explanation for everything that he finds interesting.The part that absolutely killed me was he is talking about corpus linguistics. Corpus linguistics is gathering really large bodies of texts and making it searchable. There are a bunch of free ones out there, such as the Corpus of Contemporary American English (affectionately known as COCA), for your perusal. They have a bunch of ways of analyzing, you can look at the most used words, you can look at the collocations (the words immediately preceding and following a word), you can look at the word families that are used, the lexemes that are used, the type of word that most appears, the contexts in which words appear, which is a really good way to find out what a word actually means in use, in contrast to how it is defined in the dictionary. Corpus linguistics just happens to be my baby. It was my focus in my master's program and it's my focus in my PHD program. And guess what? I know nothing about it. I've already spent three years learning about it, and I'm going to go spend another 2-6, and I've read peer-reviewed articles about it, talked to experts, and read books about it, and I still know nothing, but I know enough to know that how he's using it is mind bogglingly bogus. He basically does character counting. He counts how many words show up in a tweet, calculates the mean character length, then compares it to the mean character length in Shakespeare and concludes that since the mean character length in tweets is longer, people today are using language in a more nuanced way than Shakespeare was....mean character length. Or his other technique was to make a word list of the most used words and show that it was similar to Shakespeare because 'the' and 'a' appeared at the top. No duh Sherlock, they're function words. They happen to be required every time you are referring to a singular noun. They would show up at the top of the word list of this review as well and that would mean nothing about the similarity between reviews and tweets. They are different registers who both follow the rules of the English language, ergo, functional words such as articles and pronouns and prepositions would occur more often simply because they are closed classes that are requisite for forming phrases that make sense.So there you go, a very brief, cogent rebuttal for one of his most important methods of analysis. But that rebuttal is actually rebutting his intention, not what he actually did. What he actually did was include, on his erstwhile 'word' list, things like 'the', 'a', ''s', 'Peru' 'my blue eyes', 'tall for an Asian', etc. .........How, in the name of all that is grounded in the study of linguistics, can those things be defined as 'words'?!?!? What definition is he using?!? He isn't using one! He's just conglomerating everything that he finds interesting together and calling it a 'word' while not even recognizing that what he finds interesting is subjective! It's not a parameter by which to define something! At first I was like, huh, is he using morphemes as the basis of his 'word'? ""'s"" would be the the third person possessive morpheme, I can see that, after all 'the' 'a' and 'Peru' are all single morpheme words. But then you have 'my blue eyes' that's not a word, that's a phrase! All of the words in that phrase aren't even single morpheme words! So why on earth does the third person possessive deserve its own place of glory but the plural 's' does not!?!This is the problem with popular 'science' books. People read them, feel like they are now informed and use the same arguments that they read about without ever realizing that the books aren't science. There is no scientific method in this book. He never defines his terms, he barely defines his variables. He has a million variables, and doesn't distinguish between them. It's not an experimental study so it's fine that he doesn't have a control group, but he should be trying to make the groups that he is splitting people into as uniform as possible and he doesn't even really attempt it. His variables are men and women, black, white, Asian, and Hispanic. He never even limited his findings to people from the USA. He just assumed that everyone was. He never factored in educational status which would have a huge impact, and that information actually is in the data set, so he could have, but he didn't. He didn't even mention it as a confound! And that's just the point. Everything is a conclusion for him. He argued that there are certain topics that are anathema to certain groups because the word denoting that topic only appears once. No. It does not mean that they are anathema to that group. I can think of a dozen reasons why someone would choose not to put something that they are interested in onto a public forum. I am pretty sure that an Otolaryngologist is not going to put that as their profession on OKCupid, simply because most people don't know what that means, they are just going to go with 'doctor' because it's simpler and gets the point across. That doesn't mean that otolarynogology is a taboo subject because it's only mentioned once. And besides, the fact that it is mentioned at all is already proof positive that it is not a taboo subject, taboo subjects are epitomized by never being mentioned at all and referred to circularly. So why didn't he mention all the other terms that are never mentioned, like muons and antileptons? (No, I don't know what those are either). The self-introductions on OKCupid (which is what he studied) are texts designed to elicit a certain response. They are a specific register, a register that each writer assumes will be the most likely to get them what they want, a date. As such they are inherently not generalizable to populations as a whole. They are only generalizable as 'the words that people use to try and present themselves as a satisfactory date'. There is a purpose behind it and it shows only a very small subset of language use, taking it to mean that it epitomizes someone's character and identity is horrifying. People change how they talk constantly. They talk differently when they write as compared to when they speak. They talk differently depending on if they know their audience or not. They talk differently depending on the power dynamics of the situation. They talk differently depending on how they are feeling at the moment. Studying the language used in self-introductory texts on OKCupid is very interesting and a worthwhile subject in and of itself, but you cannot generalize out to the public. The people on OKCupid are not a random selection of people, they are self-selected to be rather outgoing, not so privacy concerned, not willing to spend their money on web-dating, mostly singly people who are interested in romantic liaisons. They are, according to his own admission of the data, mostly liberal and progressive, mostly college educated, those account for 31% and 34% of the US population respectively. That is not even broken down by sex or race, if I were to spend the time doing that it would show an even smaller portion of the population for each, you can't generalize out to everyone else in the US based on a sub population. That would be like saying 50% of the population of the US are women, and women generally score higher in compassion, therefore the US is a compassionate nation...what? That doesn't even make sense.Finally, the thing that really just made me crack up was when he said ""and I say this as someone who is reflexively critical of the left."" That made me die. Why, why did that make me die? Because it doesn't mean what you think it means. It doesn't mean that he automatically looks at what people on the left say critically. It doesn't mean that his automatic response is to be skeptical. It means to embrace your subjective understandings of reality as a basis for analyzing social interactions. Being reflexively critical is a tenet of feminist post-structuralist analysis, or you could also argue that it is a postmodern, post-Marxist analysis as well. Regardless of who you decide is the ultimate progenitor of such an idea, it remains an ideology of the left. By using it he showed that he was on the left. By trying to present himself as a balanced and disinterested analyzer he showed himself to be controlled by a particular worldview."

I thought it was fun and simple enough for the layman, but not simple to the point that it's lying about the capacity of what big data can do (as an example, I deal with a lot of research participants who do not have an email or do not use their email often). I really appreciated him talking about the limitations, as well as some qualitative methods and how they can be used. The whole point of all this is to see how our private, online behavior is actually a great insight into the human condition. Like how the rate of gay porn consumption is the same across every state, and what factors are important to each racial group. I know I made this sound super boring but it isn't. "

You might not even be too surprised, if they started to learn what music people probably like, by the way they dress, speak, or act (although it would be impressive). But, what if they had hundreds of thousands, or tens of millions of customers a day? How much would they learn about what music people like, if they could somehow deal with that many customers a day?What if, instead of a music store, people came to your store to find something more personal, like a girlfriend or boyfriend?Welcome to the book Dataclysm, where one of the founders of the website OkCupid shows us just what every website you ever use is able to tell about you. That's slightly an exaggeration, of course; dating websites do get a view of us that is a little different than most. But then, Amazon sees you when you put your money where your mouth is. Google sees what you're trying to find, or find out about, or where you're finding directions to. Facebook, of course, probably knows who your real friends are better than what you are willing to admit out loud.If you get creeped out easily by the loss of secrecy (otherwise known as ""privacy"", when it's secrecy that we like) that comes from using the Internet, this is probably not the book for you.However, if you like to leaven your opinions about topics like race (and racism) and sex (and sexism) with some actual data (not just your own personal experience), this book is a revelation. Here is a more or less randomly picked sampling of what you get in this book, not just presented as an assertion, but backed up with mountains of data:1) racism against blacks in America is not just real and enduring, but is equally rampant among Asians and Hispanic Americans as among Anglos2) Asian-Americans on dating sites use a uniquely low number of misspelled words compared to all other ethnicities3) men do not give up trying to date that 20-year old woman until they are over 30, whereas the man who looks best to a 20-year old woman is likely to be around 234) men do not give up trying to date that 30-year old woman until they are over 40, whereas the man who looks best to a 30-year old woman is likely to be around 305) of self-identified straight women on OkCupid, 26% said they had a sexual encounter with a woman, and enjoyed it (more than 3 times the analogous percentage of self-identified straight men)6) by just looking at your ""likes"" on Facebook, you can determine with 60% accuracy whether or not someone is the child of parents who got divorced before they turned 21 (this was in 2012, and the algorithms have probably gotten only better since then)7) women who get a lot of 1's and 5's (out of 5) on their picture, are more likely to get messaged, than women who get a lot of 3's, even though the average opinion of their looks is the sameIf you are online, there are servers (computers that serve up websites to your desktop, laptop, or smartphone) which know quite a lot about you and the others in the society you live in. The people you really don't want to have this kind of information, already have it. The only question is, will you? If knowledge is power, then right now there is a profound imbalance of power being created by this much data. Christian Rudder has done us the favor of showing us what he has (aggregated, of course, so that no individual is identifiable). Take a look."
235,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4579658-rob-kitchin,2,"The stated aim of Dataclysm is to introduce lay readers to the era of big data, the possibilities of such data, and the types of analysis used to make sense of them. The problems with the book start with the title and subtitle, neither of which, I think, make much sense. Dataclysm, Rudder explains, is a play on cataclysm: the wiping away of one era to be replaced by a new one. However, big data is set to complement small data, not wipe them away as small data are generated to answer specific questions rather than being a by-product that is then repurposed, and most big data are held by private corporations or government and are not readily open to researchers. All of the data that Rudder analyzes is from social media; they are data produced precisely because we think someone is looking (for a date, for conversation, for information, to provoke a reaction, etc). Uploading information to the internet is largely a process of the presentation of the self, as Goffman’s famous theory would frame the activity. Even if other people cannot see the answers to direct questions, as when filling in questions on a dating site, the answers shape the user profile and the process of matching -- something that users are aware of, consider and present to.The book then proceeds by discussing social media data and what they might reveal about human behaviour and society. Crucially, however, there is no systematic discussion of big data per se, its forms and characteristics, no discussion of data analytics, and only a cursory discussion of the many ethical, social and political implications of such data. There is no discussion of statistics, or statistical tests performed on the data presented, nor data mining, data analytics, machine learning, pattern recognition, profiling, prediction, etc. The irony here is that Rudder’s company – OkCupid – employs these techniques to be able to process and match potential partners, yet he never explains how this is achieved. Instead, the entire analysis is rooted in the empiricist form of data science, rather than data-driven science, and never proceeds beyond description. As such, the analysis of gender and race he presents are based on a ‘letting the data speak for themself’ approach and constitutes armchair interpretation. He barely engages with the vast academic literature on quantitative analysis of race and gender that has taken place for several decades using large data sets such as the census or public administration data. Rudder has access to an enormous set of very interesting data that could be used to conduct some fascinating sociological and psychological analysis. Instead what we get are a series of descriptive statistics and banal revelations, most of which are already well established. The result is a book that hints at the potential of big data and data science but undersells it substantially, and it under-estimates in my view the readership level of its potential audience by never progressing beyond mathematics and data visualisations used in junior school. In contrast, books such as The Signal and the Noise by Nate Silver provide a much wider and deeper discussion. This is a shame as Rudder is an engaging writer and he has privileged access to an extremely rich social data that could be used to conduct some wonderful and sophisticated social science research. Such rich research and its policy implications are barely hinted at."
236,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8684527-andra-n,5,"I postponed reading Dataclysm for some time, but I’m glad I took my time to read it. Its author, Christian Rudder first caught my attention in an article written after the Facebook scandal over the experiments made over its users, where he explained in a rather unapologetic manner, that this is the very nature of internet’s success and efficiency increase. His opinion is a consequence of his experience running the dating site OkCupid where decisions based on people’s behavior must be made in order to obtain optimal results. “It’s a delicate illusion, the Internet.”Dataclysm is a book about Big Data and Romantic behavior. However, it is definitely not a recipe for making a perfect profile or having more success on social networks. This book is rather a series of conclusions drawn from the aggregated data obtained from millions of interactions mainly from sites like OkCupid and other social networks or Google. This is not the story of the individual, it is the story of the collective. What distinguishes the work of Christian Rudder is that given his privileged position at OKCupid, he had in hand large amounts of data with which he could play and analyze freely. As opposed to other studies of human behavior that have as subjects mostly a bunch of students from well-known universities, his data sets contain personal information of people of all ages and races, from the US. This book has lots of pop-culture references, amusing and sometimes insightful comments. What is most intriguing about his studies is the fact that they are made over information that we rather think it is private. We get a glimpse of our rather politically incorrect behaviors as human beings.I found particularly interesting the comparison between woman preferences and man preferences when it comes to a potential partner’s age, attractiveness and race. Humor is not left out of the book, as the paragraph depicting women ratings of attractiveness of men: “Only one guy in six is “above average” in an absolute sense. Sex appeal isn’t something commonly quantified like this, so let me put it in a more familiar context: translate this plot to IQ, and you have a world where the women think 58 percent of men are brain damaged.”The comparison of words most commonly used by people on their dating profiles from different races or sexual orientation was also a chapter that I found quite interesting. The author shows via text analysis that several race related patterns emerge. “White people differentiate themselves mostly by their hair and eyes, Asians by their country of origin, Latinos by their music. But because of the way the math is set up, the three non-white lists are evidence of cultures that I, as a white man, am not supposed to know…the gay male list is very different from the other three. It’s full of pop culture and has comparatively few references to the user’s immediate person and family.”I would definitely recommend this book that tackles a wide range of topics to anyone who is interested in data science as well as those curious about the weirdness of human nature."
237,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18688-cody,4,"Much e-ink has been spilled--rightfully so--about the brave new world we live online. Targeted advertising, data breaches, the NSA; it’s easy to grow overwhelmed by the potential dangers of sharing personal information electronically. Practically everything we do on our phones and computers is tracked, often in an effort to sell us something or gain some upper hand (financially, politically, socially, etc.). Consequentially, there is now an unprecedented amount of detailed data about us that's ripe for the parsing.Beyond the obvious advantages for market research, is there a benefit to all of this data? Christian Rudder, co-founder of the online dating site OkCupid, thinks so. He’s been approaching the internet over the past decade as one big sociological experiment, and his new book, Dataclysm: Who We Are (When We Think No One’s Looking), explores his findings in depth, some of which are rather mind blowing.Penned in clear and witty prose and full of colorful charts and graphs, Dataclysm breezes by, though many of the insights linger, obsess, and often unsettle. We learn that if you apply network analysis to a couple’s groups of friends on Facebook, you can quite accurately predict how likely they are to stay together. And that Google searches beginning with the phrase “Is my husband…” most commonly end with “gay?” And that women tend to find men who are close to their age as the most attractive, whereas men, up until 50 years old, generally think that women in their early 20s look the best.Even in cases where the results reinforce long held views, what is new, Rudder asserts, “is our ability to test ideas, established ones, famous ones even, against the atomized actions of millions.” But the implications go beyond the sheer volume of the numbers. The ability we now have to track Google searches and site clicks provides us with much more accurate data, as these behaviors transcend the murkier self-reporting that plagues more traditional surveys, especially in regards to controversial topics. Rudder argues that the insights gleaned from all of this new data, even when the results are unflattering, are too beneficial to pass up, as they give us a far clearer and more accurate portrait of our true interests and behaviors.As Rudder frequently admits, the internet is still very young, which means that these data sets lack a long view. What Dataclysm does offer us, though, is another angle from which to consider our online lives. Whether you find the book’s content and approaches revelatory or creepy (at times I found them both), the results are fascinating and the ramifications huge. It reminds us that, as a sociological opportunity, we’re in the midst of a monumental sea change--one that is granting us astoundingly far-reaching insight into who we really are."

Then they prefer men a few years younger. Men find 20 year old women to be the most attractive--refardless of age (from 20-50 men all find women between 20-24 the most attractive)• Polarizing people get more attention--someone ranked with both very high & beauty ratings will receive more messages than someone with an equal average, but of more middle numbers• The smell of shit is added to perfumes and flowers, making the whole actually smell better• 74 men died of nostalgia in the Civil War (according to army records)• Twitter may actually be improving its users' writing ability--in both word length and density & brevity of ideas• More will be written on Twitter in the next 2 years, than all books ever published• 'God' has been in steady decline since the early 1800s--the word is used only about a third as much now as it was then• The best digital messages are only 40 to 60 characters long• One of the best compatibility questions is 'Do you like scary movies?' Answering the same to this question is more predictive of a successful long term relationship than 'big issues' like religion, politics, and looks• Black and White Quarterbacks perform equally down to the decimal: 81.55 (qb rating)• Zodiac signs have no effect on compatibility at all. Race has less effect than religion, politics, or education• 85% of OkCupid users have gone to college• Women are more 'race-loyal' than men in regards to attraction & relationships• 'White sounding' names get 50% more interviews with the exact same résumé as 'black sounding' names like 'Lakisha or 'Jamal'• On Facebook, every percentile of attractiveness gives a man two friends. It gives a woman three.• Often parents want their daughters to be pretty...but 'not too pretty.' Does anyone imagine limitations on a son?• Obama's race probably cost him 3 to 5 percentage points of the popular vote. The most popular Google search for the n-word in history was in Nov 2008, after he won. • 'Rumor' was a winged roman godess with 100 eyes and 100 mouths who spoke only the most hurtful side of the truth...(at least according to rumor)• The agenda of spreading a rumor is directed more for an audience, rather than the subject of a rumor• The Internet makes us vile creatures (see the 'online disinhibition effect')• The government has the greatest invested interest in tracking negativity. Mathematical models exist which predict the otcome of war, how long it will last, who will win, and how many will die• In 1950, the dawn of television, the American Political Science Association called for more polarization in national politics--the parties had grown too close together, the electorate didn't have clear choices. What made good television then, makes good television now, with 100 times the channels.• We seem to define ourselves as much by what we hate as by what we love• Stereotypes are true: white people self-differentiate themselves by their looks, Asians by their origin country, and Latinos by their music• What we don't talk about can be as illuminating as that which we do• Sex is the single most important grouping humanity has. It has existed forever--long before race or creed. In the US, all men were able to vote before women were. With that said, we are all fundamentally similar, much more so than our differences• The United States is divided: all but 4 presidential elections since 1952 would've flipped had 5% of the electorate changed their minds. Any group of people representing that number is therefore very important politically.• Gay porn searches show homosexuality occurs at the same rate nationwide. In less tolerant places however, gays are just more likely to stay in the closet to avoid persecution• In the US, the most popular Google search that begins with 'Is my husband...' most commonly ends in 'gay?' 'Cheating' comes up 10% less, and 'an alcoholic' occurs 8 times less, 'depressed' 10 times less.• Google Search data is ineffective for estimating the number of lesbians in the country, because straight men looking for porn throw off the data• The government counts everyone who's not married as 'single,' regardless of their actual relationship status• Gay and Straight people are looking for the same things in a relationship according to the numbers• Sexuality is more fluid than we realize: 51% of women and 18% of men have bad, or would like to have a same-sex experience• Who we say we are and how we behave are two separate things• Any nation is an 'Imagined Community'--comprised mostly of fellow numbers you'll never meet, and may share little in common with• The relocation of individuals in india & Southeast Asia, as well as the industrialization reflect England circa 1950, and the US 50 years later--driven by the economy, farmers move to city jobs for higher pay• The UK has 5.9 million security cameras: 1 for every 11 citizens• Search data uncovered drug side effects before they were discovered by the FDA warning system, revealing paroxetine and paravastatin can cause hypoglycemia in patients• Facebook was collecting 500 terabytes of information everyday...back in 2012• If you've ever signed up for a website with a fake zip code or fake birthday, you're a criminal--in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act• A 12 year old visiting newyorktimes.com is a criminal as well--violating their Terms of Service and the working doctrine of the US Department of Justice• Twitter usage by high school grads vs college educated is equal (17 & 18% respectively). Black people have a disproportionate presence on Twitter (nearly two fold: 29% vs 16% among whites).

Not my finest several hours.What I like about this book is that it's based on data that's not collected by people putting up fronts or creating a persona. Shit's real. My favorite piece of data was that, relative to other identities, black men talk very little online about Social Distortion. This is definitely a stereotype that should gain some momentum. "
245,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,5,"Summary: One of the best data-driven books I have read. I think the title might be why there are so many haters. He presents a lot of tough issues using a medium ""dating"" that is relatable. Also, you should not try to read this on audiobook. You need to see the graphs. There are a lot of haters that present their background as if that's relevant in some way. It's not. B/c while they typically seem to understand data, they seem to lack reading comprehension skills. What Rudder is presenting is not findings from data work. He's attempting to use data as a backdrop to talk about a host of issues that are relevant in the modern era. The data is simply a view of what one might see. Instead of presenting some other social scientist's work, he's using in-house research, which, incidentally is a larger, better joined, more carefully collected, and larger geographical grouping than what most people have.Even if you find him to be less enlightening than his blog (I don't use twitter)-as some mentioned- I would guess this long-form argument could not be divined from the constraints of that medium of communication. He would have to be even more brilliant than I think he is just from reading this book!! Maybe... the guy is a Harvard grad..... But in case I'm right, below are my notes....p. 14 - ""If Big Data's two running stories have been about surveillance and money, for the last three years I've been working on third: the human story."" ""...as a close second, they're demographers of an unprecedented reach."" P. 15 - He talks about the fact that his purpose is to generalize so he can do his job of bringing people together at scale (not with individual nonsensical exceptions as discussed by A LOT of the haters!). He's trying to understand and infer from the data. And his inference work is wonderful, presenting possible misinterpretations that were tested and reviewed. p. 46 - Actually this entire chapter of how they essentially created a series of studies to demonstrate that variation in attractiveness get you noticed as much as attractiveness does. Freakin' Brilliant!p. 47 - Did not know there was a name to it: ""the Pratfall Effect"" - ""As long as you're generally competent, making a small, occasional mistake makes people think you're more competent. Flaws call out good stuff all the more."" p. 48 - It's better to ""Purposely abandon the middle road."" p. 53 - Regarding NLP work on Twitter...I love the hypothesis that Twitter might be improving its users' writing. This is all amazing stuff as relates to transformations in human language and has application in ways that are ignored even today.""he calculated the typical world length in Hamlet (3.99) and in a collection of Wodehouse's stories (4.05)... both less than the length in his Twitter sample (4.80).""""Comparative linguistics have long traced groups of community through language."" p. 54 - The chart on changing characteristics of speech patterns. The idea being that tribe creation is no longer geographically constrained, AND ALSO, you can catch it in the language used... something that we were NEVER able to do in the past (think Chinese, Cantonese, Mandarin, and the 50+ other dialects). Super nerdy awesome point.p. 62 - ""Sitewide, the copy-and-paste, strategy underperforms the from-scratch messaging about 25%, but in terms of effort-in results-out - it always wins: measuring by replies received to compose a new message each time."" What an awesome thing to take look at. Intriguing when you think about marketing/scaled response composition. p. 82 - Confounders. This is a great way to present this material so often ignored or misunderstood in the field. Generally, this chapter does a great job presenting a series of charts with each of the appropriate analysis points you'd ask in a row. I did not need the written part, but I can see why he has it. I can also see why some who read via audiobooks struggled. It would be hard to understand this book if all you had was the audio.Chapter 7: The Beauty Myth - The whole way he presents it in the context of thinking about his daughter is great. The work that supports it is fantastic. On eating disorders, he describes a possible place to look for solutions to help others....p. 104 ""... but before the behavior was digitized, there was practically no way to get directly at this problem, at least not until visible damage had already occurred. There was only rumor - an ear at the bathroom door, perhaps a parent's sad suspicion.""Chapter 8: p. 106-107. He talks about how b/c people don't tell you their deepest thoughts, you had to really work hard (snoop, catch people unguarded, etc) to figure out what they thought. Then he talks about the truthfulness of search engines like Google. How the mechanism itself is far harder to trick. This is REALLY important to what we think of as the fundamental changes in the types of data we now are able to collect. Chapter 9: There were a number of criticisms I read that lead back to this chapter and I think it might just have been unclear how to read the charts as well to think about it. That's a fair point. I think what he's trying to say is even in words there is racial signaling on both sides. If we think about the words we use to attract others and identify tribe, in the context of dating it's super apparent. For me, then I think about how this relates to concepts like code-switching in the workplace. We focus a lot on the accent, and we know vocabulary matters. But this implies something far deeper. If you read each of the lists and you clearly identify with one group, it's likely, you are farther culturally from other groups than just skin color. This is quite profound on anyone working on things like ""How do we create a single human race without such aberrant division."" Word. p. 155 - If you care at all about gay rights, these stats are important and also very sad. If I've got him correct- and these are the footnotes, we're underestimating the gay population of the US by a lot and most are NOT dating b/c they are socially unable to do so, either because they are in the closet and scared to be themselves or there are structural reasons in their community that prevent them from self-expression. Chapter 12- Great segue into the work on migration, which covers not an only lifestyle choice but also works availability and more. This work is really relevant for - what is not mentioned, the dying cities phenomenon. p. 181 - He's arguing against things like Klout scores. This is why I do not understand the arguments that he doesn't want to drill in or he's missing some sort of causality.. he's not. This book is about what the general number are telling you out of various inferences that are possible.p. 184 - Mountain Dew Story. A great example of what not to crowdsource.p. 186 - ""If employers begin to use algorithms to infer how intelligent you are or whether you use drugs, then your only choice will be to game the system - or to borrow the wording from the previous chapter, 'manage your brand.' To beat the machine, you must act like a machine, which means you've lost to the machine. And that's assuming you can guess what you're supposed to do in the first place. Apparently, one of the strongest correlates to intelligence in the research was liking 'curly fries.' Who could reverse engineer that?p. 187 - very intersting comments on survellience and data use by the government. p. 193 - He talks about the pennies from personal data payments will not amount ot anything that actually helps people. Moreover, it is highly likely to just be passed back through to consumers."

I only got to 60% before the book was over and the notes began (and on a Kindle flipping back and forth is, for me, a pain). Also meat-wise, I was expecting something along the lines of Outlers, which of course this is the opposite of in theme since it looks at the trends of all and not the accomplishments of a few. But I wanted it to be a book I remembered long after. It's really not. Although it's an interesting read while you're in it. Big Data, when it matures, means so much info that will be longitudinal, something data analysts struggle with ever getting enough of, so in that sense this is very exciting, and it's amazing what we can tell already from the little we have.I do think the book suffered mightily by being read on a Kindle (or any e-reader, especially black and white). The graphs used red and it was not always easy to tell what was gray because it was red and what was gray because it was gray--or if anything was really gray. Since much of this book runs off the graphs, that it's a bad thing not to be able to fully read them (and at the size they were at on my Paperwhite, I also felt challenged to really dive in). I did love reading that the author was a disciple of sorts of Tufte. And I appreciated the amount of info given in the charts.I had a hard time getting through the first chapter. I think the author left out a primary reason male and female reactions to potential partners' age might change (or not) over time depending on gender--and normally I'd give him a break on this since it's from another field of study, but since he runs an online dating site and is reporting on that robust data set, then I'd expect him to understand the drives of men (be drawn to young and fertile no matter how old they get) and women (pick a good provider--until she reaches a certain age, realizes she is not going to need a provider (either because she does not have kids or because she provides just fine for herself), and then go for something young and fun). This behavior has been well documented and while I thought he was going to touch on it at one point, it really didn't happen enough for me to ever get that comfortable with the first example out of the gate. That said, I didn't have that issue with the rest of the book, so I did keep going and many of the sections were novel and interesting."
247,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24217018-matt,3,"This is a very quick read which, given the number of visuals, is not surprising. The visuals, though, are beautiful, always tell a story, and never waste a drop of ink on unnecessary information. These images reflect the book...for the most part. It's when the narrative steers away from its stated purpose (a data driven exploration of human nature) that I started to tire of Christian Rudders narrative voice. It's funny, irreverent, and insightful for most of the book and especially for the sections discussing OkCupid data. He writes best about the data he knows best and that's not surprising. But as the book advances Rudder starts to draw on unfamiliar datasets, make less rigorous assertions, and veer into both data fear-mongering and data evangelism. It was disappointing mostly because he promised to write a different kind of book than those which use data as a lens to prove the downfall of society or privacy, or predict incredible advances in technology and public intelligence. He asserts this book is special then proceeds to speculate about how invasive the NSA can be, how Twitter is unleashing our base instincts but also improving our vocabulary, and how online branding is the future of self evaluation. These parts were, in truth, boring compared to the insights about romantic relationship. In summary, I'm not sure where this book fits in the social science and statistics cannon. It's not the most insightful or the most fun, which leaves it somewhere in between and probably only worth picking up if you love the genre. "
248,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35538316-lindy,3,"I feel like I write this in every nonfiction book review, but I wished there was more depth! I also wished someone more, I don't know, anthropologically minded had given this book a once over before publication. For example, Rudder treats data showing that bisexual men are more likely to prefer/message other men on OkCupid when compared to older bisexual men as if it were longitudinal, and implies that bi men's sexual preferences change as they get older. However he does not take into account what these men may be doing off the service; a young bisexual man will probably hit on women at a bar, but is at a considerably greater risk of being decked in the face if he were to do so to men. As the dating pool grows smaller with age, he may turn to the internet to scope out both genders. (To be fair, Rudder  does responsibly account for a similar phenomenon showing that North Dakotans are surprisingly liberal when it comes to causual sex in the next chapter and why that isn't the case.) Likewise, Rudder says that ""yass,"" which turns up in a list of words distinctive of popular twitter users, is a contraction of ""your ass."" This is true, but it's definitely not the most popular use. Nonetheless, Dataclysm is an interesting and accessible book, and I imagine it would be especially so to someone with no background in statistics. I appreciated that the author had a sense of humor, and I don't think (reading in 2017) that it has aged poorly, although it would have been helpful if Rudder had cited years in the text rather than simply ""last year."""
249,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33131867-neha,3,"I had seen a significant portion of the material before on the blog, but it's still worth a read. I loved the informal voice, and the use of various graphs to illustrate new findings. It read like a collection of smaller articles with specific results.A lot of the OkCupid data revealed particular preferences of men and women in terms of age, attractiveness, and ethnicity. I can understand why the overall findings may be upsetting, and I think readers should be cautious about how this actually applies to their lives. This book is not trying to give insider tips for finding more dates. I think it's very important to remember that there is an inherent selection bias in the OkCupid data: it only represents people who have, for one reason or another, decided to try online dating.I thought the book was going to be more about OkCupid's dataset, but I appreciated the discussions about Google, Facebook, and Twitter data. The last chapter describes the ongoing conflict of privacy that is absent from earlier chapters. While giving users complete ownership of their data may seem to solve many problems, I tend to disagree that it's entirely possible. Services can certainly provide an option for users to remove their data from the site, but once data is on the Internet, I think it's safe to assume that it will never fully disappear."
250,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11500849-jen,1,"A sloppy and irresponsible introduction to big data analytics. Taking a popular science approach, the book glosses over key tenets of every day data science, like basic hypothesis testing. It also makes grand, sweeping generalizations about society as a whole where none can be made based on the population of the data (OK Cupid members hardly represent a random sampling of the US population).Some of the more egregious statements include ""There are times when a data set is so robust that if you set up your analysis right, you don't need to ask questions - it just tells you everything anyway"" and ""people are already compensated for their data: They get to use services like Facebook and Google...for free.""Putting the author's disregard of personal privacy aside, the narrative voice is filled with white male privilege. A few sections of the book made me generally uncomfortable in its approach to conversations about race, gender, and heterosexual relationships. We need a book about data science that highlights the process in a way that digital users can understand how their data is being analyzed and who is doing it responsibly. This is not it."
251,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1492668-mark,3,"You are concerned that the NSA is aggregating data and spying on you? If you check, or look at a picture of the NSA (Why does an office building need a radar dome on the roof?), you will see that has always been their job. But while you are worrying about that, you are telling scores of commercial data aggregators everything about yourself, just by what you search for on Google, what you like on Facebook and where you access the internet from. Your sex, your race, your sexual orientation, your income, your politics, your IQ (from the type of French fries you like), it's all an open book. This book is the story from one involved nerd, along with some nice graphics.People's activities are somewhat limited, so the use of this data is mostly to target you for repression or elimination in a repressive society, to sell you something in a capitalist society, or for law enforcement to find you. So if you're only getting targeted Amazon ads, be happy.Of course, I can only imagine what the data will be used for after Skynet becomes active."
252,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/140018-kyle,2,"Readable, with nice diagrams, this is a hard book to hate. It is easy to be irritated by it, however. The basis of the book is a dozen or so interesting statistical points, with a chapter of conversational description for each. I'm curious where these statistical insights actually come from. Did the author pore over data for months? It doesn't feel that way. They have the feeling of nuggets gleaned from interns working over a period of years, that never ended up being useful anywhere else. Certainly, the discussion the author offers almost no isights beyond the immediately obvious. It isn't clear enough to be a good introduction to statistics, nor in-depth enough to offer interest to statisticians.The best chapters are the early ones oriented towards anyone trying to game the system a little on dating sites. How long message should be, what the opposite sex is looking for for someone your age, etc. The later chapters, trying to offer larger insights about culture and language are ... not convincing. Problematic, even."
253,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78503-chris,3,"This book has some great perspective on human behavior derived from data sets culled from many websites. It celebrates the fact that the amount of data that we have on people's actual beliefs and desires (as opposed to their stated beliefs) and breaks down what a lot of these data sets mean. A lot of it is very funny, even while it may be disturbing in its implications.For the first two-thirds, it was really interesting to me and had a lot of, if not surprising, at least very relevant things to say about human behaviors.The last third kind of drifted off into parts of the data that I am not too concerned with personally and the author's thoughts on what the future will be. It is not necessarily bad, just not what I was looking for, and also, a bit more broad than the particulars of the earlier chapters. "
254,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63344080-lucas,4,"This book offers a new look at old questions. Race, identity and the many differences between women and men in their approach to sex and relationship are shown here through data from an online dating website (OkCupid). I think the book presents valuable insights about racism because it observes actually behavior rather than self-reported questions.Some of the interesting book's find is the following:* Both black men and black women are strongly rejected in online dating* The women who received more attention of men aren't the more beautiful but those who have the high variance in their ratings (men can't say if they are beautiful or not).* Most people (~90%) who declare themselves bisexual is indeed heterosexual or homosexual.* Straight women are less propense to search only casual sex in online datingA negative thing is that the book contains a lot of digressions."

The possibilities of big data seem scary and exciting at the same time. This book presents them in a very accessible way to the average reader. I was skeptical of some the conclusions that the author presented but there's a lot of good conversation starters here. However, I don't think much of it will stick with me in the long run.I probably didn't make the best choice by listening to this on audiobook where numbers in charts were read out for minutes hahaOverall, a short, enjoyable, and timely read if you want to delve into popular science books."

Thought I was halfway through the book but had actually finished. Note sure whether the lack of mathematical analysis is a blessing or not - I guess that would depend on how capable the writer is - but much of the content, while interesting is a ""firm grasp of the obvious."""

This was a highly enjoyable-to-read, interesting-to-think-about, pop-data/analytics book. I appreciated the author's voice and sense of humor, but he often ventured into preachy territory.

259,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8886042-michelle,2,"Dataclysm: Who We Are When We Think No One's Looking by Christian Rudder is an interesting and fact filled book. I received an Advance Reader's Copy from Crown Publishing, a division of Random House and my opinions were formed by my reading of this uncorrected proof. Author Christian Rudder is one of the founders of the dating website OKCupid and he draws his research for this book primarily from the data that has been collected from paying members who are looking for relationships. He additionally mines data from other social media resources, dating services like Match.com and websites, and his pool of subjects include a cross section of the population that he believes is an excellent barometer for the opinions of Americans today. This book is filled with charts and maps and images to help you easily understand the data he has sourced and how it applies to the ""everyman"" in all of us.This book approaches a wide variety of topics - relationships, personal preferences, age, gender, race and upbringing and tries to answer the question ""Who are we really?"" by examining what we say versus how we act. Although I felt like I came away with a bunch of quotable tidbits and an interesting peek into how the data that we so freely place on the internet is used, I'm not quite sure that I learned very much about myself from this book. Many of the observances seemed rational to me and not all that thought provoking, and although some applied to me I didn't walk away feeling like I had much personal insight. A few of the passages left me feeling uneasy, simply because I'm not sure all the members of OKCupid were willing test subjects in Mr. Rudder's data laboratory. In one memorable instance photos of users were shown in an illustration of women who had very high and very low scores from fellow users in terms of their appeal. Although he was using them to make a point about the importance of having a photo that provokes a strong reaction is better than having a commonly pretty picture (which he describes as ""meh"") and he expressly thanks the subjects for their consent to be included in the book and to have their photos discussed, it still felt mildly squicky. Although the many other charts and illustrations in the book didn't deal in this same very personal representation of data, I did question the author's use of the OKCupid site at times. Although it may all be perfectly legal it makes me ask ""do I need to know this?"" and ""is the use of this data justified in a bigger, insight gaining way that makes it important to a reader?"" I'm not sure I have the answer to those questions.  As a collection of facts and data there were definitely a few things I hadn't thought about before - for example, there is a chart showing the 100 most common words used in the English language today from the Oxford English Corpus (a collection of modern writing's approach to vocabulary and word use) versus the top 100 used to express yourself on Twitter in the form of the service's 140 character tweet posts. It showed that although you may think the language of Twitter would somewhat abbreviate or diminish your ideas to get your point across, actually a person composing a tweet is much more selective and thoughtful about what their words will convey. It may help us to write clearer and in a concise style that contributes to an overall awareness of language. That awareness filters into the speech and style of a Twitter user versus a non-user. I liked the idea that my tweeting may help me generate a better and more vivid use of language. Still I kept returning to the fact that this book didn't really live up to the ""portrait of our essential selves"" claim that it was intended to be. It isn't a bad book. I just wish that I had a greater takeaway as a reader.One thing that truly irked me about this book is the mention of a website link where you could go, punch in your own data (two Facebook usernames) and get a personal illustration to see one of the ideas in this book in action. In the fourth chapter titled ""You Gotta be the Glue"" there is an illustration showing the overlap of the author's Facebook friends and his wife's friend's. He explains in depth how we create clusters of people in our lives that know us from a specific point of view - our work friends, childhood acquaintances, family members etc. Our spouse or significant other can overlap our Facebook friendships in many categories. Perhaps you are both friends with your parents and share relationships with other couples you met while you both attended a ballroom dance lesson. The shared connections can illustrate the bonds we have as couples, and can show you the places in your relationships that have a strong and meaningful connection. I thought this sounded really cool and was happy to find an example that could be personalized to me and allowed me to be a willing participant in the experiment to see how it felt. Unfortunately this awesome personalized tool simply doesn't exist. I have tried the link dozens of times over the past few weeks and didn't post my thoughts on the book since I wanted to see this chart in action, but it still gives me a ""Page Not Found"" message. The book's publication date is set for Tuesday September 9th, and since this is Saturday the 6th I would think that it would be active. I hope it will go live on Tuesday at the very least. I contacted the author through his Twitter page about the lack of a working link and received no response, however another reviewer on Goodreads said that when they contacted him through email they received a response that it would be functional by the end of August. If I had paid for this book rather than receiving an ARC I would be even more disappointed. The one big opportunity to gain personal insight is so far, a bust.If you find the sort of data in this book interesting I would check it out of the library or wait for the book to be marked down. I wouldn't consider it a must read but I am thankful I had the opportunity to read it. I hope you find this useful information, and I will update my opinion if the link works on the publication date. For now I can only give this book 2 of 5 stars. "
260,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5177572-genevieve,4,"* Originally reviewed on the Night Owls Press blog here. *First, it was the Internet. The Internet was going to change how businesses and organized operated. It was going to change how people live. But now something else has enthralled our imagination: big data.What is big data? We couldn't have big data without the Web. Our shift to online activity has made it easier to record and document massive reams of data and data trails about seemingly everything: Where do we go when we're online? What do we do? What do we read? The idea behind big data is that scientists can analyze that activity and parse out that information, information that might predict what we would do in hypothetical situations, or what we would be likely to do in the future. This largely possible because of scale. It's not about analyzing a person, a hundred people, or a thousand people; it's about waves and waves of information, millions and millions of data points.Think about how far we've come. In the third century BC, the first great repository of human knowledge was the Library of Alexandria. Today information is available in the exabytes. (What is an exabyte? Um...it's really, really big.) Big data is about size, but it's more than that. It's the fact that we have computers and databases that will log and analyze micro-activities, actions as simple as Facebook ""likes,"" our location recorded by the GPS in our phones, and the ""number of seconds or minutes spent reading a web page.""Dataclysm Who We Are When We Think No One's Looking by Christian Rudder sheds light on what that kind of datafication looks like. Rudder himself is the cofounder of OkCupid, the online dating site, which lives and breathes on seemingly mystical algorithms that dice and chop up streams of data. No other person might be more qualified to give us an insider's account on what big data can do.Rudder dabbles in statistical, psychological, and sociological theories and drills the chapters with clever infographics and beautifully rendered scatterplots—and some of them are truly works of art. (I used to work in data so I have a soft spot for data scientists and their work.) But where Rudder really excels is in the smorgasbord of findings. Patterns emerge from the data. Stare into the matrix and you'll see...a mirror into your very soul. At least that's what Rudder wants us to believe.You might be put off by Rudder's focus on dating sites but that's his métier. The trove of information on social interactions alone on dating sites is weirdly fascinating. In one example, Rudder finds that dating profiles of women who have a polarizing physical appearance are more likely to be approached for dates than the conventionally attractive person. (Is it fascination with novelty? boredom with the same 'ole, same 'ole?) Aren't we all at our most earnest and neurotic when it comes to love and relationships?A downside of this book is that if you read or pay attention to the tech news cycle, you may find some of Rudder's examples ho-hum repeats. For example, we've seen Google Trends tackle the flu in a kind of digital epidemiology approach. Nothing new there. Rudder retells these stories not to just fill the pages though but to constantly keep the beat of this book, which is asking deeper questions about who are we as a culture?Another downside is that even with all the reams of data and stats Rudder throws at us, ultimately, these are just cool factoids. It's an impressive avalanche of interesting data tidbits, but still just tidbits. The next challenge for big data: figuring out what truly matters, narrowing it down, cutting the noise.The heart of what makes big data interesting is that it's research that isn't gathered merely from surveys or interviews or even randomized control trial experiments, which we all know can be biased for a variety of reasons: subjects don't understand the questions, subjects lie, people obfuscate, they unconsciously modify their behavior to please researchers. Here the data is based on actual behavior in situ. And we can learn something from it, we can see patterns and discern behaviors that were otherwise invisible. It's like studying people in the wild.Most books about data are dry and boring, but Dataclysm is one that makes a mark. Part of this is Rudder staying grounded in primary data and real analysis. But an even bigger part is Rudder's never-stale writing style. Yes, the book is still pop-social science. This might frustrate a few bona fide data scientists out there. But Dataclysm works. The amusing stories and asides sprinkled throughout the book are full of zest but are never fluffy. For a numbers person, a Harvard-honed math-y guy working in Silicon Valley, Dataclysm is a remarkably fluid and readable book.Big data isn't the answer to the universe, the meaning of life, or to your other burning existential questions, but you'll still become privy to some interesting discoveries about culture and society.[Disclaimer: I received this book from Blogging for Books for an honest and candid review.] "

262,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16880570-khari,1,"Three months.Three months to listen to a book seven and a half hours long. Normally I can get one of those out in a week. Nope. Three months.I'm really tired of these books with fascinating titles that just disappoint.This book made me understand why people shout 'Science' at each other. It's because authors like this either underestimate their audience and dumb down what they have done, or they have terrible methodologies themselves and don't even realize it.For a book about data which necessarily must include statistics, there is a shocking dearth of statistic lingo in this book. He tries to justify himself in the end. His intention was to write a popular science book and he didn't want to clutter it with jargon like 'p', and 'confidence interval' and fun stuff like that. And, hey, I get it. I don't completely understand statistics yet, but even I know that words like 'significant' have a particular meaning that has to be defined in the world of numbers, but he never defines his terms. He says the methodology he used was 'rigorous' and it went through something 'like peer review' but never defines what his methodology was, and his 'peer review' was for his underling (who he knew btw) to check his numbers. That's not peer review. Hate to break it to you. Peer review is done by someone who does not know who wrote the paper, and they look over the whole paper, including the hypotheses and the conclusions as well as the number. It's not someone whose job is in your hands checking your math. But I know why he chose to do it this way. It's because there is no way on this planet that this atrocity would have ever been published in a good scientific journal....wait...let me rephrase that. Considering that there have been cases of complete hoax papers being published it is remotely possible that it could have been published in a badly edited, badly curated, motivated reasoning filled journal. Because that's what this was. Badly edited, badly curated, filled with motivated reasoning, and worst of all, terrible methodology that is never explained. This book couldn't hack it in the scientific publishing world so he had to go to a subsidiary of Penguin, Crown Publishing, that focuses on hobbies, memoirs, biographies, autobiographies, cooking, lifestyle, business and nonfiction. And honestly, that makes a ton of sense, because this reads more like a memoir than a book of scientific rigor. He makes unfounded claims, presents his interpretation as fact, and only considers one explanation for everything that he finds interesting.The part that absolutely killed me was he is talking about corpus linguistics. Corpus linguistics is gathering really large bodies of texts and making it searchable. There are a bunch of free ones out there, such as the Corpus of Contemporary American English (affectionately known as COCA), for your perusal. They have a bunch of ways of analyzing, you can look at the most used words, you can look at the collocations (the words immediately preceding and following a word), you can look at the word families that are used, the lexemes that are used, the type of word that most appears, the contexts in which words appear, which is a really good way to find out what a word actually means in use, in contrast to how it is defined in the dictionary. Corpus linguistics just happens to be my baby. It was my focus in my master's program and it's my focus in my PHD program. And guess what? I know nothing about it. I've already spent three years learning about it, and I'm going to go spend another 2-6, and I've read peer-reviewed articles about it, talked to experts, and read books about it, and I still know nothing, but I know enough to know that how he's using it is mind bogglingly bogus. He basically does character counting. He counts how many words show up in a tweet, calculates the mean character length, then compares it to the mean character length in Shakespeare and concludes that since the mean character length in tweets is longer, people today are using language in a more nuanced way than Shakespeare was....mean character length. Or his other technique was to make a word list of the most used words and show that it was similar to Shakespeare because 'the' and 'a' appeared at the top. No duh Sherlock, they're function words. They happen to be required every time you are referring to a singular noun. They would show up at the top of the word list of this review as well and that would mean nothing about the similarity between reviews and tweets. They are different registers who both follow the rules of the English language, ergo, functional words such as articles and pronouns and prepositions would occur more often simply because they are closed classes that are requisite for forming phrases that make sense.So there you go, a very brief, cogent rebuttal for one of his most important methods of analysis. But that rebuttal is actually rebutting his intention, not what he actually did. What he actually did was include, on his erstwhile 'word' list, things like 'the', 'a', ''s', 'Peru' 'my blue eyes', 'tall for an Asian', etc. .........How, in the name of all that is grounded in the study of linguistics, can those things be defined as 'words'?!?!? What definition is he using?!? He isn't using one! He's just conglomerating everything that he finds interesting together and calling it a 'word' while not even recognizing that what he finds interesting is subjective! It's not a parameter by which to define something! At first I was like, huh, is he using morphemes as the basis of his 'word'? ""'s"" would be the the third person possessive morpheme, I can see that, after all 'the' 'a' and 'Peru' are all single morpheme words. But then you have 'my blue eyes' that's not a word, that's a phrase! All of the words in that phrase aren't even single morpheme words! So why on earth does the third person possessive deserve its own place of glory but the plural 's' does not!?!This is the problem with popular 'science' books. People read them, feel like they are now informed and use the same arguments that they read about without ever realizing that the books aren't science. There is no scientific method in this book. He never defines his terms, he barely defines his variables. He has a million variables, and doesn't distinguish between them. It's not an experimental study so it's fine that he doesn't have a control group, but he should be trying to make the groups that he is splitting people into as uniform as possible and he doesn't even really attempt it. His variables are men and women, black, white, Asian, and Hispanic. He never even limited his findings to people from the USA. He just assumed that everyone was. He never factored in educational status which would have a huge impact, and that information actually is in the data set, so he could have, but he didn't. He didn't even mention it as a confound! And that's just the point. Everything is a conclusion for him. He argued that there are certain topics that are anathema to certain groups because the word denoting that topic only appears once. No. It does not mean that they are anathema to that group. I can think of a dozen reasons why someone would choose not to put something that they are interested in onto a public forum. I am pretty sure that an Otolaryngologist is not going to put that as their profession on OKCupid, simply because most people don't know what that means, they are just going to go with 'doctor' because it's simpler and gets the point across. That doesn't mean that otolarynogology is a taboo subject because it's only mentioned once. And besides, the fact that it is mentioned at all is already proof positive that it is not a taboo subject, taboo subjects are epitomized by never being mentioned at all and referred to circularly. So why didn't he mention all the other terms that are never mentioned, like muons and antileptons? (No, I don't know what those are either). The self-introductions on OKCupid (which is what he studied) are texts designed to elicit a certain response. They are a specific register, a register that each writer assumes will be the most likely to get them what they want, a date. As such they are inherently not generalizable to populations as a whole. They are only generalizable as 'the words that people use to try and present themselves as a satisfactory date'. There is a purpose behind it and it shows only a very small subset of language use, taking it to mean that it epitomizes someone's character and identity is horrifying. People change how they talk constantly. They talk differently when they write as compared to when they speak. They talk differently depending on if they know their audience or not. They talk differently depending on the power dynamics of the situation. They talk differently depending on how they are feeling at the moment. Studying the language used in self-introductory texts on OKCupid is very interesting and a worthwhile subject in and of itself, but you cannot generalize out to the public. The people on OKCupid are not a random selection of people, they are self-selected to be rather outgoing, not so privacy concerned, not willing to spend their money on web-dating, mostly singly people who are interested in romantic liaisons. They are, according to his own admission of the data, mostly liberal and progressive, mostly college educated, those account for 31% and 34% of the US population respectively. That is not even broken down by sex or race, if I were to spend the time doing that it would show an even smaller portion of the population for each, you can't generalize out to everyone else in the US based on a sub population. That would be like saying 50% of the population of the US are women, and women generally score higher in compassion, therefore the US is a compassionate nation...what? That doesn't even make sense.Finally, the thing that really just made me crack up was when he said ""and I say this as someone who is reflexively critical of the left."" That made me die. Why, why did that make me die? Because it doesn't mean what you think it means. It doesn't mean that he automatically looks at what people on the left say critically. It doesn't mean that his automatic response is to be skeptical. It means to embrace your subjective understandings of reality as a basis for analyzing social interactions. Being reflexively critical is a tenet of feminist post-structuralist analysis, or you could also argue that it is a postmodern, post-Marxist analysis as well. Regardless of who you decide is the ultimate progenitor of such an idea, it remains an ideology of the left. By using it he showed that he was on the left. By trying to present himself as a balanced and disinterested analyzer he showed himself to be controlled by a particular worldview."

I thought it was fun and simple enough for the layman, but not simple to the point that it's lying about the capacity of what big data can do (as an example, I deal with a lot of research participants who do not have an email or do not use their email often). I really appreciated him talking about the limitations, as well as some qualitative methods and how they can be used. The whole point of all this is to see how our private, online behavior is actually a great insight into the human condition. Like how the rate of gay porn consumption is the same across every state, and what factors are important to each racial group. I know I made this sound super boring but it isn't. "

You might not even be too surprised, if they started to learn what music people probably like, by the way they dress, speak, or act (although it would be impressive). But, what if they had hundreds of thousands, or tens of millions of customers a day? How much would they learn about what music people like, if they could somehow deal with that many customers a day?What if, instead of a music store, people came to your store to find something more personal, like a girlfriend or boyfriend?Welcome to the book Dataclysm, where one of the founders of the website OkCupid shows us just what every website you ever use is able to tell about you. That's slightly an exaggeration, of course; dating websites do get a view of us that is a little different than most. But then, Amazon sees you when you put your money where your mouth is. Google sees what you're trying to find, or find out about, or where you're finding directions to. Facebook, of course, probably knows who your real friends are better than what you are willing to admit out loud.If you get creeped out easily by the loss of secrecy (otherwise known as ""privacy"", when it's secrecy that we like) that comes from using the Internet, this is probably not the book for you.However, if you like to leaven your opinions about topics like race (and racism) and sex (and sexism) with some actual data (not just your own personal experience), this book is a revelation. Here is a more or less randomly picked sampling of what you get in this book, not just presented as an assertion, but backed up with mountains of data:1) racism against blacks in America is not just real and enduring, but is equally rampant among Asians and Hispanic Americans as among Anglos2) Asian-Americans on dating sites use a uniquely low number of misspelled words compared to all other ethnicities3) men do not give up trying to date that 20-year old woman until they are over 30, whereas the man who looks best to a 20-year old woman is likely to be around 234) men do not give up trying to date that 30-year old woman until they are over 40, whereas the man who looks best to a 30-year old woman is likely to be around 305) of self-identified straight women on OkCupid, 26% said they had a sexual encounter with a woman, and enjoyed it (more than 3 times the analogous percentage of self-identified straight men)6) by just looking at your ""likes"" on Facebook, you can determine with 60% accuracy whether or not someone is the child of parents who got divorced before they turned 21 (this was in 2012, and the algorithms have probably gotten only better since then)7) women who get a lot of 1's and 5's (out of 5) on their picture, are more likely to get messaged, than women who get a lot of 3's, even though the average opinion of their looks is the sameIf you are online, there are servers (computers that serve up websites to your desktop, laptop, or smartphone) which know quite a lot about you and the others in the society you live in. The people you really don't want to have this kind of information, already have it. The only question is, will you? If knowledge is power, then right now there is a profound imbalance of power being created by this much data. Christian Rudder has done us the favor of showing us what he has (aggregated, of course, so that no individual is identifiable). Take a look."
265,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4579658-rob-kitchin,2,"The stated aim of Dataclysm is to introduce lay readers to the era of big data, the possibilities of such data, and the types of analysis used to make sense of them. The problems with the book start with the title and subtitle, neither of which, I think, make much sense. Dataclysm, Rudder explains, is a play on cataclysm: the wiping away of one era to be replaced by a new one. However, big data is set to complement small data, not wipe them away as small data are generated to answer specific questions rather than being a by-product that is then repurposed, and most big data are held by private corporations or government and are not readily open to researchers. All of the data that Rudder analyzes is from social media; they are data produced precisely because we think someone is looking (for a date, for conversation, for information, to provoke a reaction, etc). Uploading information to the internet is largely a process of the presentation of the self, as Goffman’s famous theory would frame the activity. Even if other people cannot see the answers to direct questions, as when filling in questions on a dating site, the answers shape the user profile and the process of matching -- something that users are aware of, consider and present to.The book then proceeds by discussing social media data and what they might reveal about human behaviour and society. Crucially, however, there is no systematic discussion of big data per se, its forms and characteristics, no discussion of data analytics, and only a cursory discussion of the many ethical, social and political implications of such data. There is no discussion of statistics, or statistical tests performed on the data presented, nor data mining, data analytics, machine learning, pattern recognition, profiling, prediction, etc. The irony here is that Rudder’s company – OkCupid – employs these techniques to be able to process and match potential partners, yet he never explains how this is achieved. Instead, the entire analysis is rooted in the empiricist form of data science, rather than data-driven science, and never proceeds beyond description. As such, the analysis of gender and race he presents are based on a ‘letting the data speak for themself’ approach and constitutes armchair interpretation. He barely engages with the vast academic literature on quantitative analysis of race and gender that has taken place for several decades using large data sets such as the census or public administration data. Rudder has access to an enormous set of very interesting data that could be used to conduct some fascinating sociological and psychological analysis. Instead what we get are a series of descriptive statistics and banal revelations, most of which are already well established. The result is a book that hints at the potential of big data and data science but undersells it substantially, and it under-estimates in my view the readership level of its potential audience by never progressing beyond mathematics and data visualisations used in junior school. In contrast, books such as The Signal and the Noise by Nate Silver provide a much wider and deeper discussion. This is a shame as Rudder is an engaging writer and he has privileged access to an extremely rich social data that could be used to conduct some wonderful and sophisticated social science research. Such rich research and its policy implications are barely hinted at."
266,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8684527-andra-n,5,"I postponed reading Dataclysm for some time, but I’m glad I took my time to read it. Its author, Christian Rudder first caught my attention in an article written after the Facebook scandal over the experiments made over its users, where he explained in a rather unapologetic manner, that this is the very nature of internet’s success and efficiency increase. His opinion is a consequence of his experience running the dating site OkCupid where decisions based on people’s behavior must be made in order to obtain optimal results. “It’s a delicate illusion, the Internet.”Dataclysm is a book about Big Data and Romantic behavior. However, it is definitely not a recipe for making a perfect profile or having more success on social networks. This book is rather a series of conclusions drawn from the aggregated data obtained from millions of interactions mainly from sites like OkCupid and other social networks or Google. This is not the story of the individual, it is the story of the collective. What distinguishes the work of Christian Rudder is that given his privileged position at OKCupid, he had in hand large amounts of data with which he could play and analyze freely. As opposed to other studies of human behavior that have as subjects mostly a bunch of students from well-known universities, his data sets contain personal information of people of all ages and races, from the US. This book has lots of pop-culture references, amusing and sometimes insightful comments. What is most intriguing about his studies is the fact that they are made over information that we rather think it is private. We get a glimpse of our rather politically incorrect behaviors as human beings.I found particularly interesting the comparison between woman preferences and man preferences when it comes to a potential partner’s age, attractiveness and race. Humor is not left out of the book, as the paragraph depicting women ratings of attractiveness of men: “Only one guy in six is “above average” in an absolute sense. Sex appeal isn’t something commonly quantified like this, so let me put it in a more familiar context: translate this plot to IQ, and you have a world where the women think 58 percent of men are brain damaged.”The comparison of words most commonly used by people on their dating profiles from different races or sexual orientation was also a chapter that I found quite interesting. The author shows via text analysis that several race related patterns emerge. “White people differentiate themselves mostly by their hair and eyes, Asians by their country of origin, Latinos by their music. But because of the way the math is set up, the three non-white lists are evidence of cultures that I, as a white man, am not supposed to know…the gay male list is very different from the other three. It’s full of pop culture and has comparatively few references to the user’s immediate person and family.”I would definitely recommend this book that tackles a wide range of topics to anyone who is interested in data science as well as those curious about the weirdness of human nature."
267,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18688-cody,4,"Much e-ink has been spilled--rightfully so--about the brave new world we live online. Targeted advertising, data breaches, the NSA; it’s easy to grow overwhelmed by the potential dangers of sharing personal information electronically. Practically everything we do on our phones and computers is tracked, often in an effort to sell us something or gain some upper hand (financially, politically, socially, etc.). Consequentially, there is now an unprecedented amount of detailed data about us that's ripe for the parsing.Beyond the obvious advantages for market research, is there a benefit to all of this data? Christian Rudder, co-founder of the online dating site OkCupid, thinks so. He’s been approaching the internet over the past decade as one big sociological experiment, and his new book, Dataclysm: Who We Are (When We Think No One’s Looking), explores his findings in depth, some of which are rather mind blowing.Penned in clear and witty prose and full of colorful charts and graphs, Dataclysm breezes by, though many of the insights linger, obsess, and often unsettle. We learn that if you apply network analysis to a couple’s groups of friends on Facebook, you can quite accurately predict how likely they are to stay together. And that Google searches beginning with the phrase “Is my husband…” most commonly end with “gay?” And that women tend to find men who are close to their age as the most attractive, whereas men, up until 50 years old, generally think that women in their early 20s look the best.Even in cases where the results reinforce long held views, what is new, Rudder asserts, “is our ability to test ideas, established ones, famous ones even, against the atomized actions of millions.” But the implications go beyond the sheer volume of the numbers. The ability we now have to track Google searches and site clicks provides us with much more accurate data, as these behaviors transcend the murkier self-reporting that plagues more traditional surveys, especially in regards to controversial topics. Rudder argues that the insights gleaned from all of this new data, even when the results are unflattering, are too beneficial to pass up, as they give us a far clearer and more accurate portrait of our true interests and behaviors.As Rudder frequently admits, the internet is still very young, which means that these data sets lack a long view. What Dataclysm does offer us, though, is another angle from which to consider our online lives. Whether you find the book’s content and approaches revelatory or creepy (at times I found them both), the results are fascinating and the ramifications huge. It reminds us that, as a sociological opportunity, we’re in the midst of a monumental sea change--one that is granting us astoundingly far-reaching insight into who we really are."

Then they prefer men a few years younger. Men find 20 year old women to be the most attractive--refardless of age (from 20-50 men all find women between 20-24 the most attractive)• Polarizing people get more attention--someone ranked with both very high & beauty ratings will receive more messages than someone with an equal average, but of more middle numbers• The smell of shit is added to perfumes and flowers, making the whole actually smell better• 74 men died of nostalgia in the Civil War (according to army records)• Twitter may actually be improving its users' writing ability--in both word length and density & brevity of ideas• More will be written on Twitter in the next 2 years, than all books ever published• 'God' has been in steady decline since the early 1800s--the word is used only about a third as much now as it was then• The best digital messages are only 40 to 60 characters long• One of the best compatibility questions is 'Do you like scary movies?' Answering the same to this question is more predictive of a successful long term relationship than 'big issues' like religion, politics, and looks• Black and White Quarterbacks perform equally down to the decimal: 81.55 (qb rating)• Zodiac signs have no effect on compatibility at all. Race has less effect than religion, politics, or education• 85% of OkCupid users have gone to college• Women are more 'race-loyal' than men in regards to attraction & relationships• 'White sounding' names get 50% more interviews with the exact same résumé as 'black sounding' names like 'Lakisha or 'Jamal'• On Facebook, every percentile of attractiveness gives a man two friends. It gives a woman three.• Often parents want their daughters to be pretty...but 'not too pretty.' Does anyone imagine limitations on a son?• Obama's race probably cost him 3 to 5 percentage points of the popular vote.

Mathematical models exist which predict the otcome of war, how long it will last, who will win, and how many will die• In 1950, the dawn of television, the American Political Science Association called for more polarization in national politics--the parties had grown too close together, the electorate didn't have clear choices. What made good television then, makes good television now, with 100 times the channels.• We seem to define ourselves as much by what we hate as by what we love• Stereotypes are true: white people self-differentiate themselves by their looks, Asians by their origin country, and Latinos by their music• What we don't talk about can be as illuminating as that which we do• Sex is the single most important grouping humanity has. It has existed forever--long before race or creed. In the US, all men were able to vote before women were. With that said, we are all fundamentally similar, much more so than our differences• The United States is divided: all but 4 presidential elections since 1952 would've flipped had 5% of the electorate changed their minds. Any group of people representing that number is therefore very important politically.• Gay porn searches show homosexuality occurs at the same rate nationwide. In less tolerant places however, gays are just more likely to stay in the closet to avoid persecution• In the US, the most popular Google search that begins with 'Is my husband...' most commonly ends in 'gay?' 'Cheating' comes up 10% less, and 'an alcoholic' occurs 8 times less, 'depressed' 10 times less.• Google Search data is ineffective for estimating the number of lesbians in the country, because straight men looking for porn throw off the data• The government counts everyone who's not married as 'single,' regardless of their actual relationship status• Gay and Straight people are looking for the same things in a relationship according to the numbers• Sexuality is more fluid than we realize: 51% of women and 18% of men have bad, or would like to have a same-sex experience• Who we say we are and how we behave are two separate things• Any nation is an 'Imagined Community'--comprised mostly of fellow numbers you'll never meet, and may share little in common with• The relocation of individuals in india & Southeast Asia, as well as the industrialization reflect England circa 1950, and the US 50 years later--driven by the economy, farmers move to city jobs for higher pay• The UK has 5.9 million security cameras: 1 for every 11 citizens• Search data uncovered drug side effects before they were discovered by the FDA warning system, revealing paroxetine and paravastatin can cause hypoglycemia in patients• Facebook was collecting 500 terabytes of information everyday...back in 2012• If you've ever signed up for a website with a fake zip code or fake birthday, you're a criminal--in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act• A 12 year old visiting newyorktimes.com is a criminal as well--violating their Terms of Service and the working doctrine of the US Department of Justice• Twitter usage by high school grads vs college educated is equal (17 & 18% respectively). Black people have a disproportionate presence on Twitter (nearly two fold: 29% vs 16% among whites).

Not my finest several hours.What I like about this book is that it's based on data that's not collected by people putting up fronts or creating a persona. Shit's real. My favorite piece of data was that, relative to other identities, black men talk very little online about Social Distortion. This is definitely a stereotype that should gain some momentum. "
275,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,5,"Summary: One of the best data-driven books I have read. I think the title might be why there are so many haters. He presents a lot of tough issues using a medium ""dating"" that is relatable. Also, you should not try to read this on audiobook. You need to see the graphs. There are a lot of haters that present their background as if that's relevant in some way. It's not. B/c while they typically seem to understand data, they seem to lack reading comprehension skills. What Rudder is presenting is not findings from data work. He's attempting to use data as a backdrop to talk about a host of issues that are relevant in the modern era. The data is simply a view of what one might see. Instead of presenting some other social scientist's work, he's using in-house research, which, incidentally is a larger, better joined, more carefully collected, and larger geographical grouping than what most people have.Even if you find him to be less enlightening than his blog (I don't use twitter)-as some mentioned- I would guess this long-form argument could not be divined from the constraints of that medium of communication. He would have to be even more brilliant than I think he is just from reading this book!! Maybe... the guy is a Harvard grad..... But in case I'm right, below are my notes....p. 14 - ""If Big Data's two running stories have been about surveillance and money, for the last three years I've been working on third: the human story."" ""...as a close second, they're demographers of an unprecedented reach."" P. 15 - He talks about the fact that his purpose is to generalize so he can do his job of bringing people together at scale (not with individual nonsensical exceptions as discussed by A LOT of the haters!). He's trying to understand and infer from the data. And his inference work is wonderful, presenting possible misinterpretations that were tested and reviewed. p. 46 - Actually this entire chapter of how they essentially created a series of studies to demonstrate that variation in attractiveness get you noticed as much as attractiveness does. Freakin' Brilliant!p. 47 - Did not know there was a name to it: ""the Pratfall Effect"" - ""As long as you're generally competent, making a small, occasional mistake makes people think you're more competent. Flaws call out good stuff all the more."" p. 48 - It's better to ""Purposely abandon the middle road."" p. 53 - Regarding NLP work on Twitter...I love the hypothesis that Twitter might be improving its users' writing. This is all amazing stuff as relates to transformations in human language and has application in ways that are ignored even today.""he calculated the typical world length in Hamlet (3.99) and in a collection of Wodehouse's stories (4.05)... both less than the length in his Twitter sample (4.80).""""Comparative linguistics have long traced groups of community through language."" p. 54 - The chart on changing characteristics of speech patterns. The idea being that tribe creation is no longer geographically constrained, AND ALSO, you can catch it in the language used... something that we were NEVER able to do in the past (think Chinese, Cantonese, Mandarin, and the 50+ other dialects). Super nerdy awesome point.p. 62 - ""Sitewide, the copy-and-paste, strategy underperforms the from-scratch messaging about 25%, but in terms of effort-in results-out - it always wins: measuring by replies received to compose a new message each time."" What an awesome thing to take look at. Intriguing when you think about marketing/scaled response composition. p. 82 - Confounders. This is a great way to present this material so often ignored or misunderstood in the field. Generally, this chapter does a great job presenting a series of charts with each of the appropriate analysis points you'd ask in a row. I did not need the written part, but I can see why he has it. I can also see why some who read via audiobooks struggled. It would be hard to understand this book if all you had was the audio.Chapter 7: The Beauty Myth - The whole way he presents it in the context of thinking about his daughter is great. The work that supports it is fantastic. On eating disorders, he describes a possible place to look for solutions to help others....p. 104 ""... but before the behavior was digitized, there was practically no way to get directly at this problem, at least not until visible damage had already occurred. There was only rumor - an ear at the bathroom door, perhaps a parent's sad suspicion.""Chapter 8: p. 106-107. He talks about how b/c people don't tell you their deepest thoughts, you had to really work hard (snoop, catch people unguarded, etc) to figure out what they thought. Then he talks about the truthfulness of search engines like Google. How the mechanism itself is far harder to trick. This is REALLY important to what we think of as the fundamental changes in the types of data we now are able to collect. Chapter 9: There were a number of criticisms I read that lead back to this chapter and I think it might just have been unclear how to read the charts as well to think about it. That's a fair point. I think what he's trying to say is even in words there is racial signaling on both sides. If we think about the words we use to attract others and identify tribe, in the context of dating it's super apparent. For me, then I think about how this relates to concepts like code-switching in the workplace. We focus a lot on the accent, and we know vocabulary matters. But this implies something far deeper. If you read each of the lists and you clearly identify with one group, it's likely, you are farther culturally from other groups than just skin color. This is quite profound on anyone working on things like ""How do we create a single human race without such aberrant division."" Word. p. 155 - If you care at all about gay rights, these stats are important and also very sad. If I've got him correct- and these are the footnotes, we're underestimating the gay population of the US by a lot and most are NOT dating b/c they are socially unable to do so, either because they are in the closet and scared to be themselves or there are structural reasons in their community that prevent them from self-expression. Chapter 12- Great segue into the work on migration, which covers not an only lifestyle choice but also works availability and more. This work is really relevant for - what is not mentioned, the dying cities phenomenon. p. 181 - He's arguing against things like Klout scores. This is why I do not understand the arguments that he doesn't want to drill in or he's missing some sort of causality.. he's not. This book is about what the general number are telling you out of various inferences that are possible.p. 184 - Mountain Dew Story. A great example of what not to crowdsource.p. 186 - ""If employers begin to use algorithms to infer how intelligent you are or whether you use drugs, then your only choice will be to game the system - or to borrow the wording from the previous chapter, 'manage your brand.' To beat the machine, you must act like a machine, which means you've lost to the machine. And that's assuming you can guess what you're supposed to do in the first place. Apparently, one of the strongest correlates to intelligence in the research was liking 'curly fries.' Who could reverse engineer that?p. 187 - very intersting comments on survellience and data use by the government. p. 193 - He talks about the pennies from personal data payments will not amount ot anything that actually helps people. Moreover, it is highly likely to just be passed back through to consumers."

I only got to 60% before the book was over and the notes began (and on a Kindle flipping back and forth is, for me, a pain). Also meat-wise, I was expecting something along the lines of Outlers, which of course this is the opposite of in theme since it looks at the trends of all and not the accomplishments of a few. But I wanted it to be a book I remembered long after. It's really not. Although it's an interesting read while you're in it. Big Data, when it matures, means so much info that will be longitudinal, something data analysts struggle with ever getting enough of, so in that sense this is very exciting, and it's amazing what we can tell already from the little we have.I do think the book suffered mightily by being read on a Kindle (or any e-reader, especially black and white). The graphs used red and it was not always easy to tell what was gray because it was red and what was gray because it was gray--or if anything was really gray. Since much of this book runs off the graphs, that it's a bad thing not to be able to fully read them (and at the size they were at on my Paperwhite, I also felt challenged to really dive in). I did love reading that the author was a disciple of sorts of Tufte. And I appreciated the amount of info given in the charts.I had a hard time getting through the first chapter. I think the author left out a primary reason male and female reactions to potential partners' age might change (or not) over time depending on gender--and normally I'd give him a break on this since it's from another field of study, but since he runs an online dating site and is reporting on that robust data set, then I'd expect him to understand the drives of men (be drawn to young and fertile no matter how old they get) and women (pick a good provider--until she reaches a certain age, realizes she is not going to need a provider (either because she does not have kids or because she provides just fine for herself), and then go for something young and fun). This behavior has been well documented and while I thought he was going to touch on it at one point, it really didn't happen enough for me to ever get that comfortable with the first example out of the gate. That said, I didn't have that issue with the rest of the book, so I did keep going and many of the sections were novel and interesting."
277,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24217018-matt,3,"This is a very quick read which, given the number of visuals, is not surprising. The visuals, though, are beautiful, always tell a story, and never waste a drop of ink on unnecessary information. These images reflect the book...for the most part. It's when the narrative steers away from its stated purpose (a data driven exploration of human nature) that I started to tire of Christian Rudders narrative voice. It's funny, irreverent, and insightful for most of the book and especially for the sections discussing OkCupid data. He writes best about the data he knows best and that's not surprising. But as the book advances Rudder starts to draw on unfamiliar datasets, make less rigorous assertions, and veer into both data fear-mongering and data evangelism. It was disappointing mostly because he promised to write a different kind of book than those which use data as a lens to prove the downfall of society or privacy, or predict incredible advances in technology and public intelligence. He asserts this book is special then proceeds to speculate about how invasive the NSA can be, how Twitter is unleashing our base instincts but also improving our vocabulary, and how online branding is the future of self evaluation. These parts were, in truth, boring compared to the insights about romantic relationship. In summary, I'm not sure where this book fits in the social science and statistics cannon. It's not the most insightful or the most fun, which leaves it somewhere in between and probably only worth picking up if you love the genre. "
278,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35538316-lindy,3,"I feel like I write this in every nonfiction book review, but I wished there was more depth! I also wished someone more, I don't know, anthropologically minded had given this book a once over before publication. For example, Rudder treats data showing that bisexual men are more likely to prefer/message other men on OkCupid when compared to older bisexual men as if it were longitudinal, and implies that bi men's sexual preferences change as they get older. However he does not take into account what these men may be doing off the service; a young bisexual man will probably hit on women at a bar, but is at a considerably greater risk of being decked in the face if he were to do so to men. As the dating pool grows smaller with age, he may turn to the internet to scope out both genders. (To be fair, Rudder  does responsibly account for a similar phenomenon showing that North Dakotans are surprisingly liberal when it comes to causual sex in the next chapter and why that isn't the case.) Likewise, Rudder says that ""yass,"" which turns up in a list of words distinctive of popular twitter users, is a contraction of ""your ass."" This is true, but it's definitely not the most popular use. Nonetheless, Dataclysm is an interesting and accessible book, and I imagine it would be especially so to someone with no background in statistics. I appreciated that the author had a sense of humor, and I don't think (reading in 2017) that it has aged poorly, although it would have been helpful if Rudder had cited years in the text rather than simply ""last year."""
279,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33131867-neha,3,"I had seen a significant portion of the material before on the blog, but it's still worth a read. I loved the informal voice, and the use of various graphs to illustrate new findings. It read like a collection of smaller articles with specific results.A lot of the OkCupid data revealed particular preferences of men and women in terms of age, attractiveness, and ethnicity. I can understand why the overall findings may be upsetting, and I think readers should be cautious about how this actually applies to their lives. This book is not trying to give insider tips for finding more dates. I think it's very important to remember that there is an inherent selection bias in the OkCupid data: it only represents people who have, for one reason or another, decided to try online dating.I thought the book was going to be more about OkCupid's dataset, but I appreciated the discussions about Google, Facebook, and Twitter data. The last chapter describes the ongoing conflict of privacy that is absent from earlier chapters. While giving users complete ownership of their data may seem to solve many problems, I tend to disagree that it's entirely possible. Services can certainly provide an option for users to remove their data from the site, but once data is on the Internet, I think it's safe to assume that it will never fully disappear."
280,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11500849-jen,1,"A sloppy and irresponsible introduction to big data analytics. Taking a popular science approach, the book glosses over key tenets of every day data science, like basic hypothesis testing. It also makes grand, sweeping generalizations about society as a whole where none can be made based on the population of the data (OK Cupid members hardly represent a random sampling of the US population).Some of the more egregious statements include ""There are times when a data set is so robust that if you set up your analysis right, you don't need to ask questions - it just tells you everything anyway"" and ""people are already compensated for their data: They get to use services like Facebook and Google...for free.""Putting the author's disregard of personal privacy aside, the narrative voice is filled with white male privilege. A few sections of the book made me generally uncomfortable in its approach to conversations about race, gender, and heterosexual relationships. We need a book about data science that highlights the process in a way that digital users can understand how their data is being analyzed and who is doing it responsibly. This is not it."
281,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1492668-mark,3,"You are concerned that the NSA is aggregating data and spying on you? If you check, or look at a picture of the NSA (Why does an office building need a radar dome on the roof?), you will see that has always been their job. But while you are worrying about that, you are telling scores of commercial data aggregators everything about yourself, just by what you search for on Google, what you like on Facebook and where you access the internet from. Your sex, your race, your sexual orientation, your income, your politics, your IQ (from the type of French fries you like), it's all an open book. This book is the story from one involved nerd, along with some nice graphics.People's activities are somewhat limited, so the use of this data is mostly to target you for repression or elimination in a repressive society, to sell you something in a capitalist society, or for law enforcement to find you. So if you're only getting targeted Amazon ads, be happy.Of course, I can only imagine what the data will be used for after Skynet becomes active."
282,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/140018-kyle,2,"Readable, with nice diagrams, this is a hard book to hate. It is easy to be irritated by it, however. The basis of the book is a dozen or so interesting statistical points, with a chapter of conversational description for each. I'm curious where these statistical insights actually come from. Did the author pore over data for months? It doesn't feel that way. They have the feeling of nuggets gleaned from interns working over a period of years, that never ended up being useful anywhere else. Certainly, the discussion the author offers almost no isights beyond the immediately obvious. It isn't clear enough to be a good introduction to statistics, nor in-depth enough to offer interest to statisticians.The best chapters are the early ones oriented towards anyone trying to game the system a little on dating sites. How long message should be, what the opposite sex is looking for for someone your age, etc. The later chapters, trying to offer larger insights about culture and language are ... not convincing. Problematic, even."
283,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78503-chris,3,"This book has some great perspective on human behavior derived from data sets culled from many websites. It celebrates the fact that the amount of data that we have on people's actual beliefs and desires (as opposed to their stated beliefs) and breaks down what a lot of these data sets mean. A lot of it is very funny, even while it may be disturbing in its implications.For the first two-thirds, it was really interesting to me and had a lot of, if not surprising, at least very relevant things to say about human behaviors.The last third kind of drifted off into parts of the data that I am not too concerned with personally and the author's thoughts on what the future will be. It is not necessarily bad, just not what I was looking for, and also, a bit more broad than the particulars of the earlier chapters. "
284,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63344080-lucas,4,"This book offers a new look at old questions. Race, identity and the many differences between women and men in their approach to sex and relationship are shown here through data from an online dating website (OkCupid). I think the book presents valuable insights about racism because it observes actually behavior rather than self-reported questions.Some of the interesting book's find is the following:* Both black men and black women are strongly rejected in online dating* The women who received more attention of men aren't the more beautiful but those who have the high variance in their ratings (men can't say if they are beautiful or not).* Most people (~90%) who declare themselves bisexual is indeed heterosexual or homosexual.* Straight women are less propense to search only casual sex in online datingA negative thing is that the book contains a lot of digressions."

The possibilities of big data seem scary and exciting at the same time. This book presents them in a very accessible way to the average reader. I was skeptical of some the conclusions that the author presented but there's a lot of good conversation starters here. However, I don't think much of it will stick with me in the long run.I probably didn't make the best choice by listening to this on audiobook where numbers in charts were read out for minutes hahaOverall, a short, enjoyable, and timely read if you want to delve into popular science books."

Note sure whether the lack of mathematical analysis is a blessing or not - I guess that would depend on how capable the writer is - but much of the content, while interesting is a ""firm grasp of the obvious."""

This was a highly enjoyable-to-read, interesting-to-think-about, pop-data/analytics book. I appreciated the author's voice and sense of humor, but he often ventured into preachy territory. For someone to write so extensively on data that illuminates our biases, I wish he could have taken more care to hide his own."

289,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8886042-michelle,2,"Dataclysm: Who We Are When We Think No One's Looking by Christian Rudder is an interesting and fact filled book. I received an Advance Reader's Copy from Crown Publishing, a division of Random House and my opinions were formed by my reading of this uncorrected proof. Author Christian Rudder is one of the founders of the dating website OKCupid and he draws his research for this book primarily from the data that has been collected from paying members who are looking for relationships. He additionally mines data from other social media resources, dating services like Match.com and websites, and his pool of subjects include a cross section of the population that he believes is an excellent barometer for the opinions of Americans today. This book is filled with charts and maps and images to help you easily understand the data he has sourced and how it applies to the ""everyman"" in all of us.This book approaches a wide variety of topics - relationships, personal preferences, age, gender, race and upbringing and tries to answer the question ""Who are we really?"" by examining what we say versus how we act. Although I felt like I came away with a bunch of quotable tidbits and an interesting peek into how the data that we so freely place on the internet is used, I'm not quite sure that I learned very much about myself from this book. Many of the observances seemed rational to me and not all that thought provoking, and although some applied to me I didn't walk away feeling like I had much personal insight. A few of the passages left me feeling uneasy, simply because I'm not sure all the members of OKCupid were willing test subjects in Mr. Rudder's data laboratory. In one memorable instance photos of users were shown in an illustration of women who had very high and very low scores from fellow users in terms of their appeal. Although he was using them to make a point about the importance of having a photo that provokes a strong reaction is better than having a commonly pretty picture (which he describes as ""meh"") and he expressly thanks the subjects for their consent to be included in the book and to have their photos discussed, it still felt mildly squicky. Although the many other charts and illustrations in the book didn't deal in this same very personal representation of data, I did question the author's use of the OKCupid site at times. Although it may all be perfectly legal it makes me ask ""do I need to know this?"" and ""is the use of this data justified in a bigger, insight gaining way that makes it important to a reader?"" I'm not sure I have the answer to those questions.  As a collection of facts and data there were definitely a few things I hadn't thought about before - for example, there is a chart showing the 100 most common words used in the English language today from the Oxford English Corpus (a collection of modern writing's approach to vocabulary and word use) versus the top 100 used to express yourself on Twitter in the form of the service's 140 character tweet posts. It showed that although you may think the language of Twitter would somewhat abbreviate or diminish your ideas to get your point across, actually a person composing a tweet is much more selective and thoughtful about what their words will convey. It may help us to write clearer and in a concise style that contributes to an overall awareness of language. That awareness filters into the speech and style of a Twitter user versus a non-user. I liked the idea that my tweeting may help me generate a better and more vivid use of language. Still I kept returning to the fact that this book didn't really live up to the ""portrait of our essential selves"" claim that it was intended to be. It isn't a bad book. I just wish that I had a greater takeaway as a reader.One thing that truly irked me about this book is the mention of a website link where you could go, punch in your own data (two Facebook usernames) and get a personal illustration to see one of the ideas in this book in action. In the fourth chapter titled ""You Gotta be the Glue"" there is an illustration showing the overlap of the author's Facebook friends and his wife's friend's. He explains in depth how we create clusters of people in our lives that know us from a specific point of view - our work friends, childhood acquaintances, family members etc. Our spouse or significant other can overlap our Facebook friendships in many categories. Perhaps you are both friends with your parents and share relationships with other couples you met while you both attended a ballroom dance lesson. The shared connections can illustrate the bonds we have as couples, and can show you the places in your relationships that have a strong and meaningful connection. I thought this sounded really cool and was happy to find an example that could be personalized to me and allowed me to be a willing participant in the experiment to see how it felt. Unfortunately this awesome personalized tool simply doesn't exist. I have tried the link dozens of times over the past few weeks and didn't post my thoughts on the book since I wanted to see this chart in action, but it still gives me a ""Page Not Found"" message. The book's publication date is set for Tuesday September 9th, and since this is Saturday the 6th I would think that it would be active. I hope it will go live on Tuesday at the very least. I contacted the author through his Twitter page about the lack of a working link and received no response, however another reviewer on Goodreads said that when they contacted him through email they received a response that it would be functional by the end of August. If I had paid for this book rather than receiving an ARC I would be even more disappointed. The one big opportunity to gain personal insight is so far, a bust.If you find the sort of data in this book interesting I would check it out of the library or wait for the book to be marked down. I wouldn't consider it a must read but I am thankful I had the opportunity to read it. I hope you find this useful information, and I will update my opinion if the link works on the publication date. For now I can only give this book 2 of 5 stars. "
290,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5177572-genevieve,4,"* Originally reviewed on the Night Owls Press blog here. *First, it was the Internet. The Internet was going to change how businesses and organized operated. It was going to change how people live. But now something else has enthralled our imagination: big data.What is big data? We couldn't have big data without the Web. Our shift to online activity has made it easier to record and document massive reams of data and data trails about seemingly everything: Where do we go when we're online? What do we do? What do we read? The idea behind big data is that scientists can analyze that activity and parse out that information, information that might predict what we would do in hypothetical situations, or what we would be likely to do in the future. This largely possible because of scale. It's not about analyzing a person, a hundred people, or a thousand people; it's about waves and waves of information, millions and millions of data points.Think about how far we've come. In the third century BC, the first great repository of human knowledge was the Library of Alexandria. Today information is available in the exabytes. (What is an exabyte? Um...it's really, really big.) Big data is about size, but it's more than that. It's the fact that we have computers and databases that will log and analyze micro-activities, actions as simple as Facebook ""likes,"" our location recorded by the GPS in our phones, and the ""number of seconds or minutes spent reading a web page.""Dataclysm Who We Are When We Think No One's Looking by Christian Rudder sheds light on what that kind of datafication looks like. Rudder himself is the cofounder of OkCupid, the online dating site, which lives and breathes on seemingly mystical algorithms that dice and chop up streams of data. No other person might be more qualified to give us an insider's account on what big data can do.Rudder dabbles in statistical, psychological, and sociological theories and drills the chapters with clever infographics and beautifully rendered scatterplots—and some of them are truly works of art. (I used to work in data so I have a soft spot for data scientists and their work.) But where Rudder really excels is in the smorgasbord of findings. Patterns emerge from the data. Stare into the matrix and you'll see...a mirror into your very soul. At least that's what Rudder wants us to believe.You might be put off by Rudder's focus on dating sites but that's his métier. The trove of information on social interactions alone on dating sites is weirdly fascinating. In one example, Rudder finds that dating profiles of women who have a polarizing physical appearance are more likely to be approached for dates than the conventionally attractive person. (Is it fascination with novelty? boredom with the same 'ole, same 'ole?) Aren't we all at our most earnest and neurotic when it comes to love and relationships?A downside of this book is that if you read or pay attention to the tech news cycle, you may find some of Rudder's examples ho-hum repeats. For example, we've seen Google Trends tackle the flu in a kind of digital epidemiology approach. Nothing new there. Rudder retells these stories not to just fill the pages though but to constantly keep the beat of this book, which is asking deeper questions about who are we as a culture?Another downside is that even with all the reams of data and stats Rudder throws at us, ultimately, these are just cool factoids. It's an impressive avalanche of interesting data tidbits, but still just tidbits. The next challenge for big data: figuring out what truly matters, narrowing it down, cutting the noise.The heart of what makes big data interesting is that it's research that isn't gathered merely from surveys or interviews or even randomized control trial experiments, which we all know can be biased for a variety of reasons: subjects don't understand the questions, subjects lie, people obfuscate, they unconsciously modify their behavior to please researchers. Here the data is based on actual behavior in situ. And we can learn something from it, we can see patterns and discern behaviors that were otherwise invisible. It's like studying people in the wild.Most books about data are dry and boring, but Dataclysm is one that makes a mark. Part of this is Rudder staying grounded in primary data and real analysis. But an even bigger part is Rudder's never-stale writing style. Yes, the book is still pop-social science. This might frustrate a few bona fide data scientists out there. But Dataclysm works. The amusing stories and asides sprinkled throughout the book are full of zest but are never fluffy. For a numbers person, a Harvard-honed math-y guy working in Silicon Valley, Dataclysm is a remarkably fluid and readable book.Big data isn't the answer to the universe, the meaning of life, or to your other burning existential questions, but you'll still become privy to some interesting discoveries about culture and society.[Disclaimer: I received this book from Blogging for Books for an honest and candid review.] "

292,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16880570-khari,1,"Three months.Three months to listen to a book seven and a half hours long. Normally I can get one of those out in a week. Nope. Three months.I'm really tired of these books with fascinating titles that just disappoint.This book made me understand why people shout 'Science' at each other. It's because authors like this either underestimate their audience and dumb down what they have done, or they have terrible methodologies themselves and don't even realize it.For a book about data which necessarily must include statistics, there is a shocking dearth of statistic lingo in this book. He tries to justify himself in the end. His intention was to write a popular science book and he didn't want to clutter it with jargon like 'p', and 'confidence interval' and fun stuff like that. And, hey, I get it. I don't completely understand statistics yet, but even I know that words like 'significant' have a particular meaning that has to be defined in the world of numbers, but he never defines his terms. He says the methodology he used was 'rigorous' and it went through something 'like peer review' but never defines what his methodology was, and his 'peer review' was for his underling (who he knew btw) to check his numbers. That's not peer review. Hate to break it to you. Peer review is done by someone who does not know who wrote the paper, and they look over the whole paper, including the hypotheses and the conclusions as well as the number. It's not someone whose job is in your hands checking your math. But I know why he chose to do it this way. It's because there is no way on this planet that this atrocity would have ever been published in a good scientific journal....wait...let me rephrase that. Considering that there have been cases of complete hoax papers being published it is remotely possible that it could have been published in a badly edited, badly curated, motivated reasoning filled journal. Because that's what this was. Badly edited, badly curated, filled with motivated reasoning, and worst of all, terrible methodology that is never explained. This book couldn't hack it in the scientific publishing world so he had to go to a subsidiary of Penguin, Crown Publishing, that focuses on hobbies, memoirs, biographies, autobiographies, cooking, lifestyle, business and nonfiction. And honestly, that makes a ton of sense, because this reads more like a memoir than a book of scientific rigor. He makes unfounded claims, presents his interpretation as fact, and only considers one explanation for everything that he finds interesting.The part that absolutely killed me was he is talking about corpus linguistics. Corpus linguistics is gathering really large bodies of texts and making it searchable. There are a bunch of free ones out there, such as the Corpus of Contemporary American English (affectionately known as COCA), for your perusal. They have a bunch of ways of analyzing, you can look at the most used words, you can look at the collocations (the words immediately preceding and following a word), you can look at the word families that are used, the lexemes that are used, the type of word that most appears, the contexts in which words appear, which is a really good way to find out what a word actually means in use, in contrast to how it is defined in the dictionary. Corpus linguistics just happens to be my baby. It was my focus in my master's program and it's my focus in my PHD program. And guess what? I know nothing about it. I've already spent three years learning about it, and I'm going to go spend another 2-6, and I've read peer-reviewed articles about it, talked to experts, and read books about it, and I still know nothing, but I know enough to know that how he's using it is mind bogglingly bogus. He basically does character counting. He counts how many words show up in a tweet, calculates the mean character length, then compares it to the mean character length in Shakespeare and concludes that since the mean character length in tweets is longer, people today are using language in a more nuanced way than Shakespeare was....mean character length. Or his other technique was to make a word list of the most used words and show that it was similar to Shakespeare because 'the' and 'a' appeared at the top. No duh Sherlock, they're function words. They happen to be required every time you are referring to a singular noun. They would show up at the top of the word list of this review as well and that would mean nothing about the similarity between reviews and tweets. They are different registers who both follow the rules of the English language, ergo, functional words such as articles and pronouns and prepositions would occur more often simply because they are closed classes that are requisite for forming phrases that make sense.So there you go, a very brief, cogent rebuttal for one of his most important methods of analysis. But that rebuttal is actually rebutting his intention, not what he actually did. What he actually did was include, on his erstwhile 'word' list, things like 'the', 'a', ''s', 'Peru' 'my blue eyes', 'tall for an Asian', etc. .........How, in the name of all that is grounded in the study of linguistics, can those things be defined as 'words'?!?!? What definition is he using?!? He isn't using one! He's just conglomerating everything that he finds interesting together and calling it a 'word' while not even recognizing that what he finds interesting is subjective! It's not a parameter by which to define something! At first I was like, huh, is he using morphemes as the basis of his 'word'? ""'s"" would be the the third person possessive morpheme, I can see that, after all 'the' 'a' and 'Peru' are all single morpheme words. But then you have 'my blue eyes' that's not a word, that's a phrase! All of the words in that phrase aren't even single morpheme words! So why on earth does the third person possessive deserve its own place of glory but the plural 's' does not!?!This is the problem with popular 'science' books. People read them, feel like they are now informed and use the same arguments that they read about without ever realizing that the books aren't science. There is no scientific method in this book. He never defines his terms, he barely defines his variables. He has a million variables, and doesn't distinguish between them. It's not an experimental study so it's fine that he doesn't have a control group, but he should be trying to make the groups that he is splitting people into as uniform as possible and he doesn't even really attempt it. His variables are men and women, black, white, Asian, and Hispanic. He never even limited his findings to people from the USA. He just assumed that everyone was. He never factored in educational status which would have a huge impact, and that information actually is in the data set, so he could have, but he didn't. He didn't even mention it as a confound! And that's just the point. Everything is a conclusion for him. He argued that there are certain topics that are anathema to certain groups because the word denoting that topic only appears once. No. It does not mean that they are anathema to that group. I can think of a dozen reasons why someone would choose not to put something that they are interested in onto a public forum. I am pretty sure that an Otolaryngologist is not going to put that as their profession on OKCupid, simply because most people don't know what that means, they are just going to go with 'doctor' because it's simpler and gets the point across. That doesn't mean that otolarynogology is a taboo subject because it's only mentioned once. And besides, the fact that it is mentioned at all is already proof positive that it is not a taboo subject, taboo subjects are epitomized by never being mentioned at all and referred to circularly. So why didn't he mention all the other terms that are never mentioned, like muons and antileptons? (No, I don't know what those are either). The self-introductions on OKCupid (which is what he studied) are texts designed to elicit a certain response. They are a specific register, a register that each writer assumes will be the most likely to get them what they want, a date. As such they are inherently not generalizable to populations as a whole. They are only generalizable as 'the words that people use to try and present themselves as a satisfactory date'. There is a purpose behind it and it shows only a very small subset of language use, taking it to mean that it epitomizes someone's character and identity is horrifying. People change how they talk constantly. They talk differently when they write as compared to when they speak. They talk differently depending on if they know their audience or not. They talk differently depending on the power dynamics of the situation. They talk differently depending on how they are feeling at the moment. Studying the language used in self-introductory texts on OKCupid is very interesting and a worthwhile subject in and of itself, but you cannot generalize out to the public. The people on OKCupid are not a random selection of people, they are self-selected to be rather outgoing, not so privacy concerned, not willing to spend their money on web-dating, mostly singly people who are interested in romantic liaisons. They are, according to his own admission of the data, mostly liberal and progressive, mostly college educated, those account for 31% and 34% of the US population respectively. That is not even broken down by sex or race, if I were to spend the time doing that it would show an even smaller portion of the population for each, you can't generalize out to everyone else in the US based on a sub population. That would be like saying 50% of the population of the US are women, and women generally score higher in compassion, therefore the US is a compassionate nation...what? That doesn't even make sense.Finally, the thing that really just made me crack up was when he said ""and I say this as someone who is reflexively critical of the left."" That made me die. Why, why did that make me die? Because it doesn't mean what you think it means. It doesn't mean that he automatically looks at what people on the left say critically. It doesn't mean that his automatic response is to be skeptical. It means to embrace your subjective understandings of reality as a basis for analyzing social interactions. Being reflexively critical is a tenet of feminist post-structuralist analysis, or you could also argue that it is a postmodern, post-Marxist analysis as well. Regardless of who you decide is the ultimate progenitor of such an idea, it remains an ideology of the left. By using it he showed that he was on the left. By trying to present himself as a balanced and disinterested analyzer he showed himself to be controlled by a particular worldview."

I thought it was fun and simple enough for the layman, but not simple to the point that it's lying about the capacity of what big data can do (as an example, I deal with a lot of research participants who do not have an email or do not use their email often). I really appreciated him talking about the limitations, as well as some qualitative methods and how they can be used. The whole point of all this is to see how our private, online behavior is actually a great insight into the human condition. Like how the rate of gay porn consumption is the same across every state, and what factors are important to each racial group. I know I made this sound super boring but it isn't. "

You might not even be too surprised, if they started to learn what music people probably like, by the way they dress, speak, or act (although it would be impressive). But, what if they had hundreds of thousands, or tens of millions of customers a day? How much would they learn about what music people like, if they could somehow deal with that many customers a day?What if, instead of a music store, people came to your store to find something more personal, like a girlfriend or boyfriend?Welcome to the book Dataclysm, where one of the founders of the website OkCupid shows us just what every website you ever use is able to tell about you. That's slightly an exaggeration, of course; dating websites do get a view of us that is a little different than most. But then, Amazon sees you when you put your money where your mouth is. Google sees what you're trying to find, or find out about, or where you're finding directions to. Facebook, of course, probably knows who your real friends are better than what you are willing to admit out loud.If you get creeped out easily by the loss of secrecy (otherwise known as ""privacy"", when it's secrecy that we like) that comes from using the Internet, this is probably not the book for you.However, if you like to leaven your opinions about topics like race (and racism) and sex (and sexism) with some actual data (not just your own personal experience), this book is a revelation. Here is a more or less randomly picked sampling of what you get in this book, not just presented as an assertion, but backed up with mountains of data:1) racism against blacks in America is not just real and enduring, but is equally rampant among Asians and Hispanic Americans as among Anglos2) Asian-Americans on dating sites use a uniquely low number of misspelled words compared to all other ethnicities3) men do not give up trying to date that 20-year old woman until they are over 30, whereas the man who looks best to a 20-year old woman is likely to be around 234) men do not give up trying to date that 30-year old woman until they are over 40, whereas the man who looks best to a 30-year old woman is likely to be around 305) of self-identified straight women on OkCupid, 26% said they had a sexual encounter with a woman, and enjoyed it (more than 3 times the analogous percentage of self-identified straight men)6) by just looking at your ""likes"" on Facebook, you can determine with 60% accuracy whether or not someone is the child of parents who got divorced before they turned 21 (this was in 2012, and the algorithms have probably gotten only better since then)7) women who get a lot of 1's and 5's (out of 5) on their picture, are more likely to get messaged, than women who get a lot of 3's, even though the average opinion of their looks is the sameIf you are online, there are servers (computers that serve up websites to your desktop, laptop, or smartphone) which know quite a lot about you and the others in the society you live in. The people you really don't want to have this kind of information, already have it. The only question is, will you? If knowledge is power, then right now there is a profound imbalance of power being created by this much data. Christian Rudder has done us the favor of showing us what he has (aggregated, of course, so that no individual is identifiable). Take a look."
295,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4579658-rob-kitchin,2,"The stated aim of Dataclysm is to introduce lay readers to the era of big data, the possibilities of such data, and the types of analysis used to make sense of them. The problems with the book start with the title and subtitle, neither of which, I think, make much sense. Dataclysm, Rudder explains, is a play on cataclysm: the wiping away of one era to be replaced by a new one. However, big data is set to complement small data, not wipe them away as small data are generated to answer specific questions rather than being a by-product that is then repurposed, and most big data are held by private corporations or government and are not readily open to researchers. All of the data that Rudder analyzes is from social media; they are data produced precisely because we think someone is looking (for a date, for conversation, for information, to provoke a reaction, etc). Uploading information to the internet is largely a process of the presentation of the self, as Goffman’s famous theory would frame the activity. Even if other people cannot see the answers to direct questions, as when filling in questions on a dating site, the answers shape the user profile and the process of matching -- something that users are aware of, consider and present to.The book then proceeds by discussing social media data and what they might reveal about human behaviour and society. Crucially, however, there is no systematic discussion of big data per se, its forms and characteristics, no discussion of data analytics, and only a cursory discussion of the many ethical, social and political implications of such data. There is no discussion of statistics, or statistical tests performed on the data presented, nor data mining, data analytics, machine learning, pattern recognition, profiling, prediction, etc. The irony here is that Rudder’s company – OkCupid – employs these techniques to be able to process and match potential partners, yet he never explains how this is achieved. Instead, the entire analysis is rooted in the empiricist form of data science, rather than data-driven science, and never proceeds beyond description. As such, the analysis of gender and race he presents are based on a ‘letting the data speak for themself’ approach and constitutes armchair interpretation. He barely engages with the vast academic literature on quantitative analysis of race and gender that has taken place for several decades using large data sets such as the census or public administration data. Rudder has access to an enormous set of very interesting data that could be used to conduct some fascinating sociological and psychological analysis. Instead what we get are a series of descriptive statistics and banal revelations, most of which are already well established. The result is a book that hints at the potential of big data and data science but undersells it substantially, and it under-estimates in my view the readership level of its potential audience by never progressing beyond mathematics and data visualisations used in junior school. In contrast, books such as The Signal and the Noise by Nate Silver provide a much wider and deeper discussion. This is a shame as Rudder is an engaging writer and he has privileged access to an extremely rich social data that could be used to conduct some wonderful and sophisticated social science research. Such rich research and its policy implications are barely hinted at."
296,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8684527-andra-n,5,"I postponed reading Dataclysm for some time, but I’m glad I took my time to read it. Its author, Christian Rudder first caught my attention in an article written after the Facebook scandal over the experiments made over its users, where he explained in a rather unapologetic manner, that this is the very nature of internet’s success and efficiency increase. His opinion is a consequence of his experience running the dating site OkCupid where decisions based on people’s behavior must be made in order to obtain optimal results. “It’s a delicate illusion, the Internet.”Dataclysm is a book about Big Data and Romantic behavior. However, it is definitely not a recipe for making a perfect profile or having more success on social networks. This book is rather a series of conclusions drawn from the aggregated data obtained from millions of interactions mainly from sites like OkCupid and other social networks or Google. This is not the story of the individual, it is the story of the collective. What distinguishes the work of Christian Rudder is that given his privileged position at OKCupid, he had in hand large amounts of data with which he could play and analyze freely. As opposed to other studies of human behavior that have as subjects mostly a bunch of students from well-known universities, his data sets contain personal information of people of all ages and races, from the US. This book has lots of pop-culture references, amusing and sometimes insightful comments. What is most intriguing about his studies is the fact that they are made over information that we rather think it is private. We get a glimpse of our rather politically incorrect behaviors as human beings.I found particularly interesting the comparison between woman preferences and man preferences when it comes to a potential partner’s age, attractiveness and race. Humor is not left out of the book, as the paragraph depicting women ratings of attractiveness of men: “Only one guy in six is “above average” in an absolute sense. Sex appeal isn’t something commonly quantified like this, so let me put it in a more familiar context: translate this plot to IQ, and you have a world where the women think 58 percent of men are brain damaged.”The comparison of words most commonly used by people on their dating profiles from different races or sexual orientation was also a chapter that I found quite interesting. The author shows via text analysis that several race related patterns emerge. “White people differentiate themselves mostly by their hair and eyes, Asians by their country of origin, Latinos by their music. But because of the way the math is set up, the three non-white lists are evidence of cultures that I, as a white man, am not supposed to know…the gay male list is very different from the other three. It’s full of pop culture and has comparatively few references to the user’s immediate person and family.”I would definitely recommend this book that tackles a wide range of topics to anyone who is interested in data science as well as those curious about the weirdness of human nature."
297,0385347375,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18688-cody,4,"Much e-ink has been spilled--rightfully so--about the brave new world we live online. Targeted advertising, data breaches, the NSA; it’s easy to grow overwhelmed by the potential dangers of sharing personal information electronically. Practically everything we do on our phones and computers is tracked, often in an effort to sell us something or gain some upper hand (financially, politically, socially, etc.). Consequentially, there is now an unprecedented amount of detailed data about us that's ripe for the parsing.Beyond the obvious advantages for market research, is there a benefit to all of this data? Christian Rudder, co-founder of the online dating site OkCupid, thinks so. He’s been approaching the internet over the past decade as one big sociological experiment, and his new book, Dataclysm: Who We Are (When We Think No One’s Looking), explores his findings in depth, some of which are rather mind blowing.Penned in clear and witty prose and full of colorful charts and graphs, Dataclysm breezes by, though many of the insights linger, obsess, and often unsettle. We learn that if you apply network analysis to a couple’s groups of friends on Facebook, you can quite accurately predict how likely they are to stay together. And that Google searches beginning with the phrase “Is my husband…” most commonly end with “gay?” And that women tend to find men who are close to their age as the most attractive, whereas men, up until 50 years old, generally think that women in their early 20s look the best.Even in cases where the results reinforce long held views, what is new, Rudder asserts, “is our ability to test ideas, established ones, famous ones even, against the atomized actions of millions.” But the implications go beyond the sheer volume of the numbers. The ability we now have to track Google searches and site clicks provides us with much more accurate data, as these behaviors transcend the murkier self-reporting that plagues more traditional surveys, especially in regards to controversial topics. Rudder argues that the insights gleaned from all of this new data, even when the results are unflattering, are too beneficial to pass up, as they give us a far clearer and more accurate portrait of our true interests and behaviors.As Rudder frequently admits, the internet is still very young, which means that these data sets lack a long view. What Dataclysm does offer us, though, is another angle from which to consider our online lives. Whether you find the book’s content and approaches revelatory or creepy (at times I found them both), the results are fascinating and the ramifications huge. It reminds us that, as a sociological opportunity, we’re in the midst of a monumental sea change--one that is granting us astoundingly far-reaching insight into who we really are."

I felt like I read this constantly having to pick my jaw up off the floor, but that it had no major takeaways: we are all more racist than we think. We are all giving away so much information about ourselves each day that it's nearly unfathomable. We are all not nearly as unique and interesting as we think we are.
