0,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45941903-lou,4,"Humans is a book you will learn lots of new information from, and not only that but what you do learn is interesting and engaging, albeit a little depressing. To create a contrast between the darkness of most of what we are told, Phillips adds humour which lightens the mood somewhat. The style of writing is eminently readable and flows smoothly from one point to the next without trouble. This is such original non-fiction, and it appears the author has carried out extensive research to find these unique stories that I have not encountered in any other books previous to this. Each of the stories are varied and intriguing enough that I am still thinking about some of them, even long after I turned the final page. They range from stories about the fails of our earliest ancestors right through to ones we are currently making right now! Well worth picking up, especially for history buffs and those who enjoy factually correct stories that teach us valuable lessons about how fallible we really are as a species. However, whether we learn from them or not is a different matter entirely and as this book illustrates, it's not always as easy or black and white as it seems.Many thanks to Wildfire for an ARC. I was not required to post a review, and all thoughts and opinions expressed are my own."

2,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma,4,"For all that the humour provides the bulk of the content here, and is very enjoyable in itself, the real value of the book is in the bits where Phillips gets a bit more serious. There's some very pointed commentary on the kinds of things we just can't seem to learn and reading it in today's political climate gives these repeated failures an extra kick. However, I leave the book wondering whether the whole 'it's not just us' makes me feel better or worse. How a book can be so funny and so profoundly depressing, I don't know...My thanks to the best kind of friend, the lovely TS, who bought me this book, instinctively understanding how much I would enjoy both the history AND the ranting. Good call."
3,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"Did you have a bad day? Read this book. It will give you a multitude of examples, large and small, of people fucking it up a lot worse than you. At the same time that is absolutely horrifying, exemplifying time and again our incapability of learning from past mistakes, it is also entertaining and educational. A rare combination.As an example of the list ""fuck ups I have never heard about"" is Mao Zedong's Fours Pests campaign. ""The most disastrous entirely successful public health policy ever"". The Chinese dictator decided that mosquitoes, rats, flies and sparrows to this list. He figured that sparrows ate grain and that that without sparrows ""60000 extra people could be fed for every millions sparrows that were eliminated"". A billion sparrows died. Locusts came at the harvests. Sparrows weren't eating grain as much as pests. This caused a famine that killed between 15 and 30 million people. ""You'd hope that the basic lesson of this - don't fuck with nature unless you're very, very certain what the consequences will be, and even then it's probably still not a good idea - would have stuck. But that seems unlikely. In 2004, the Chinese government ordered the mass extermination of mammals from civet cats to badgers in response to the outbreak of the SARS virus, suggesting that humans' capacity for learning from their mistakes remains as tenuous as ever.""Don't worry, people from all walks of life get a bashing in this book. It's definitely readable and no matter how much else you've covered on the subject, you're likely to find something new here. And if you have a shitty day, you can take comfort in the fact that you did not invent leaded gasoline or freon and kill millions by pollution and further with increased radiation through the ozone hole. That was just the one guy by the way, Thomas Midgley Jr. If your looking for hope, well, I'm not sure this is the book to read. However, to be able to do anything about the current state of the world you really need to know how incredibly large our capacity for screwing things up really is, in order to be able to circumvent some of it."

The story of human progress starts with our capacity for thinking and creativity. That's what sets humans apart from other animals – and it's also what leads us to make complete tits of ourselves on a regular basis.
Author Tom Phillips studied Archaeology, Anthropology and the History and Philosophy of Science at Cambridge University and has worked as a journalist, a humour writer, and as the editorial director of BuzzFeed UK. All of these skills and influences are apparent in Humans: A Brief History of How We F*cked It All Up, and if you're the kind of reader who thinks you might enjoy a chronology of humanity's biggest mistakes, told with ironic humour and f-bombs, then this pop-history just might be a perfect fit for you. As for me, the humour here didn't actually make me laugh out loud, I was familiar with many of the stories, and I'd prefer more of a connecting thesis than, “Humans are stupid and selfish and always have been; probably always will be”. Still, Humans is very readable – an ultralight version of Jared Diamond or Yuval Noah Harari – and it's always the right time to stand humble before humanity's many flaws. To begin, an example of the humour:Australia's rabbit problem is one of the most famous examples of something that we've only figured out quite late in the day: ecosystems are ridiculously complex things and you mess with them at your peril. Animals and plants will not simply play by your rules when you casually decide to move them from one place to another. “Life,” as a great philosopher once said, “breaks free; it expands to new territories and crashes through barriers – painfully, maybe even dangerously. But, uh, well, there it is.” (Okay, it was Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park who said that. As I say, a great philosopher.)(And incidentally, this scourge of rabbits [and cane toads] unleashed on Australia is also an example of the kind of story most people have heard before; if the tone in a nonfiction work isn't academic, isn't attempting to support some new theory with long-accepted facts, I think all of the information should at least be new and surprising.) Humans is divided into chapters on our brains (going over confirmation bias, the Dunning-Kruger effect, and other ways that we convince ourselves we're right when we're wrong), the mistakes of the Agricultural Revolution and the domestication/resettling of animals, the rise of leaders (and all the horrible ways they have taken advantage of their positions, no matter the political system), the evils of colonisation and war, mistakes of diplomacy, and the unintended consequences of technological breakthroughs. Along the way, there were many stories that were new to me – Scotland's attempt to build an empire in Panama, Kessler syndrome (that could see us “trapped on our planet by a prison we've made from our own trash”), or the avoidable decimation of the Khwarezmian Empire – and I liked these bits very much; the brand of humour didn't speak to me but Phillips is an excellent storyteller.If there was a theme running through this book, it would be throwing shade at Donald Trump without ever once mentioning him. One chapter is titled “A Dummies' and/or Current Presidents' Guide to Diplomacy”, a parenthetical note in the prologue states, “at the time of writing this, there's a broad awareness that the only thing that stands between us and annihilation is the whim of one petulant man-child or another”, and after a passage that outlines how “Hitler was actually an incompetent, lazy egomaniac and his government was an absolute clownshow”, Phillips concludes:  
Many of the worst man-made events that ever occurred were not the product of evil geniuses. Instead, they were the product of a parade of idiots and lunatics, incoherently flailing their way through events, helped along the way by overconfident people who thought they could control them.
And if that level of subtext is too understated, Phillips concludes the bit about Scotland's doomed empire-building with:
As a tale it lends itself to metaphor. I mean, it's the story of a country turning away from a political union with its closest geographical trading partners in favor of a fantasy vision of unfettered global influence promoted by free-trade zealots with dreams of empire, who wrapped their vague plans in the rhetoric of aggrieved patriotism while consistently ignoring expert warnings about the practical reality of the situation. Unfortunately, I can't think of anything that could be a metaphor for right now.
So, that running theme is either interesting to the reader or not – I found it a little juvenile; a distraction from any legitimate connections Phillips might have been trying to draw between the failures of the past and the dangers of the present. 
Whatever our future holds, whatever baffling changes come along in the next year, the next decade and the next century, it seems likely that we'll keep on doing basically the same things. We will blame other people for our woes, and construct elaborate fantasy worlds so that we don't have to think about our sins. We will turn to populist leaders in the aftermath of economic crises. We will scramble for money. We will succumb to groupthink and manias and confirmation bias. We will tell ourselves that our plans are very good plans and that nothing can possibly go wrong. Or...maybe we won't?
As a collection of anecdotes about human failure, Humans is trivia-rich and easy to read (even when describing horrible abuses or modern threats, the tone is light but respectful). I understand the truism that history is repeated by those who fail to study and understand it, but also know that we humans are wired the same way today as we were the first time someone murdered, lied, or stole to advance a selfish cause – who knows what the future holds for us? Unlike Diamond or Harari, Phillips doesn't even hazard a guess."
5,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,5,"When I first laid my eyes upon the cover of this book in the bookstore, I knew that it'll appeal to my dwindling optimism about humanity in general. It did not disappoint as I enjoyed reading this book tremendously. It was highly informative, written in a most engaging tone and pretty darn funny (although the topic in itself is actually really bleak). I even wished the book was longer. Highly recommended for everyone. Even if you don't share my sentiments. "
6,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7416346-gerhard,5,"At first what drove me nuts about this book is the total lack of referencing, apart from what feels like a tacked-on ‘Further Reading’ section at the end. Towards the beginning, the statement that “more people were killed by lawnmowers than by terrorism in the USA in the decade between 2007 and 2017” made me actually appreciate the Internet for a change.A Google search lead me to the World Economic Forum website … and the equally bizarre fact that this statistic is attributed to none other than Kim Kardashian in a January 2017 tweet. (Apart from lawnmowers, apparently the number of Americans killed by ‘armed toddlers’ was 21 for the same period, and 31 by lightning, which admittedly is far more prosaic.) It seems that Kim obtained her facts from the Huffington Post, which also admittedly is not a font of infinite wisdom.The beginning of the book, ‘The Dawn of Fuck-Ups’, also had me scurrying for the Internet, in order to read more about our famous fossilised ancestor Lucy actually dying from falling out of a tree, of all things. This is something of a running joke throughout the book, about how the unexpected can put a spoke in the wheels of the best-laid plans. Indeed, BBC News reported in 2016 that “CT scans have shown injuries to her bones similar to those suffered by modern humans in similar falls.”So why didn’t Tom Phillips include references? I think the main reason is that this is by no means an academic book, but rather the work of a raconteur, who doesn’t want to interrupt the flow of his story by having readers squint at reams of footnotes. Hence it is best to just ‘go with the flow’ and enjoy what is an immensely entertaining read, given the rather grim subject matter.Phillips does state politely near the beginning: “A gentle warning: if you’re not really into Schandenfreude, now might be a good time to stop reading.” He notes that “at the time of writing this, we’re a few weeks away from a nuclear summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jung Un. “I’m going to work on the assumption that if you are in fact reading this book, then we made it …” This ties in quite nicely with the ending, which is (as one would expect) a pitch-perfect black joke that resonates perfectly.Kirkus Reviews describes this book as “Al Gore by way of Monty Python”, which is a perfect encapsulation of the balancing act that Phillips has to engage in, who not only wants to make us chortle in horrified mirth at how dumb humans can be, but also to warn us that, like COVID-19, stupidity can often be fatal."
7,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9846570-leah,4,"I loved how this book was written. Tom Phillips writes with such confidence and tells his points very bluntly - while being very entertaining and funny. I also like how the beginning of the book starts with creation and Lucy, and as the book goes on it discusses later things in history. I marked it as a re-read because Tom Philips refers to things in history that I totally don't remember haha and he basically just discusses the things in history that we went wrong but I want the whole story. You will think after this book that humans are really stupid but in fact Tom Phillips gas gathered all the really ridiculously stupid moments into one book. It's like calling humans totally stupid from reading the The Darwin Awards for all the stupid ways humans have died. Are some of us very dumb? Yes. Do the smart ones also have their moments of stupidity? Yes. We're definitely not perfect. But this book takes all those stupid moments and compiles it together. So just remember that we're not THAT stupid and hopefully through history and through Tom Phillips writing about all the mistakes we can go forward and not makes the same mistakes again lol but... history repeats itself so *shrugs*"

It chronicles some of the colossal mistakes mankind has made throughout history to the detriment of their environment, their countries, the planet, the atmosphere and now outer space. Incompetent or deranged leaders, blunders in war, exploration, science, government and colonialism are all here. The mistakes made me shudder and cringe. Some had me laughing out loud. I frequently had both reactions at the same time. What has mankind learned from the errors of the past? The final page says it all. Recommended to history lovers, those who enjoy bizarre trivia and facts omitted from history texts, and those who want a good laugh despite some startling accounts of stupidity leading to miserable results.  I have only one complaint. It is with the partially blanked out word in the title. I am seeing many new books using this attention getting tactic. Well, if it works to sell books I shouldn’t complain."

It is written in a lighthearted way that makes what is essentially depressing history fun! It’s quite sweary so if that bothers you give this book a wide berth (but I think the title gives it away already).I read this book across about a week. It’s not a book I would read in one sitting. I found it best to read a chapter, put the book down and do something else (read another book even) and then come back to it for a daily chapter.Overall an enjoyable and amusing read, albeit it with some sad life lessons (that we won’t ever learn from it seems). If you are looking for serious history this isn’t really the place, yes it is history and yes he is writing about events that we believe are accurate but it’s not high brow at all or in any great detail. It is however very accessible for your average know nothings, like me. It also encouraged me to read up further on some of the subjects within this book that were only briefly discussed - so I guess that’s good.Worthy of a very respectable 4*/5 and I think I would read other books of his - I like his down to earth style.N.B. One point worth noting is that although I thought there were lots of interesting points made here it is of course all the authors interpretation of the facts, and I found myself agreeing with him, but (as he mentions in the book) it’s easy to get sucked into confirmation bias, so I have to remind myself to keep an open mind and think about what he is saying, and that there might be a margin of error here."

After all, if we've always been like this, then there's no chance that the current downhill road is just a trend, a brief dark hour we might one day cross and make better. It's not going to get any better. The only difference is, our fuck-ups are on a global scale now, meaning there's nowhere left to run.It feels like it's going to be Easter Island all over again. The world is fucked, not nearly enough folks realize it or are willing to do anything about it, and just like they couldn't make any boats to escape, we don't yet have the technology to leave our world - and Kessler Syndrore's going to make sure we'd never go away even if we did.Still, on the whole the book didn't tell me too much that was new, nor suggest any kind of feasible solution to our problem nor any way for me to help out in preventing or delaying the inevitable. It mostly just reminded me that the world is shite. But it's still an important message and this particular installment doesn't deliver it all too badly."

What could have been a depressing overview of how badly we humans have screwed up instead made me laugh out loud most of the way through.Tom Phillips writes with a combination of humor, sarcasm, and academic honesty. He's clearly an incredibly smart guy, but he doesn't take himself too seriously, and so we readers get to sit back and enjoy ourselves. Along the way we learn a few things and should probably be horrified by some of it, and yet the tone keeps us from sinking into hopeless misery.In a weird way, this book made me feel better about our situation in the world. It's not that we're better off now than I previously thought; it's that we have a long history of making a mess of things, which makes current events seem less perilous.

What did I love about it? This book is as funny as anything I have read in quite a long time. The author has presented each incident in such a way that the reader can't help but laugh at the stupidity of humans. That was fantastic. The other thing I did like was the inclusion of some photos relating to the text. This could have been a very boring presentation without it.The downsides:The writing style is very ""now"" - lots of abbreviations, slang and all-caps which I think is fun for a while but does tend to get a little annoying after 50 pages or so. There isn't a great deal of depth to the examples given, no real back story/history of what led to the incident so there was no real investment in time - nor was there any urgency to read to see what happened next. I wasn't compelled to keep going at any point.While I did enjoy reading this book for the hilarious descriptions, I think the style and depth was a bit of a let down for me.PaulARH"

But Phillips walks the line carefully and always falls on the side of humorous, not condescending.The book seems very well researched.

And also, that we've shown no capacity from learning from thousands of years of similar mistakes.(Not all of the men in the book are white, so neo-nazis can chill the fuck out; but it is largely a book about men fucking up because, as the author says, for most of history they're the only ones who have been given a chance to fail.)"

40,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24206848-pamela-usai,4,"Here is a personal opinion : as demonstrated by reactions to recent events, humans have truly demonstrated that we can be the absolute worst. We can be shortsighted, we can be breathtakingly selfish, and we can be woefully misguided. And this lovely book is a condensed historical account that shows just how little we have changed. WE ARE STILL THE ABSOLUTE WORST.""Human : A Brief History [...]"" is a much needed breath of levity to an otherwise extremely depressing problem. The human condition, it seems, is that we never learn from our mistakes - even if these are well-intended. Tom Philips, across thematic chapters, recounts instances in which shortsightedness, hubris or downright stupidity have resulted in a butterfly effect of devastation. For example, introducing an invasive species as pest control, without researching the fragility of an ecosystem (Kudzu!). Or attempting to invade a country that your army is ill-equipped for, and unnecessarily losing thousands of lives (Germany!). Or appointing a dog as a civil leader. Needless to say, Philips' well-timed humor made the delivery of these historical accounts much more palatable. I enjoyed his candid, blunt tone, and I never felt that I was being bogged down by statistics or facts. Philips, in this book, found the perfect balance between entertainment and education, and I only wish it had not ended so quickly. Highly recommended!"
41,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111016916-carolyn,3,"This book was a light read on a depressing topic - that humans really don’t learn from our big mistakes and so history does repeat itself. The author was a journalist for Buzzfeed, which explains the easy pop cultural readability, humor, sarcasm and irreverence. He certainly researched the topic and had some crazy stories from history I’d never heard about, but I could have used more commentary on how we could get better as a species. I enjoyed all the parts about psychology: confirmation bias, our brains spotting patterns where there are none (tendency to believe conspiracy theories), groupthink, Dunning-Krueger effect all combined with our own hubris that makes us susceptible to propaganda and “fake news”. We are so prone as a species to greed and prejudice, which affects decision-making. I really liked this quote:“Another one of our most common mistakes is prejudice: our tendency to split the world into “us” and “them” and quickly believe the worst thing possible about whoever “them” is. This is where all our cognitive biases get together and have a bigotry party: we divide the world up according to patterns that might not exist, we make snap judgments based on the first thing to come to mind, we cherry-pick evidence that backs up our beliefs, we desperately try to fit into groups and we confidently believe in our own superiority for no particularly good reason.”That was all covered in Chapter 1 and I would have liked more about all that. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the book and found it to be interesting if not terribly meaty."

I originally expected there to be a lot of environmental stuff, and there was some, but there was much more. Some of the humour is sarcastic, but that’s ok. The funniest was the photo at the very end, after a paragraph of doom, then a paragraph of positive, then a photo (not going to say what it’s of – I don’t want to spoil it!). That photo really made me laugh after the positive words in the previous paragraph! Some of the anecdotes were short and some were longer and went into more detail. I did lose a bit of interest in a couple of the longer ones, but mostly it was interesting. Some of it was history I (broadly) knew about and some of it was stuff I either didn’t know about, or just didn’t know much about (i.e. Ghengis Khan – no, he wasn’t he one who make the stupid mistake…). Overall, though, quite enjoyable!"

So if you need a pick me up, after you think you screwed up something, this might make you feel much better. This was a fast read, with a bunch of entertaining historical stories, and anecdotes. Written in a very funny way, with a smart, and amusing commentary. I will definitely have to check the next book out"

Surprisingly my favourite chapter was the one on science! The way he describes what science is and also learning about Thomas Midgley was fascinating!

From good intentions gone awry to selfish hubris induced decisions, humanity has no boundaries to the amount of f*ckery we are capable of.Phillips compiles multiple mistakes, including a goodly amount of history and humor, into a nonfiction book that is eye-opening, laugh out loud funny, and basically just an all around great read.

I had been discussing about this book with my friends and still there is so much to uncover. The final message I took from the book is that, no idea is new. As a decision-maker or a policy maker, if you want to implement an idea, look into the history first. Somewhere somehow, the idea must have been tried and tested. See to its results, study it, find its shortcomings, be thorough, go that extra mile, because that way you would be saving a lot of efforts and energy if the project fails. On a lighter note, this book is actually mood-changing, uplifting if you are feeling depressed, because you will find in it so many people messing it all up that your mistakes would never even count.

It has a fun opening and it keeps the same humor throughout the book.Reading it, you will learn a lot and you will enjoy it too. It is filled with fun facts and even those that are not so fun are written with humor. All the stories lead to one and only objective. To show the reader how stupid we can be, wanting it or not, but inevitably leading our race to chaos. This book underlines our biggest and most wrecking mistakes.

61,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3848561-anatl,5,"A brilliantly wry account of some of the biggest and dumbest mistakes in the history of mankind. I feel almost guilty for laughing at some of the mistakes that caused so much misery. The book is rife with crazy capricious rulers like the Turkish sultan who forbade coffee drinking, “In a list of ‘moves designed to piss lots of people off’, banning coffee in Turkey probably ranks somewhere alongside banning cheese in France, banning guns in America and … well, banning national stereotyping in Britain.”. The Egyptian King who pick pocketed Churchill's watch. King Ludwig II of Bavaria who was obsessed with fairy tale castles, and in hindsight he doesn't seem as crazy as the rest, since these castles are now big tourist attractions. There are some lessons to be learned, from various historical blunders. I particularly liked the message about the Darien sceme, The Caribbean colony that brought down Scotland and forced them to sign a treaty with England to recuperate their loses:“To this day, the story of Darien is one that divides Scotland. During the 2014 referendum on independence, it became a metaphor for both sides. For the nationalists, a parable of how England had always sought to sabotage and oppress Scottish hopes; for the unionists, a lesson in the dangers of abandoning stability in favour of unrealistic ambitions. As a tale, it lends itself to metaphor. I mean, it’s the story of a country turning away from a political union with its closest geographical trading partners in favour of a fantasy vision of unfettered global influence promoted by free-trade zealots with dreams of empire, who wrapped their vague plans in the rhetoric of aggrieved patriotism while consistently ignoring expert warnings about the practical reality of the situation. Unfortunately, I can’t think of anything that could be a metaphor for right now.” "
62,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182379-gregg,5,"I have to admit: I’m addicted to tomes that detail exactly how screwed we really are. There’s a wealth of quality books detailing our climate change crisis and what’s to be done about it; there aren’t nearly enough of what I’m going to call “climate change porn”—that genre in which you get to wallow and strut just a bit on the grave of the dying world while naysayers continue to chant “la la la can’t hear you profits petroleum.” This book ain’t that, but its tone is so that. Phillips starts with basic human psychology—cognitive bias, groupthink, etc—and then runs through several facets of human existence, all through a deceptively simple lens that argues we screwed up so much before for much the same reasons as we’re screwing things up today. Period. The nuggets of history are fascinating; Phillips walks us through them with good humor and fatalism, along with an acumen that demands attention. I happened to listen to the audiobook, and Nish Kumar perfectly captures the voice Phillips establishes. I need to grab a copy of the book in print and get more of the details down. It would be a hit at parties, to be able to unload parables like Scotland trying to establish an empire, or Genghis Khan eliminating an empire over “a bit of shade” thrown his way, or how the scientific community almost bought into the notion of “super water.” Then pivot to rising carbon levels coupled with our ability to purchase a Nicholas Cage pillowcase for $13, deliverable within hours. “Yeah, it’s that all over again,” I’d say, and take a deep sip of my cognac or Bud Lite or whatever, and wait expectantly.

63,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59458750-daniel,5,"This.. was actually really fun, if horrifically depressing to read.The subject matter is universally pretty dark, morbid or just intellectually frightening but the authors delivery and sense of sarcastic gallows humour about it was delightful and well executed. Many of the sections are emphasized in ways that make the events seem even more idiotic, and there are several details that get glossed over. But credit where its due, the author frequently acknowledges it and even points it out directly (if sarcastically) a few times. Thats not to say that the history he describes werent anything less than utterly idiotic, but at least there were occasionally mitigating factors.... like greed and malice.Anyway, this should not in any way be treated as an actual history text. He references a few history texts, a few historians, and some biographies of the people involved. But this unto itself is not a history text to be relied on. Its just.. funny. It has the feel of a few slightly inebriated friends joking about their old college shenanigans and it really worked to entertain and spark some more interest in some of the events wasnt familiar with.And credit where its do. The author does cite his sources (even if many of the sources are secondary) but he also subtly (and less subtly) encourages the reader to do some fact checking and investigation on their own and not just to believe everything here because its in a book. Honestly I loved it, and I think a few of my friends would adore this humorously cynical synopsis of humankind's worst moments.Contents Include (snagging a few of my favorite chapter titles):1.

I dont think so, so that's what I did.Mostly a humorous look at the kind of mistakes we've made through history that have led to disastrous results. Typically these problems arise from a person or group of people who just cant see, or aren't bothered by, the possible consequences of their actions. There's also plenty of examples of how we didn't learn from history and repeated the same mistakes as others.Author Tom Phillips points out the difficulty in predicting some of the future consequences of our actions, but ends the book on an obvious point of the environmental damage we've done to our world before talking about diseases that have been reignited as layers of permafrost have melted. Raging diseases isn't something we can ignore at the moment. Another thing we can't ignore is also featured on the final page of this book. A big picture of Donald Trump giving us two thumbs up. A fitting end for a book about our mistakes."

Tom Phillips has a rather unusual writing style! He sets out how humans have made poor decisions in the past history (and how this could have changed the chain of events) and how, maybe, human's choices will still be wrong (very wrong) in the future. For those who like history, this book will provide you with another viewpoint than classical-neutral stories about how famous men shaped our world. It addresses 10 key topics (environment, colonialism, international diplomacy, technology, dictatorships, democracy, wars, etc.) and highlights the life, decisions and influence of various known (Khan, Columbus, etc) and less known figures (Thomas Midgley) through human ""unforgettable"" (not necessarily great) achievements. In my view, Tom Phillips' s book deserves 4 stars for depicting a very interesting picture of humanity's stupidity. "
66,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99056353-dawkins,1,"A brief comment how Tom Phillips fucked up: I'm just in the middle of reading his book ""Humans"". I am myself Belgian and in the middle of the book when he talks about colonialism of course he has to mention the Congo Freestate and Leopold II. Ever since Adam Hochschield wrote his famous book ""King leopold's ghost"" wherein he wrote that some 10 million black natives perished during a short period at the end of the 19th century, this number of 10 million deaths has been repeated over and over in books and documentaries. However this number is based on nothing and is asolutely false. I sometimes think the Americans and British can't let go of this number so they don't have to face up to there own colonial/past cruelties: ""yeah our (colonial) past was bad but look what the Belgians did!"" Nobody says that the period during the Congo Freestate was one big celebration. There was a lot of violence and yeah people lost limbs for no good reason (the cutting of limbs actually preexisted the arrival of the Europeans -something to do with taking the powers of your victim - but this doesn't excuse it's continuation by them/and let us not forget if you were so unlucky to get your hand cut off it was a black man handling the machete and generally no white man was standing beside him giving the order, but yeah of course the natives at the time were a bunch of mindless puppets with no own free will whatsoever, easy victims for the Europeans devils (sarcasm)). It's a shame that Leopold II at the end of his reign gave the order to destroy the archives of Congo Freestate so it would have been more difficult for uneducated and uninformed people to make up lies. There was a lot of violence and a lot of people died but most of them died of deseases in the same way as the Indians in the Americas. The area of the Congo is a big chunk of earth with the second biggest rainforest. When you start opening up the area, tribes that otherwise didn't have any contact with the outside world, for the first time came in contact not only with white men but also with all sorts of unknown deseases. As they weren't immune to them they sometimes died of them. The European obsession for rubber and it's gruesom exploitation didn't help. Because of that, some native tribes had a pretty difficult time during that period and due to malnutrition and abuse were more susceptible to die of deprivation. Let us not forget that many of the white men that went there to colonise the area also died of deseases, going to Congo Freestate was pretty much a death sentence for most of them. The actual figure of the people that perished during this period is probably around 200 to 300 thousand people. That's a lot but it's a far cry from the number of 10 million and again it's not that a bunch of white men took their guns and started shooting the natives (If people were shot they were shot by a black person! but hey let's not complicate things/ the responsibily of the Europeans lies in the fact that they created the circumstances in which cruelties could take place for example recruting simple folk, giving them a gun and authority and letting them patrol in foreign towns that are not part of their tribe, who would've know that this is a recipy for dissaster! (sarcasm)). No, I repeat, most of these people died of deseases. If you still can't let go of the number 10 million here are some basic facts to think about. Firstly, how did Hochshield came up with 10 million? The first time an actual attempt was made to actually count how many people were living in the area was done in the 1920s by the Belgian government after they took over from Leopold II. Hochshield took this number and compared it with an estimation of the population that was made by some scholar at the end of the 19th century. When he compared the 2 figures he noticed that there was a difference of 10 million and voila the Belgians committed one of the biggest genocides in history. How life can be easy and simple. Does this really sound like a decent scientific investigation to you??!! Don't forget when they made the estimation they didn't send people to go around the whole area and visite all the towns to actually count every head. If that even was humanly possible during that period. No they estimated, or rather guessed, and there's no reason to believe that the figure they came up with was correct. Secondly during the period there were about 800 white civil servants working in the Congo Freestate. Do you know how big this area was? It was even bigger than the current country the Democratic Republic of Congo. So we have to believe that 800 supermen (I guess we can talk about Übermenschen) killed 10 million people!? My god next to that the Nazis were a bunch of pussies! They actually needed the effort of the whole German Reich to kill of 6 million Jews (probably closer to 5 million but there are some people in this world that have a hard time letting go of certain set numbers!).So we're back with Tom Phillips who likes to talk about fuck-ups and miscommunication. In short, he read a few books and summarized them in one book called ""humans"". If you do that, at the end you may have a book but it doesn't mean you're a serious author. The irony of it all is that Mr Tom Phillips is the editor of Full Fact, the UK's independent factchecking charity, but he's too lazy to check the facts in his own book! At one point he also talks about Eastern Island and repeates the errors that Jared Diamond wrote in his otherwise fantastic book(s). The Rapanui undoubtedly cut down some trees but the deforestation was likely due to the polynesian rat they brought with them. In short, can we actually believe anything he wrote?! Yeah Tom because of your laziness: you fucked-up big time!"

108,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5636244-david,3,"We tend to assume that when something awful happens there must have been some great controlling intelligence behind it. It’s understandable: How could things have gone so wrong, we think, if there wasn’t an evil genius pulling the strings? The downside of this is that we tend to assume that if we can’t immediately spot an evil genius, then we can all chill out a bit because everything will be fine.But history suggests that’s a mistake, and it’s one that we make over and over again. Many of the worst man-made events that ever occurred were not the product of evil geniuses. Instead, they were the product of a parade of idiots and lunatics, incoherently flailing their way through events, helped along the way by overconfident people who thought they could control them.Rating: 3/5[W]hile the human brain is remarkable, it is also extremely weird, and prone to going badly wrong at the worst possible moment. We routinely make terrible decisions, believe ridiculous things, ignore evidence that’s right in front of our eyes and come up with plans that make absolutely no sense. Our minds are capable of imagining concertos and cities and the theory of relativity into existence, and yet apparently incapable of deciding which type of potato chips we want to buy at the shop without five minutes’ painful deliberation.This is how we get financial bubbles—when the perceived value of something far outstrips its actual value. People start investing in the thing not because they necessarily think it has any intrinsic worth, but simply because as long as enough other people think it’s worth something, you can still make money. Of course, eventually reality kicks back in, a lot of people lose a lot of money and sometimes the entire economy goes down the pan.Quite where democracy was first tried out is somewhat disputed—forms of collective decision-making were almost certainly a feature of early small societies. There’s also some evidence for something at least approaching democracy in India about 2,500 years ago. But generally, it’s the Greek city-state of Athens that gets the credit for adopting and codifying democratic government at around the same time, in 508 BCE.Little of this was especially secret or unknown at the time. It’s why so many people failed to take Hitler seriously until it was too late, dismissing him as merely a “half-mad rascal” or a “man with a beery vocal organ.” In a sense, they weren’t wrong. In another, much more important sense, they were as wrong as it’s possible to get. Hitler’s personal failings didn’t stop him having an uncanny instinct for political rhetoric that would gain mass appeal, and it turns out you don’t actually need to have a particularly competent or functional government to do terrible things.Having a plan is obviously crucial to military success. But sometimes it’s possible for a plan to be too cunning and devious for its own good. If you’ve ever played chess against somebody much, much better at it than you, you’re probably familiar with how it goes: you spend ages trying to maneuver them into an extremely clever trap, only to realize that they’ve anticipated every move and you’ve actually defeated yourself. That’s basically what French general Henri Navarre did in Vietnam, except he did it with people rather than chess pieces. Like his earlier compatriot Napoleon, he hatched a plan that was perfect just so long as his opponents did exactly what he wanted them to.When Columbus managed to accidentally sink the Santa María on the shores of Hispaniola in 1492, the population of the indigenous Taíno people on the island numbered in the hundreds of thousands. A little over two decades later, after the Spanish introduced mining, slavery and disease, there were only 32,000 of them left. Columbus was bad at math, sure, but it definitely wasn’t his worst mistake.Fortunately, getting all judgy about the past is exactly the job of this book, so let’s quickly clarify something: colonialism was bad. Really, really bad...How bad, exactly? Well, one estimate of the deaths from European colonialism in the twentieth century alone puts the figure in the region of 50 million, placing it up there with the crimes of Hitler, Stalin and Mao—and that’s in the century that colonial empires were collapsing. In the hundred years or so following the colonization of the Americas, a fairly conservative estimate is that 90 percent of the continent’s population died from a combination of disease, violence and forced labor—again, a figure in the tens of millions. The only reason we can’t be more specific is because it’s hard to work out how many people were living there before; we literally don’t know what we lost.The human compulsion to explore and to always seek out new horizons is—as I think we’ve mentioned already—one of our defining characteristics. It was that urge to explore and to uncover new knowledge that drove NASA to launch the Mars Climate Orbiter into the vast, empty black void of space in 1998.The dawn of the scientific, technological and industrial ages have brought opportunities to humanity that our ancestors could never have dreamed of. They have also, unfortunately, offered us the chance to fail on a scale never previously anticipated. When Columbus got his units of measurement wrong, he was at least confined to making his mistakes on the surface of the earth. Now, as the unfortunate story of the Mars Climate Orbiter shows, we get to screw up in space.Scientists are no less susceptible than any other humans to the perils of just assuming that their view of the world is right, and ignoring anything to the contrary. That’s why all the structures of science—peer review and replication and the like—are put in place to try and stop that happening. But it’s extremely far from foolproof, because groupthink and bandwagon-jumping and political pressure and ideological blinders are all things in science, as well. This book has been about the failures and mistakes we’ve made in the past. But what about the mistakes we’re making right now, and the ones we’ll make in years to come? What shape might the fuck-ups of the future take?Making predictions is, as we’ve noted, a sure-fire way to make yourself look stupid to historians further down the line. Maybe the decades and centuries ahead will see humanity commit a whole series of completely original, novel mistakes; maybe we’ll find a way to stop making mistakes at all. But if you were of a mind to put money on it, a sensible bet would be that we’ll probably carry on making the exact same mistakes as we have in the past.The worry about outsourcing our decisions to computers doesn’t stop there, as research on artificial intelligence progresses apace. The fear here is that if we do manage to create an AI that’s far smarter and more capable than humans, we might be mistaken in thinking it’ll be on our side. It might be able to manipulate us to its own ends, it may see us as a threat and destroy us or it may simply fail to recognize that humans are important, and we’ll end up being little more than fodder for its goal of creating as many paper clips as possible (or whatever other task we’ve set it). The prospect that we might Frankenstein ourselves into oblivion may seem remote, but a worryingly large number of supposedly smart people appear to be taking the prospect quite seriously.We live at a time when technological and societal changes happen with dizzying speed. Dramatic shifts in the way we live can happen inside the space of a generation, or a decade, sometimes in less than a year. Everything seems to be constantly new: and yet, at the same time, it’s hard to escape the feeling that we’re just replaying the mistakes of our past at an ever-increasing rate. Somehow we consistently fail to see them coming."

He says, ""There are lots of books about humanity’s finest achievements— the great leaders, the genius inventors, the indomitable human spirit. There are also lots of books about mistakes we’ve made: both individual screw-ups and society-wide errors. But there aren’t quite so many about how we manage to get things profoundly, catastrophically wrong over and over again."" Yep.First chapter nails it with the root of all the upf*cking...our brains. From availability heuristics to pareidolia to confirmations biases, Smith condenses a host of our problems into an informative and sardonic yet still funny package. He’ll probably be dismissed by many for his cavalier relation of the topics, but the source material is there under, around and over his wonderful sense of humor. On pareidolia, he says he used to think confirmation bias was the real culprit, and everything he'd read, uh ... confirmed that. (See where he's going with that?) Which is exactly the problem: our brains hate finding out that they’re wrong. Confirmation bias is our annoying habit of zeroing in like a laser-guided missile on any scrap of evidence that supports what we already believe, and blithely ignoring the possibly much, much larger piles of evidence that suggest we might have been completely misguided.The ""choice supportive bias"" tells usThere’s even some evidence that, in certain circumstances, the very act of telling people they’re wrong— even if you patiently show them the evidence that clearly demonstrates why this is the case— can actually make them believe the wrong thing more. The T-msters are masters of that, but not alone. And of course, there's the Dunning-Kruger effect (detailed in their paper, “Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One’s Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments”). Fits someone to T. In his chapter on people in power, he had these things to say about someone. Omitting identifying words, see if you can guess who...“Things that might have proved career-ending for other politicians [...] didn’t seem to be much of a barrier to his success.”“Once he was in power, the country’s poor who had voted for him were somewhat surprised at the economic plan he unveiled a few months into his term [...]. Oh, and he tried to remove the term limits on the presidency. And went off-script in his speech announcing the economic policy to mount a lengthy attack on a newspaper that had been critical of him.”“Even after elections had made the [...] the largest party [...], the people kept thinking that [...] was an easy mark, a blustering idiot who could easily be controlled by smart people.”“As it would turn out, [...] was really bad at running a government. As his own press chief [...] wrote [...], ‘In the [...] years of his rule [...he] produced the biggest confusion in government that had ever existed I. A civilized state.”“His government was constantly in chaos, with officials having no idea what he wanted them to do, and nobody was entirely clear who was actually in charge of what.”“[...] was incredibly lazy. According to his aide [...], even when he was in [...] he wouldn’t get out of bed until after 11:00 a.m., and wouldn’t do much before lunch other than read what the newspapers had to say about him [...] He was obsessed with the media and celebrity, and often seems to have viewed himself through that lens.”“...he’d take any opportunity to leave to seat of government and go to his private country retreat [...] where he’d do even less .”“He was deeply insecure about his own lack of knowledge, preferring to either ignore information that contradicted his preconceptions, or to lash out at the expertise of others - he was said to ‘rage like a tiger’ if anybody corrected him.”“He hated being laughed at, but enjoyed it when other people were the butt of the joke (he would perform mocking impressions of people he disliked).”Who? Trick question... The first two were about Abdalá Bucaram, Ecuador’s President in 1996. The rest were about Hitler. Phillips doesn’t say anything about T in that chapter, but it's pretty obvious he was alluding. (So the last page has a picture of he-who-shall-not-be-named...more than allusion.) And from the chapter on leaders......if you want a helpful guide on why it’s best not to put someone with the temperament of a spoiled child in charge of a country, then the Zhengde Emperor (born Zhu Houzhao) is probably a pretty good place to start. His distaste for actually doing any of the work of ruling, when he’d much rather be off hunting tigers or sleeping with absurd numbers of women, was one thing. Not ideal, but, eh, you work with what you’ve got. and Germany’s Wilhelm II believed himself to be a master negotiator with a diplomatic golden touch. In fact, his only gift was insulting just about every other country he came into contact with, which may help explain how World War I happened. How far off is WW3, with T? On technology and the scientific method:The way it’s supposed to work is this: you have an idea about how the world might work, and in order to see if there’s a chance it might be right, you try very hard to prove yourself wrong. If you fail to prove yourself wrong, you try to prove yourself wrong again, or prove yourself wrong another way. After a while you decide to tell the world that you’ve failed to prove yourself wrong, at which point everybody else tries to prove you wrong, as well. If they all fail to prove you wrong, then slowly people begin to accept that you might possibly be right, or at least less wrong than the alternatives. Of course, that’s not how it actually works. Scientists are no less susceptible than any other humans to the perils of just assuming that their view of the world is right, and ignoring anything to the contrary.Spot on. So there is a lot more. And Phillips is funny. My confirmation bias likes him."

It’s the definition of pop-sci, with a VERY informal style which I found almost hard to read at times and essentially consists of mini stories from history written in continuous pros, split up into chapters. Yes, I bagged some new editions to the fun facts bank but I almost stopped reading at least three times as I felt it to be a waste of my time. And this is coming from someone who loves history and popular science books. Positives are it’s a quick read and has a fantastic section on famous ‘manias’ (did you know that there were many outbreaks of inexplicable, uncontrollable dancing in the Middle Ages?) which I haven’t forgot.

A Brief History of How We Fucked It All Up“ is a real refreshment. Truth be told, I haven’t been overly enthusiastic about all that homocentrism, a tremendous charge of pride for being a member of a species that has succeeded what none in history has and by constantly strenuously emphasizing how best, smartest, best in this or best in that we are. Of all those superlatives we like to wrap ourselves in, my hair stands on end. Although, I recognize these superlatives if we are talking about science or art, for example, but maybe it’s finally time to land on Earth, when we are already failing to populate Mars.""The story of human progress starts with our capacity for thinking and creativity. That´s what sets humans apart from other animals – but it´s also what leads us to make complete tits of ourselves on a regular basis.""In an unusual way, the book chronologically depicts our journey that began some 70,000 years ago when we began to settle on continents outside of Africa to the present day. But this is not a typical history book if this sentence made you think so. This is a book based on history and historical examples, used to show the most interesting examples when we, as individuals and as a species, fiercely fucked. Ten extremely readable, entertaining, and educative chapters will take you through different historical segments and show you that a wise man may not always deserve that title after all.""Human nature being what it is, it´s a good bet that there have always been people who liked bossing around, but it´s not entirely clear when this became an actual job rather than just a hobby.""How did the agricultural way of life have its fingers in the escalation of epidemics, economic inequality, wars, and negative effects on the environment? How did we fuck it up by thinking that, after the domestication of the first animals, we are now the rulers and conductors of nature? What circus performers in the past have had the opportunity through the role of rulers to make critical decisions on behalf and unfortunately of all of us? How has what we optimistically call democracy often gone in the completely wrong direction in the past? What incredibly stupid war strategies and decisions have we applied? How did we manage to fuck it up with colonialism, unbridled aspirations for conquest, and some of the worst diplomatic decisions in history? And how do technology and the advancement of science sometimes only give us even more opportunities to fuck things up?""It´s the problem that the Taino faced when Columbus came along – during their first meetings, they were trusting and impressed Columbus with their friendliness and generosity. Obviously Columbus reacted in the normal way you do when someone is friendly and generous to you: They should make good servants.""The author offers us answers to these questions through a large number of historical examples, presented in a witty, and often an ingeniously sarcastic way. From the example of the Cuyahoga River which burned 13 times; the decision of a Shakespeare-crazed homo sapiens to inhabit starlings in North America, which, in turn, destroyed crops, drove away domestic birds, and spread infectious diseases from fungal infections to salmonella; to Farouk I, the Egyptian kleptomaniac who, at a meeting during World War II, managed to steal a watch from Winston Churchill. From the most famous example when we did not take the incompetent and lazy egomaniac seriously in time, so after a while this mockery of a man was staged as a character of Hitler; to Columbus who, due to his bad calculation, accidentally discovered a whole new continent after being stranded and, consequently, the Spanish colonization which brought disease, mining, and slavery. From the Aztec leader Moctezuma, who fucked it up in the assessment of Hernan Cortes; to Francis Galton who fiercely fucked it up by proclaiming eugenics, to which we can thank the laws on sterilization and the multitude of Nazi crimes. And all the way to answering the question why have we never heard of the Khwarezmian Empire which in the 13th-century covered an area larger than today’s six states?""It was that urge to explore and to uncover new knowledge that drove NASA to launch the Mars Orbiter into the vast, empty black void of space 1998. A few months later, the Mars Climate Orbiter ended up crashing onto a load of rocks, like an idiot. In a spectacular demonstration on humanity´s ability to make essentially the same mistakes over and over again, a little more than a five centuries after Christopher Columbus messed up his units of measurement…“Apart from the historically educational character of this book, which sometimes made me feel like I was reading the part of the history schoolbook that answers the question “Did you know?”, the book is definitely a very fun and vivid read with which you will have a good laugh. This homo sapiens is definitely recommending it, you will not fuck it up by reading it.""Making predictions is, as we´ve noted, a sure-fire way to make yourself look stupid to historians further down the line."""

121,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78104800-stephen,3,"I was asked to read and review this book as an ARC so here is my review adapted for this site:So what is “Humans: A Brief History of How We F*cked it All Up”  by Tom Phillips about? Well as it’s title suggests, it’s a book about humans throughout history who have made mistakes small and large, often to the detriment of society, and more often than not were complete accidents. Humans is similar to Sapiens in that it's pop-history for people who aren’t history experts. However, I feel like Humans is more accessible to non-history people than Sapiens because it takes as its subject matter events that most people likely don’t know about and presents them in a very comedic way, it’s as if the author scraped through the barrels of history to pull out a bunch of unknown stories to add to the collection, that were so strange that they were almost unbelievable; whereas Sapiens has a high degree of already slightly-known or available events presented in a more straightforward way. Many of the stories felt like they were intentionally chosen FOR the desired comedic effect within the given chapter. Humans also has more quotability, whether you're in a bar or your grandmother's house.After the first few pages I was convinced that Phillips is a millennial but couldn’t tell if he was actually a history major or someone who had a few too many sleepless nights spent on Wikipedia; I have a feeling it's a bit of both.From the beginning, while I was having a bit of cognitive dissonance when taking in the writing style, one thing was for sure clear: that this book is knee-slappingly funny. I actually spat-laughed reading some of those paragraphs. The stories ranged from short paragraphs, to longer multi-page explorations of an event and the interworking parts that led to catastrophic results. Some were boring and didn't quite land for me, while others were so good I immediately texted some friends to inform them of my newly learned tidbit of useless information. And when I say cognitive dissonance, I don't mean it in a strict sense, it's just that the history that I'm used to reading is either written in the traditional sense of dense prose like Edward Gibbon, Howard Zinn, and Mary Beard, or is written in that newer narrative style like Erik Larson, Laura Hillenbrand, and Jon Krakauer. Phillips has found a whole 'nother style.The book’s writing style is unique to this generation, using a vocabulary and style common to the social-media-consuming, meme-culture of the present. Using random thoughts in brackets, swearing, sarcasm, abbreviations, all caps, slang, and 0-100 type exaggerations, Phillips appears to be hip and writing for a younger audience. TBH this book could've been written entirely in the meme format and I would’ve been down for that; the only thing missing was some emojis throughout the text. I can’t imagine an older person who needs a book like “iPhones for Seniors” reading this book, or really anyone who isn’t up to date on the aforementioned internet culture; they wouldn’t last more than two chapters. I was LOLing a lot, and most of the time it was because of Phillips style. Check out these 3 quotes out of a plethora I had to choose from. “Ironically, after the initial fuck-up of introducing rabbits into Australia in the first place, the eventual solution was also a fuck-up” (p. 69).“Julius Caesar decided that he quite liked the power and actually he’d rather keep it... that ended stabbily for Caesar” (p. 113).“If instead of having wars, we just sent large groups of people to each other’s countries to drink loads of their wine and aimlessly wander around their towns on a regular basis, then the world would probably be a much, much happier place. Although now I’ve written that, it occurs to me that’s essentially what the EU is” (p. 131). I feel like it would be hilarious to grab a drink with him and have a chat about history. As for longevity, the writing style and references may not allow the book to age well, unless I’m wrong, or the author updates it or writes a sequel (Homo Deus style). If internet culture evolves far enough away from the current one, the lingo present here may be too context-based. Overall I give the book a solid 3/5 for its entertainment value and for teaching me some interesting and unfortunate things that we as a species have done, mostly accidentally. "
122,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4842743-readingmama,4,"The 10 chapters of ten different genres of f#cked up, from war to environmental issues, the book is informative, witty and well written. There are so many interesting and TRUE historical events of stupid events, including issues of combustable rivers to lead poisoning, which has permanent impact in human and our environment. The lesson here is let us learn from history, even if it may be difficult because of our tendency to follow patterns and make hopeful assumptions without rationality. I am deeply concerned about the environment that we are living in; we humans have used and abused it throughout history and sadly, we have already seen the impact. Yet, the book ends with optimistic hope that maybe, we can start making better choices; since Covid19 crisis and staying at home order, even I have seen the changes of healing of the earth and wilderness come alive. Yes, there is hope…. and we are all responsible. “We tend to assume that when something awful happens there must have been some great controlling intelligence behind it. It’s understandable: how could things have gone so wrong, we think, if there wasn’t an evil genius pulling the strings? The downside of this is that we tend to assume that if we can’t immediately spot an evil genius, then we can all chill out a bit because everything will be fine. But history suggests that’s a mistake, and it’s one that we make over and over again. Many of the worst man-made events that ever occurred were not the product of evil geniuses. Instead they were the product of a parade of idiots and lunatics, incoherently flailing their way through events, helped along the way by overconfident people who thought they could control them.” “Humans see patterns in the world, we can communicate this to other humans, and we have the capacity to imagine futures that don’t yet exist: how if we just changed this thing, then that thing would happen, and the world would be a slightly better place. The only trouble is … well, we’re not terribly good at any of those things. Any honest assessment of humanity’s previous performance on those fronts reads like a particularly brutal annual review from a boss who hates you. We imagine patterns where they don’t exist. Our communication skills are, uh, sometimes lacking. And we have an extraordinarily poor track record of failing to realise that changing this thing will also lead to the other thing, and that even worse thing, and oh God no now this thing is happening how do we stop it.”“Even if popular culture has long enjoyed turning him into an object of mockery, we still tend to believe that the Nazi machine was ruthlessly efficient, and that the great dictator spent most of his time...well, dictating things. So it’s worth remembering that Hitler was actually an incompetent, lazy egomaniac and his government was an absolute clown show. In fact, this may even have helped his rise to power, as he was consistently underestimated by the German elite. Before he became chancellor, many of his opponents had dismissed him as a joke for his crude speeches and tacky rallies. He was a “pathetic dunderhead” according to one magazine editor; another wrote that his party was a “society of incompetents” and that people should not “overestimate the fairground party.”"

However, trouble starts when we start to see patterns that just aren't there.This is made worse by some heuristics, some mental shortcuts, our brains use. Two of the main ones are ""anchoring heuristic"" and ""availability heuristic"", anchoring meaning that we tend to make our mind about something and try to find every bit of proof that we're right even when that is extremely difficult (because all proof goes to the contrary). Availability refers to the fact that we make judgement based on the information that is most easily available rather than considering all the possible information about something.The author then goes on to illustrate various examples of how and when we got it all wrong. He starts with Lucy, our australopithecus ancestor, who most likely died from falling after climbing up a tree.Going through how we tend to screw up delicate ecosystems for no legitimate reasons, like when an English man called Thomas Austin decided it was a good idea to introduce 24 rabbits to Australia but 'within 50 years rabbits had spread throughout the most of the continent with devastating impact on indigenous flora and fauna' and they are still a problem today!How we thought colonialism was a great idea when really ""it was really, really, really bad. One estimate is that of the deaths from European colonialism in the twentieth century alone puts the figure in the region of 50 million"".How we invent new technologies without thinking about the impact it might have in the future: think about Thomas Midgley, the single man who developed not one, but two of the most toxic compounds that were later banned, leaded gasoline and chlorofluorocarbons.How we are very bad at predicting the future, even when we are the experts in the field: in 1912, Guglielmo Marconi, the inventor of the radio, predicted that ""the coming of the wireless era will make war impossible, because it will make war ridiculous"" and in 1914, the world went to war. In 1932, Albert Einstein predicted that ""there is not the slightest indication that nuclear energy will ever be obtainable""...And how we are still prone to accidents just like Lucy after climbing trees, only now accidents happen inside self driving cars.It's not all bleak, however: maybe, just maybe, we are in the dawn of a new era, where we realise how biased we are prone to be and that we tend to make mistakes so we can finally become better."

After the lecture you may wonder why we have made it so far after all.I would have loved to give it full five stars because it is highly educational, funny and the Audbile version also well read but there is one aspect, albeit the author warns of it beforehand: In the prologue he states that history is difficult because you have to rely usually on a limited, biased perspective and there is not always the opportunity to check if that what got written down was really that was happened. He promised to try not to step into the ""too good to be true"" trap too often.As I am not a historian I took his research for face value, having no information why it should not be true, until he came to the story of King Ludwig II. and his castles.Living in Germany and having visited them with a guided tour I actually know that there is one thing he has gotten wrong. The story that, although he had no supporters and the State of Bavaria wanted to keep him from building all his dreamcastles because of boring financial reasons, Ludwig II's legacy lives until today and that he would be elated that his dream has shaped and inspired a huge part of popculture sounds great. But it is not quite true. First of all, his ministers were not a group of spoilsports without imagination, they were seriously worried about the state going bancrupt because of Ludwig II. His building extravagancies drove them deeply into dept, as far as 7 Million Mark (which was about 4.7 Million Dollar at the end of the 19th century so - quite a bit of money). Second, Ludwig II. would NOT be delighted that his dream, like Schloss Neuschwanstein, would be shared by the world today. He would be abhorred. In his lifetime he hated visitors, nobody should see his castles. They were meant for his sole enjoyment and in his last will he decreed that the lot of them should be blown up and destroyed. The government happily ignored this and used them as tourist attractions, to fill up the depleted state treasury.After that chapter I took what Phillips said with a grain of salt, as I should have, after all he warned me of it himself. So, no harm done, just a reminder: he is just a human and f*cks sometimes up like the rest of us."

It's whitty but it is a history lesson which doesn't surprise me but I'm not always in the mood for a book like that. The themes, ideas and messages are very good though! Right off the bat he brings up something that I think is probably the most significant reason why history and today has been so messed up: people don't like to be wrong.He went through environmental ideas like farming causing inequality? Very interesting and a totally new concept for me perosnally. Then the obvious like how people were diverting rivers and ruining lakes, putting our waste products into the rivers to the point where a river in Ohio has set on fire several different ocassions oh and others in different states as well...but were improving apparently.The example of cutting down every single tree on an island. mostly because "" not my problem mate"". Again a major theme in history - everyone does what's best for themselves or their communities because they are fixing their own problem but the problems created from this is not their problem but someone else's.Then there's war and leadership. Obviously war is bad but I enjoyed some of the smaller battle stories that shows how stupid people and leaders can be like when the English tried to steal money from the ship's going to Spain but didn't get to the right ships in time and ended up without food so they went on a Spanish ship anyways just to get drunk and then most of them got killed. How about troops killing one another on the same side by accident ...but yet war goes on. We cant forget about finding new lands but instantly murdering and kidnapping the people from those lands. Who knew how many lives were actually lost due to colonizism?! from disease, violence and forced labour. the number will astound you? There's alot more like individual people's mistakes. Some great examples there.Overall this book is interesting, but a history lesson. It includes wittniess but it was not like I was laughing out loud at any point in the book. I liked learning about history most people don't know about and enjoyed the themes. If you like history you'll like this. If you're looking to broaden your horizons in genres you could read this book for sure."

From the publisher, as I do not regurgitate the contents or story of books in reviews, I let them do it.Modern humans have come a long way in the seventy thousand years they’ve walked the earth. Art, science, culture, trade—on the evolutionary food chain, we’re true winners. But it hasn’t always been smooth sailing, and sometimes—just occasionally—we’ve managed to truly f*ck things up.Weaving together history, science, politics and pop culture, Humans offers a panoramic exploration of humankind in all its glory, or lack thereof. From Lucy, our first ancestor, who fell out of a tree and died, to General Zhou Shou of China, who stored gunpowder in his palace before a lantern festival, to the Austrian army attacking itself one drunken night, to the most spectacular fails of the present day, Humans reveals how even the most mundane mistakes can shift the course of civilization as we know it. Lively, wry and brimming with brilliant insight, this unique compendium offers a fresh take on world history and is one of the most entertaining reads of the year.The only great thing about chicken pox at age 52 (and being a super- speed reader) is you can easily read and review four+++ books a day..and this was an excellent book to have spent an hour or two (or many more on your side) withHumans as we know them have only been around the 70,000 years that the author presents (If you want ""more on that "", read SAPIENS) Yes, 70,000 years of the BILLIONS that the earth is aged - thank god we, humans, have not been around more as this book shows we are amazing at f*ing up our world on a personal and global level. (Oh, this book will make the bible crowd sh*t their f*ng pants when and if they read about Lucy!)The book made me laugh out loud and is so freaking entertaining that I swear that I read half the book aloud to my husband while he was trying to sleep! As always, I try to find a reason to not rate with stars as I love emojis (outside of their incessant use on Instagram and Twitter) so let's give it ☕☕☕☕☕ (caffeine overload) as you will want to stay up late and finish it in one fell swoop! Your book club would love it, too!"

But 10 pages in I was hooked annoying my whole family laughing all the time. Tom Phillips is a comic genius. Making the slightly boring subject of Lucy the ancient ape into a laugh inducing extremely memorable topic. The book is about how mankind has the ability to completely mess up our future at every single turn. We have manged before with colonialism. As detailed in the chapter Super Happy Fun Colonialism Party. Which spoiler alert is not that fun. Other chapters include The Dawn of F*ck Ups, War. huh. What is it good for?, A dummies and/or presidents guide to diplomacy (not at all pointed) and finally F*cking up the future. Sadly, Man Kind has managed to fill a 260-page book jampacked with all of them. I particular liked the anecdotes like. “about why for every accomplishment that makes you proud to be a human (art, science, pubs) there’s always something else that makes you shake your head in bafflement and despair (war, pollutions, pubs in airports”. I like Phillips’ humour and his idea of a good laugh. This book made me feel joyful. It made me feel amused and just relaxed for once. But what I didn’t like in the book was the amount of swearing some was needed especially in the tittle for effect. But some was just unneeded useless even. The strengths were that it was amazing, fascinating even. Just amazingI would recommend this book to people who are in for a good laugh at history . Those who can point out the flaws in human nature and those who just want to laugh at the absolute stupidness of man. I would recommend this book to those 13 and up. Because 13 year olds would love this. Not just for the swearing but for the funny thoughts and observations. Everyone could love this book. Everyone and anyone. It is a history book. I give it 5 out of 5 stars. Because through its flaws it is a great book that can be loved. I feel sad to have finished it."
128,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102383690-giulia-held,5,"Phillips must be a joy of a person to hang around with because 1) he is hilarious and 2) his pessimism is basically at the same level as me. I was literally laughing out loud throughout the whole book! 	The book is about human history, from the very beginning until now. Somehow, we have managed to mess it up, whilst also having survived long enough to stumble into the present. Who knows how much further we can keep this up with the sheer quantity of disastrous decisions we have made/still make? It is a wonder how we keep making the same mistakes that we have made multiple times in the past, yet we never learn from them! In any case, the book recounts historical moments in such an entertaining way that it doesn’t even feel like you are learning! Phillips also chose some very obscure examples, which is awesome because I was able to learn about moments in history that I otherwise would have never encountered! I believe that my favourite story must be that of Sigurd the Mighty, a ninth century Norse Earl of Orkney. His story is literally the definition of bad karma. Not only is the story in itself quite funny, but the way that Phillips recounts it is simply hilarious. I, honestly, would buy the book just to read that section! I also loved the chapter names, some examples:•	Prologue: The Dawn of Fuck Ups•	Why Your Brain is an Idiot•	A Dummies’ and/or Current Presidents’ Guide to DiplomacyI think this summarises pretty well what it will be like to read this book. Expect plenty of sarcasm, pessimism and self-deprecating humour. It is pretty much the most British book to come out of Britain. Overall, GREAT read! I really hope you read it because it is so worth it! Also, if you have already read this book I would love to hear feedback on it. If you enjoyed this review please let me know on any of my social media platforms or on this website! I would really appreciate it! "
129,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66026978-nathan,5,"With a gigantic amount of dry wit and colorful language, Phillips touches on some of the ""greatest hits"" of failures during the course of humanity's reign as the preeminent species upon the planet. We're informed of screw-ups in terms of the environment, ones regarding animals, war, politics, inventions, and the list goes on; concluding with a few words on what we're messing up now, it's not the biggest pick-me-up you'll ever reach for, but at least the book's aiming to be proof that we're at least aware of *some* mistakes and a few of us are trying to keep away from repeating them. Approaching our massive shortcomings from the angle of light-heartedness balms the wound, so to speak. It's a legitimate page-turner, as, thanks to the author's writing style and biting humor, everything seems balanced---not too many snide remarks, and not too bogged down with the copy/paste historical re-tellings that end up rolling along more akin to a term paper than someone in front of you woefully laying out why we suck so much. If you're looking for a book that's going to allow you to just back up from it all and have an easy, hilarious read (wherein I'm sure you'll learn something, too: I mean, did you already know how the U.S. acquired Guam as a territory? Phillips will tell you), then put this in your queue.Is there an audiobook of this? If not, might I suggest one of the following to do the reading: John Cleese, Eric Idle, Billy Connelly, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Richard E. Grant, Timothy Dalton, Helen Mirren, Tilda Swinton. Many thanks to NetGalley, Harlequin, and Hanover Square Press for the advance read. "
130,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/159421-shan,4,"Quick, entertaining overview of a lot of historical mistakes, many of which are hilarious and some of which are uncomfortably parallel to the present; followed by a mercifully short but brutal section on the things we're clearly f'ing up right this minute. Some of the stories are familiar; others were new to me. All are told in an easy, page-turner style. There's Genghis Khan and the ruler who foolishly turned down Khan's offer of friendship because the wording wasn't sufficiently admiring, leading to the Mongol takeover of vast swaths of Europe and Asia. There's the guy responsible for leaded gas AND ozone-depleting CFCs. There are diverted rivers leading to millions of deaths from starvation, military blunders, the bizarre royal succession practices in the Ottoman Empire, rabbits in Australia, starlings in the US, a crazy Chinese campaign against sparrows that opened the door to a plague of locusts, and much much more. The moral of many of the stories is beware of unintended consequences, and watch out for human tendencies like confirmation bias and ""choice-supportive bias"" (once we've committed to a course of action, we cling to the idea that it was the right choice). Others are more damning: for instance, plenty of people warned about the danger of putting lead into the atmosphere BEFORE the advent of leaded gas, but using lead instead of an alternative like ethanol was more profitable, so here we are. Or were, from the 1920s to the 1970s, and there's an interesting bit of speculation on the possible effects of that decision beyond the obvious health effects.I wouldn't call it an optimistic book, but the style makes it readable. Recommended."

I don't care!Somehow, we tend to consider this a selfish attitude. But in fact it is not. Whatever! I don't care means there's no connection, no bonds, no hope. Ultimately means there is no self any longer.And because there is no protection of the self it becomes dangerous for everyone around. Somehow, Tom Philips collected numerous examples throughout Human History of how ""Whatever"" f*cked it all up. Whether unconscious or not, intentional or not, the let's do it because whatever  kind of behavior is responsible for disasters, of different magnitudes, but still disasters. Some examples: the American Dust Bowl (winds of dust as a consequence of over farming a dried soil); the rabbits plague in Australia (as a consequence of Thomas Austin's determination to live the life of a traditional Englishman country squire in Oceania); all the leaders that were legitimately voted and became dictators; the Scotland Empire disaster (as a consequence of the Dunning-Kruger effect as well as nationalism fever); Polywater (as a consequence of wishful thinking); millions of people, mainly children, poisoned by lead fuel pollution (as a consequence of Thomas Midgley ambition of making 3cents a gallon). The book could be depressing if it was not so f*cking funny.And still makes me wonder that if we keep making funny will ultimately get even more depressing."
132,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28148681-aurora,1,"The title is misleading. It should be ""MAD MEN"". Of course, you can say - females aren't humans anyway. But yeah. The book is a story what happens when you give the power away and let the mad men decide and rule over other people and resources. No spoiler - egomania and spermotoxicosis hit the mad men's brain and they fuck it all up. There are just 3 honorable mentions of female personages who was trying too, but i don't think they arrived even close: the first is our ancestor monkey female Lucy which is said to have fallen from the tree and brake her bones, my guess is - she most probably was beaten to death by a stick in a hand of the primate male. The second is Kristin, princess of Sweden, who weared men's clothes, yet refused to rule and runned away. The third is mother of a few childish Ottoman sultans. She secretly reigned instead of her mad sons. This mother reminds me of a many unknown women who are behind those world famous leaders. They are mothering them, patiently calming down their tantrums. They are the reason why we still have our planet - raped but still breathing. Without the soft power of those silent workers mad men would fuck it up completely with their hard sticks and bombs already some thousand years ago. So - what we gonna do now, after reading it? Will we just suck it up, with feelings of guilt and shame, while they aren't feeling any?Also i want to say also that i hated this book for its style almost the same as the similar book SAPIENS. I felt the same annoyance as while consuming some Fake News Media produced shows - the dizzyness of being distracted/brainwashed."

I've been someone who ha loved reading for as long as i can remember, however in recent years i have been struggling to find the motivation to read (or to do anything for that matter) so the instances i have read i have tried to explore non-fiction reads as i feel they are both informative and better suited to my current reading pattern as continuity is less important (in most cases). Humans is the first book in a few months that i have successfully completed and i loved every moment reading it. I felt engaged and interested in both the content an the authors portrayal of the events and figures featured in this book.I have explored some of the more critical reviews and agree that the writing style is very informal, full of witticism and sarcasm that had me chuckling throughout. Whilst i agree that the style is informal i disagree that this is a detriment to the book - i dont feel that it distracted from the information in fact i felt it added to the content as there was an air of humor throughout that without which one would probably of had to have put the book down out of frustration towards the incompetency of the human race.The only point of criticism i have is surrounding the end of the book, i felt more could be explicitly said about the current state of the world (rather then briefly hinted at in passing) however this was not the purpose of the book so i can't be too hung up on that.Would recommend to anyone who is looking for an easy and informative read."

Of course there will be those who will scream and quote all possible reasons from the top shelf to prove that Homo sapiens is unique and has achieved a great deal, but the purest truth is that it is also one of the most STUPID animals ever walking on the face of the earth, no other known animal did anything to undermine and destroy everything in their habitat. Phillips proves that many times over, but not in the emotions of doom and gloom instead with great British sense of humor – great job. When talking about extremely hard examples of evil, which is unavoidably accompanied by stupidity of white humans he is direct and critical in his analysis. On the other hand when he writes about Hitler one can see clear parabole to one “orange haired orangutan” guy from New York, however he obstains from making it obvoius to the reader, I guess assuming that the reader is inteligent and will get it, well it is also typical British gamble. I recommend it for anyone who would like to know the history and why is it so f..ked up endlessly ☺"

Humans: A Brief History of How We F*cked It All Up will introduce you to much worse human errors in judgment.We celebrated when our hunter-gatherer ancestors started farming. Wrong! That practice started class divisiveness and wars over land.We romanticized the middle-class Shakespeare fan who brought Henry IV’s starlings to New York City. Wrong! The starlings ate our crops and spread disease like salmonella coast to coast. The starlings’ kinsfolk also killed 62 air travelers in 1960 while forcing a plane to crash land.There are many more examples of unintended consequences here. If you enjoy irony, Humans: A Brief History of How We F*cked It All Up is a gem. It also explains history with an eye to the human factor. Disneyland’s Cinderella’s castle is based on a Bavarian castle created by theatrical set designers at Mad King (really just homosexual) Ludwig’s behest as a tourist attraction. It is ironic that it worked for current and olden day Bavarian sightseers but also for copycat Disney. Killing Ludwig after he had built only three castles was the gaffe here.Other reviewers characterize this book as funny and depressing. However, I think it is empowering knowing that everyone makes mistakes. 4 stars!Thanks to Hanover Square Press and NetGalley for a copy in exchange for my honest review."

I particularly liked that it managed to Segway easily through all the mistakes that are mentioned. Sometimes you barley notice that you have changed subject, and it feels like nothing has changed. It has happened several times that I have had to re-read a page because I did not understand that the book had now moved on. I enjoyed this, though this might not be the same for some people, it's just something that is worth knowing before dedicating to this book. Some things that people may complain about is that there is no beginning, middle or end, with a buildup, and then a slow build down. Everything kind of ‘happens’, starting the flow on the first chapter and finishing when the book finishes. These things are all minor details, that you can get around. One major part of the book, though that is not made clear, is that this book is to read purely for entertainment. There is no way you can look up a historical event, and you would read this book to learn anything in particular. It is a book made purely for enjoyment, and that should be made clearer in my opinion.Due to swearing / sexual content in some areas, I would not recommend this book for people under the age of 12. Besides that, I think that people from various ages would find it entertaining. "

When I picked up this book and read the back cover, I expected a quick and dirty ""greatest hits"" list of embarrassing mistakes recorded in history. (My immediate thought was the Battle of Karansebes -- a ""battle"" in 1788 when a bunch of drunk Austrian soldiers thought they were being attacked by Ottomans and ended up shooting each other -- should be in the book, and it is.) Instead what I read was a pretty comprehensive look at the major man made innovations and catastrophes throughout history, with specific chapters set aside on topics like agriculture, war, democracy, science and technology, etc. It even more or less follows the chronological history of the world, with the first chapter after the introduction being about how human brains developed, followed by the rise of agriculture and the domestication of animals, then of states ruled by leaders, then of states ruled ""democratically,"" then of war and so on. The book is hilarious, surprisingly nuanced and even sometimes optimistic. As I read, I kept an ever increasing list of people I needed to recommend it to, and by the end I could only think of about two people I know that I WOULDN'T recommend it to, and that just because they don't like swearing.So ... don't read this book if you don't like profanity.

The flow of the writing kept me focused, I learn things I did not know about our past. Things that I know tell at work during break time. It's helpful. It's the first time I read a book from this author, I do not know if it is his first book. I have not checked, I confess.I will when I am done writing this all over the place review.

139,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11174449-ella-belakovska,4,"The clue is in the title - this really is a brief history of human civilisation, a whistle stop tour through some of the more hilariously daft mistakes folk have made throughout the ages. Tom Phillips writes in an easy, conversational style and never labours over minute points, producing a very readable book that should have mass appeal. There are several tongue-in-cheek digs at the current political climate, so the book may not age particularly well, however, this doesn't take away from the fun provided in the historical narratives. Fans of Horrible Histories will appreciate the mickey taking of aforementioned stupid mistakes, and there is quite a nod to the butterfly effect theory, as almost all of these mistakes created unintended seismic changes, some of which still resonate today. Sadly, some of these are more shocking than funny, but Phillips himself acknowledges this and signals the doom and gloom appropriately.I finished the book a little over a week ago and am still thinking about some of the details, which is always a sign of an interesting read. It's definitely one to dip back into for a reference, and I'd recommend this for anyone who enjoys history, quirky stories, light reads, social sciences and who has a sense of humour."

For starters, this was an amazing read that I would recommend to anyone that got interest in History and its people while having a sense of humor. Or just wants to loosen up their way of learning something into a more funnier method. This book includes a bunch of jokes which make the specific article even more interesting by giving us the authors opinion. The structure of this book is also really easy to follow and organized starting from the earliest humans to ending of the book with the present time. However the book is specific with its dates and names so if someone is not interested into detailed history than this book might not cut it. Just a last tip is that the author does swear which might upset some people or more importantly be a alarm bell if handing this book to younger children. Some of the authors comments might also upset some people as they are directed to specific people or societies as a whole. Would I recommend this book? Absolutely! While some complex words exist, most are basic English words understood on every level with not to long sentences. It also gives a insight into history and teaches the audience in a fun and engaging manner. "

These are the authors comments about Hitler's personality:“Hitler was actually an incompetent, lazy egomaniac and his government was an absolute clown show. before he became chancellor, he was dismissed as a joke, a pathetic dunderhead.What had been a democracy was suddenly not a democracy anymore.He was obsessed with media and celebrity, and often seems to have viewed himself through that lens. He once described himself as “the greatest actor in Europe” and wrote “I believe my life is the greatest novel in world history”.""Hitler was deeply insecure about his own lack of knowledge, preferring to either ignore information that contradicted his preconceptions, to last out at the expertise of others. He was said to “rage like a tiger” if anybody corrected him. He hated being laughed at but enjoyed it when other people were the butt of the joke. He also craved the approval of those he disdained, and his mood would quickly improve if a newspaper wrote something complimentary about him.”The author could have been describing Mr. Donald Trump.

But it also provides plenty of fascinating history. We start with Lucy falling out of a tree and dying 3.7 million years ago. Phillips discusses how everything we try, farming, raising animals, all lead to generally bad things. Politics, whether it’s a monarchy or a democracy, leads to wars which are always started because at least one person is really stupid. Exploration leads to colonialism which usually leads to millions of deaths including wars over who gets to kill people from which colonies. And although science seems like a great idea, because scientists are humans there are plenty of screwups including scientists inventing weapons like dynamite and the Gatling gun to end wars. But plenty of scientists, like a lot of other humans, are just in it for the money. I have barely touched on the book but you get the idea of the theme. Each chapter has at least a handful of major screwups and one really big one you probably didn’t know anything about. The ultimate question the book asks is can we learn from our mistakes or will we continue to make more screwups. The book is quick reading but very enjoyable and I highly recommend it. "

Direct and to the point. I can't speak highly enough about how much I enjoyed it.

No, seriously, the reason this book is thoroughly enjoyable is because it manages to incorporate the matters of environment, history, politics and science without making the reader snore, and instead narrate a number of events and ""fuckups"" as the author calls it with humour interspersed generously. This achieves the purpose of the book to convey information and simultaneously keeps the reader's nose buried in the pages to spot another jibe. I almost took a month to complete this, mostly because each subchapter began to serve as my nugget of knowledge for the day. The brief list of snippets at the end of each chapter are partly sympathetic and partly hilarious like the one with the Yellow Fever. I think that Thomas Midgley, those Khwarezm and Ottoman sultans and the man who basically bankrupted Scotland were among the worst, along with the Battle of Cadiz. That went well. It's informative and funny, people. It's Sapiens condensed for anyone at all. What more can a book offer?"

Despite being so cynical (especially the ending), it made me feel slightly better about myself. I may make a lot of mistakes, I may not always learn from them, but at least none of my mistakes have lead to the decimation of an entire society.Some of the pacing was a little weird. Many stories were very short and could have benefited from some more details, while others, like the story of Paterson and the colony of Darien seemed to stretch on forever even though the conclusion was obvious given what book they were featured in. I did enjoy the little blurbs at the end of every chapter that drove the point home.I also kind of wish he spent a little more time exploring that patterns that contributed to these stories. I definitely agree with all of his critiques of colonialism, though he could have explored racism involved there beyond just the surface level. There was also no class analysis or critique of how capitalism contributed to these stories. I know it's not necessarily this kind of book, but given Phillips' level of observation, it would not have been out of place either."

More appropriate for your teenager than adultsExtremely entertaining and depressing in equal measure. Do you enjoy history, quirky stories, and social sciences? Well, this could be the book for you. As one would expect from a former Buzzfeed writer, ‘Humans’ has is written in a very informal, conversational style. Tom Phillips packs his book with well researched eclectic examples from human history of our desire to make disastrous mistakes. He presents these in no particular order, and turns the oft-used narrative upside down. By touching upon only the critical elements needed to construct the mental final picture of each historical event, he enriches the text by adding lots of examples to send a compelling message in each chapter.Nish Kumar narrated, which helped to convey the grim sarcastic humour.

There should be no excuse for not being aware of what is happening with politics and the environment and what humans have been doing (and how we've been making awful decisions) for 200,000 (to 3+ million) years.

If all the history books were written like this, there would have been far less people falling asleep in Ms Whites high school history class. Essentially this is a book about failure. The epic fails of history. Because of the subject matter it should be a bleak read, but its delivery mutes that bleakness with its humour. All the way through this work I vacillated from laughing until my face started to leak, and wanting to channel my inner Plath because clearly we are doomed as a species. You frequently want to roll your eyes and sigh Ugh...humans! I learnt some history I was previously unaware of and, thanks to the complete hilarity with which we are presented that history, I thoroughly enjoyed learning it. It keeps you engaged til the very end and leaves you wondering if humans will ever learn from their mistakes…. Ergh...doubtful it seems! Looking forward to reading more from this author."

No one likes stuffy, clinical fact-spewing, but this went a bit too far in the other direction for me, and at times I found myself rolling my eyes at Phillips' jabbering and willing him to just get to the point. On that note, it should be said that the book meanders from point to point in a casual, fairly shallow fashion. Don't expect hard-hitting any analysis here, but a collection of thematically connected stories that make for fun trivia to trot out at dinner parties. Lucky for me, the ""Brief"" in the title isn't ironic; the 'meat' of the book clocks in at a scant ~260 pages, depending on version, so even at its most tedious moments, it never truly overstays it's welcome. Worth a read, but your enjoyment will wholly depend on your tolerance for tongue-in-cheek British humour. "

It took me quite a while to finish it, but that's because there is so much amazing information! In just a few chapters you can go from learning about Christopher Columbus' poorly-planned journey across the Atlantic to Scotland's attempted (and again, poorly thought out) colonial establishment in Panama - Which William Patterson had dubbed Darien and which had *spoiler alert* already been colonized by the Spanish. In the same sitting, you can laugh at Mao Zedong's hilariously failed Four Pests Campaign, Al ad-Din Muhammad II's... disappointing, relationship with Genghis Khan. Overall, this is a fun, light and informative read, as well as a reassuring one, as it tells the tale of a species whose seemingly never-ending trail of mistakes seems to be a 70-thousand year tradition, and one whose history is sure to leave a permanent mark on our world."

Even though I usually find history heavy and hard to follow, he told the stories in a way that made me race through the pages. I liked the way he divided the book into chapters with their own themes, used stories and anecdotes from across the world - not focusing on any continent or peoples.

The author divides it into thematic chapters, where some of the greatest, funniest and most tragic historical fuck-ups are narrated. The idea you are left with at the end is that while humans are capable of great things, they are equally capable, if not more, of being so dumb sometimes it's hard to believe these stories, yet they are true. The whole book is an easy read thanks to the author's ability to talk about historical happenings as human tales and the tone, even when some tragic shit is being told, will make you laugh out loud. Yet towards the end of the book a personal reflection of the author puts everything in perspective, making the reader realise how humans can forget about past mistakes and make them all over again in cycles. Will we ever be able to learn for good?"

Some of the events described are historical but the author was not prepared to let any lack of research stop a good story. I found myself smiling in a number of places and chuckling in a few but I can't say it was a knee-slapper. Still I enjoyed it and there are a number of good plot ideas hiding between the covers. If you read this, be prepared for a bit of sermonizing among the anecdotes. The author's politics are on the far left and sometimes he gets preachy. In particular he doesn't care much for older white males but that doesn't matter. It's easy to just shrug and read on. If you enjoy reading about mistakes on a grand scale, you'll find plenty of them here. The book is well written and overall I think it's worth reading.

It really is genuinely funny and the perfect combination of laughs and political put-downs. I especially enjoyed how the last chapter, without saying it outright, makes it obvious just how often humans fail to understand the dire consequences of their decisions, their inventions or their lack of response. Perhaps the book doesn't paint the most positive picture of us as a species, but then again, perhaps our ability to laugh at ourselves can be considered our one saving grace.

But the proof is in the pudding; humans pretty much find ways to screw up no matter how hard we try. I'd say the main gist of the book is something along the lines of ""think REALLY hard about what might happen if you make this choice...and then come to terms with the fact that something will probably happen that you didn't even conceive of and you'll botch something somehow"". Not to say that the author communicated that humans are all evil or anything, but we don't think. Or we think selfishly. Or we think of convenience for today but fail to realize that we're just a blip on the timeline of history and consequences of our actions (however small they may seem) will keep playing themselves out.

Mostly it was a fun and fascinating romp. Missing might be criminal blunders though I know many books cover that topic.Generally, the book was fun and exciting and did a pretty good job meshing facts with humor. A few critiques would be the timeline jumps, which were confusing. It would be better if he explicitly labeled the events and page breaks by their dates. The brief detour into neuroscience was fine, but a little out of place and seemed odd it was basically just introduced once. Kudos that he laid into humor without resorting to cursing in every sentence. Also, some stories were fantastic. My favorites were the stories about stupid science (obvi), the Genghis khan diplomacy breach, and the depiction of Hitler that’s a bit too Trump-like and his shout out at the end.

Unfortunately, at times the experience is undermined by him trying too hard to be funny/snarky, or by some short but unnecessary political rants. Anyone who is well-versed in history will already be familiar with much of the content*, but there were still a few more obscure little tidbits.

I enjoy the combination of humour and historical events/people that aren't taught in classroom or textbooks. With events ranging from 70,000 years ago to modern times, there were so many different events that occurred that I had never heard of (or dreamed could happen). I also enjoyed how it wasn't centered on European history, it did capture inexplicable and hard-to-believe events from around the globe. Some events, and individuals, do get a more in-depth description than others (such as William Paterson aka ""The Man Who Broke Scotland""). Sometimes the descriptions and explanations for some events felt a tad long for my taste, but overall I would highly recommend this book be added to everyone's summer reading list. "

If I had one criticism it's that it would have been nice if he ended on a little more optimistic tone, especially since I was reading this in the middle of a pandemic where his thesis of humanity's proclivity for fucking things up very much applies. It's sort of depressing to end with the author telling you we're just going to fuck things up again only to see his proclamation fulfilled by people rejecting science on a daily basis leading directly to the loss of life.

From Lucy falling out of her tree, to the numerous weapons makers who believed that their creation would stop wars, all the inventors whose creation caused millions of deaths while their companies got wealthier and wealthier. I found Humans sad, but amusing. Without most of these f*ck-ups, we probably wouldn’t have the lifestyle we have today, but at what cost?I urge everyone to read this book. It is a wonderful read. "

Covers a large swathe of human history, but without drilling down much past the details and context required to anchor each story into the narrative, allowing the reader to shake their head in a mixture of amusement and dismay at our species' stupidity. Oh, and with a few jabs at the current state of world affairs thrown in for good measure.It's not a literary masterpiece, and the humour won't be to everyone's taste. One to avoid if you are not the type to enjoy wry, snarky looks at humanity's many failings."

This book detail and explain very well how we reached this point, our planet has been dominated by tyrants who destroyed recklessly our right and values.

It is a depressing thought that humans are really good at messing things up, but it is a sobering thought as well. We are here today because of all the mistakes our ancestors made, and the mistakes we make will change our world for future generations. My only complaint is that it wasn't longer.

I could not put it down due to its insightful recollection of the details of our history told in a concise yet historically hilariously accurate way. This book talks of all the fantastic failures of human history which have largely been told as success and evidence of our achievement as a species, but with delightful sarcastic British humour. It reads like a John Oliver Last Week Tonight episode, but covers all of human history. With undertones of how all of these glorious achievements in the name of advancing our intelligence, experience and insights were really just a bunch of crazy ideas, egotistic meniacle behaviour and over confident salesmanship turned into blood baths, spreading of disease, speculative investment failures, and destroying our environment to the point of collapse. The ending sums it up so well where we will just be trapped inside our own prison made of our own waste circling around us as space junk that will turn into projectile missiles that will ultimately lead to our collapse as a civilization (My prediction is that the planet goes on to regenerate itself for the next lot of species with out us.)"

I do agree. But interestingly enough, though he gives some examples from early days in USA or Sweden, and of course Nazi-Germany, he somewhat forgets to list actions of so called pro-choice movements, which among others, call to kill unborn children with, e.g., genetic disorders; as a result, e.g., there was only one (?) child with Down syndrome born in Denmark last year!And I guess the book could be easily 10 as long if we only wanted to list more epic failures."

Even though I don’t particularly like historical books, I really enjoyed this one, and though it’s about how people and humans have and are constantly screwing up, the writer’s comic way of narrating it has lightened things a-bit. This book as saddening as it can be , I think it highlights the fact the screwing up and making mistakes is part of of the human nature. So if you ever feel like a total loser and complete idiot, just pick up this book and pretty soon you’ll feel a lot better about yourself as the writer says at the beginning “ I dedicate to anybody who has ever f*cked up really badly.

Perhaps the early ones were inevitable but subsequent ones were just through ignorance. Unfortunately, I fear, human nature , as perhaps highlighted by this book, does not have an aptitude to learn from one's own mistakes, let alone those who have gone before.

The book was published in the late spring of 2018 and was written by Tom Phillips,who uses accurate historical citing along with colorful language to keep the reader engaged as he recites the story of humankind’s idiotic decisions and the accidental mistakes that occurred between circa 10,000 BCE and the present day, from prehistoric Africa to New York City in the 1920s. Many major historical figures such as Genghis Khan, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Adolf Hitler have their tale recounted but among them are also some lesser known creatures and people like Lucy, an Australopithecus afarensis who fell out of a tree and died. The book focuses almost exclusively on the mistakes of humankind and how the road to disaster is often paved with good intent, but there is an underlying theme of perseverance.Personally, I absolutely adore this book. Not only was it educational and thorough with its content, but it conveyed that information in a way that was made it feel as though the book was tailored to be read by a reader like me. It would not have been nearly as enjoyable if the writing had not been the way it was; fluid as though it were being spoken aloud to me and with small bits and pieces of humor and exaggeration where they felt appropriate. Conversely, I think that the writing was the biggest flaw of the book because of how well it suited me. Philips writing style and what he wrote in Humans mainly appeals to my generation, Gen Z, and to millennials which would could cause other older readers or future readers to feel uncomfortable while reading the book. Overall, Humans: A Brief History of How We F*cked it All Up was a worthwhile read and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for an informative and entertaining read."

Rarely do you find a novel so informative, filled with every discipline from history, psychology, and anthropology to chemistry and engineering, which is so f**king hilarious. 'Humans' is not all fun and games, however - Phillips makes sure that readers understand that, while disastrously funny, the mistakes of mankind's past are not without consequences. Socially, environmentally, and geographically, we have truly fucked up this planet, and unless things change significantly, the future looks even more bleak than the past for humans. I would recommend this book to everyone, if not to learn about the quirky and curious blunders of the past, then to hear and understand the warnings about mistakes we will inevitably make in the future."

The title and the cover clearly refer to Harari’s “Sapiens”. The similarity is not totally coincidental. The author traces humanity’s history not through its finest moments (as in Harari), but rather by recalling the less glorious ones. The cases are embedded in history and the book’s entertainment value is thus not fictitious, but entirely due to the author’s light pen, which is sometimes hard to believe, given the nature of some of the f*ck ups described. A delightful way of learning interesting historical facts for the less studious fans of history. For the more serious scholars the selection of cases may appear somewhat haphazard, but this should not detract from enjoying this book, as is."

218,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18975218-joe,5,A great entertaining read. Basically it poses the question do humans ever learn from their mistakes or those of others. The answer is a resounding no with a dash of hope that some day they will. The author references many examples for instance the decision to build the great wall of China and Brexit. Other examples range from the ludicrous to the tragic. Well worth the few hours it takes to read. 
219,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4568901-avid,3,"Parts of this book were really interesting. Other parts were really not. Also, the writing style is distracting - lots of passive voice and past perfect tense. Sometimes it worked to make the tone casual and chatty, but we often end up with sentences like this: “the trouble with that is that, because of the speed objects in orbit are moving at, a collision becomes incredibly destructive”. (p 280, paperback) It makes for a cumbersome read. "

The book starts off by describing some heuristics we use when processing information, then gives countless examples of judgment errors humans made throughout history. The examples Tom Phillips used to illustrate his points were not bogged down by details so it was an easy read. I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoyed Sapiens. I cannot believe I never heard of Thomas Midgley before reading this."

It similarly chronicles the history of humankind, but this time focusing on all the mistakes we made along the way. I liked that it discussed failures from small (like the first monkey that fell out of a tree) to big (like the entire concept of colonialism) and how they made huge, lasting impacts on our world. I had not heard about a lot of these events, and it was eye-opening to learn that so much of how the world operates today actually stems from someone's fuck-up decades or centuries before! However, I sometimes felt like the depth of the contents was compromised for comedy's sake, leaving several moments where I craved for more detail on what happened. So don't go in expecting the level of depth that Sapiens includes: this is more of an entertaining read that wants to cheer you up on a bad day and give you comfort knowing that plenty of people fucked up far more than you.

289,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89928375-tom,4,Tom Phillips has written a very entertaining and informative book. I knew some or parts of stories that he documents but this book gives a much more comprehensive answer. The final chapter alone makes the book wothwhile with penultimate final conclusion.

It recounts various foibles and failings of humans over the centuries into modern times. It doesn't follow any particular path but goes from topic to topic. A quick, fun and engaging story. "

It's never going to be an exhaustive list of humanity's f-up's, but it's certainly a broad-ranging taste of exemplars that will have you shaking your head at our endless foolishness across thousands of years."

294,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97109361-tom,5,Brilliant bookThis book started off as not my cup of tea but by the second chapter I was loving it. Such a funny book while telling important history lessons of the world we live in. Thanks Tom for writing this great book

This was the rare book I could enjoy both on and off an airplane.Also, I will never look at a cop movie with a car chase in an air conditioned movie theater the same way again. "

On the surface, an ill omen for the future of humanity, but on the flip side, it means people have been doing stupid things for a long time and yet we find a way to muddle through."

But, frankly, it's not exactly been plain sailing, and sometimes - just occasionally - we've managed to really, truly, quite unbelievably f*ck things up."
