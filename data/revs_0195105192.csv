0,0195105192,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12946199-will,5,"This is the ideal book to read during the last years at school, or early in an undergraduate degree. School maths is often about understanding mathematical concepts intuitively via rote learning, repetition and visualization. This book teaches you how mathematical knowledge is arrived at by looking carefully at a few simple ideas and building upon them.This book is also ideal reading for anybody who wants to improve their general mathematical literacy. Perhaps many people who don't know much about mathematics think that it is about arithmetic or calculation - it is easy to get that impression when school mathematics centers mostly around solving uninteresting problems, which often involve a lot of calculation.This book shows that mathematics is about understanding the properties and behaviour of mathematical objects. What are numbers? Why do they behave the way they do when we carry out operations on them? Why can some shapes be constructed with ruler and compass, but some not?The book requires patience and time to read. Don't read it if you are in a hurry."
1,0195105192,http://goodreads.com/user/show/849366-dave-h,4,"""The difficulty is that it is easy to prove a problem is easy, but hard to prove that it is hard!""I'm probably not unique in that I made it through a lot of math without ever really understanding what I was doing, just flipping equations around until an answer poured out. I had a trigonometry professor who at least pushed understanding what you were doing. It was in my first semester of the calculus that math started to make sense. ""What Is Mathematics?"" was a clear inspiration for some of the lectures in that course. This book ties it all up with a nice bow. The long chapter on maxima and minima -- went on long, I was ready to put the book down and then it made this brilliant transition to the calculus.I'm sure the more math you've had, the more you will get out of this book -- some sections may be rough if you haven't had some trig and the calculus and I was a little lost more than once anyway."

3,0195105192,http://goodreads.com/user/show/655723-nick-black,5,"Wow, that was absolutely beautiful! Thanks for the heads-up, Alex! I really, really wish I'd have had this book back as a senior or junior in high school; I'd have been able to plan out my math classes early on much better (why on earth did I take Dynamics and Bifurcations?!?! and how did I avoid taking a serious vector spaces/manifold calculus class? would have been nice for upper-level physics! oh well!). I think this will be my default high school graduation present to anyone with an inkling of mathematical talent from now on (rather than the more intimidating Road to Reality, which likely just frightens people).As they said in Mathematical Review, ""A work of extraordinary perfection."""
4,0195105192,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28612264-shaun-zhang,5,"This is a magnificent book for laymen who want to know about mathematics. This is a sensational book for amateurs who wish to widen and deepen understanding of mathematics. This is an indispensable book for educators who need to find wonderful examples to inspire children and students. Everyone does not want to miss this.I especially love the geometry part of this book, which contains chapter 3, 4 & 7. Chapter 3 introduces the ruler and compass construction. This chapter firstly discusses the classical geometry of Des Cartes, namely how to construct the finite sums, differences, products, quotients and square roots of given line section. Then explains the construtable problems. Finally proves the impossibilities of the three ancient famous classical construction problems, squaring the circle, doubling the cube and angle trisection, which cost mathematicians hundreds of years to finally figure out. Readers will be stunned by the connection between algebraic fields and classical geometry, which is an important subject named group theory in modern mathematics.Chapter 4 talks about geometries beyond Euclidean. Readers' recognition about what the geometry is will be totally subverted by finding out that shape, length and area of a figure might not be intrinsic. Put in another word, one might never distinguish a square from a rectangle and never measure a unique value of its side length or area. Actually, these concepts are undefined in some geometries. Felix Klein defines geometry in Erlangen program as a subject studying the invariant properties of space under group transformations. Projective geometry, studying the invariant properties of space under projection, is one of the most famous and intriguing geometries. (Actually, projective geometry directly leads to the definition from Klein.) In projective geometry, dual roles of line and point make it extremely interesting. Readers will enjoy it from homogeneous coordinate and conic curves. Moreover, authors give a very brief introduction to Riemannian and pseudo Riemannian geometry. The most general, abstract geometry, which contain all other geometries, named topology, is the main topic of Chapter 5, which is surely interesting and readable but I will not talk about it.Chapter 7 shows some famous extreme values problems in geometry. If those two chapters relate geometry to algebra, then this chapter relates it to analysis. Readers will see how differential calculus and method of variation play the significant role in such problems. Both of which have strong geometric intuitions and applications. The method of variation has been applied to solving problems in optics, classical mechanics, and now relativity and quantum mechanics. Soap film problem is such a very interesting and even artistic example because readers can easily conduct experiments and find out how beautiful the mathematics is. The mean curvature is natural to describe in minimum surface, and has great implications in geometric analysis, a fresh and active study subject."
5,0195105192,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7915393-simon-mcleish,5,"This is a book which changed my life. I originally read it when I was 17, and it was the book which confirmed to me that I wanted to study mathematics at university. Re-reading it now, it is a clear and inspiring look at a wide range of interesting mathematics, presenting an elementary view of how it is viewed from a university (rather than a high school) perspective. Some parts are a little dated - even when I read it in the 1980s, the amount of geometrical expertise expected was much more than was present in the O and A level syllabus. The equivalent today would probably include a lot more about logic, as the basis for computer science. But I still found myself getting interested all over again in parts of the subject I haven't thought about for years."
6,0195105192,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1824287-benjamin,5,This is one of the best high school level extensions in mathematics. Originally called -Mathematics for Lori - it was written for his daughter.
7,0195105192,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40270645-milica,5,"In another life, many many moons ago, I received this book as a gift from an English math professor I met on a plane. It was not a completely haphazard encounter: we were both on our way back from the Hong Kong IMO. I was a contestant (not a really successful one), and he was an elderly member of the committee... I did not realize who he was during our pleasant conversation; I only learned that from our team leader after we landed in Frankfurt and parted way with the British contingent. In a couple of weeks, this book arrived in the mail :DIt was my second ""real math"" book. When I say *real* math, I mean that it was not a problem book or a textbook, but it explored the history and reasoning behind all the ideas I held so dear to my heart and mind. The first one was about Platonic solids ... This one is about Mathematics as a whole ... I will always cherish the afternoons spent going over this book, figuring out both Math and English. I cannot even remember most of the math covered consciously -- but I remember the feeling... For some reason I do Math for a living now, so it must be that some of the ideas in Courant's book stuck. If you are in high-school, there are probably books which would be more modern in exposition -- you should probably look into one of those. If you are a bit more ""advanced"" math-lover, you will appreciate the patina in the text and the weight behind the name ""Courant"".  "
8,0195105192,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13421432-eddie,3,"I wanted to like this book. I really did. But it's just too old. It will never be a classic; it's just outdated. There are references to ongoing problems to solve Hilbert's 10th problem, but no acknowledgement of Alan Turing's contributions (probably because his work was still classified or unknown at the time of publication). Godel's ""recent work on incompleteness"" is a footnote to the summary of Russell's ""great work"", which made me snicker. The notation is pretty bad as well. Many of the fonts are difficult to read, and some of the shorthand is less than modern. This may have been a good introduction/refresher at some point in time, but there have to be better books out there now. For one, your time would be better spent reading Heath's translation of Euclid. Some day I hope to make time for The Princeton Companion to Mathematics. I'll see how it compares. "
9,0195105192,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12338541-walker-rowe,5,"This book has risen to the top to be one of my favorite math books. The other is David Foster Wallace's book on Infinity. What makes them fun are these are prose books on math. The rigor is there but you do not need to work through the actual with a pencil and paper. Instead the author walks you through the logic.You will find this book very difficult at times. But that's the point. It's fun to be challenged. You don't need any knowledge of advanced math to read this book. What makes it fun is that the author walks you through the most famous proofs in all of mathematics simplifying them to simple equations that you can solve in your head. Some of these are difficult and you will need to pull out paper and pencil. But there is a lot of joy in understanding, for example, how the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem works or what is an algebraic expression."
10,0195105192,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46199633-phil-filippak,1,"I am strongly disappointed with this book. I think it only delayed my progress in mathematics. And here's why: written supposedly for non-mathematicians it contains so many abstract concepts and strict reasoning that it's virtually impossible to apprehend it being a person with a non-technical background (put aside that I work as a software developer for almost 5 years now). For me, the book is more like Wikipedia than like a guide for newcomers.My point is that for a novice, a tour into something new should contain hooks tying new ideas to the person's previous experience. And this book doesn't provide such approach at all."
11,0195105192,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15504857-ron-banister,4,"One of my favorite books on mathematics. Also, one of Einstein's favorites."
12,0195105192,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8482935-cm,2,"So I returned the book after page 65.The premise is promising: bridging high school and college mathematics by going through all major areas of mathematics from scratch and showing everything in proof with exercise problems. While one can learn a lot of the actual rationale behind the mathematical principles we study with rote learning (like why we get a positive number from multiplying two negative numbers), the explanation ,for this reader, is often too technical and requires multiple reading to follow its logic....and this reader here is already doing more than quite well in high school calculus. Yet, there are times when this reader spent the whole evening to get through 2 pages... The lack of any tip for the exercise here is not helping either. As a book to bring expertise knowledge to the public, it's hard to see why the author decided to convey his content in this dry, technical tone.The author did suggest readers to skip all the harder parts and enjoy the journey but, argh, just so frustrating."
13,0195105192,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50886376-ankush-rajput,4,"Passed a lot of math courses but failed to make any sense out of them ? If your answer is yes, this book is for you. As Albert Einstein said this book is a lucid representation of fundamental concepts and methods of whole field of mathematics.But, it is not a casual mathematics history book which you can flip through at leisure. It is a serious read involving actual mathematics and should be treated as a reference book and should be refrenced from time to time, specially if you are in high school or college."
14,0195105192,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112613522-alan-chan,5,Everyone who's interested in Math should read this book.
15,0195105192,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64548275-parsa,4,"Q. what is this book about? As a first approximation, here are the(abridged) contents of the book(more on all of these later): Chapter 1 : natural numbers(intuitive ""definition"" of integers, representations of integers in non-decimal bases. mathematical induction and proofs of geometric and arithmetical series based on the principle of induction.Elementary number theory(congruence, divisibility etc.) Chapter 2: number systems(definitions of Q and R(not formal definitions, but reasonably well-explained), cardinality of reals. complex numbers and operations with them, algebraic and transcendental numbers. Chapter 3 : geometrical constructions(limits of ruler and compass constructions, proofs of the impossibility of two of the three famous Greek construction problems(trisecting and angle and all that) Chapter 4: mainly projective geometry, remarks on non-euclidean geometries, discussion of the axiomatic method. Chapter 5: Basics of Topology. Chapter 6: functions and limits Chapter 7: Maximum and minimum problems Chapter 8 : Differential and integral calculus----------------------------------------- Q. how rigorous is the book? A. varies chapter by chapter. Generally, the proofs are provided, but they are not absolutely rigorous. Sometimes, the proofs are merely hinted at, this can be seen particularly on the chapter on Topology.-------------------------- Q. how difficult is the book? A. Again, varies chapter by chapter. But this is mainly a consequence of the changes in mathematics education since the book was published. I think that the chapters on geometry, especially chapter 4, were quite difficult, but I think that this is partly because of the lack of proper education in geometry in current school curricula. Some other chapters, by contrast, were easy. Indeed, I only skimmed chapters 6 and 8 because I felt I was already familiar with most of the content.-------------------------- The title might be misleading. One might think that this is a book that talks about mathematics, without any actual mathematics being done. This is not the case. This can mostly be thought of as an ordinary textbook on elementary mathematics. Now, by this I don't mean that the contents are easy or shallow, they are not. You could say that the book is a response to the question : "" What happens if you start thinking more deeply about certain areas of high-school mathematics?"" There are however, some small philosophical and historical sketches, but this does not make it a philosophy of mathematics book.  My main problem with the book was the over-emphasis on classical geometry. Although it is a beautiful subject, and I learnt many things that I'm certain I would not have known about in a standard undergraduate curriculum(say, projective geometry), It is far-removed from most of the modern undergraduate mathematics curriculum, and seems to me to be almost a dead subject. This is not, by itself, a problem. But I was reading this book mostly to prepare for university mathematics, and I Don't think that it did a very good job in that. However, in some ways, This was a type of book I had always wished to have read. I always had the suspicion that my knowledge of elementary mathematics was woefully incomplete, and there are certainly many deep theorems and beautiful results to be found there. Indeed, there are, and you can find them in this book."
16,0195105192,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15785230-paulo-glez-ogando,5,"This is a good book to read in your first years in the maths degree, even for prospective mathematics students who wants an advance of how university mathematics are. I think this is a high school level extension, but a very strong extension. Besides, Courant and Robbins give their opinion about the necessity of the mathematical concepts and ideas, just as their location in Mathematics, understanding these as an interconnected discipline.The edition I read is a revision by Ian Stewart, who added some commentaries and wrote extensions to several of the chapters in the light of recent progress (well, recent in 1996 when this edition was published).The chapters are almost entirely independent of one another, each one about a different mathematical topic, like natural numbers, ruler and compass contructions, projective geometry, topology, calculus or the number system. Often the beginning is easier to understand, and then the path leads gradually upward. A reader who wants only a general vision may be content with a selection of material, avoiding the more detailed discussions.It's a book not to read in a day. It requires time and patience. You will need paper and pencil near you. And to really enjoying it you have to have certain previous knowledge in issues like trigonometry or calculus. If not, you can be a little lost sometimes... but there is always the chance to jump the darkest paragraphs and continue later.The book includes many exercises proposed to the advanced reader, some are easier and some a bit more difficult. The authors come out with them between discussiones, and Ian Stewarts add a bunch of them at the end of the book."
17,0195105192,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36744598-isaac-lambert,4,"lots of interesting things to ponder in here, especially for an PhD dropout. I most enjoyed the problems I haven't worked rigorously before- see e.g. knot theory, soap bubbles, and Steiners problems. what keeps me from giving this book a five is it switching in between:-material I find pretty basic- such as the introduction of calculus, and prim d-material which is hazy and I've mostly covered before, such as complex numbers or topology-material which is fascinating, and I want to try and follow the proofs, but they aren't too 100% rigor- such as the Prime Number Theorem-material which blew me away (the railway rod problem) but then in the appendix of recent developments we are told the solution is wrongi was given this book a long time ago. if I had the bandwidth to read something like this in highschool, if I could have handled it, it would have been eye opening. now, it gives me more of a feeling of my past life, which parts of me miss, but is also long gone."
18,0195105192,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20845184-michael-cayley,4,"The book covers a broad range of topics in (mainly pure) maths. It should be comprehensible to anyone who has done the equivalent of UK ""A"" Level maths. To get the most out of it, you need to be willing to concentrate hard - explanations are clear but sometimes at a breathless pace - and to tackle some of the exercises. The most technical parts are clearly flagged up as optional reading. For anyone wanting to go beyond school maths, or about to embark on a maths course at university, the book will be invaluable.If I have a quibble, it is that the exercises and some parts of the book are printed in smallish type which my (ageing) eyes had difficulty coping with, especially when it came to subscripts and superscripts, some of which I could not decipher. In places the notation - for instance some symbols used in relation to sets - is outmoded, but this is not a significant problem."
19,0195105192,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108520747-parham-hasani,5,"+A clear explanation of Basic Math. it's sweet as a Novel, with enough Example(not less not more).I think it's good for Bachelor's students in Engineering or computer science.- while it's a good book, there are two negative points: 1. some subfields such as ""Combination, Graph theory, Numerical Analysis, Optimizing, linear algebra, ..."" are dismissed. 2.this is a little old-fashion and maybe today's teenagers avoid reading it."
20,0195105192,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100277937-laura,4,I liked it! I could relate to much of the writing angst and decisions about stepping away from the novel writing. Not sure I’d recommend it for non-writers though.
21,0195105192,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9644972-craig-citro,5,"I loved this book. My quick summary would be ""this is all the parts of a high school/undergrad math curriculum that so often get lost.""The book consists of an overview of much of mathematics through what's normally taught in the first ~two years of undergrad, with a few extra bonuses (projective geometry!), but with little to no linear algebra (boo!). The book spends nearly all its time focusing on motivations and ideas, and much less on mechanical details. This is a sharp contrast to most undergrad classes, where lack of time means the professor ends up working plenty of examples and hoping the quick tour of big ideas sticks. (It never does, but we always try.)This book would be the perfect supplement for a mathematically-inclined undergrad who wanted a bit of context and history; I think it could be good for an eager and interested high-schooler, though it wouldn't hurt to have someone on hand to help talk things through.Of course, a few bits didn't age as well as they could, eg the commentary about infinitesimals was a bit more awkward in light of the development of nonstandard analysis. Can't fault Courant and Robbins for not predicting the future, of course; the new final chapter does a great job of these sorts of updates.I'm sad it took me so long to read this book -- I'd seen it a zillion times, and I think my old roommate even had a copy in our dorm, but I'd never cracked it open. I wish I had, both for my own enjoyment and to recommend to others. I was finally turned on to it while reading http://pauli.uni-muenster.de/~munsteg... (which is worth its own review); I'm now more excited about reading the rest of the books listed there."
22,0195105192,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23477493-unknown,4,"I did not read it carefully and slowly. At first, I thought that this book is about the history of math according to some description on a website. I started reading it and discovered that it explains a great deal of math concepts in real great way and good amount of details. I think I need to re-read it sometimes again because I really liked it. My overall experience with this book is great. It basically explains what is mathematical equations and concepts in a great and simple way. But I think if you wants to read it, you should have some level of understanding the concepts in the book before looking at them. "
23,0195105192,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5174097-a,3,"This is a heavy book. Literally and figuratively. This book went way over my head in the discussion of mathematics. I would recommend it to college math professors, but not many other people. It does have some interesting background, but many of those background stories are found in other books as well. Too mathy for me."

The author tries to cover most topics in mathematics which is daunting at first. The algebra and analysis parts of the book are well written and full of insights especially for those who love mathematics as a whole and not just from a practical point of view. I suggest the book for high school students with a stronger background and university students who want to know about other more advanced parts of math without sinking in the ocean of technicalities.I strongly recommend a part of the book about fractals which is more abstract but worth taking a look at. This book is more like a poem book for me, sometimes when I want to take a rest I read a random part of it."
