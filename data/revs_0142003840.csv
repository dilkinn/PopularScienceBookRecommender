I find it hard to digest holistic overview approaches when used by a philosopher to prove his point. Let me say at the outset that I never studied philosophy (although I did study mathematical logic) and I haven't read much in the field either, and that my criticism is that of a writer and an enthusiastic reader who's always curious. The few classic philosophy texts that I've read in the past held me from start to finish, like a good novel does, and cajoled me into understanding where the philosopher is coming from and what it is he's trying to achieve. What I like about that is that the philosophy is argued within the realm of philosophy - logical thought arguments. More modern approaches seem to be overly scientific in that they actually need to site latest developments or discoveries from the hard sciences such as physics or neurobiology to...well, to sort of validate themselves. Like arguing for the sake of arguing within the parameters of the available knowledge in their field is.. pointless. I don't know if this is true, or a general shift in the field of modern philosophy, but reading it in these bestseller-type books is exceptionally boring to me. Besides, the eastern civilizations have, for centuries, approached the 'big questions' holistically - and they've done a brilliant job at explaining the universe without the scientific method or modern technology. So if philosophers and scientists have an itch in their pants to need to tackle these grand cosmic questions using their western tools, at least write about it bearing in mind that I'm a pea brain who likes digestible chunks of information without repetition, over explanation, mathematics, references... I mean, seriously, either stick to your academic papers or take a damn writing workshop if you insist on tormenting me with your rhetoric, you just might publish something worth reading outside academia."

He shows that determinism is no enemy of free will. He disproves quantum consciousness. He justifies using the intentional stance in a deterministic universe, then uses this handy tool to explain when and how free will arises as an human adaptation.He also defends the morality of investigating the scientific validity of free will. He also investigates some of the moral consequences that arise when we apply the tools of science to the problem of free will."
2,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2344676-neil,2,"I tend to defer to authors when reading a book by someone, you know, smarter than me, but I'm fairly certain that this is one of the worst books I've ever read. If you read and liked this book, email me or message me on this website or something. I never bother to write reviews, but I've trudged through this book for a month now, and I hated it, so I feel compelled to write my feelings somewhere, and I'd love to hear from someone who tells me I misunderstood.Here's the book's central concern, and it's one of those things that I used to think about and worry about and then just stopped caring about because it's an insoluble waste of time: we all make decisions, or whatever, but who is ""we?"" I am a product of genes and environment and I have nothing to do with those, and even those have nothing to do with themselves, and in fact the circumstances which allow a situation to happen are unbelievably complicated and may have nothing at all to do with ""us."" In fact maybe when you know like when whatever subatomic particles collided all the way back when, the future was already determined; they rebounded according to whatever path physical laws forced them to, and then we decided on chicken for dinner tonight. But we didn't decide. The decision was made the second the universe started. Our consciousness is an illusion.I don't care to retype a lot of passages from Dennett's book, but here's what I think are a couple of key ones. From ""Will the Future be like the Past?"" in ch. 3 (p. 94 in my edition), in response to a straw-man critic insisting (as I assume many people will, since I did over and over again throughout the margins) that Dennett is not answering the question we picked up the books for:""...Very well, if you insist. Maybe there is a sense of possible in which Austin could not possibly have made that very putt, if determinism is true. Now why on earth should we care about your question?""Why wouldn't people care about this question? I mean, I long since threw up my hands because who cares, but -- after reading, in The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins, an account of Dennett's interesting ""skyhook v. crane"" argument re: something from nothing and the idea of God -- I thought this book could interestingly consider another spiraling, hope-nobody-mentions-it-when-you're-high-or-you're-all-going-to-freak-the-fuck-out philosophical riddle. The reason people wonder about all that is because people like to envision that we all know what good and bad is and that we make the choices ourselves, that we can blame Osama bin Laden for September 11 in a way we couldn't blame a comet falling through both towers. Your insistence that you could answer is why I, and presumably anyone, picked up this book.Here is a piece of his conclusion (from ""'Thanks, I needed that'"" in the last chapter, on p. 302 in my edition):""Yes, luck figures heavily in our lives, all the time, but since we know this, we take the precautions we deem appropriate to minimize the untoward effects of luck, and then take responsibility for whatever happens... [guy who did something bad:] can...face the much more demanding task of constructing a future self that has this terrible act of omission in its biography... This is indeed an opportunity for a Self-Forming Action of the sort Kane draws to our attention, and we human beings are the only species that is capable of making them, but there is no need for them to be undetermined.""Why, Dennett, is this a self-forming action? If someone wants to pick themselves up by the bootstraps, whence that? Was it not in their genes, maybe roused in them by inspiring speeches from their father or encouraging notes from a teacher? Would they not likely have turned out differently if they'd been starved in a basement and beaten all their lives? I just don't get it. So many things he wrote seemed so obtuse that I wondered if I was simply stupid to not understand them. The whole ""Life World"" thing? I mean, just because it appears to us, in taking a large-scale view, that things are happening differently on this large scale, does not mean that it isn't simply happening according to the laws we impose, in the same way that us feeling consciousness does not mean we are somehow disobeying the law of physics. And then there's the whole quantum indeterminacy thing. I can't say anything about this, but neither, it seems to me, does Dennett. Dennett doesn't ally with the libertarians who just use this as a way to say ""see we're totally free because scientists can't pinpoint electrons"" but it still hangs there as his only possible exception to physical laws governing the universe.I guess I could go on, but it'd just be a random jumble of thoughts on the various claims he makes throughout the book. Perhaps you can claim that my random jumble shows I didn't understand the book, but I'd say my thoughts are like that because the book's in such disarray. Seriously, if anyone out there really liked this book or wishes to tell me how I'm wrong, I'd be eager to hear from you.(I gave the book two stars because Dennett is obviously deeply intelligent and widely-read and thoughtful and it's not a useless read like an awful novel; though I disliked like the book itself, I don't think it was a complete waste of time, per se.)"
3,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175748-thermalsatsuma,5,"We live in a deterministic universe. Drop an apple and it will reliably fall to the ground, knock a snooker ball (or an atom) into another one at a particular speed and angle and you can predict the paths of both of them. Even the strange sub-atomic quantum realm operates within areas of probability that average out to give us the predictable effects that we can measure on larger scales.As Douglas Hofstadter argues in 'Godel, Escher, Bach' our brains are composed of neurons with the simple function of switching off and on in response to the inputs from their neighbours and thus can be considered as formal systems acting in a deterministic fashion. Determinism implies that given a particular configuration of particles in the universe (including the states of the neurons in our brains) there is only one possible state that the system can advance at the next tick of the cosmic clock. How can the absolute inevitability of all things be reconciled with the sense of free will that we all experience?It's a tricky question, and one that Dennett does not shy away from confronting in this book. It's a question that makes some people very nervous - if we don't have free will then what is the point of anything? Dennett likens this to Dumbo the elephant who believes that he can only fly when holding his magic feather until a pesky crow points out that the feather is not needed - stop that crow! Needless to say, Dennett sees himself in the role of the crow questioning the magic feathers that we insist on clinging onto.He squares the circle by first explaining exactly what determinism is and what it implies, beginning with simple mathematical models such as Conway's Life game and chess playing computers, and then shown how rational agents can develop 'evitability' within such systems. He then argues that natural selection of both our brains and the cultural memes that govern our lives have given rise to consciousness and free will, as well as concepts such as morality and altruism that initially seem at odds with 'red in tooth and claw' style Darwinism. If the book has any faults, it is that Dennett spends quite a lot of the time trying to anticipate the arguments that will be raised in objection to his thesis, thus making some of the early chapters somewhat convoluted in their presentation as he defines what determinism and free will are not before moving on to give his own ideas.Absolutely fascinating, and full of optimism for our ability to pull ourselves up by the bootstraps of our own consciousness."
4,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1062388-dylan,4,"I was interested in this book because of the hypocritical inconsistency exhibited by many secular types who, reasonably enough, deny the existence of ""God"" but bristle at the prospect that we all live in a completely determined universe. They (and I include myself here) reflexively feel that while science rightly treats the entirety of the natural world as subject to the same universal (deterministic) laws, they must preserve an idea of human free will as an exception to the laws of physics, in exactly the same way that theists allow for intervention by ""God"". As Dennett puts it, this indeterminism insists that human beings are little godlets, or miracle workers, able to defy the otherwise universal laws of physics. Dennett understands that we want to believe that we are always ""able to choose otherwise"" in a given situation because, if we're not, there seems to be no basis for moral responsibility: praise and blame only make sense in relation to free choices, and why care about anything if we can never deserve praise or blame for whatever good or bad we do? His thesis, in short, is that it is unnecessary to invoke miraculous powers to solve this apparent problem. Thanks to natural selection, humans have more freedom than has ever existed in the history of the universe. Although this freedom is not exempt from the physical laws governing every particle in the universe, and is hence determined, it is only determined in the same sense that a coin toss is determined. That is to say our choices are determined by so many intervening variables that no observer can possibly know their outcomes. Dennett's view is that in the important sense of everyday life, humans make free choices. The key distinction here is between the physical level, the fundamental variables that determine the outcome of the coin toss, versus the design level, what agents are actually able to observe and experience. The latter is what matters to all of us, and the observable operation and evolution of freedom on that level--in our everyday experience--gives us a sufficient (Dennett argues, more well-founded) basis for moral responsibility.All of this makes pretty good sense to me, despite my ingrained aversion to determinism. My only problem with Dennett, and I am still mulling whether I think it taints his whole philosophical outlook, is that he is utterly uncritical of his own implicit mainstream views of technological progress (which he presumes even now to be an inevitable, unstoppable impulse of human culture) and the state (which he presumes to be the only solution to organizing human society). He reaffirms these positions in his pejorative use of the terms ""anarchy"" and ""Luddites"" and in his praise of ""civilization"". ""Science"" is his main affinity, and those very institutions are prerequisite for its existence. It should not be a surprise then that they aren't in question here. What remains to be answered for me is, what is the benefit of a scientific deterministic worldview when we have concluded that the state system and the technological progress that created it (and that it demonstrably perpetuates in return) were not, are not, and cannot be desirable? Early in the book, (with none of his characteristic well-reasoned argument) Dennett parodies postmodern critics of science who characterize it as ""just another in a long line of myths"". But he proves himself, disappointingly, to be an equally simple-minded partisan of ""science""; he sees history and the future going in only one direction, that of more elaborate guns, memes, and steel for which our ""freedom"" is evolving to help us to be prepared. The book leaves me more worried about the possibilities of a future with more science than about the question of my own free will. Personally, I hope that imperialistic science eventually becomes a detour, albeit an informative one, from which a freer, wiser humanity was able to return, instead of the dead end of absolute control which is its inexorable instinct."
5,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18944-aj,4,"A book combining many ideas from Consciousness Explained and Darwin's Dangerous Idea, and pushing them into their logical follow-up questions: If materialism is so true, what are we to do about determinism and free will?

6,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12933866-edward,3,"I was a bit disappointed by Freedom Evolves, but that’s largely due to my own expectations. I had heard that Dennett held some sort of compatibilist view, whereby he argues that true, non-deterministic free will arises through evolution from a basis of determinism at the lower physical level. I was looking forward to be challenged and even swayed to this position by good arguments. Unfortunately Dennett’s view seems to be simply that the universe is deterministic, but at the level of complex creatures, evolution has driven the interactions within the brain and in relation to the external environment to generate a kind of will that is intentional and beneficial, and that for all intents and purposes (legal, moral, etc), this can be considered “free” will, or at least “a kind of free will worth having.” But even Dennett acknowledges that this kind of will is not really free from constraints, and is still deterministic (though, like a coin-flip, the outcome is dependent on so many factors that it cannot be reliably predicted).This secondary argument of evolved “free” will seems to have developed to provide a safety net for people who are convinced by the primary argument for determinism and would otherwise throw up their hands and scream, “then what’s the point!” - these are people who grasp determinism but have not thought about the subject any further. In this respect his arguments for evolved free will (though they are largely informal and often not logically argued) do provide some perspective for such people and may cushion the blow, or at least promote further thought. What I do respect about the work is that it is (for once!) philosophy that is grounded in science, not simply speculation. Dennett draws from examples in psychology and neuroscience, and while his conclusions are sometimes tenuous and often speculative, they are at least grounded in physical fact.For me though, the ideas presented are not really that profound. The conclusions are often pushed past the point that they have been established through the argumentation, and to the extent that they have been demonstrated, they are often fairly obvious. The ideas and examples given can often be found elsewhere in his own work and the work of popular authors like Richard Dawkins. I would therefore only recommend this to someone with an interest, but who has not read many other works on these topics."
7,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,2,"Not much new here, which is truer and truer of Dennett's later worksThe biggest problem, other than this book largely recycling ""Elbow Room""? Dennett refuses to take his ideas on free will to their logical conclusion, and stops at a brink.That ""logical brink"" would be that, if there is no ""Cartesian Meaner,"" no central controller of consciousness, then logically there is no ""Cartesian Free Willer,"" no ""central meaner,"" either.But, Dennett, as he did in Elbow Room (written before he fully formulated his ideas of consciousness vs. folk psychology) claims that there is a type of free will compatible with materialism and indeed, even worth saving.Dennett rejects the philosophical label of ""compatibilist"" re his ideas on free will; nonetheless, any quibbles he has with the label are minor and ultimately, differences that make no difference. He claims that there are varieties of free will that do exist and are worth having. (I would say, instead, ""worth believing in,"" as I don't believe his case is proven.)Dennett uses more of his famous ""intutition pumps"" to elucidate his ideas on free will in a quasi-Socratic manner.BUT, BUT, BUT, he never squares this -- he never even attempts to square this -- with his rejection of a ""Cartesian Meaner"" as stated in ""Consciousness Explained.""Other modern cognitive philosophers DO go down this road and find there is no ""central self"" to have free will; Dennett's illogic must be held against any explication of free will he makes. (Daniel Wegner, among others, is a better read than Dennett.)This book is a 2/3 star border for me, but, as I do occasionally here on older books with numerous other ratings, I adjust my rating to counter others, and so it gets bumped down."
8,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1978665-w-geoff,5,"Having read a lot in the area of consciousness and free-will and being a researcher in neuroscience, I can say that Dennett has a good grasp of the most important aspects of this field. For anyone not in the field, they can get an excellent review of the many sides of the debate. In addition to reading the scientific and philosophical journals, out of professional interest, I was also reading Wegner's ""The illusion of Conscious Will"". I can't be completely objective, because both authors were preaching to the choir. But as far as the writers out there who are in the field and trying to simultaneously get their latest theories out there while making them somewhat accessible to anyone interested, Dennett does a good job. I liked this as much, maybe more than Breaking the Spell, his book on explaining religion and his position on atheism. All in all a highly recommended read for anyone wondering how anyone could believe we don't have free will. "
9,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32737435-p,2,"It's not that I would disagree with Dennett on his main points. It's that I despise his writing. All the space he uses to ridicule those who don't get his views, the overall condescending tone, the superfluous use of block quotes - sometimes only to show that he's famous: ""hey, I was referenced to in this novel, in which there's a fictitious character who happens to be wrong about free will!"". Frankly, I expected better, and those expectations were probably why I ended up finishing the book: I held on to the hope that it would get better towards the end. Writing pop science is a tricky job. But as many other writers demonstrate, it is possible to be clear without being condescending, to be conversational without rambling, and to disagree with views without ridiculing them.All the same, I probably did get something out of this, although I'm rather unsure what it was I got. I award the second star in honor of that mysterious take-off."
10,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,2,"After re-reading Consciousness Explained (1991) and Darwin's Dangerous Idea (1995) recently, I decided to go all-out and re-read Freedom Evolves (2002) and Breaking the Spell (2006) as well. I'm glad I did; the books make a lot more sense on a second reading (and I have acquired a lot more background information and knowledge meanwhile). Each book contains a set of original ideas or new approaches to old problems, and for this Dennett deserves credit - a lot. A major drawback of his books is that he easily gets bogged down in philosophical issues that a lot of readers will not like (let alone follow). In this light, Freedom Evolves is a breath a fresh air, compared with Consciousness Explained and Darwin's Dangerous Idea - two amazingly difficult, dense works of 400-500 pages...Basically, Dennett applies the theory of evolution (an algorithmic process) to the notions of consciousness and free will. Does consciousness exists? Are we free? Dennett gives these questions his best shot and comes up with a coherent, convincing model of consciousness (and somewhat less convincing) human freedom. Here are some short steps that outline his main argument (I'm sure I missed some important details).1. We - including our mental faculties - are products of natural selection, just like the rest of life on earth. Some steps are not yet clear and scientists are currently working on promising theories (e.g. origin of life). Even so, the broad outlines from millions of years of evolution are clear: from prokaryotes to eukaryotes to multicellular organisms to the diversity of life we witness. No skyhooks, cranes all the way!2. There's a path up to Mount Improbable - via 'situation-action machines', 'choice machines', 'Popperian hypothesis-generating intellects' - leading to our own mental world: 'Gregorian creatures'. In other words: there's an immense variety of degrees of freedom, all according to the 'need-to-know-principle' that economically minded Mother Nature endorses. 3. Human consciousness and intelligence are adaptations, shaped by gene-meme coevolution. The origin of language led to an environment where humans communicate their mental states to each other and via this means learned to 'talk to themselves' (i.e. reflecting on our own mental states). 4. Not only this: consciousness itself is a tool that we use in our everyday communication: our 'self' is a point of reference in dealing with others. This leads to the illusion of consciousness. We think there's a centre (a Cartesian Theatre) where the 'buck stops' - a sort of control centre where we observe our bodies as machines under our control. This is simply not true (according to Dennett). In reality there are many simultaneous, parrallel processes going on inside our brains: consciousness is nothing else but our noticing of some processes - the ones that are most important for our functioning. (So, you don't notice the neurological processes regulating your heartbeat; you will notice changes in your visual area though).5. Towards the end of his book - after dealing with consciousness - Dennett plunges into the debate of free will. Are we free? Well, according to Dennett, freedom is gradual. In general, we are more free than human beings were 100 years ago; some individuals are more free than others; human beings come equipped with more degrees of freedom (the maximum possible?) than other animals. This doesn't solve the issue though: does it make sense to ask: could I have done otherwise at time t in situation X? If determinism is right, I could have done nothing else, therefore I am not free. Dennett doesn't solve the puzzle, he just asks us to not be too narrow in defining the options at time t - minor variations are allowed (""If you make yourself really small, you can externalize everything""). In other words: it is not useful to take a dive into the quantum world (atom for atom comparisons or the (mis)use of quantum indeterminacy), just ask yourself if you could have achieved the thing you value in a range of similar circumstances. This still sounds fishy to me, it smells like a cleverly disguised evasion.6. But luckily Dennett comes to the rescue: determinism is not related to freedom. In other words: whether we live in a deterministic or an indeterministic universe is completely irrelevant to the question about free will. Dennett argues that only a deterministic world offers the stability and predictablity for nature to 'design' organisms that can use their intelligence to interact with the world to accomplish goals. This is entirely convincing and I personally don't see why so many people who fear determinism flee into obscure quantum indeterminacy. In essence, they claim that we are guided - in all our decisions - by complete randomness. Is this free? It seems to me we would be just bouncing balls of random happenings: where's the freedom in this? In all, this was an amusing book to read - food for thought - even though at some moments the main story became bogged down in intricate philosophical debates. I realize that this is a necessary inconvenience, but still found it tiresome at some points. In all, it's an interesting book that offers some original insights and is written in a clear and concise way. It's certainly one of Dennetts easier-to-follow books. For example, I found his treatment of consciousness (one chapter) much more enlightening than his treatment of consciousness in Consciousness Explained (a whole book!).There's still a nagging question after closing the book though. I'm not a philosopher, I'm just an (interested) onlooker, but it seems to me that Dennetts treatment of freedom is ultimately a retreat into obscurity. Do we have freedom, or not? Maybe that's not the right way to ask it, indeed. But saying that freedom is the 'capacity to achieve what we value in a range of circumstances' leaves a lot of questions unanswered. I think Dennett is right in claiming that freedom is gradual and that it is a product of gene-meme coevolution. He convinced me on these points. But that still leaves open the question of exactly how free the murderer is when he commits his act. According to Dennett, we should ask if this person can honestly acquiesce in his punishment; if not, then either this person is not rational (and therefore not responsible for his crime) or else this person is fully responsible for his self-control. In other words: anyone 'above the minimum treshold of self-control' is free and thereby responsible for his/her self-control; this treshold is politically agreed upon. Does Dennett claim that (at least in jurisprudence) freedom is a political construct? It seems so.It seems to me that Sam Harris' answer is much more coherent and convincing (cf. Harris, 2011). Harris claims that if you would trade places, atom for atom, with this murderer, including his personal history, you would do exactly the same thing - is this freedom? But then again, if you would trade places, you wouldn't be you anymore... This is another famous, excruciatingly tiresome philosophical thought experiment: If an evil neurosurgeon would take your brains out of your body and put it in someone else body - ofcourse under anaesthesia - would you be this other person? Or would you be your old self? These sorts of philosophical thought experiments are excruciatingly tiresome: if this evil neurosurgeon would do the things explained, you would simple be dead. Period. What if an evil brain surgeon anaesthesizes you and puts your brain in vat and.... Practically impossible! Period.Maybe I'll just wait another 25 years to await the advances in neuroscience and cognitive psychology instead of reading more books of philosophers on free will, consciousness and mind."
11,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9525548-robert-starr,3,"I don't think I'll ever understand more than about 40% of a Daniel Dennett book and that's probably fine. I don't necessarily read his books for the information, but more for the way they get me to think about things I haven't considered. One of my favorite examples is his Library of Mendel from Darwin's Dangerous Idea. Imagine a library of books with every possible combination of letters and numbers and symbols. Every book ever written or that ever will be written would be contained in this library.What exactly is the point of such an imaginary library? To distinguish between large numbers and infinite? I think it had something to do with showing what is possible using DNA, but there's more contained in the idea than just that. Or less. Philosophy is more about ways of thinking and justifications than reality, exactly. Or something.So in this book, Dennett defends the existence of free will. And he says it's consistent with determinism. Perhaps he is successful, I don't know. But what he did do, throughout this book, is make me really consider what the concept of free will means to me. And what determinism means. And what it might mean for me to say something like, ""I wish I had done such and such."" Because I hadn't done such and such and there's no way for me to have done such and such now that we're past that point.My head starts hurting and maybe I miss a few lines of the text as I read past them, too quickly, still considering an idea that he brought up paragraphs earlier. But it's a good kind of hurt and I'm glad I read it. That being said, if you gave me a test on this book, I don't think I'd pass."
12,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72796908-daniel-hageman,3,"Well at least I can say I’ve now at least attempted to steel-man compatibilism, though it continues to fall short given the context of our societies and the beliefs people hold. And don’t get me wrong; Dennett makes a fascinating case for a justified use of a term like ‘free will’. The problem, however, is that he drastically underestimates the adherence to libertarian free will that continues to permeate society, particularly across religious cultures. This flavor of ‘free will’, which Dennett thoroughly shows to be nonsensical, continues to justify eternal punishment for finite earthly actions, and even in our human justice systems provides grounds for retributive justice which should be decades if not centuries in our past. It’s clear that Dennett still holds to some of the fears regarding the counterfactual of a world where people recognize we don’t have free will, but I think this is the case for many new ideas before they spread and are properly understood. We cannot hold to masses to some sort of lower standard forever, and creating a ‘new definition’ for free will only muddies the water in other important conversations that need to be had.It’s surely one of the best arguments I’ve heard for the wrong conclusion, but wrong nonetheless. Also, there are a few too many tangents with respect to Darwinian memetic selection that are a bit beyond the scope when describing just how 'freedom evolves’. "

His occasional arrogance and sometimes stodgy style don't help, but he does provide the reader with lots of very stimulating arguments, and on several occasions, I found myself stopping to put the book down and spend time mulling over the points made. It was worth the three stars just to experience that."
14,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16181797-wayland-smith,2,"A lot of philosophy about whether or not we have free will, or if everything is fated beforehand. I know there was a reason this was on my to-read list, but looking back at it, I really can't remember why. A bit dry in places. "
15,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7441387-jason,3,"Some people worry about free will. They worry in particular about not having it.If our universe is deterministic, a hypothetical being who knows all the physical properties of the universe at one point in time - where all the particles are, and where they're moving - and possesses sufficient computing power, knows the entire history and future of the universe. He knows, for example, what you're going to choose for breakfast tomorrow - and the day after, and the day after that, and all your future breakfast choices until you die (and he knows the date and cause of your death).If the whole world, including our brains, works like clockwork then, I may worry, ""I'm"" not really deciding anything I think or do. The laws of the physical universe have decided everything already: my initial makeup, my external environment, and how I will respond to it. So how can we be responsible for what we do, and how can we be praised or blamed?Feeling uncomfortable about this, but unwilling to abandon a universe ruled by physical laws, some have argued that we might be able to escape the problem if our universe is not deterministic. Happily enough, quantum mechanics shows indeterminacy exists in the physical world. That is, reality appears to have a degree of randomness about it, which appears mainly at the subatomic level. There are many possible future universes, and so even an omniscient being doesn't know for sure what the future looks like.But is this relevant to how much control you have over your own decisions? Dennett argues, though it is an aside to his main thesis, that it does not. If what happens in the universe at a subatomic level is based entirely on impersonal physical processes, ""you"" don't obviously have more free will if those processes are non-deterministic.Dennett's view seems to be that all attempts to argue that what happens in your brain is not the result of impersonal subatomic interactions seem to involve postulating explicitly or - more commonly these days - implicitly, some kind of immaterial soul or mind that is distinct from your body (the idea known as Cartesian dualism). ""You"" and your consciousness are separate from your physical brain, at least at critical decisonmaking junctures, and so you're not entirely bound by what happens in it, and can exercise ""control"" over the direction your brain's processing takes.Dennett refutes arguments that try to derive free will from indeterminacy, in particular those of Robert Kane. Dennett sees free will at a subatomic level as both unattainable and - equally provocatively - not even desirable.Dennett is by no means a skeptic about free will. The first main point of his book is that morally significant free will, the kind that most if us want to have, has got nothing to do with what happens at a subatomic level, or whether or not our universe is deterministic. ""Free will"" exists at a higher level of abstraction. This is called the ""compatibilist"" version of free will, held by many philosophers from Hobbes and Hume onward.If you zoom right in on me, or on you, we're just an assembly of particles behaving according to physical laws. If you look at in any particular neighbourhood of molecules, you can't tell if you're looking at a human being or a lump of coal. But as you zoom out, you start to see patterns and structures - cells, tissues, organs, and eventually animals. What's more, those structures are not just a chance grouping at one instant: they are persistent, and self-replicating and evolving over time. Dennett holds that it is at this level that notions of avoidance, will, and choice emerge. They are innate ""designed"" capabilities.We are natural born choosers. We constantly receive information from the environment, process it (both ""consciously"" and otherwise) and then make decisions to cause particular things to come about, or to avoid things from coming about - to the extent that we foresee or anticipate them. Many animals, in fact, exercise some degree of choice, but we have evolved this capability to an extremely sophisticated and qualitatively greater extent. In Dennett's example, if we're at bat in baseball and the ball is pitched at our body, we may choose to avoid it to escape pain and injury (as many animals would) or we may avoid avoiding it in service of some other uniquely human goal we have in mind (gaining a walk to first base, winning the game, etc).At this level, we have a kind of free will, so long as no one else is actively coercing us to do one thing or another. Dennett, in common with other compatibilists, thinks this everyday version of free will is much more important and relevant to autonomy and morality than the subatomic or metaphysical sort.Much of the rest of the book is speculation about how this kind of free will might have evolved. This discussion was, for me at least, less compelling. Nevertheless, I found the book as a whole highly worthwhile."
16,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24258499-alan-johnson,0,"If you like what Daniel Dennett calls ""toy universes"" or ""toy worlds,"" you will love this book. If, like me, you question the validity of contrived analogies between ""toy"" mental constructions and the actual human world, you will find the book less endearing.Interspersed among lengthy digressions on toy mental constructions in the first half of this book are comments that sometimes appear to be germane to the issue at hand: scientific determinism versus free will. Dennett is a self-acknowledged ""compatibilist""—one who takes a middle road between the ""hard determinists"" and the advocates of free will. ""[C]ompatibilism [is] the view that free will and determinism are compatible after all, the view that I am defending in this book."" (Daniel C. Dennett, Freedom Evolves, Kindle ed. [New York: Penguin, 2004), 98.) How Dennett can take such a position without violating the principle of (non)contradiction is the central mystery of this work. He tries to accomplish it by utilizing semantic legerdemain: changing the historical meanings of such terms as ""determinism,"" ""inevitability,"" and ""free will"" so that they signify something other than what they have classically meant in the millennia of philosophical, scientific, and other debate on these issues. In Dennett's universe, ""determinism"" does not imply either inevitability or causation, and ""free will"" does not mean free will but rather something like free will. For example, Dennett remarks in chapter 4: ""The hard determinists among you may find in subsequent chapters that your considered view is that whereas free will— as you understand the term— truly doesn’t exist, something rather like free will does exist, and it’s just what the doctor ordered for shoring up your moral convictions, permitting you to make the distinctions you need to make."" (Dennett, Freedom Evolves, 98 [italics in the original].) Nevertheless, like the impossibility of following the ball in quantum mechanics, I still don't understand his exact position even after two readings of this book. The judgment of Dennett's hard-determinist friend Sam Harris (whose book on free will I have otherwise critically reviewed  here) may be on point:""As I have said, I think compatibilists like Dennett change the subject: They trade a psychological fact—the subjective experience of being a conscious agent—for a conceptual understanding of ourselves as persons. This is a bait and switch."" (Sam Harris Free Will, Kindle ed. [New York: Free Press, 2012], 22.)About half-way through his book, Dennett transitions from an obsession with game theory to a preoccupation with genetic and cultural evolution. This change in focus was welcome to the present reader. At least here we are dealing with empirical fact (or, more precisely, Dennett's interpretation of empirical fact through more analogical reasoning). But the relevance of this large digression to the issue of determinism versus free will is less than apparent. ""Freedom evolves,"" according to Dennett, but what does this mean exactly? Although the last two chapters delineate a picture of evolved human life that implies free will, he nevertheless maintains until the end of the book that scientific determinism remains valid. The entire book juggles these inconsistent concepts as though they are somehow compatible, but in the end Dennett never resolves the contradiction.Alan E. JohnsonApril 29, 2018"

As always, the author is never in your face with his beliefs and practices the art of critical reasoning better than anyone. He puts others contrary viewpoints in their most effective forms and systematically shows why they are not right and are not as effective as they might seem at first glance, and then goes on to build a coherent consistent system.For me, I enjoy the author's writing style, but I realize it can be dense for others and the author himself refers to some of his previous writing as ""obscure and difficult"". I guess I like obscure and difficult when I know at the end I'll understand the subject matter better than I have ever before.He says that ""if you make anything small enough than everything will be external"". By making the role of the individual insignificant you will make free will outside of the person and free will belongs within us not outside of us. Also, he says that ""we all want to be held accountable for our own actions"", both at the individual and societal level. That makes free will within us.As the author steps the reader through the development of freedom, he also gives the listener some of the best takes on why homo sapiens are so different from any other species known in the universe.Most of what is in this book seems to be covered in his other books I've read, Consciousness, Darwin's Dangerous Idea, and Intuition Pumps.

He certainly does that in this book, though I can't claim to understand big chunks of his logic, for which I blame myself. (Since it's a book about personal freedom, autonomy, blame and responsibility, I could hardly hold him accountable for the concepts I didn't grasp!)It isn't as entertaining or broadly appealing as ""Darwin's Dangerous Idea,"" but ""Freedom Evolves"" is nevertheless a rewarding book. There is a lot to chew on here, on almost every page.

I would say that his brief digression into the domain of ethics was perhaps not as well thought out as the rest of the subject matter in the book, and although his opinions appear to hang on predicates from previous chapters, these left out too much for me to consider them sufficient to substantiate the ethical views that he so briefly espoused. Rather, I prefer take the author at his word, at the conclusion of the text, that his primary focus for writing the book was otherwise.Because I listened to the Audible version of this book, I would like to note that the narrator took a bit of getting used to. There were many passages that could have been phrased in such a way as not to break the cohesion of thought, but were not. I surmise that the narrator, then, was probably not cogently familiar with the text. This minor difficulty, coupled with the fact that his tone of voice tended toward pompousness, was rather annoying. Otherwise, the narration was reasonably clear, and the text was sufficiently engaging most of the time so that the arrogant drone of the narrator was reasonably obviated."

He concedes that determinism (or even indeterminism) does not allow for contra-causal free will (where we get to wholly determine our actions, free of influences from any prior events), but states that we have another variety of free will (""worth wanting""), which enables humans to make considered decisions and be morally responsible for their actions.The book ultimately failed to persuade me, and instead left me wanting more (more explanations and examples that could drive home his highly un-intuitive position). This is, mind you, the same thing that happened with me when I read his ""Consciousness Explained"" (1991) — a magnificent piece of work that also failed to persuade me (despite reading it thrice!) and many others (after all, people call the book Consciousness Explained Away). I commend Dennett for his brilliant decades-spanning work on how consciousness and free will can exist in a physicalist world (his latest on this theme is ""From Bacteria to Bach and Back"", which I read not long ago). The positions he advocates may very well be right, but I fear that despite that, many of us may never be able to come to terms with them."

On second thought, that's not trivial at all. His works on paper include web links, for another, and he chooses accessible illustrations to make his points. In the first section of Freedom Evolves, Dennett is discussing whether determinism—the idea that all outcomes/choices/decisions are set by the initial conditions, that ""everything's fixed, and you can't change it,"" as Andrew Lloyd Webber's Judas complains to Jesus—means that no one is responsible for their choices in life. To illustrate that whether or not you believe in it, determinism cannot affect guilt, Dennett tells the story of the French Foreign Legionnaire who is hated by all at the fort. Tom, knowing that he will be sent on patrol the next morning, poisons the water in his canteen. Dick, unaware of Tom's actions, empties the Legionnaire's canteen and fills it with dry sand. Harry, also unaware of the previous interventions, pokes a small hole in the canteen so its contents will trickle away as the hated fellow marches out in the morning. When the Legionnaire does march off into the desert with his adulterated canteen, and eventually perishes of the lack of potable water, which man is responsible for his death? Dennett has said of Freedom Evolves, ""If I accomplish one thing in this book, I want to break the bad habit of putting determinism and inevitability together. Inevitability means unavoidability, and if you think about what avoiding means, then you realize that in a deterministic world there’s lots of avoidance. The capacity to avoid has been evolving for billions of years. There are very good avoiders now. There’s no conflict between being an avoider and living in a deterministic world. There’s been a veritable explosion of evitability on this planet, and it’s all independent of determinism."" [Emphasis mine, Dennet quote from a 2004 interview in ReasonOnline] Exercise for the reader: Was the Legionnaire's death by dehydration avoidable?*This review is a brief visit because this is not a book to be grasped in a quick scan; that's the main reason I like Dennett's work. I read several pages, then sit back, stunned by the light of reason. Aha! And I must go reread this article, or that book, or even turn back to reread a few pages in Dennett, in the light of that new understanding. ""Inevitable"" is a word I'm hearing a lot these days. So is ""guilt,"" and ""blame."" Dennet helps put them all into perspective for me.Liner Notes:My involvement with Dennett pre-dates this review by decades; 
Darwin's Dangerous Idea
 was the my first encounter. I enjoyed the philosophical exploration of this scientific revolution, with its the pro-and-con arguments from Darwin's time and ours so much that I went Dennett-hunting. 
Consciousness Explained
 was next. I found this the toughest to read, because I was also reading Stephen Pinker's 
How the Mind Works
 at the time, and many of Dennett's thoughts on Thought run counter to Pinker's. Then I got Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting, and had to reread both of those books in the light of what I learned. All, including Freedom Evolves, are now available on Kindle.*The Legionnaire's ""inevitable"" death? There was a fourth man involved with his canteen, the only one who ultimately needed to rely on its contents, whose responsibility it was to make sure the canteen was functional, and filled with clean water. A fourth man, who might, had he thought about it, suspected that the canteen might have been tampered with. So while his death in the desert was not his fault—I'm not blaming the victim—it certainly was avoidable."
37,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6488078-dustyn-hessie,4,"This book was interesting and fun to read but I can't entertain his philosophy/science because...:Dennett entertains the idea of a ""free"" human subject (or ""agent"" as he calls it) who must make deterministic snap nonthinking reactions and, eventually, transform into a being that never wavers when making decisions, because all decisions become practical, mathematical, scientific. This idea is quite fascinating if you fancy a future Utopia where: there is no god, no room for the imagination, no arguments about art, and absolutely no Profound Art, because, according to Dennett (and his idea) placing an art and artist who is gifted above all the others in artistic matters is analogous to ""racism."" As a ""free"" practical subject all I need to do is relate to the art as something that resonates for me because it speaks to my ""inner"" qualities as a member of this or that community. - All you need to do to meet this ""free"" subject, today, is immerse yourself into mass culture for awhile (and believe me, you'll meet a lot of people/cooperators, some good, some not so good - but this is not the main point!). A sober imagination and a high IQ will take you far in Dennett's society because their are no other ""potentialities"" out there beyond what has been given to you by your ""cooperative"" milieu. So what's so great about Dennett's society is that it makes things easy (not a bad prospect for many... but for others... Hell!). Ease and simplicity allows you to move about the world in complete obedience to its laws and decrees. Complexity and imagination complicates the world, precipitates madness, and puts you in a state of unease - and this is when philosophy, religion, and art (things Dennett has conceptually referred to as ""memes"") enter the fray. For philosophy proper, freedom is taking it upon yourself to explore your potential in all its vastness; to learn to decipher what is real, what is virtual, what is imaginative; to will the imagination to weave into the most ambiguous and dizzying texts with an array of perspectives in mind to work through them; and to exit this skirmish with an innovative perspective worth everything in the world to you, Eureka! - Dennett does not think this is a Great Thing, as many of the philosophers do, so he presents us with a version of Materialist-Determinism unique in its kind. This is one of my first explorations in the cognitive sciences, but I am interested. However, it does seem to me as though the cognitive sciences are extremely vain, and envious of the philosophers: for the cognitive scientist does not give the philosopher or the artist its rightful due when it comes to erudition; he seems to say, ""So you have a soul, and all these wonderful linguistic novelties and the like - why can't I do that?"" A succinct, rather laymen's, reply is: ""You have to will it, mentally, form it, intellectually, produce it, artistically, and actually BELIEVE (and this is something the scientist simply cannot do) you are entitled to do so."" Recreate nature; don't just reproduce it. But, at least cognitive science is something fun to critique. And that's worth something! "
38,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25059922-kel,4,"Whatever free will is, determinism is the wrong way to think about it!Whenever I see a discussion of free will online, inevitably someone drags quantum mechanics into it. It's a confusing notion at first, for what does quantum mechanics have to do with volition? But the less woo-inclined (i.e. those who don't equivocate the mysterious nature of quantum mechanics and the mysterious nature of consciousness) see quantum mechanics an escape from determinism.Whether Dan Dennett's book is a convincing argument for compatibilism, its framing of the issue of volition is important. Decisions form an integral part of our lives, and we are competent decision-makers. So when someone drops to quantum indeterminacy, are they getting any sort of will? Dennett persuasively argues not. An indeterminate path doesn't have an agent own the choice - the choice is randomness, the equivalent of following the outcome of a coin-flip.That is the kind of argument throughout this book. Dennett's case isn't to give a comprehensive defence of compatibilism, but to look at whether the concerns that often are put forward in opposition to compatibilism are deflated. The point is to come up with a variety of free will ""worth wanting"", and Dennett believes that through evolution we have become ""agents of evitability"". That is, as subjective agents, we are only going to understand human actions by understanding how it is our evolved (both genetic and cultural) talents allow us to make responsible decisions in the world. The consequence of Dennett's view is that responsibility comes in degrees, but as Dennett points out, this is already a latitude we ascribe in the real world already.The elephant in the room, perhaps, is that consciousness is still not fully explained. One point Dennett kept returning to was that opponents of compatibilism kept making consciousness ""too small"" - a remnant of what he dubs the Cartesian Theater. Perhaps this is a problem, but Dennett's persistent referencing of the Cartesian Theater as the stumbling block was one of the many rhetorical flourishes he used on his opponents. The times he flat out accused his opponents of being afraid of his view detracted from the case.So, overall it's a book full of stimulating conversation, and hopefully will help better frame the issue."
39,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22094221-morgan,5,"Freedom Evolves is similar to Drescher's Good and Real, in that it attempts to derive ethics from a naturalistic worldview. The author starts by discussing Conway's Game of Life, and shows that even in such a simple deterministic world, it makes sense to talk about higher level constructs having purpose or making choices. He moves from this simple example to a discussion of what people usually mean when they talk about choice and causality, and I found there to be some really interesting surprises there. In particular, some events may be considered uncaused in a colloquial sense.Much of the book is dedicated to refuting various theories about free will that require an indeterministic universe, which I was less interested in. I'm basically sold on the idea that determinism doesn't prevent choice at the level of agents.The middle third of the book is spent showing examples and telling Just So stories about how certain aspects of our freedom could have evolved in a deterministic world. One chapter discusses the rise of biological life through evolution (design from determinism). Another goes over how, once there were brains, memes were able to have a huge impact on evolution. These memes competed and created new cultures, forming a still higher level of design that was capable of reflecting on itself. It's this self-reflection, using memes as tools, that allowed humans to capture random reasons of evolution and make them our own.The last section of the book discusses ethics under this viewpoint of human freedom. Since freedom is based on memetic tools running on brains, it's very feasible for different people to have different levels of moral culpability. The book discusses different ways of dealing with this, but one of the most interesting to my mind is the idea that, in a well run society, people want to be held accountable for their actions. Culpable, free people have more agency in their own lives and in society. This view of human freedom gives it both costs and benefits, and finds that people will want freedom in spite of its costs because of its benefits."
40,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,5,"Dennett's books are the best at illuminating Darwin's strange logic. The evolutionary tale of humanity is much more rich and enlightening than any of its mythical counterparts, particularly as told in this book focusing on free will.Free will is in some ways an illusion for us. Our bodies routinely react before our conscious mind is even aware of what our brain has told it to do, but this doesn't mean that we don't have free will. Our evolutionary tale is one of increasing freedom as our capacity as a species has evolved. Freedom has evolved along with us.It began with sex (which is a good thing). When we started sexual selection, our genes had to learn to cooperate. The better our genes cooperated, the more likely they were to evolve and sustain themselves.As we continued to evolve, our minds layered until we obtained consciousness. The process was as gradual as the shifting into mammals. The brain is a prediction machine and the better predictors evolved and continued to grow. The act of prediction is where we obtain the first steps of free will. We make choices based on what we believe will happen and to get a certain result. Couple this with our social, bee-hive like qualities as human and our choices take on moral significance. The better we have become at predicting the future as humans, our capacity to exercise free will has increased, not decreased. Did man just 150 years ago have the option of choosing to fly? I do. I can go places, do things, communicate with people by my brain's choice because our human capacity to connect our human species through technology has increased. This is freedom evolving and my free will increasing because we live in a deterministic universe with evolutionary life forms.Our ethics and human laws on how to deal with human choice and free will should focus firmly on what type of risk we as a society are willing to take as to allowing members of our species to act. It is a subtle shift from religious based free will, but in the end will guide us to creating ethics and laws that are more in keeping with our evolutionary heritage. "
41,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8163633-kripsoo,4,"The first point to make about this book is that Daniel Dennett's ability to engage readers is well-nigh unprecedented in current scientific or philosophic writing Reading him is like watching a lion-tamer whose daring keeps us, breathless, on the edge of our seatsHis basic effort is to reconcile the determinism of Darwinism with the humanist's concern with human freedom. To do so he jettisons the notion that free will is a metaphysical concept. Rather, he explains it in terms of contemporary objective science, specifically via the same sort of evolution that led to the development of the eye or of language He relies heavily on Richard Dawkin's concept of the evolution of memes: ideas that compete with each other just as other characteristics do via natural selection. In other words he argues that freedom of will grows and evolves. To achieve this conclusion he makes the point that determinism (a cause mechanistically producing an effect) is not the same as inevitability. He uses an example from baseball (shades of the late Stephen Jay Gould!) to make his point. He says that a batter has a choice of turning away from a pitch that is going to hit him or allowing it to hit him, depending on which action will help his team. His action is not determined by the prior history of the universe, but by his own analysis in the moment In a different game, he might make a different choice. This, and other similar arguments, lead Dennett to the conclusion that the more we know, the more varieties and degrees of freedom we can have. Thus, modern man has more freedom than did, say, the NeanderthalEssentially then, Dennett, whose earlier work in the areas of consciousness (another concept that gives determinists fits) are seminal, asserts that natural science is the ally of freedom, not an argument against it. The audacious arguments he posits to support this position are breathtaking in their scope and are, for this reader, convincing"
42,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14234350-darren,3,"""Trading in a supernatural soul for a natural soul—is this a fair bargain?"" Dennett, seeking to fend off ""caricatures of Darwinian thinking"" that plague his philosophical camp, argues in this incendiary, brilliant, even dangerous book that it is. Picking up where he left off in Darwin's Dangerous Idea ( a Pulitzer and National Book Award finalist), he zeroes in on free will, a sticking point to the opposing camp. Dennett calls his perspective ""naturalism,"" a synthesis of philosophy and the natural sciences; his critics have called it determinism, reductionism, bioprophecy, Lamarckianism. Drawing on evolutionary biology, neuroscience, economic game theory, philosophy and Richard Dawkins's meme, the author argues that there is indeed such a thing as free will, but it ""is not a preexisting feature of our existence, like the law of gravity."" Dennett seeks to counter scientific caricature with precision, empiricism and philosophical outcomes derived from rigorous logic. This book comprises a kind of toolbox of intellectual exercises favoring cultural evolution, the idea that culture, morality and freedom are as much a result of evolution by natural selection as our physical and genetic attributes. Yet genetic determinism, he argues, does not imply inevitability, as his critics may claim, nor does it cancel out the soul. Rather, he says, it bolsters the ideals of morality and choice, and illustrates why those ideals must be nurtured and guarded. Dennett clearly relishes pushing other scientists' buttons. Though natural selection itself is still a subject of controversy, the author, director of the Center for Cognitive Studies at Tufts, most certainly is in the vanguard of the philosophy of science. "
43,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4796278-adam,5,"I love the perversity of discussion of free will. For something that can seem so intuitively obvious (of course we have free will, right?), how might we actually prove that it exists in the physical world…? It is surprisingly difficult.Dennett argues for a brand of Compatibilism - where the brain, as a physical object which must obey the laws of physics and therefore its actions be pre-determined, is compatible with free will for the individual without the need for metaphysics. Sounds like a laugh, right?Hes a bit like Richard Dawkins really, just without being such a dick about it.Its probably fair to say this book changed how I see the world a little. He argues that altruism is real and there are good evolutionary grounds for its existence in us as humans. The memetics stuff was totally new to me. I’d never considered that our susceptibility to particular ideas may be part of our evolution. Or that ideas might somehow have an evolution of their own. I can’t say I followed all of it, but Dennett does make the ideas quite accessible. Well, relatively accessible for philosophical writing on theory of mind. And my reading list is now full of the recommended further reading.Ultimately it emerges from Dennett’s arguments that human freedom may be as much a social construct as money, language or music. It may rely on us believing in it to exist, which is not to say that we don’t have free will, but it may be a little different to what we previously expected.I think I might like a world where everyone had read this book. It left me with more questions than I started with but wow what awesome questions. "
44,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6967393-nicholas,2," To be honest I was expecting more than I got here,from a renowned author.Most of the book concerns theories,thought experiments and suppositions that should be familiar to most people with an interest in popular science and a beginners book in philosophy.He borrows heavily from Richard Dawkins/Matt Ridley and espouses Darwinian methods, by which conscious freedom evolves from the preconscious ""situation action machines"" that comprise more lowly creatures. Most of the book seemed like an extended review of other books, but of particularly note was the hatchet job he does on Libet's famous experiment and the criticism of Daniel Wegner's' ""The illusion of conscious will"" in which he manages to both criticise and promote the authors work at the same time.In fact, he does a lot of direct quoting and never misses an opportunity to plug his own back catalogue as well.I started to get the impression that the whole project was cooked up at the annual faculty bun fight. I found his writing style tiring at times,with sentences that where overly long and wandered off in other directions finally rejoining the initial starting point just as your attention had been subverted,requiring a reverse back to the start,to contextualise the middle.Too many of these occurrences tend to exhaust the concentration and I was beginning to begrudge spending the time and effort it took to read as I was page counting well before the mid-point."
45,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62373710-roqsan,5,"I'm not sure that I necessarily agree that it makes any sense that we have ""free will"" even in the compatabilist sense where free will is compatible with (but does not imply) determinism. Really it is largely a question of semantics and Dennett is surely right that other concepts of free will (libertarian free will in particular) are just incoherent. But Dennett does clarify very well in this book just what degrees of freedom we could possibly have given the physical constraints we are under and never allows himself to be influenced by any kind of woo, such as trying to explain consciousness in terms of quantum mechanics, so tempting to less clear thinkers. And he is a clear thinker unlike many philosophers and is able to explain himself in an engaging manner for the most part - although I see from other comments that all this is still a bit much for some people.In any case, far from being just of academic interest, the topic of what kind of decisions we are capable of making is of great importance, because we need to finally recognize, when we are strolling through the designer malls, that people are very much the victim of their circumstances and are often not able to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps and so could use some help. In the end the more stable societies that would result would be beneficial to everyone, even if we had to forego the occasional Rolex watch or Ferrari. "
46,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17072730-julian-lewis,5,"Maybe there is no such thing as free will and the universe is fully determined... the point is that knowledge about the future is limited, so the only smart way to behave is to maximise your probability of surviving in a situation with limited knowledge about what will happen... this is how we evolved as a species and is the basis of our survival instinct... the smart way to behave is to assume you have free will... even if its not actually true. PS this is not the only case where it may be smarter to believe in things which may not be true ... for example I hate anthropic arguments that say things like ... if the universe wasn't the way it is then we wouldn't be asking the question... we have to keep trying to find out why no matter what !Dennett is a brilliant spokesman for reason and common sense, he has no axe to grind, his arguments are very well thought out and well argued. This is a brilliant thought provoking book, in my opinion his best book. PS If the universe wasn't determined then you can forget about free will, there would be nothing you could do to influence future events in a random universe..."
47,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5982358-derek-bridge,4,"I was prompted to re-read this after recently enduring a public lecture on the topic of free will by an altogether lesser philosopher than Dennett. That lecture was a master class in self-deception and obfuscation. It was the typical mis-reading of what non-classical physics might offer.Dennett understands the implications of the science much better. Quantum indeterminism does not offer us a get out of jail free card - it is as fatal to some conceptions of free will as is classical determinism.But, he argues, at an appropriate level of description, we do have a form of free will. It has evolved: we are choosers, deciders; we must still make our decisions for the universe to unfold as it does (whether according to physics its unfolding is pre-ordained or not). And, more than that, there is morality, also as a result of our evolution: we take some decisions in ways that are sensitive to other beings, and there is an evolutionary advantage to doing so.This is not an easy book but far more rewarding and appropriately challenging than the cheap burblings of many a charlatan philosopher."
48,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8595498-sam,4,"I should preface all of this by saying that I am not a philosopher and so some of the arguments which Dennett counters here we're not familiar to me in advance.Dennett shows that physical determinancy doesn't needn't undermine the notion of free will. I hadn't really thought about this before so am thankful for the book for prompting me to think about it. That said, I don't think the argument Dennett is refuting makes a lot of sense. To me saying that free will is undermined by the fact that the cells of which we are made obey the laws of physics, is like trying to explain traffic jams by studying the second law of thermodynamics: the two things just operate on totally separate planes. Free will is a cultural phenomenon, ultimately linked to the biological realm, but for practical purposes separate from it. Maybe I don't understand the debate well enough.As it's Dennett, there are a ton of great thought experiments, relevant examples from all kinds of different areas and basically zero jargon and obfuscation.The chapter on culture as a phenomenon which behaves in an evolutionary way is especially interesting."
49,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1864588-bar-shirtcliff,3,"I'm pretty sure this book is mostly about Dumbo (Stop that crow!). No, really, Dennett uses the phrase ""Stop that crow"" at least a hundred times in the book, and it isn't because it adds substance to the argument - it's like a flag indicating that he expects some people to be offended: he's sort of pointing at them disparagingly. I found that distracting, at first, and maddening by the end. I had nothing at stake, reading the book, but I was bothered by the dull repetition, the tone, the incorrect ideas about pseudo-random number generators (he probably has heard about this mistake by now), the computer science topics that didn't contribute much, if anything, to the overall argument, and the general unfinished quality of the book. There are incomplete sentences, even. The flow of the argument is not very great, and the writing seems unfocused. I felt like I was reading a rough draft.Actually, this book would probably have made a good essay, suitably trimmed.Complaints aside, it was a thought-provoking book, and I'm glad I read it. I wonder what I ought to read on this topic next. Suggestions?"
50,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,1,"Dennett's virtue is that he looks at human behavior from an evolutionary perspective. His downside is his preoccupation with human choice as conscious, rational activity, ignoring the power that comes from millions of years of our animal past that guides choice. He looks at (freedom of) choice as ""I want to do X"" but not at the more relevant question, ""why does one want to do X."" The relevance of this type of re-formulation is that Dennett sees the future lying in our hands as rational animals, ""reasoning together."" That's one-half of our future. The other half is not trusting that reason alone is sufficient to preserve the social order. Dennett's title evokes promise but in the end he says little about freedom's evolution and why it occurred. He leaps from animals to man, saying we have it (freedom) and animals do not. Most know that. Dennett's other downside is that he goes over well-known ground, repeating what he and so many others have said before. It would be nice to see him new lines of thought. "

Thanks to our growing understanding of nature (we have learned that we are indeed responsible), we have greater knowledge, a growing sophistication about who we are and what we are, and what we can and cannot do.

Nice the polemic against Wolfe. No, the soul has not died. Yes, there is consciousness. Just do not ask to go into any detail.He tries to show that free will does not contradict a deterministic world. Now, I am all in favor of a Life-like deterministic world but our world is probably not deterministic and if it were there could be a really complex universe with free-like actions but it would still be designed and by definition not free.

Anyone familiar with Dennett will understand what he's getting at here, but it would be foolhardy to presume familiarity on the reader's behalf. That said, I'm at something of a loss to understand the strange circularity of this work though I suspect that Dennett may have found himself torn between two distinct manners of proving his provocative conjecture - either in the guise of a layman or in his natural role as a wiseman - and ended up choosing the awkward middle path between. This book is functionally sound (dare I say brilliant) but is felled by poor form.Still a recommended read, though."

And then he did something awesome: he wrote out the anticipated objections, as if he was reading my mind, and then answered them simply and straightforward. But he stopped doing that and I just found myself either not following what he was saying or not agreeing, the former is probably the most likely. After a while, it seemed like Dennett didn't want to address free will head-on, and instead used metaphors to explain tangential topics. I just lost interest. "

In order for someone to determine what you would do, they would need to simulate you, and it would be ""you"" making the decision. You are still determining your choice.

270,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27376783-john-clements,4,"My difficulty with this book is different than others'. Rather than finding fault with Dennett's arguments, I find them entertaining and ... obviously true.I think I'm obviously a raging strong-AI person, but it seems very obvious to me that free will is completely compatible with a deterministic universe, as long as you define free will as ""doing what it is that you want,"" and not simply defining free will as ""non-deterministic."" Fundamentally, I believe that those that disagree with Dennett aren't being completely honest with themselves about what they mean when they say ""free will."""
271,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1029593-carrie,1,"Hoped to get some insight on the free will vs. determinism issue, but Dennett didn't deliver. Guess I've gotten used to better writers like Dawkins and Pinker. Dennett talks all around the issue but doesn't give a hard answer. Plus he has an annoying tendency to (frequently) interject tangential comments (of very little value) into (just about) every sentence. (Stop that crow!) I can't remember the last time I read a book that I felt I got nothing out of. Definitely not recommended."
272,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8091929-hrvoje,3,"I'm a fan of Dennett's work but somehow I wasn't able to identify with the ideas in this book. Dennett advocates the existence of free will, observing it through the physical, natural, sociological and psychological dimension. Book convinced me to the contrary - the absolute determinism and the fact that the freedom of the human will can occur only as a result of the vast number of possibilities. On the other hand, I'm not a philosopher by education and might be terribly, terribly wrong :-)"
273,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2929282-conor,4,"The best defence of compatibalism I've come across and probably the only position that doesn't melt my brain. Great writer, who, even when you don't agree with him, leaves his arguments easy to follow. The intro/summary bits he does for each chapter are a very useful feature, he does it in Darwin's Dangerous Idea too."
274,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18149635-descartisan,3,"I'll make this short and sweet. There's a lot of good material in here that made it worth the read, however Dennett hasn't convinced me that a free will worth saving exists. It seems like he uses a lot of rhetoric to metaphorically make it seem as if we have free will, but again this isn't free will... I know I got into zero specifics here, but I'm in a rush. "
275,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10498241-james-boyle,4,"Far from an easy book to read, but wonderfully fascinating and shows off the genius mind of Daniel Dennett. The book is full of interesting ""intuition pumps"", and whilst I'm not fully convinced by the central conclusion that free will and determinism are incompatible, it has certainly made me think that it is possible. This is another book that most certainly benefits from a second reading."
276,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31104786-dave-peticolas,4,"Dennett presents a splendid defense of free will in the face of materialism and Darwinism. He also puts to bed the notion that quantum mechanics could somehow ""save"" free will from determinism. This book is an excellent antidote to a lot of muddled thinking about free will including Blackmore's The Meme Machine."
277,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2567035-akiva-jackson,4,"An insightful and fascinating book. Dennett was very convincing in his arguments for moral responsibility, the evolution of morality and abilities, and critiques of metaphysical libertarianism. While I am convinced of almost all of his premises, I am unsure as to whether I believe that we really have free will, but I will need to think about it more."
278,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4652985-josh,2,"I don't read much philosophy, and this book makes me appreciate how little philosophy I've read about free will. Most of this book went over my head. The general sense I got from this is that Dennett doesn't think free will is incompatible with determinism. Instead, we can make decisions in a world where some things are inevitable. Something like that. I have no idea."
279,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9186-erin,4,"hey guess what! we DO have free will. just not the kind we may be used to thinking about. in any art, living included one must follow the rules to know how and when to break them. humanity is a slow moving beast. necessarily so. :)"
280,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/895268-josh-paul,4,"Great summary of the the latest and greatest in the social sciences and medicine and the metaphysical implications of it all, particularly what it means for free will (he says we've got it, but not in the sense that most people think)."
281,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2141032-kevin,3,"Quite the interesting discussion of the problem of free will which brings neuropsychology into the usual philosophical discussion. At the end of the day, Dennett's vote is ""yes"" and/or ""it doesn't matter"" since we act as if free will exists. "
282,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4468396-francis-barton,4,"Dennett is brilliant, and this book is full of great writing and entertaining thought experiments. Failed to convince me in some areas, and tailed off a bit towards the end, but overall I'd recommend it."
283,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8450803-d-a-serra,4,"Nicely written book pertinent to today's aggressive debate within the hard & social science community on Free Will. Dennett has some clever examples, and some enjoyable humor, placed within the pages of this very readable philosophy book."
284,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7291786-alexi-parizeau,5,"Dennett at his best! I think he nailed it. I also loved how this was written with a clear and flowing cadence, and the ample references were nicely summarized and explained (the Further Reading section at the end of each chapter was also a nice touch)."
285,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44087372-linore,3,"Other than hypothetical pseudo-random coin flips, Dennett fails to make an argument that does not devolve into word games and arguments over definitions with his hard determinist counterparts. Dennett remains a skillful writer, and reading his work is always a pleasure. "
286,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22752-nat,4,Decent chapter on attempts to solve the problem of free will.

288,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/881007-daniel,4,"Using evolutionary theory Dennett argues that free will, self awareness and consciousness can emerge from a physical universe without the need for the divine as explanation."
289,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/365504-jennifer,3,"Wished for more qualitative research, less quantifiable models. For more of my take on this book, see my thoughts on Zizek...heard Breaking the Spell was more to my liking."
290,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/743205-wayne,4,Exploring free will? Don't leave this one out. Did you think all evolutionists are randomizing or deterministic? Think again.
291,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/578275-adam-lubin,3,"a non-technical intro to Dennett's arguments on why determinism and free will are not incompatible. I think the man may in fact be full of shit, but we'll see."
292,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1909242-dan-carey,0,This book was just heavier lifting than I am currently inclined to attempt. I hope to get back to it someday.
293,0142003840,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2459665-rodrigo,5,"This book is awesome, 5 stars, I think his theory on free will that's ""good enough"" makes a lot of sense."
