I've been doing some of these things in my own life and it's neat to see what some others have done. Newport's big suggestion is scheduling when you'll be mindless on social media and spend time creating ways to let the tools do the work you want them to do in the other time. Likewise, the suggestions for a digital detox are easy enough and some of the other ideas, including don't put apps on your phone, are things I've been doing and finding to be valuable, for sure. More on this one soon. It doesn't necessarily tread new ground, as (How to Break Up with Your Phone: The 30-Day Plan to Take Back Your Life and others like it do this...but I guess since they're by women, y'know. "

2,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36137204-carl-rannaberg,3,"I badly wanted to like this book. I really did. Because I have very much enjoyed other books by Cal Newport: So Good That They Can’t Ignore You and Deep Work. Both have inspired me a lot and I have recommended these to others in many occasions.This book was way below my expectations. I'm afraid it’s not the book, it’s me. The practical value for me was minimal as I have already implemented a lot of things he proposes in the book.As Cal Newport mentions that he sees the digital minimalism trend gaining momentum I thought this book has the potential to be the bible for this movement. But I don’t believe that happens because the message in this book is not clear enough. There are really no core underlying principles for this digital minimalism philosophy that Cal Newport tries to communicate in this book or he just did a poor job at it. I would have expected that he would lay out the laws or principles of digital minimalist at the start of the book and reinforce them through anecdotes in the rest of the book. For me there were only loosely related anecdotes where sometimes I scratched my head and thought: “how is that relevant to this topic?”This book seems to have identity crisis. As Cal himself mentioned at the start of the book he usually doesn’t write practical books. And this book is neither theoretically coherent nor is it well-structured practical book. It’s somewhere between and it’s a shame. His research in this topic is very thorough and the examples and tips he offers are actually useful.One thing that irritated me a little was his dismissive attitude towards blog posts with tips to turn off notifications on your smartphone and then he goes on in the book and does exactly the same thing. Of course he also talked about that you need a more deeper philosophy to actually make these changes in your life but for me he failed at communicating it clearly enough.One of the biggest grievances for me was lack of authors understanding of how habits work. This book would have been sooo much better when he would have actually connected our harmful digital behaviours with fundamental habit changing theory.If you would like to get pretty much the same content in a much clearer and practical form I would highly recommend you read “Atomic Habits” by James Clear and “Make Time” by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky. Former gives a very solid understanding of the psychology behind habit change and the latter gives over 80 highly practical tactics to find better focus and more energy in this distracting world."

I appreciate the thesis that by choosing to minimize technology in our day-to-day lives, we're choosing to be more deliberate with how we spend our time. I liked some of the advice to consolidate texting, hold conversation office hours, and in general, choose to be more purposeful with what energy we give to reacting to others. I think this book would have been stronger if he provided research to this points rather than random anecdotes about people who decide to step away from technology. A few pieces throughout the middle also felt like fluff to fill up the book (i.e. the rock-paper-scissors championship, the fantasy board game groups, and anecdotes about old white dudes like Henry David Thoreau). It would have served better to take more stories of the modern-day person who has to be ingrained in technology, like someone working in Silicon Valley, and solutions for how to balance professional requirements with self-preservation and mindfulness."

Online. 24/7. Until real life (which one was that still...) collapses Probably the one or the other reader might tend to eat too much sugar, fat, has quit smoking or even worse things like online gaming. In each of these cases, a different strong bodily and or physical addiction has triggered the craving for more. It´s not difficult to see the problem when the doctor tells you that you ought probably lose weight, quit this, reduce that, yada yada yada, what does he know, it´s my body, health and life. Now we get stimulated with each like (Please, oh please, click the button under the review, I need it so desperately, my whole life circles around it, click it, damn!), message, comment, etc. Our brains are wired to social interaction because happy apes in groups meant survival while lonely apes in the dark jungle meant yum yum for predators. So some of us (except a large, but underrepresented group of introverts, ahem) get pretty stressed as soon as the confirmation of popularity doesn´t grow, stagnates, or even, inconceivable goes down. Why don´t those complete strangers don´t support me anymore? In nature, we could be dead now. No more drug-like hormone exposition in the brain, so that the flow kicks in, just sadness. Any company with an allegedly free business model, running a social media site, search engine, etc. knows that. So thousand of high skilled experts do nothing except of trying to get as many people as hooked on as possible, considering age, gender, social status. It´s as if an organized drug dealing cartel had employed people to tailor and advertise their products to each possible customer base. But hey, humans have a free will, at least in theory. What the book is trying to tell us is the same thing each monk and Buddhist says all day long each day of her/his life. Get your mind trained, meditate, stay calm, check your feelings, needs and especially cravings. Ask why your construct of personality in this wet mess up there seems to do what it wants. You are the ego it simulates, so you should really try to at least take control for a few moments every day and expand to longer periods, perhaps half hours or so. Ideology might play a large part here too. Completely ignoring the social and human part can lead to a technocratic, cold and alienated world. Doing as if no social media exists can destroy possibilities to something that might get closer to Gaia than nothing before. It´s, as many wise doctors often said, the dosage that makes the poison. Or the demonization of the poison, although it would be the only possible cure for many problems. It could be easy by just checking social media once or twice a day for a certain time and take a day, weekend or even holiday (Is he crazy?) off. A mini-hiatus. Just like computer gaming addiction, the social media addiction is something just existing in your mind and as someone who quit smoking (many times) I can tell you that there are really other burdens that come with real physical cravings and not just the inability to control the delay of the answer to the question of how many people have shared and liked my precious, precious review of this book that can also be read on my:Fictional twitter link Fictional Facebook linkFictional whatever the latest freaking popular overhyped social media thing, app may be.

Where we want to be cautious . . . is when the sound of a voice or a cup of coffee with a friend is replaced with ‘likes’ on a post.
Read. This. Book. Have you ever told someone in your life you just didn't have enough time in the day to get everything done? Have you thought about why that is? Maybe look down and see what you've been doing for the last 5, 10 or even 60 minutes. Probably scrolling through your phone. Sometimes with intention but sadly a lot of the time we are on our phones because of we are boredom or we are addicted and fear FOMO.A little background before I get into this book and why it's very important. I've always been into tech. I started at a young age, went to college and got a Web Dev/Interactive Media degree and I've had jobs in Digital Marketing, Email Marketing and now Cyber Security. I use tech each and everyday so you may be asking why I think this book is so important and questioning why I agree there is a problem? Well because I started to notice it in my own life and around me. I'd go meet a friend and they'd sit there scrolling through their phone while i'm trying to talk to them. I've watched family members sit on their phones while we're supposed to be ""spending time"" together. I looked around my train car the last couple days at 95% of people sat there scrolling through their phones and most of it was social media, not work. I watch families of 4 go out to eat and all 4 (parents and kids) are on their phones. Why bother going out? I know you may thinking well that's their choice and I agree but I personally don't want to lose human interaction to my phone or my time to my phone/other tech. Mindless scrolling because I'm bored or that I'm afraid I'm going to miss out just isn't worth my mental health or relationships. I also started to recently feel depressive and sad feelings while being on social media. It made me feel sad watching others thrive in their life and I felt insignificant in a way. The ""Facebook effect"" is real and I firsthand have felt it. Just remember there was once a time when we didn't have all this tech or phones and we were more connected, less anxious and we still survived. I realize I'm typing this on a digital site and it has to be read here but just hear me out...DIGITAL MINIMALISM takes us through different steps that you can go through to become a digital minimalist. What is one you ask? ""They’re the calm, happy people who can hold long conversations without furtive glances at their phones. They can get lost in a good book, a woodworking project, or a leisurely morning run. They can have fun with friends and family without the obsessive urge to document the experience. They stay informed about the news of the day, but don’t feel overwhelmed by it. They don’t experience “fear of missing out” because they already know which activities provide them with meaning and satisfaction.""Newport takes us through almost ""detoxing"" yourself from doing tech activities without intention. So if you spend 2 hours a day on facebook, try taking it off your phone so you can get over the urge of automatically opening it and then set aside specific time to go on it and try to use it with high intention so that you really get something out of it. Technology is not good or bad and Cal is actually a Computer Scientist, it's moreso about how we use it and how we can change that to be more healthy.I personally made a few changes - my husband and I do not look at our phones during dinner or any meal together. In fact, I try to leave my phone in the car or at home as much as I can. I put on night mode at night. I put my phone farther away at night. I turned off almost all phone notifications. The next step is to delete some low intention (social media) apps.If you are ready to take back control of your time and not feel like you need your phone attached to you every second then definitely read this book. It's simple but powerful and it has a lot of interesting studies/background on technology as a whole. I personally love technology (it is my job after all!) but I'm ready to use it more intentionally then mindlessly and strengthen my human face-to-face connections rather than hoovering behind a screen. I think my neck, thumbs and hands will probably thank me too!"

It’s not that I, and many others, don’t have the will to be a minimalist but it’s that we can’t. Newport does show the benefits of reducing technology use quite nicely but unfortunately this book wasn’t made for everyone. Newport’s previous book was significantly better."
7,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1213607-julie-christine,5,"Every rare once in awhile a Facebook friend announces their imminent departure from Facebook. Or simply quietly slips away, leaving behind a shadow profile in my friends list. I send up a silent cheer when I realize they have deactivated their account, knowing in my belly they are better off without this ubiquitous social media overlord. For a long time, I've felt a sense of disquiet about social media, but the disturbance has become a growing alarm and a deep sadness in recent months. I feel that we, all of us who are connected, have just lost our way. Then two things occurred almost simultaneously, one horrific, one glorious. First, The New York Times ran a feature on child pornography, a hideous crime that's exploded in volume because of social media. The wretched creeps who exploit and abuse children have multiple platforms that make it harder to track their behavior and make it all the easier for children to be preyed upon. The social media companies, like Facebook with its Messenger platform, are complicit in these crimes, just as they were in the travesty that was the 2016 election. They want users, regardless of the consequences. And then a friend of mine fulfilled a lifelong dream, which also happens to be one of mine: hiking the Camino de Santiago. She chronicled every day through photos and anecdotes posted on Insta and Facebook. As much as I treasured joining her journey from afar, I also wanted to plead with her to put down the phone, forget all of us, and be there, in her head and body and heart and just walk. Walk for the sake of it, not for the instagrammable moments. Being disconnected from the world is natural, healthy, necessary. I imagine my own Camino and know that I want it to be private, meditative, transformative, not shared, not liked or retweeted. Pure. Into all this walked Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport, giving me yet more reasons, and now a strategy, to reframe and redo my relationship with social media. Cal Newport isn't a Luddite. He's not against social medial or digital technology. He does throw down the gauntlet, however; challenging his readers to look their use and habits squarely in the screen, to recognize and deeply register the power Silicon Valley has in nearly every aspect of our lives, our time, our children's brains, our attention, our pocketbooks. Few want to spend so much time online, but these tools have a way of cultivating behavioral addiction. And as Newport demonstrates throughout Digital Minimalism, while some of these addictive qualities are accidental, many have been exploited by tech and social media companies whose driving purpose is to keep us online as often, and for as long, as possible. Through intermittent, unpredictable social approval (likes, loves, retweets), we become dependent on the feedback that shows someone, somewhere, has noticed us.I've moved around so much as an adult- cities, states, countries- and it's precious to keep in touch with friends from lifetimes ago. Facebook and Twitter have brought me into communities of writers that were crucial to the development of my career; I might never have started writing if it weren't for this very space: Goodreads. Writing thoughtfully about the books I read became a DIY MFA. I learned story structure, narrative depth, character development, and how to construct a beautiful sentence not only by reading great (and not so great) books, but by being a part of a community that discusses them. It's not that any of these tools is bad. To be fair, they can bring pleasure and satisfaction. It's just that they are too much. And we, no matter how professional, intelligent, disciplined, have been manipulated to respond like rats to a sugar drip. Our brains are tired. We're overstimulated, over-connected, over-info'ed. It's not natural to have hundreds of ""friends,"" to share not only the minutiae of our daily lives, but its most intimate details, with people we wouldn't recognize if we passed them on the street, to constantly seek social approval, not to spend time in solitude, not to look up and observe the world around us. Newport, and his co-frères/sœurs James Clear, Atomic Habits, Jenny Odell How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy ,among others, are part of the emerging Attention Resistance, a loosely-knit group of educators, researchers, artists, and business professionals who are decrying the outsize role digital technology and social media play in our lives. 'Sean Parker, the first president of Facebook, has called the platform a “social-validation feedback loop” built around “exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology.” Tristan Harris, who worked as a “design ethicist” at Google, has said that smartphones are engineered to be addictive.' ""What It Takes to Put Your Phone Away,"" by Jia Tolentino,The New Yorker April 22, 2019.This just isn't right. I don't want to play the game anymore. Or more accurately, I don't want to be played anymore. I am accepting, moving toward embracing, that time spent on social media is ""low quality"" time. No matter how much I appreciate the connections, the sharing of fun moments or commiseration over the bad, I am coming to accept that I will be happier, more focused, productive, and peaceful the less time I spend on social media. I already take periodic breaks, employing various tips and technologies to reclaim my time and attention, but as Newport states, “willpower, tips, and vague resolutions are not sufficient by themselves to tame the ability of new technologies to invade your cognitive landscape.” Social media isn't that big a part of my life. I have a full-time + day job and rarely check social media during the day, even though my actual job requires that I post on both Facebook and Instagram. I am finishing the first draft of my fourth novel; most days I work out at twice a day; I read copiously. I'm busy, engaged in the real world. But still. I think social media is compromising my—and our society's at large—mental, intellectual, physical, and communal health. It's time to start doing things differently. Hey, there's an app for that! (actually, quite a few: Moment, Forest, Freedom, Focus, and one new to this Mac user: Ulysses, which looks an awful lot like Scrivener). Seriously, Cal Newport has a plan. Detox for thirty days, And then, once your 30-day detox is over, rebuild your relationship with digital technology from the ground up, with intentionality and minimalism, where technology serves you and what you deeply value. ""The goal is not simply to give yourself a break from technology, but to instead spark a permanent transformation of your digital life."" Newport recommends that you spend your time away from optional technology by discovering, or rediscovering, what you enjoy. It's the Marie Kondo approach to a digital life: if it's not useful or doesn't bring you joy, it needs to go, as much as is reasonable. Most of us have aspects to our jobs that make some of these technologies, including emails or texting, inevitable. There are engrossing sections of this book that discuss the beauty of solitude- a beauty we've all but lost with constant presence of our phones in our pockets, sharing the carefully curated moments of our lives or reading about others'. He argues that we are suffering from Solitude Deprivation - A state in which you spend close to zero time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from other minds. . There are also alarming looks at younger generations who've never known life without iPads or smartphones: the stunted growth of empathy, focus, motivation, and observation. It's not just terribly sad and weird, I believe it's a public health crisis. So, in a couple of weeks, beginning November 1, I will be starting my digital declutter. The first step is a 30-day digital declutter/detox from optional technologies. For me, that will be Facebook, including Messenger, Twitter, and Instagram. I may also let go of Goodreads and just upload my book reviews after I come back online, but I don't feel a digital drain here.I'll journal my detox, maybe I'll return to loving my blog, that I always seem to be too busy to post on. I won't force myself to finish this first draft of my novel by the end of November, but at the rate I'm going even before I begin my detox, I just might! I look forward to all that I will add to my life, as I let go of the ubiquity, the artificiality, of ""connection."" I want to learn to be better connected to and present in my real world life."
8,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,3,"I like the idea in here--less is more. We do not need all the apps and the social platforms. He's definitely talking to someone like me here. I am not a huge consumer of these platforms (mostly this is age-related). However, I listened to his book using audible and some apps have really helped me expand my mind (meditation apps and audible are two). There is no room in Newport's framework for using smartphones in a good way. He's sort of an intellectual luddite. I get this and sometimes I think it's easier to draw crisp and bright lines and never walk over them lest you get sucked in, but perhaps we need to think more about our relationship with our app-filled phones before we just swear them off. I think the better plan would be to practice radical consciousness when dealing with tech. To not walk numbly and dumbly into each platform and let it take our free will. "
9,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4753619-k-j-dell-antonia,5,"I've been thinking a lot these days about making more deliberate tech choices. No one human--not even Steve Jobs--ever expected technology to invade our lives the way it has. Instead, keeping us tethered to our tech and pulling that lever became the most popular and obvious way to monetize the Internet, and we individuals became, not the consumers, but the product being sold. And instead of cutting ourselves some slack--billions of dollars have been spent in the name of making the screens around us stickier and sticker, is it any wonder we're drawn in?—we feel guilty, as I did the other night, about being too weak to just shut it off and look away. The perfect antidote to that guilt is Cal Newport's Digital Minimalism. Newport skips the guilt (noting that we didn't ask for this and really could not have been prepared for it) and challenges to ask ourselves: what am I trying to do when I use this technology—and is this the best way to serve that goal? Build a philosophy around your tech use and you’ll use your tech more wisely. I'm trying, and this book is helping."

Still loving it, and checking it less and less in general. This book has remained top of mind since I read it, and keeps popping up in my life.

Alone with one’s thoughts. Or simply present with one’s self. The result is a global epidemic of distraction. A fomenting of loneliness and isolation. And a degradation of our humanity.The solution isn’t Ludditism. Instead it’s agency. We need not be victims of technology. We have the power to liberate ourselves from the tether of digital dependency. And the freedom it creates isn’t just the salve to what ails us, it’s the gateway to that which we seek most. Meaning. True human connection. And a reconnection with our innate humanity.Indeed, there is no substitute for real relationships. Boredom is useful. And focus is the new superpower."" (RRP Episode 447)Newport is the Marie Kondo of digital tidiness. Solitude is essential for creating new ideas, solitude as in the freedom from input from other minds.""Many people mistakenly associate [solitude] with physical separation—requiring, perhaps, that you hike to a remote cabin miles from another human being. This flawed definition introduces a standard of isolation that can be impractical for most to satisfy on any sort of regular basis. As Kethledge and Erwin explain, however, solitude is about what’s happening in your brain, not the environment around you. Accordingly, they define it to be a subjective state in which your mind is free from input from other minds."" — Cal Newport, Digital MinimalismNewport doesn't have to convince me, I'm a big fan of my personal time.

13,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/811928-forrest,4,"A little over a year ago, I posted an entry to my blog softly decrying the place that social media and screen time was playing in my life. A few months later, as I was preparing for a trip to Europe, I vowed to go without social media for two weeks while I was away (outside of texting my kids). I was . . . mostly successful. I was on very little, far less than ""normal"". And my strategy of taking a notebook with me and writing every night proved successful. But I didn't drop everything all the way. Now, as I said in the blogposts referenced above, I am no luddite. Not by a long shot. Okay, so I'm not on the bleeding edge of technology, either, but I am facile in the use of technology and catch on fairly quickly. But I do recall a time, many years ago, when I spent far less time online and was more satisfied with life, in general. I think that the quality of my online experience has diminished a great deal since those early days. Some of it has to do with the fact that those days were the ""wild west"" of the web when you could code your own (admittedly crappy) web page, you had to look hard to actually find information (remember webcrawler?), and the internet was far less homogenized. So, I decided I'd give Newport's book a read. I was leaning this direction anyway (c.f., my blog posts), and I'm not one to just swallow people's advice, but I was curious what he had to say about ""choosing a focused life in a noisy world"". I expected to read a lambasting of those who spend time online, a hard stance against distracting technology, a flaggelant's guide to the evils of the internet.I was pleasantly surprised to find this was not the case at all. Newport's arguments are measured and logical in a way that isn't derisive or condescending. It can be brutally honest, at times, and a touch too ascetic for my tastes. But only a touch. There is a lot here to learn from.Rather than go through Newport's arguments, I'd like to present what I've done already and will be doing as a result of this book. First of all, my habits on Goodreads are not changing at all. In fact, I would expect to see more action out of me, rather than less. Because reading is one of my core values, and I need to feed those core values. And I love other readers, for the most part. Goodreads, despite it's difficulties, feeds my soul.Facebook is dead to me. Yes, I'm there, but only to see cute pictures of my grandkids. I can do without Facebook, and am barely ever on there now. I keep a presence there so old high school friends can keep in touch and for family stuff, but I am now barely ever on there. Newport's book didn't start my process of leaving, but it definitely accelerated it.I love Twitter. I know, there's a lot to hate, but I do love it. However, I have changed my presence there dramatically. I followed about 4,000 people at one time. I've cut that down to under 1,000 and feel pretty great about that. Because now I can actually see the posts my friends make and the free static is much diminished now. I spot more articles and art that I like (loving art is another core value of mine), much of which I missed before because of all the flotsam and jetsam surrounding the really good posts.One habit I have changed on Twitter as a result of reading Newport's book is that I no longer ""like"" posts on Twitter. If I really like the post enough, I'll retweet it. Even better, if I really, really like the post, I will respond to the poster directly, rather than just clicking the little heart icon. I mean, really, who remembers who has ""liked"" their posts? Almost no one, in the long run. But I can recall some meaningful conversations that have happened between me and others on Twitter because I chose to respond and engage in real interaction rather than just satisfying my conscience by clicking like. I value those qualitatively-better conversations more and more as I avoid hitting the like button. This has made a huge difference in how I feel inside when I go online. Sounds corny, but it's true. Next month is February. I plan on taking the month offline except for Goodreads and blog posts. I have several blog posts that I have promised myself (hello, bullet journal) I would create, but have not. It's easier to go around liking stuff than it is actually creating stuff. And far less satisfying . . . I plan on re-engaging for that month as a creator. I have a denim jacket I got for Christmas that I'm going to sew over with patches I've bought. I will write more. I will read more. I will practice guitar more. I will RPG more. I will, in essence, live more. I will have to, in order to avoid boredom. Or, rather, to engage with and tackle boredom again. Then I'll come back and reassess my relationship with social media. You know, in some ways I really, really miss boredom. I need to go get into more trouble.Again, Goodreads friends need not worry. I will be here. And for the few people who actually read my blog, there will be posts. Many more posts. I've got to fill all that extra time up.Speaking of which, I need to do a few blog posts about my trip to Europe. I took lots of pictures . . . with my phone. See? I told you I wasn't a luddite!"
14,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6296289-tyler-j-gray,2,"2.25I have somewhat complicated feelings on this book. I feel like I need to say these are all just my opinions. Anyway..Through-out there were so many times I was internally screaming ""DISABLED PEOPLE EXIST!"" and wanting to DNF it. I almost wish I had. There is so much privilege that goes unseen that I wanted to scream. That's not to say I didn't get anything good out of this book, because I did, but it was a chore to wade through the privilege, so much of it I don't have myself, and the pretentiousness as well as an almost complete lack of being able to acknowledge the good social media has done. I know it has it's cons and flaws and people can definitely have an unhealthy relationship with it and the internet. Many do. That's a part of why I picked up this book. That doesn't mean it's evil, and I had heard that this book doesn't paint it as completely evil, and it doesn't. But it still drove me up a wall. The author even admits he has never used social media so you can take that how you want to as well.Personally I am physically disabled (as well as mental health issues that i've had long before social media-PTSD, Depression, Anxiety-that I have had my entire life due to my medical issues and I did grow up in a time before social media and the internet like it is today-mentioning that because it talks about how teens today are more anxious then ever before due largely to social media) as well as queer (non-binary trans and bisexual specifically), and i'll get to why I mention that in a second.Social media, even with it's cons, has given me a world of good. I grew up with VACteRL Association (used to be called VAteR syndrome) (capitalized like that because it's an acronym). I have rare medical issues and grew up with doctors constantly telling me ""never heard of that"" and looking at me like I got 3 heads. I still, less than 2 weeks away from being 31, have never, to my knowledge, met, in person, a SINGLE other person with vacterl. Not one. I grew up feeling all alone and like a freak of nature, in constant physical pain, like a burden because of the way people (including parents-not all of them-had 4 with stepparents) treated me, and like no one understood or even cared to. Add to that fact that at 13 I realized i'm bisexual and grew up thinking that's a sin and that I was going to hell for it. So I tried to pray myself straight for a few years. Obviously it didn't work. I'm proud to be queer now but man was it a journey. I also was confused as to my gender all my life but never had the words to describe how I felt.What does that have to do with social media? As an adult I found facebook groups for people with vacterl. Finally, I can talk to others that have the same medical issues, have had the exact same pain and problems, that understand because they go through it too. Some even older than me despite being told if I was born just years earlier i'd be dead. Do you know how valuable this is? In addition to realizing i'm not alone and that there are others out there that understand and care...we can also share medical information. This can save lives or at least help each other live a little better. With rare medical issues this is an understatement. Feeling all alone is the worst feeling.With social media I can now find many other disabled people who even when we have different issues we can often relate in certain ways. And I can find many other queer people now and see what teen me didn't get the chance to, that being queer isn't a bad thing. And now I know the word non-binary...finally, I understood my issue with not being able to describe my gender growing up. I knew how I felt LONG before I had the words. The word may be new to me, but the feelings aren't. Someone knowing that they aren't alone can save their LIFE. Many people don't have the privilege of having someone in their real life that understands or seems to care.Time and time again this book talks about strenuous activity and walking. Umm...physically disabled here. I can't walk much or physically do a lot. Some people...can't walk at all. It even says (talking about someone named Thoreau) ""But if we remain inspired by his vision, and try to spend as much time as is reasonable on foot and engaging in the ""noble art"" of walking, we too will experience success in preserving our health and spirits."" I didn't know I had picked up a fitness book. ""Noble art"" of walking? So what about those that can't walk? That can't get out much? My medical issues keep me home-bound and i'm far from the only home-bound disabled person. Through-out this book it completely forgets disabled people exist, that not everyone can walk or do strenuous activity, or get out of the house often, or has people around them in real life that actually care about them or that understand them in some way.It talks about craftsmanship, making things with your hands (not everyone has hands), and how making something in the physical real world is superior and seems to be what makes a person...matter. Time and time again it gives off the impression that if you are disabled, if you can't be handy in someway, you don't matter. Granted it seems to completely forget disabled people exist. The pretentiousness oozing off the pages made me want to throw it.It also constantly mentions smartphones and to use your desktop computer once in awhile and you're smartphone a lot less so you are on the internet less. I'm sure that can work for some people but it believes that everyone HAS a desktop computer. Many people are too poor and the only access they have to the internet is their smartphone. I'm quite the opposite, smartphones confuse the fuck out of me. I do have a tablet but I use that for ebooks mainly. I do have a desktop...that i'm always on. Because i'm home-bound.It also constantly says that downtime is overrated. Why must we always be productive? Why can't we just relax once in awhile? We aren't machines. We are human. Downtime can be necessary. Why must leisure activity be yet another thing to use as a measure of productivity and why must how productive someone is be tied to their worth as a human? When talking about leisure activities it kept saying ""high quality"" leisure activities aka strenuous and productive stuff.If you are wondering why I even picked it up, it's because I do want to be on the internet/social media less because I want to do other things. I want to draw, paint, write, read more. I thought maybe I could get something out of this book. And as I said in the beginning, I did. It's not without some words of wisdom or information that is useful as well as some things I wish more people knew. I don't actually regret reading it, I just didn't like reading it and it was hell to get through. I can't really recommend it and I feel like I wasted my money on it because I bet I could've just googled stuff. But the good stuff in it is why it gets a strong 2 stars from me, rather than ya know, 1 star.It talks about how we are social animals and how that evolved in our brains and why social media is kinda fucking with it. And how we aren't wired to be constantly wired, which i'd agree with. How we could generally use some solitude to be with our thoughts. A part of me hates to give it a low rating because of how valuable I actually do find the good in it. I would love a book on this topic but more nuanced and inter-sectional. I'm glad for what I got out of it and i'll try to take that and forget the rest of my frustrations with it.This review can also be found on my blog

15,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5501950-kate,3,"Cal Newport’s Digital Minimalism is Marie Kondo’s tidying philosophy applied to technology: technology isn’t inherently bad or good, but it should be judiciously curated to fit your pre-existing values of what constitutes a good life. Rather than going to Facebook or Instagram or a news feed of breaking news to find human connection and entertainment, pre-decide what you value in the spheres of entertainment and connection and then tailor the tools of social media to achieve those pre-defined objectives. The structure of Newport’s arguments: social media tools like Facebook and Twitter have been ruthlessly engineered to take up as much of our time as possible; the human brain is built in such a way that we become anxious and stressed seeking these notifications, yet their arrival fails to meet our need for real social communication; eliminating the things we’ve come to take for granted – constant access to a mobile phone, social media, and the internet – is much more possible than it sounds and is likely to result in significant long-term benefits. This last point forms the crux of much of what this book is based on, an experiment Newport ran with 1,600 of his e-mail list subscribers who already agreed to a 30-day “digital detox” and then shared their experiences with him. Many of Newport’s insights come from what his readers discovered, and throughout the book, he lays out various ways to try this detox in your own life.I suspect it will be difficult to fully appreciate this book unless you implement the recommended intervention. Without trying it, this book borders being viewed as one of the many get-rid-of-your-smartphone writings that have begun to appear over the last few years (I’ve read most of Newport’s previous books, and this was the first time I felt he published in the middle of a trend, rather than being at the forefront, or even being the catalyst for, a trend). Part of this is the fault of the book itself: unlike Deep Work or So Good They Can’t Ignore You, it’s poorly structured. The guide to follow the digital detox is all over the place, with some steps in the first few chapters and some in the last few; Newport introduces it before he’s had you buy in to the idea with background information on why digital addiction is bad, etc. That also means even readers who do try to implement the detox might not do so the way Newport intended, and fall off the wagon before they achieve the end goal. Due to being a longtime reader of Newport, I actually participated in his initial digital detox experiment and can say: it works, and it can significantly change your life. It’s why I gave this book 3 starts instead of 2 (in addition to the structural issue, Newport’s examples are often superficial and mainstream and unlikely to be new to many readers). Newport also offers three key points that might be lost if you’re not paying attention closely. First, he is not advocating for the elimination of all social tools. He is advocating instead for an intentional approach to your life: understanding your values, understanding what you need, and then crafting how you approach social media in response to that. With the recent “disconnect” trend, his work risks being labeled as a “get rid of everything” – when instead he’s only advocating “get rid of everything for 30 days as a way to gather data about what’s truly important to you.” Second, and possibly even more important: you will not succeed at removing social media and other distracting digital agents from your life unless you have something substantive to fill them with. Great, you stopped bingewatching Netflix for 3 hours each night – but if you haven’t cultivated something intentional to fill that three hours with (rock climbing, in-person dinner with friends, mastering the art of cooking, whatever), you’ll feel restless and empty and slide back into your previous habits. Finally, there is a difference between “connecting” with your network (passively liking someone’s new baby photos) and truly cultivating a relationship with them (going over to friend’s house to meet said new baby). We are being pushed more and more to connect, but connections are meaningless without those deeper underpinnings. Up until now, we’ve tended to talk about technology as “all good.” Newport encourages us to view it, “some parts of this are useful – use only those parts.” Time, as he discusses, is literally money – and your time starting a screen is making other people money. The people who built Facebook could not have done so if they had spent hours every day on social media platforms. So, in summary: An important message but you have to do Newport’s actual detox; that being said, this book is poorly structured and is a lot of repackaging of other people’s ideas."
16,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27482054-huyen-chip,0,The entire thesis of the book is: uninstall all your apps and only reinstall those that actually serve a purpose. The rest of the books is just examples.
17,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,4,"I've been trying to write this review for nearly a week, which has been repeatedly stymied by lack of focus and exhaustion due to sleeping badly. Consequently I have lowered my standards and invite you to lower your expectations.I was bitterly amused when, six months after I reserved a copy, 'Digital Minimalism' turned up in the library the day before lockdown. Amazing timing. Once my initial desire to read only escapist fiction had abated, however, it suddenly seemed like an ideal read at the moment. Lockdown has profoundly changed my relationship with technology, which will undoubtedly have long term effects. What most struck me when reading Newport's book, though, was that I still seem to qualify as a digital minimalist and possibly always have without being aware of it. The practicalities of digital minimalism are wildly different during a pandemic, though.For context, I have long believed that personal communication technology was fine until 2004, whereupon it went too far. Consequently, I hate touch screens, returned to using an unsmart phone after trying the smart kind, and relied solely upon second-hand electronics seven or more years old. I switched off my router for an entirely internet and screen free day once a week and restricted my social media use in various ways. Then coronavirus emerged. Initially, this led me further restrict my internet access, as the news and twitter were so anxiety-inducing. Almost exactly a month ago, though, Britain went into lockdown. I live alone and have been working at home, so haven't had a face-to-face conversation for more than a month. Being outside and anywhere near other human beings now feels like a terrifying threat. The same technologies I tried to reduce my use of are now absolutely essential, as they allow me connection with other human beings. Consequently, I've stopped having internet free days, allowed myself much more social media use, and, most significantly, purchased a new laptop. My creaky 7 year old machines repeatedly crashed during video calls. Part of my rationale for using old laptops and phones was to discourage their use through unreliability and inconvenience. I did not foresee the need to rely entirely upon them for human companionship.That's enough about me for the moment. 'Digital Minimalism' is the work of an American associate professor of computer science, whose central thesis is that technology use should be based on personal utility rather than reflexive adoption due to novelty. This is consistent with and complimentary to The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power, as it sets out strategies of personal resistance to the global phenomenon explained in Zuboff's book. Newport emphasises the deliberately manipulative design of social media, apps, and smart phones, which aim to consume as much of your time and attention as possible. The book makes its points via specific voices of authority and personal anecdote backed by academic research, as it is written to be widely accessible. The style is very easy to read, yet I was pleased to spot a thorough set of endnotes with citations as well.I appreciate that Newport distills his thesis into a single sentence for ease of quoting: Digital Minimalism.A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimised activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else.In other words, articulate the purposes of the time you spend on particular apps or websites. At present, goodreads lets me track my favourite hobby and read other people's book reviews. Twitter allows me to keep up with certain friends and their cats. Whatsapp allows me to keep up with other friends. Tumblr is a fashion and meme magazine. Netflix is my TV and cinema. Spotify is my stereo. Etc. However, I did not take Newport's suggested route to select these websites. He suggests you ask, ""Is this the best way to use technology to support this value?"" Before lockdown, probably not. I had additional and often better ways to keep up with nearby friends and pursue my interests in books, fashion, and films. Now those are not available. It is important to emphasise, though, that the online versions feel inferior. I miss hugging my friends and eating meals with them; I miss libraries; I miss browsing charity shops and spotting stylish outfits on passersby; I miss cinemas. Of course, I fully accept the need for lockdown and do not begrudge the lack of nonessential diversions in order to save lives. There are some tiny pleasures to this period of time, my favourite of which is walking on the road rather than the pavement on my daily walk. If you haven't tried this and the traffic has vanished from your roads too, I highly recommend it. While looking and listening carefully for vehicles, wander down the middle of a residential street - an experience to be savoured while it lasts. Cycling on empty roads is also pretty great. The principles of digital minimalism certainly chime with my pre-existing views: clutter is costly, optimisation is important, and intentionality is satisfying. I hate clutter in physical or digital realms, consider it important to use technology with specific aims in mind, and (as Newport admits is very common) can be a bit smug about it. There is something satisfying about seemingly getting one over on big tech in a tiny way. This is part of the reason I'm amused by the bizarre book recommendations that goodreads gives me (notably the Extraordinary Chickens saga); they suggest I'm not providing particularly helpful data. I don't want targeted recommendations! I love choosing books using my own arbitrary tastes and happenstance, rather than essentially being marketed them by amazon in a wig. Despite not always being amenable to Newport's choice of illustrative examples, due to transatlantic cultural differences, I approve of what he's saying in this book and enjoyed the structured and systematic way in which he explained it. To embrace digital minimalism, the recommendation is to spend 30 days taking a break from optional technologies (after carefully defining these in your own specific context). Although theoretically you could do this during lockdown, it seems like a dubious idea. For a start, my mind isn't clear enough to judge what is and isn't optional as at least a third of it is busy yelling PANIC PANIC DEATH DEATH at all times. Moreover, during the next 30 days the technologies that are optional in my life might change substantially as lockdown restrictions and/or work demands change. Most importantly, however, the idea is to rediscover non-digital pursuits during the 30 days, which is simply impossible at present. To rediscover an activity at the moment, everything required for it must already be within your home. Crucially, this includes motivation and energy, both of which are scarcer than flour and yeast. (I actually have both flour and slightly expired yeast, but more than a month into lockdown have not tried baking bread. I feel quite guilty about that.) After describing the 30 day digital break procedure, Newport suggests a range of thoughtful practises to manage your new relationship with technology. Unfortunately these begin with a chapter titled, 'Spend Time Alone'. There will undoubtedly be many books written about feeling alone or otherwise during the pandemic. The core of the matter is, I think, that how alone we feel is no longer under our control in the same way. I live alone, so am alone all the time that I'm not on a video call whether I like it or not. Colleagues and friends with partners, housemates, and/or children are barely ever alone whether they like it or not. This lockdown has certainly caused me to reflect on what I do and don't miss about human companionship, as I'm sure is the case for many. More than a month in, I still think that for me being in lockdown alone is the least worst alternative. I wish I had a cat, though. Newport is a great advocate for taking walks alone without your phone and I fully agree with that. He considers time spent alone with your thoughts to be very important, which is no less relevant indoors than outside. Sticking your head out of the window and listening to the changed tempo of sounds is a pleasant little mindfulness exercise I've been trying. While at the moment I consider video calling vital to avoid total isolation, I wonder to what extent my insomnia, absence of concentration, and inability to relax at all is exacerbated by constant screentime and increased social media scrolling. I think of the latter as a tranquiliser, while fully aware that reading a book has a much more calming effect (if I can concentrate on a book). On twitter there is the constant risk of falling down a rabbit hole of extremely worrying and totally unconfirmed pandemic content, even when you take precautions. I lock my twitter, follow only 50 accounts the majority of which are IRL friends, and always keep my timeline set to Latest Tweets.The big question raised by lockdown in the context of this book is where to direct your attention. The Big Five tech companies obviously want it, to provide them with data. In the time before the pandemic there were plenty of other things to pay attention to that are now on hold: meeting up with friends and family, going to the cinema, visiting beautiful places, going to museums, art galleries, and libraries, etc, etc. I adore reading, but even I could not face being at home for >23 hours a day, working for 8, sleeping badly for 7ish, and reading the rest of the time. Technology's addictive glow is more attractive when there's such a terrifying reality to be distracted from. I think lockdown requires a very different personal agreement to be negotiated with technology. I definitely haven't got it right yet; scrolling twitter at 2am is obviously not conducive to sleeping well and distraction by further fragmenting my attention isn't very calming.Being a digital minimalist requires, 'stripping away superfluous features of new technologies to allow them to access functions that matter while avoiding unnecessary distraction'. This can be genuinely difficult, as functions I consider superfluous after often complex or even impossible to switch off. There is also the question of how much distraction is genuinely necessary right now. I am still closely controlling my news access, because the ever-growing coronavirus death toll and shockingly incompetent political responses in the UK and US are very distressing. No-one gains from my being too weepy or anxious to work from home because of news overload. Rewatching my favourite sitcom (Community) and looking at pictures of pets feel like necessary distraction right now. Nonetheless, I worry that too much screentime is going to worsen my eyesight and create habits that will be difficult to modify. On the other hand, I've been reassuring my students that this is a time of crisis so they should not expect themselves to be able to work as normal. I could maybe listen to my own advice and not pressure myself to cope in a totally optimised and systematically thought out manner. I suspect some would find 'Digital Minimalism' grating at the moment, as parts of it do provoke sighs of amazement and sadness at what we took for granted a mere few months ago. While I still found it worthwhile, it basically confirmed my pre-existing views and pre-lockdown behaviour so your mileage may vary substantially. For those not overloaded with caring responsibilities and other work, lockdown potentially offers the time for introspection combined with utterly unsuitable conditions for it. A state of intense anxiety and total lack of certainty about the future is making it difficult for me to think at all and I'm definitely not the only one. Nonetheless, spending more time than ever using digital technologies should really encourage us to consider what we're using them for and whether that's actually what we want, now and once we can venture outside again. Minor tweaks to technology use can really improve morale. With the disclaimer that I have no authority to recommend anything to anyone, here are my tips for digital minimalism during a pandemic:- Daily walks. In the UK, you can go outside for one form of exercise a day. I've been forensically exploring my local area to improve the scope and detail of my mental map. Appreciate the lack of traffic while you can. All I take with me on these walks (or bike rides) are my keys, never my phone or headphones.- When watching TV or a film, do some simple crafts that you already knew how to do. I've knitted a somewhat slapdash cowl.- Limit your time reading news. I only allow myself 30 minutes a day. All articles, absolutely no liveblogs. I don't follow any news accounts or journalists on any social media. If someone I know retweets lots of news, I switch off their retweets or even mute them. - Prune who and what you follow on social media. Tweak your feeds so they provide what you actually want: cat pictures, news from your friends, etc. I hate facebook so suggest not using that at all.- Keep a paper diary. I began one at the start of the year and of course it has turned into The Coronavirus Chronicles. I'm finding it very helpful, given that time has become such a peculiar frangible thing, to record at the end of the day what I actually did with myself. What work did I manage, what did I read, who did I talk to or exchange messages with, what do I remember of the news articles I read, how do I feel about it all, etc. - Two of Newport's suggestions that are still absolutely relevant and I already did: don't click like and consolidate your text-based messaging into a single service if remotely possible. Finally, for personal amusement reasons I've adopted Victorian terminology for my newly digitalised social life. I think it sounds less awkward! Examples: ""I paid a call on my parents yesterday evening"" = we videochatted via an iPad propped on the kitchen worksurface. ""I will be at home to callers on Friday evening."" = catch me on whatsapp at the end of the week. ""Here is my calling card."" = this is the link for the Zoom meeting. ""How would you prefer me to call upon you?"" = do you want to use skype, zoom, or hangouts? ""I am not at home to callers."" = this evening I prefer to be alone with netflix and my knitting. There's no real connection to digital minimalism, but I find being archaically formal makes total separation from people I love very slightly less depressing."

I've found myself sitting down with a cup of coffee for a quick scroll of content, looking up to find 30 minutes or more have passed. The thing is, these social media scrolls rarely leave me feeling the way, say, a great book does: rewarded, challenged, or that I have just spent my time doing something useful. All the same, I found it harder and harder to pull away from my screen (I'm sure the feeling is nigh-universal these days). I decided to veer away from my typical reading and try out a self-help book about how to remodel my relationship to these new technologies.I started out this audiobook and had some major worries: would this book work as well in audio when so much is given as ""practices and exercises?"" I was right to feel tentative since this book, for most people, is going to work a lot better in print than it is playing through your ears. Nonetheless, for my purposes the book was able to deliver its thesis and provide some helpful tips on how to curb social media/screen time use. Cal Newport does a good job providing helpful tips and educating the listener about how exactly these apps can sap your will to be functional. Occasionally I found the book to be a touch on the preachy side, but that's not to be entirely unexpected in a self-help book. More often than not I found myself able to take a piece of Newport's suggested practice and put it into play in my daily life. My phone is now entirely black and white (a change that my friends describe as Schindler's List: iPhone edition), all social media (excepting Goodreads!) has been scrubbed from my phone, and I've been doing my best to divert my time to more fulfilling activities. My wife and I have even been engaging in a modified digital declutter! I'm not going to take up all of the practices that Newport describes--indeed, there's a lot here that just doesn't jive with some of my professional requirements--but it's been enough to make a real difference.Definitely a step outside of my reading comfort zone, but one that has had pretty positive effects on my screen time. I'll be recommending this to a few friends over the coming year."

For a few months, I've been trying unsuccessfully to reduce the amount of time I spend browsing social media on my phone. The screen time report has been dismal reading. I also realize that when I am tired after a long day at the office, my capacity to resist is next to nil.I am now going to make a serious attempt at decluttering my digital life. Tonight I will delete all social media on my phone and take a 30 day break. I feel horrible. I absolutely don't want to do it. However, after months of failed attempts to curtail my use , I do see that a sabbatical is the only way. After 30 days I presume I will go back to using Facebook at least, and absolutely Goodreads. Goodreads is the only one I am considering not blocking completely. Maybe I'll log in on PC once a week on Saturday? But no. I can do it. I can be strong. For 30 days I will only review with paper and pen and I'll write up my reviews in May. ""Your monthlong break from optional technologies resest your digital life. You can now rebuild it from stratch in a much more intentional and minimalist manner. To do so, apply a three-step technology screen to each optional technology you're thinking about reintroducing.""""To allow an optional technology back into your life at the end of the digital declutter it must:1. Serve something you deeply value (offering some benefit is not enough.)2. Be the best way to use technology to serve this value (if it's not, replace it with something better).3. Have a role in your life that is constrained with a standard operating procedure that specifies when and how you use it.""So my friends - good bye! I will be back on May 1. There is no doubt in my mind that Goodreads will be on my re-introduction list. I love books and this community, that has let me discover so many great stories I might otherwise have overlooked. "

22,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13198822-settare,2,"During the first half of 2019, I was reading mostly about environmental issues, which led me to read a few books on the Zero Waste lifestyle, which then led me to read a few books on minimalism (or rather, starting a few books on minimalism, getting through most of them, but almost never finishing them). I have implemented many minimalist and zero waste practices in my own life since, and it has benefited me. Then, as I have always been struggling with social media addiction, I came across this book. This book is alright. It's well written, interesting, and its logos is so convincing that it made me deactivate all of my social media accounts and go -almost- completely offline for around six months during the second half of 2019. The book makes some very interesting (and unsettling) points about how our infatuation with the screen of our phones and laptops has had many negative effects on our lives and minds as a whole. Then in the last part of the book, Newport lays out his suggestions for how to become a ""digital minimalist"" and how to reduce social media time (and online time in general) into the absolute minimum. While I think his suggestions are all nice and applicable and even liberating for someone in his situation (A middle-class white person living in a developed country, who has most of his loved ones within a rather short distance and whose life isn't constantly disrupted by political news and also doesn't rely on the internet to make a living or advocate for his work), they simply do not work for many of us in less privileged situations and/or less developed countries. I live in Iran, I have most of my friends and loved ones scattered around the globe, each in a different time zone, I get to see them once every few years, and my life is constantly disrupted by heated political news and war threats in the region. I don't see myself being able to implement Mr. Newport's full recipe to digital oblivion in my own life in any way, and thinking about the fact that I can't live up to them gives me a lot of anxiety. I have certainly benefited from the tips and methods, but I don't see myself being able to convert to complete digital minimalism.In short, it's an interesting book, it makes some important points, it's worth the read, I've learned some habits and tips from it, and that's great. If you can consider adopting only a few of the practices it suggests to any extent that is possible for you, or even be a bit more mindful of your online life, then I think the book has had its impact, and it can, in my opinion, improve your life even if just a little bit.

This is probably the best book that I've encountered on the subject of digital minimalism, and having revisited it around the time I finally decided to delete my Facebook permanently (and am close to doing the same with my Instagram), I can safely say that this is an incredibly useful practical guide on how to move away from being phone dependent.

It's like a checklist: uncritical quotations from Thoreau, unquestioned male privilege, neoliberal individualism, smug superiority. Did you know, the internet is addictive! But, it's not like an *actual* drug; you'll get over it if you just set very firm rules and get a new hobby. Like woodworking! Welding! Cross fit! We desperately need to have nuanced and sophisticated conversations about technology and social media. This is not one."

27,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25226945-ashley,4,"Reviewed on: Ashes Books & Bobs.The moment I saw the cover for this book, I knew I had to pick it up. I often find myself overwhelmed by technology. While others seem at ease holding a conversation, scheduling an Uber, and texting 3 different friends, my mind struggles to keep up with one task at a time. I feel strained and exhausted by information overload. I want to be on social media less and in the real world more. Yet, when ten different people are needing ten different things in one moment, how are we to keep up, if not for technology?Since this book released, I’ve seen many negative reviews berating this book on bookstagram. Yet, I think it’s important to examine the source of the reviews here. As a bookstagrammer myself, it’s easy to get sucked into the black hole of beautifully cozy book pictures and chatting with fellow book lovers. The next time you look up, 2 hours have vanished in a flash. The internet is addictive, and like the addicts some of us are, it’s hard to admit we have a problem. Earlier this year I decided to take stock of my social media usage and I came to a few realizations about how the internet environment was affecting me. Since then, I’ve drastically reduced the amount of time I spend online. Some of the things I’ve found helpful were even mentioned in this book, like turning off social media notifications and creating set times to check my online accounts. These tools and others mentioned in this book have helped the level of overwhelm I feel on a daily basis, allowing me to reclaim pockets of time that were whittled away online. Still, I feel that addictive pull urging me to log in and scroll.In many ways, I’m technologically inept. It took a weekend away in Richmond, VA to learn how to use the AirDrop feature on my phone. I’m sure there are plenty of features I don’t know how to use, but I’m still severely dependent upon my smartphone. I was hoping this book would allow me to evaluate ways to manage that dependence on an even deeper level. You see, my husband doesn’t have a cell phone at all. He is the essence of what this book is about. I see how stressfree his life is, how much free time he’s able to claim, and how little the pings, dings, and rings affect him. When someone isn’t accessible, people find someone else to bother. And I’m a little envious.Cal Newport did an exceptional job of relaying the information in this book in a highly interesting way. It’s rare that I find a nonfiction book I can’t stop thinking about. Since I’ve finished reading the book, I’ll notice things that were mentioned in the writing in my daily life, sparking thoughts and ideas. I especially loved the use of Henry David Thoreau’s Walden as a prime comparison for the Digital Minimalism philosophy. Thoreau’s writings are some of my all-time favorites, sparking a sense of wonder and motivation in me to live a simpler life. Why not apply the same principals to the modern world that often constrains us in the tightest boxes while forcing us to believe we have ultimate freedom? The first time Thoreau’s name was mentioned, I was sold.Furthermore, I appreciated the depth in which Newport was able to detail how deeply our fast-paced, hyper-connected society is affecting our mental health and physical well -being. Depression and anxiety are at all-time highs, especially in our teens and young adults and yet we can’t seem to correlate that with our social media consumption. We truly aren’t able to understand the effects of smartphones on our overall health because they are still relatively new inventions. How much of our attention, concentration, and self-worth are these tools diminishing?There are so many thought-provoking aspects of this book, I could discuss it for days. It made a profound impact on my thinking and reaffirmed many things I already knew. Most importantly, however, this book is not attacking anyone for their smartphone use. It’s simply asking us to evaluate our needs for our own lives and adjust in a way that will benefit our lifestyle. If you’re like I was and feeling a sense of constant overwhelm, I think this book is worth a purchase. I honestly think it could benefit every single smartphone user if read with an open mind. I highly recommend it!"

The history of social media and how it is engineering to be so compelling was an eye opener. He gives very useful ideas about how we can rebel against the ""attention economy"". The author stresses the importance of spending time being bored and being alone with our thoughts, which is definitely something to mull over!A useful book with practical advice that will change my approach to technology.

Newport provides some helpful concrete changes that make a lot of sense! 
30,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53304148-tim-casteel,5,"Shockingly, Newport has never ever had a social media account. So why write a book on technology?Because he (rightly) sees that our screens are ""the single biggest factor shaping our lives today.”Digital Minimalism was written to help us find a way ""to be fully human.”The main obstacle= our phones.We need something to keep us from staring into the abyss (most choose to be distracted by their phones). Newport espouses active leisure and community as that replacement: ""quality activities fill the void your screens were previously tasked to help you ignore.” Which is brilliant and true. But not sufficient (more on that below).Newport’s unique and important contribution to the technology conversation is he does not merely dwell on the negative psychological effects of technology (distraction, envy, lust). Newport suggests the main problem:""I want to bypass a discussion of the potential pathologies of the social media universe and keep our focus on the zero-sum relationship between online and offline interaction.I believe this to be the most fundamental of the issues caused by the digital communication era.""Newport’s other unique insight: in order to displace the gravitational pull of our phones, we need to replace it with something (high value activities and community). He begins with Why. Why give up hours on your phone? Because you want more time to invest in things that actually satisfy - more time in face-to-face relationships, more time to invest in active leisure. Reminds me of Chalmer’s “the only way to dispossess it of an old affection, is by the expulsive power of a new one.”As much as I loved Digital Minimalism (5 stars for sure!) Newport lack of faith prevents him from seeing spiritual solutions. His diagnosis is spot on. But his cure of active leisure falls short.Here's my quick spiritual analysis of Digital MinimalismBad - mindless phone scrolling* We vindicate our worth through likesBetter - active leisure in community (where Newport leaves us)* We vindicate our worth through intentional living and producing real things of real valueBest - rest and community * We can rest because we are vindicated by Christ. We don't need to DO anything (not even active leisure) to validate our existence.(Philosopher Josef Pieper powerfully makes this connection in Leisure: the Basis of Culture- ""leisure is not possible unless it has a durable…link with…divine worship.""An easier to read version is found in Buchanan's The Rest of God)"

I was a little worried it would just be a re-hashing of his previous book Deep Work, through a slightly different lens, but it’s not that at all. Cal brings in lots of psychology, and provides practical (and pragmatic) recommendations for cultivating a better relationship with technology.He also draws heavily from the experience of about 1,600 people who undertook a 30-day “technology declutter” during the research phase for the book. Cal uses their stories to share what worked for them, what didn’t work, and ways to address some of the most common pitfalls of trying to become a digital minimalist.I won’t lie, this book is scary. It’s making me rethink every single online service I use, and I realize that I’m going to give up a lot of it. But I also somehow feel lighter and freer, having come to those conclusions.Cal isn’t dogmatic in his approach in this book. He lays out the evidence for why the intermittent positive reinforcement and drive for social approval that are built into social media is detrimental to our mental health and relationships. He gives practical advice on how to choose and use the tools that will provide benefit to you. But then he also tells you to use the principles behind what he’s saying, but do what works for you. I really appreciate that."

A few years ago I made a real effort to more intentionally use social media and online news, moving toward more of an ""I find it"" vs ""it finds me,"" and really heavily restricting what comes into my brain. It was _amazing_, really changed my mood and my attitude. So I was expecting this to be a rehash of what I had already bought into, along with the typical 200 pages of padding.There was some really great stuff in here, though! I loved the sections about finding high-quality real-life activities to replace optional online media with, instead of just giving it up. I liked the focus on using social media purely to set up real-world conversations and meetings.There was enough here to recommend it even to people who've already bought into the premise.

What I liked the most is that every information presented in the book was linked with a scientific article, or another book, or some study, meaning that they are true and not just some stories about some people who found technique X useful to improve their Y as all the self improvement books are made of.Furthermore, I identified even more with the author's thinking since we are more or less working in the same industry (Computer Science) and are both critically evaluating the products and tools that we (not we directly, but we as an industry) are building."

The inclusion of everyday people and their experiences with Newport's steps really helped bring a more practical, realistic nature to the book. I also liked the fact that this didn't completely demonise social media in the same way other books can do. I kind of wish I'd read this in physical format though, as the audiobook isn't narrated by Newport and I'd have liked to have heard him read it himself. I'll probably end up picking up a physical copy though and re-reading it at some point because I want to annotate the shit out of this as I try and implement some of Newport's suggestions."

38,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,3,"Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noise World is a self-help book for those who wish to change because their real life has been negatively impacted by their digital life. Among many devices, apps and entertainment tools, the author sets his eyes mostly on mobile phones and social medias when arguing about the principles of digital minimalism and their implementation. I like the psychology part. As a computer engineer, I know very well that mobile apps and social medias are not ""gifts from Nerd gods building a better world"", but money making machines designed to make users spend as much time as possible on their sites or apps. Time is money. Your attention and your data are their money. Adam Alter's book Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked (my review) is quoted in this book. Two common psychological tools--intermittent positive reenforcement and our internal drive for social approval--are what employed to make us addicted. In 2013, DSM5 first time included behavior addiction.However, the focus of the book is not psychology, but self-help. The main steps of the author's digital minimalism are digital de-clutter and building a meaningful, high-quality leisure. Some arguments are philosophical, such as the necessity of solitude. The author is a fan of Thoreau and earlier Presidents of the United States.I agree with the principles of the digital minimalism. Some of his advices are useful, and some are not. Removing all social medias from your mobile phone is a good idea. I often compulsively check my phone because it's a distraction from tasks at hand that I do not like. To implement digital minimalism is to evaluate and re-construct your daily life.The chapter about real life socializing is impractical to a lot of the people in today's busy ultra-metropolitan life. The author has not considered introverts. Introverts seldom seek out social gatherings. It's not saying introverts don't need social connections. They prefer deep, meaningful connections that are increasingly hard to find. For these introverts, no much difference between superficial, light-touch connections and relationships in real life or online.This book is good for those not yet qualified as behavior addiction and without complications such as OCD or anxiety disorder."
39,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31175254-sudheendra-fadnis,4,"Another master piece from Cal Newport. While the book Deep Work stresses on how to thrive professionally, this one is all about how to flourish in our personal lives through discretionary use of social media. We should be the masters of the technology we use, and not the other way around. We live in an age of dramatic distractions , which is driven by the attention merchants such as Facebook, Instagram , Twitter etc.Now a these days one's attention has become one of the most valuable resources in the world. And companies such as Google or Facebook for that matter, do all they can to hijack our attention and make us spend as much time as we could on the social media , because it drives their revenue. This should not sound like a conspiracy though. That is how their business models are built. Spending time on social media is like playing a slot machine. Once you are in, you get addicted to it.However, as Cal Newport makes it clear in the book, it is the unexpectedness of the information updates that makes social media an addictive phenomenon. The only remedy for this , as Cal Newport suggests is to go on a Digital Detox for a month, which might revolutionize the way you live your life. However, the digital diet should be based on the philosophy of technology, which states that you take stock of the digital distractions you have in your life, conduct an audit of the activities which are valuable and meaningful to you, and subtracts the digital distractions that add little or no value to your life. The most interesting thing about this book was the importance of solitude. The greats like Arthur Schopenhaeur, Fredreich Nietzsche, Soren Kierkegaard, Descartes, and many others harnessed the power of solitude to come up with world-changing ideas. In today's world, what we commonly observe is 'solitude deprivation'.The next highlight which I liked about this book is the importance of long walks. The greats such as Henry David Thoreau and Fredreich Nietzsche could get their game-changing ideas through long walks. Most recently, Steve Jobs. The one advice which particularly stuck with me was: ""never hit the like button'. Also, the importance of High quality leisure also deserves an honorable mention. This is not some thing only the FI(Financially Independent) can afford. Anybody can do it. The free time that we have at our disposal should not be spent on passive consumption of social media, which requires little or no cognitive effort. Rather it should be directed towards activities which require concentrated effort such as reading a difficult piece of literature or a strenuous workout. The next value add activity which he mentions is writing letters to self. Through this, we develop the ability of thinking on the paper. Abraham Lincoln and Dwight D Eisenhower, I learnt had this habit. It is very encouraging to learn that I am already implementing some of the tips given in the book. All in all, it was a great read."

Only, surviving means how to make the best of, and you may be inclined to miss that you are in a wilderness, and are being preyed on.Digital minimalism is a philosophy followed by many in this time and world, and from what I saw, adopting this philosophy if the best way to conquer and thrive in the age of information.The main issue this book deals with is social media. Cliché a bit I know. A subtle downside to this book is that Cal Newport never entered the social media sphere. So you are told how to quit an addiction by someone who has never experienced it. That proves to be an advantage of sorts sometimes, and he makes up for it with extensive research.This book starts by convincing you that the life you are living with social media is inconvenient at best. Moving on, you get introduced to digital minimalism and the various techniques that come with it to overcome an addiction, and use digital tools without letting them use you.Over the course of the book, Cal Newport draws from the wisdom of great thinkers, from Nitzsche to Teddy Roosevelt, as well as various examples from people like you and me, who emphasize his arguments for digital minimalism.If you are here, reading this review, you should probably pick this book up, read it, and apply what it prescribes to the best of your ability."

The good part is – it is all collected together in a book. The basic idea is – less is more. But that is true for most things in life. A few points from the book:•	Delete social media apps from the phone (only have one installed)•	Install apps that limit mobile apps usage (don't find it too useful)•	Downgrade to a dumb phone like in the old days (very tough to do)•	Remove all notifications (already doing it)•	Delete unnecessary files and programs from your laptop (already doing)•	Stop online gaming or binge TV watching (don't do either)•	Provide a fixed timing for people to call you (not very practical in India)•	Look for leisure activities in the real world (doing sometimes)•	Live off grid if you are financially independent (not yet financially independent)•	30-day fast “declutter” from optional technologies (already use bare minimum)•	Don't use your device as a computer (have to do for a few things)•	Join social groups/clubs offline (difficult to manage time-wise)•	Plan downtime (this one I find easy to do)•	Make room for more high-quality time while limiting low-quality activities (trying)•	Unsubscribe from anything you don’t need (in progress)•	Solitude is one way to feeling more meaningful (doing sometimes)•	Read more books (trying to do all the time)

Rather than being just a way to connect with our friends, facebook has mastered the art of the slot machine, giving us random and variable rewards. That has been found to be the most addictive of all; just look at slot machines, the Japanese Pachinko or channel surfing. I totally agree with this. 2. The only way out is Digital Minimalism. There are many ways to do it: 2.1. Deleting the mobile facebook app, using only the desktop version. 2:2. Install apps that limit mobile apps usage. 2.3. Downgrade to a dumb phone2.4. Remove all notification, even to the permanent ‘Do not Disturb’ mode. 2.5. Provide a fixed timing for people to look for you or call you, but no random texting and expecting instant answers. 2.6. Stop online gaming or binge TV watching. Maybe limit this only with friends. 3. Find something else to do:3.1. Social gym going3.2. Book clubs3.3.

Newport gives ample historical and modern evidence for the benefits seen in adopting the digital minimalism philosophy, which is using technology to focus on a small number of things that you value and (happily) missing out on everything else. He goes through the impacts of new optional technology, how companies work to make technologies (especially social media) addictive, the process of how to adopt minimalism, gives practices to follow, and ideas for new activities to fill all your new free time. The man gives you material for the long haul and we have no choice but to stan.I would definitely buy this book irl (my mom actually got a copy for herself #myimpact) to highlight and annotate the heck out of because this bad boy is full of good info. if you're like me and have been feeling like social media, your phone, or other optional technologies have become an unnecessary weight, i HIGHLY recommend this book. however, if you go in with the mindset of 'meh. old people just don't get the wonderful joys of the technology captured lifestyle' this book may not be for you.or maybe it's especially for youfood for thought"

I value real life activities and relationships a lot, and on that front I agree with the author that we should make sure to keep our time protected and not just be on screen all the time. It is especially a challenge for people who were born into this situation and maybe never learned enough about human connection and how to get off the screen. On the other hand, I didn't like the tone or the preaching. I didn't like the warnings and the negativity. Technology is also awesome, and I would hope that there are other ways to keep it in check.The book also contradicts itself many times with its ambivalent attitude towards technology. I think the author meant to show balance, but ended up being quite confused. The advice in the book are also not going to be practical for many people, so I felt a miss there too.Overall, I will give it 3 stars, even though it is a bit below.

This book is what allowed me to push myself over the edge to delete social media from my phone. In this book, Newport does not only do a great job in explaining why it is so important to be a digital minimalist, but he also gives concrete steps on how to approach and maintain this lifestyle. I would strongly recommend this book to people who want to get rid of social media, but never could commit to it. I would also recommend it to people who do not believe society's addiction to social media is a problem. Newport rightfully prompts readers to think critically about all the relationships you have through social media. If the relationship only exists or primarily exists in this medium, is it really worth keeping?"

My out-of-office message did not instruct people whom to contact in the case of an interpreting/translating/voiceover emergency nor did it justify my absence with an explanation of where I was or why I was there, just: “I’m offline. I’ll be back on such-and-such day. – M.” I know I lost some work; I don’t know if I lost any clients. But I am sure I surrendered to my lack of control.Newport does a spectacular job engagingly explaining the science behind our digital behavior and increasingly digital addictions, first teasing out what we social beings ultimately must have to ensure ongoing healthy and necessary interactions, then guiding his readers through his recipe for resetting and reconfiguring our relationship with online media. He is no Luddite; he does use a computer and a cell phone and he streams movies and music. By all means, he offers, we should certainly use the online social tools at our disposal, but only once we’ve figured out where within the digital fog we find ourselves, having found a method in the madness we must reflect upon.The most salient point Newport makes is how critical it is that we tune into INTENTIONALITY: being intentional in what we do, how we do it, why we do it and when we do it in the digital universe. After bemoaning how we’ve collectively come to a point of vast solitude deprivation (“a state in which you spend close to zero time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from other minds”), he launches into a straightforward primer for training our monkey minds by doing a deep-clean of the digital clutter we accumulate every day.He preaches a hard-core digital detox for a month – accessing/keeping only those apps/sites absolutely necessary for survival, a threshold that obviously shifts depending on one’s professional and personal circumstances; and setting up strict rules for when and how the apps/sites/tools allowed during the detox are to be used – that I have (sigh!) yet to implement. This is to be followed by a guided, deliberate reintroduction of the bare bones digital necessities only once two questions have been answered in the affirmative: “Does this technology directly support something that I deeply value?” and “Is this technology the best way to support this value?”. Honestly I have not detoxed not because I am addicted to social media and digital tools (see next paragraph), but because I have not set aside time to think deeply about the rules for my exceptions (plus, gasp, is Goodreads in or out?).Here is what happened upon my emergence from the quiet corner of the unusually lush and flowering Brazilian cerrado: I checked e-mail and WhatsApp (Brazil’s de facto means of client communication) immediately upon my return, allotting myself exactly one hour to answer only the e-mails I deemed professionally critical. I sheepishly admit I spent a fair amount of time over the following days catching up on job-related e-mails as I wasn’t quite in a financial position to throw in the professional towel. But it did actually take me six days to open social media. In the ten weeks since, I have logged a total of under eight hours on Facebook and Instagram combined and I haven’t posted a single photo from the trip. It has been truly liberating.Newport would likely admonish me for cutting corners. “If you begin decluttering the low-value digital distractions from your life before you’ve convincingly filled in the void they were helping you ignore,” he writes, “the experience will be unnecessarily unpleasant at best and a massive failure at worse.” Translation: I am possibly setting myself up for a failed experiment because, for me, Instagram and Facebook are, by and large, low-value digital distractions, ones that I find quite easy to cull from my life. In other words, if you don’t do a full-fledged detox, you’re depriving yourself of truly understanding why you let your attention get so cluttered (in his words, “clutter is costly”) in the first place and are setting yourself up for mucking up your newfound intentionality pretty quickly.Maybe this will be my February resolution. Maybe not. Either way, even without embracing Newport’s very compelling argument to do a month-long, hard-core cleanse, I am still basking in the respite that has resulted from reading this book in a place that pulsed with a million breathtaking reasons to be entirely offline and entirely intentional."

54,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25300361-lacey,1,"The most pretentious and rambling book I've ever read.For a book about minimalism, Cal Newport sure does waste a lot of time and words to say very little. Ironically, this whole book could have been a Twitter thread. He does offer a few tidbits of practical advice, but it's all bogged down by pretentious musings and circular prose. Basically, Newport suggests the following: Delete your social apps from your phone. Become more intentional with your social media use; that includes being aware of why you remain on social and how to achieve those goals without mindlessly tapping and swiping. Get ""non-digital"" hobbies. Read real books. Talk walks. Nothing groundbreaking, honestly, but stuff that's good for us all to hear. What really pushed this book from a two-star read to a one-star read is just how smug the author comes off. To begin with, he's never even used social media. We're told this repeatedly. Not really sure how he can relate to the rest of us, as he doesn't seem to fully understand the role that social media plays in a lot of people's lives. I have friends I've met on Twitter -- that I only know from Twitter. No, we're not all BFFs, but I value those connections, especially since we share many interests that my IRL friends and I don't.Privilege is baked into the book. Most of his advice just boils down to being rich or spending money on something. For example, we're told to cultivate more ""non-digital"" habits to break away from our computers. In the chapter, we meet some dude who has somehow achieved financial independence in his 30s (curious as to how he did that? Me too. We never hear the secret behind this major accomplishment. I'm going to guess it's ""having rich parents""). After getting a expensive welding estimate from a metal smith, dude decides to just buy all the equipment himself and teach himself how to weld. He was able to provide his own iron works, as well as sell some to friends and family. It's so out of touch. How do I apply this example to my life? I have a full-time job; I don't have the luxury to while away my days learning how to do underwater basket-weaving. Newport doubles-down on the home improvement angle, telling readers they should start with small projects to build up their handiness and work their way up to bigger projects. But what if you rent and aren't allowed to fiddle with your home's wall color/electricity/plumbing? What if you have kids and don't or can't sacrifice valuable time to build a deck? What if you just don't want to? How does becoming a handyman help someone break away from their digital addiction, especially since Newport suggests readers visit YouTube for tutorial videos? The whole digression was pointless.There's so much more I could touch on. Like his weird shilling for the Mouse Book Club, a subscription book service that charges readers $50 for abridged versions of public domain texts. The idea being you keep their tiny books in your purse/pocket so that whenever you go for your phone, the book is there as a solid reminder of your unplugging goals. Why a $1 copy of the same book from a second-hand shop can't do the same, I don't know. Or his casual assumption that his readers are working at jobs that will allow them to just get up and take a walk in the middle of the day or leave early on a whim. Or his one piece of advice that's literally just ""set a time limit for using social media."" It's like going to your doctor and having him tell you to just be healthy. This book isn't worth it and I can't recommend. It was the cause of my recent two-month reading slump. Just go read Ten Arguments For Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now. At half the length, it's more insightful and more practical. The true minimalist. "
55,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45946197-renee,5,"This was a good quick read. Nothing that was a big revelation, we all know how easily technologies gets a hold and a grip on us. Cal Newport makes many good points but one quote that got me was about how we sometime feel more "" important "" then we ought to be. That we are so indispensable that we need to be reach at all time or that the world we stop turning we we don't have a constant access to others, particularly our own families . So here is the quote. "" young people, for example, worry that even temporary disconnection might lead them to miss out on something better they could be doing. Parents worry that their kids won't be able to reach them in an emergency. Travelers need recommendations for places to eat. Workers fear the idea of being both needed and unreachable. And everyone secretly fears being bored. "" p.113Social media, entertainment, technologies aren't the evil of our days but, the way we use it can become an idol. There are many great way to use this inovation, and I may modorarly disagree with a few points Newport made. Other great points he makes that I am completely onboard with:1. Being afraid to be alone and in solitude. 2. Seeking approval from others aka your tribe3. Time waster4. Not knowing how to use your time more productively or having good hobbies.5. Lack or real interactions in favor on mindless or superficial small talk. I am not saying that this digital minaminilism is something absolutely new, being idle with our time and seeking entertainment because of boredom is nothing new under the sun. And don't get me wrong, relaxing and having some form of entertainment isn't bad, but how would it be better if your choose to , for example say, that you would only watch Netflix with someone else instead of just binging on whole tv series at the time. Or spend time at a coffee shop or restaurant with your phone in the car or home. Newport quotes many quotes from Henry David Thoreau and Wendell Berry, two of my favorite authors ( I have a few favorite and yes you can have more then one favorite 😉)I will leave you with some of those quotes"" The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. They honestly think there is no choice left. But alert and healthy natures remember that the sun rose clear. It is never to late to give up our prejudices "" Walden H.D Thoreau"" we enter solitude, in which also we loose loneliness "" Wendell Berry Over all I recommend the book, it might be preacher to the choir for some but still I think it is a insightful read."
56,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11116469-sebastian-gebski,4,"Hmm, 3.5 stars would be fair, I think.The topic itself is more than important, so it's very good that we're getting books on it, but ... some opinions & statements are either oversimplified or plainly ignorant.Examples? Here you go: I like the general idea of using craftsmanship as a way to gain satisfaction, but I totally disagree with the odd opinion that digital craftsmanship can't produce equal satisfaction, so the outcome has to be physical. It's rubbish. Composing, writing, programming, drawing - all kinds of craftsmanship can be equally important. The fact that you're doing something using computer (e.g. programming) doesn't mean it's the same as spending half of the day on Facebook. Programming can be equally satisfactory AND cause the state of flow. Digital minimalism doesn't have ANYTHING in common with the fact that you have a paid job of producing digital items.It's not the only example, ofc, there are more: the whole ""Don't click 'like'"" chapter is controversial & somehow in conflict with the rest of the book. I think that the clue of achieving DM is in finding the sane border between the kind of relation/interaction you want fully rich & the ones that are perfectly acceptable to remain ""shallow"". ""Like"" (and equivalent tools) is actually very useful when used with reason. I understand the good intentions - I hate ""wish-streams"" on social media when someone has a birthday (like all these people think it's enough to celebrate in such way), I despise ""suggested"" responses on Messenger or LinkedIn (that completely flatten all the interactions), but still - minimal friction interactions have their applicability as well. Btw. they were in use yeeeeeears before so-called social media picked them up - e.g. on the discussion boards.OK, to conclude - still, it's a very good book. A book I'd like to recommend to several people I know who truly & visibly suffer from ""digital addiction"". But it could have been much better, if it got some broader perspective/consultation."
57,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1167415-regina-lemoine,4,"I think this book has some great info on decluttering our interactions with screens. I have an inexpensive basic smart phone that's generally used to play audiobooks and, rarely, to make a call or send a text. Unless I'm meeting someone someone somewhere and they might need to reach me, my phone stays on airplane mode 99% of the time. Now, my iPad is a different story. I can easily hop onto the 'net to Google something and emerge from youtube 3 hours later. So, a lot of Newport's suggestions for dealing with a smartphone habit made me look more closely at how much time I waste with the iPad. It's a great device and I wouldn't want to do without it, but it can be a real time drain.I only have two little quibbles with the book. First, while Newport does have recommendations for leisure time, most of those suggestions are for doing ""productive"" things for relaxation. It's not quite as prevalent as what I've seen of some other books of this kind, but one does come away with the notion that leisure shouldn't be just vegging out every now and then. I think it's fine to turn off the need to be ""productive"" at all times.The second problem is also in relation to leisure and hobbies. Newport writes that doing something with one's hands and making things is very satisfying. I agree, however almost all of Newport's suggested activities are traditionally male-leaning. For example, he writes about learning auto-repair, welding, furniture building, etc. That's fine and women can certainly do those things, BUT, there's barely a mention of traditionally ""female"" pursuits such as needlework, knitting, etc. I won't go so far as to say that Newport doesn't value ""women's"" crafts and skills, but that was how I felt at times during the book. There's also no mention of things like cooking or baking (both very valuable skills) or even much, if any, mention of gardening. All-in-all, I enjoyed the book and came away with some good strategies that I can apply in my own life."

Also, having read, enjoyed and put into practice advice from Cal Newport's previous book So Good They Can't Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love  I figured this book would definitely help. In  Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Nosy World  Cal intended to  make the case for digital minimalism, including a more detailed exploration of what it asks and why it works, and then to teach you how to adopt this philosophy if you decide it’s right for you. I feel, for the most part Cal did put forward a good case for Digital Minimalism, but that was an easy case to put forward because we can all/mostly agree that some of us would benefit significantly from practicing Digital Minimalism. If I am being honest, what Cal intended for the book he accomplished, I just felt it lacked something. For me, most of the ideas put forward wasn't groundbreaking. In fact, the main take away from the book was, ""put down your phone/get a dumb phone and see how your life changes"" I also felt that Cal didn't get to the underline cause of WHY we need to practise Digital Minimalism. WHY are we consuming so much and the whole psyche behind that. I do think someone who is just exploring Digital Minimalism may learn more from the book.

Also, it didn’t feel preachy or “self help,” a quality I cannot abide. Unexpectedly, it was FILLED with practical real world suggestions for addressing the problems presented, something that is left out of this kind of book too often. In fact, there are a few latent problem spots in my digital life that aren’t deliberate and I didn’t quite know what to do about. Much to my joy, there were some practice tips in this book that address those issues precisely and provide innovative solutions I hadn’t thought about... and they are simple enough that I plan to put them into practice immediately!

Sparing you the details, but ""screentime"" on iphone tells me that my total FB+Twitter+browsing usage on avg is less than 30 mins per day. And apart from goodreads and imdb on which serve an important function for me, I am not on any other SM (including Whatsapp or Insta).Wished to take a step further and also compare notes. A lot of it - opting for quality communications and avoiding distractions was intutively clear since the unsavoury aspects of Facebook and Twitter have been in the news, especially since Trump's election. But interestingly it also suggested something I suspected - many Indians lack a quality hobby and hence are SM and WA addicts. If you do not have an activity you love - be it jogging, reading, playing music, sports or even watching cinema etc, you are better off with the blue pill of SM (ref Matrix) :)On the negative side, the self-esteem angle needed to be discussed in depth. While the author talks of pseudo-pleasure derived from likes and Re-tweets, the self-esteem of some ppl atleast has come to depend on their likeability online.Overall, this is a short read at 200 pages and would say it is easily worth your time."

These solutions are real life examples from people who have gotten tired of their smartphone addiction, and have taken steps to be in control of their life. Some have simply implemented some clever, little hacks (albeit very intentional ones) to help them be productive, while others have made radical changes in the ways they interact with technology.Newport is not a Luddite (technology avoider) by any means, but instead he challenges us to make careful, intentional choices about how we use technology.

I logged out of Facebook since late March because of misleading news related to Covid-19. I told my self that it's temporary and that I'm going to go back using it ASAP. But those months of freedom tasted different. Words can't describe how I felt not using the only social media I use. Just know that I'm not addicted as many people I know, but dumping it made me realise how it used to drain my energy, and that I'm well off without it. Back to this amazing book. We're almost back to college, and I really need FB in my studies. I was anxious because I didn't want to fall in that hole again, until this book was recommended to me. What I liked about this book is that it's full of real stories from different kinds of people. Different and manageable practices are mentioned too, some of them I'm currently practicing, others I'm willing to try. What I'm writing right now is like a letter to the future me. I want her to remember how I felt not using social media, a d how this book has changed her mind. If you didn't read this book, JUST READ IT!!  You'll thank me later. Ps.

73,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13274832-luiz,5,"This book is a relief in a age where our attention is attracted by so many magnetic tools. It makes us think a lot about our priorities and abusive technology usage. Cal Newport is not anti-technology, but instead, he wants us to reflect how we engage with these tools in order to improve our quality of life.The message is: make deliberate choices and focus on things you care about (I mean, things you REALLY care about).As the author says: “Digital minimalism is much more than a set of rules, it’s about cultivating a life worth living in our current age of alluring devices”.Some notes from the book:* Don't click “likes”: connection is a low-bandwidth interaction (and it defines most of our online social lives). Conversation is much richer and a high-bandwidth communication. We should avoid the former. Clicking in the “Like” button, we teach our mind that connection replaces conversation. Social media can be a useful tool if we decide to use it as one of our conversation-centric communication tools rather than creating low-quality relationships. “Likes"" don’t build relationships.* Avoid the slot machine: social media is built to be a true slot machine. We keep pulling the lever - almost literally when refreshing the timeline - hoping for a reward. Something new to appear and satisfy our apetite. Or a notification saying that a bunch of people approves our post and generating a self-esteem boost.* ""Treat minutes of your life as a concrete substance. check how much of your life you trade for the activities you allow to claim your time. When we confront our habits from this perspective, we conclude that, more often than not, the cumulative cost of non-crucial things we clutter our life with are higher than the small benefits each clutter promises""* Spend time alone: we are always online and connected. We lost the capacity to see the benefits of solitude. Regular doses of self-reflection is healthy.* Take long walks: I'm incorporating more walks to my routine. When it’s possible, I choose walking. When it’s not possible, I'm commuting with the phone in the bottom of my backpack. This allows me to read/listen a book or just stay disconnected preventing the urge to check something in the smartphone without intention.* Reclaim leisure: prioritize demanding leisure activity over passive consumption.* Schedule low quality leisure: you don’t need to eliminate low quality leisure. Just schedule and create a threshold for usage. Remember: Facebook group (including Instagram and WhatsApp), for instance, is one of the most valuable companies in the world and there is a reason for this. They are great to capture the most valuable resource in the world: time.* Follow a leisure plan: if you don’t create a leisure plan, you will do the easiest thing available to you (e.g. scrolling the timeline until the end of the world).* Delete social media from your phone: unless you have a really good reason, you probably don’t need social media apps in your phone. If you need to use in your phone, use in the mobile browser and log out as soon as you finish what you intend to do. It will be an ugly and uncomfortable experience. Create friction for your bad habits (if you are interested about this subject, read ""Atomic Habits"")* Turn your device into single-purpose computers: our computers are powerful and we are capable to run multiple programs at the same time. Context-switching in a computer was never so easy. (Freedom.to / StayFocusd apps may help you)* Embrace slow media (http://en.slow-media.net/manifesto): monotasking, don’t be a passive consumer, choose actively what and how you want to consume, focus on quality rather than quantity.Join the attention resistance, be deliberate, live with intention and enjoy your short period of life without a phone in your face."

With minimalism having its hay-day a few years back the general term is clouded in connotations of rich hipsters. Also, given the ""recommended reads"" based on this book I was worried it would be stock-standard white-man self help. I wasn't sure what to expect.What I got, frankly, was great life advice. As someone who works computationally, like Cal, I think I needed the permission to seek more intentional use of technology. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone, but especially those of us who were introduced to unrestricted internet access during our youth (young millenials and zoomers I'm looking at you)."

It's not mere coincidence that you pick up your phone 85 times a day. It's not mere coincidence that, on average, teenagers nowadays spend nine hours of their day staring at screens. Some really smart nerds, after playing a game of ping pong in their offices in Silicon Valley, were able to gamify basic human sociality, and now their product is YOU. They have to keep you clicking, liking, favoriting, and hitting ""Next Episode.""And it's no coincidence that we've seen a sharp decline in general mental health. Almost everyone I talk to, when I ask them whether or not they think social media is a good thing for society, admits that it's not: it decreases their personal productivity, it makes them feel worse about themselves, and it gives them unhealthy ideas of what their peers are REALLY doing (which is never as interesting as it looks when you see the carefully curated content on their Snapchat stories or Instagram posts, which is specifically designed for maximum envy).Also, I like the distinction between high-bandwidth and low-bandwidth conversation. When you talk to someone in person, your brain is firing on all cylinders. It's highly engaged with what the other person is saying because during tribal times ignoring your fellow tribesmen could mean exclusion, and death. Whether you consciously think about it or not, you're paying attention to a person's vocal tonality, facial expressions, body language, and, of course, the words themselves. When you receive a text message, though, you're only getting one tier of that feedback: the words themselves (and maybe an emoji, a weak substitute). In the same way that your body is adapted for single-ingredient, high-fiber, nutrient dense fruits, vegetables, and lean meats, your brain is adapted for high-feedback conversation. Here's how I like to think about it, in academic analogy terms: bologna is to your body as text messaging is to your brain. You can eat bologna every once in a while, just like how you can text people every once in a while, but you don't want to make it a staple of your diet or else you're going to feel like shit all the time. Your brain needs person-to-person communication. Just because we live in a bologna-centric culture doesn't mean that you need to eat bologna all the time. It's okay to tell people that you don't like bologna. Eat a banana. Make a salad. Get a coffee with your best friend. Play Scrabble with your grandma. It's good for you.But what I like most about this book are the strategies within. It made me seriously reconsider my relationship with optional technologies, forcing me to think about who was REALLY in control. As a result, I've started the digital decluttering process and I've already read three books this month. I'm more productive AND more relaxed.If you can't quit for thirty days, can you quit at all?"

I finished this last night in one sitting and thought that it was great, however full of a lot of things I was already doing or had read elsewhere. Hence the four star review and not five. Then, I couldn’t sleep and created a list of all the things that I could actually change immediately to become more of a digital minimalist. After making my list I have around 30 action items either taken directly from this book or spurred by actions in this book based on my own digital experiences. That’s the thing I realized though is that there is no way someone could write a be all, end all guide on this subject because although we are all living in a digital world and some of our habits are the same, there are millions of apps out there and millions of websites, newsletters, podcasts and humans to connect with online. With each of us interacting with these in infinite ways, it would be impossible. Are there things in here I likely won’t put into practice? Absolutely. But given the steps I’ve taken in just 24 hours and the productivity and lightness I feel already, I highly recommend this book to literally everyone. As Mr. Newport says in the conclusion “it’s not really about technology, but is instead more about the quality of your life.” And who can argue with that!?"

It's pathetic.Social media is so powerful and can be used for so much good. Be warned of the social media companies, for they are after your attention and without careful notice, they will obtain it a detrimental cost to you. While reading this book I went to dinner and left my phone at home.And guess what??I ate and enjoyed my meal, talking to others, laughing with others... But at a certain point I was left to watch everyone... on their phones. I'm convinced our cellphones are more addictive than sugar. It's scary. Be selective with your time. Schedule social media time and adhere to that schedule. Enjoy and engage in face to face conversations. Soak in what you understand from tone and pitch of voice, from nonverbal communication.Try not to let something important be truncated to a text message.Change your digital ways.After reading this, I will think about what I'm doing every time I grab for my phone.I enjoy change.And change I will.Favourite quote: ""Digital minimalism definitively does not reject the innovations of the internet age, but instead rejects the way so many people currently engage with these tools."""

Digital Minimalism is a phenomenal follow up to Deep Work (and is largely built upon the same foundations). In it, Newport uncovers our underlying assumptions about technology and compares them to their unintended consequences: social media, isolation; notifications, gambling; consumption, anxiety.Technology is supposed to support our values; they should not be the source of value. If you value relationships, use technology to set meetings with friends -- don't text at the dinner table. If you value leisure, use technology to learn how to perfect a skill -- don't mindlessly scroll through your feed during your free time.Essentially: It's not about technology, it's about cultivating a life worth living in the midst of digital distraction.Other points:- Scrolling through social media may lead to a perceived lack of time.- Be comfortable missing out on the shallow content the Facebook news feed presents.- Liking and commenting is not necessarily a form of good communication.I'll be undertaking my 1 month digital declutter now.

There has been a rise in teenage anxiety, depression, and suicides because the generation that grew up on smartphones are being bombarded with carefully crafted posts, which makes their lives seem lacking.The author jumps around a little. First recommending solitude, where you spend time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from others (like using a journal to capture and organize your thoughts). Then the author recommends cultivating relationships. As social beings, we thrive on having richer, deeper relationships with other people. There are various high quality activities that can replace trivial digital consumption; select the ones that add value to your life. If you had to pay for the use of Facebook or Instagram, would you still be checking it 10-20 times a day? Limit your online time to a small number of carefully selected activities that strongly support the things you value."

It reminded me of the passage in Luke about demons returning to the place they were chased out of:“When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’ When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order. Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first.” (Luke 11:24-25)You may clean house - or digitally minimize - but if you do not have good and joyful things to fill that space, there is little chance of making lasting change. I am challenged and inspired about the call to solitude and high-quality leisure and look forward to seeing how this will manifest itself in the upcoming months!"

Let’s go back to a life without the obsessive need to take out our phones when bored, or alone, or just because we absolutely need to check our feeds.

This book begins by echoing several of the ideas central to Deep Work, but then takes a close look at social media and its effects on human psychology. As one would expect, Newport argues for putting one's core values & most important projects ahead of everything else and stripping away superfluous digital distraction that often ends up being a time sink without adding value. He also makes a compelling argument for bringing back quality conversation over shallow moments of connection. Like in Deep Work, he advocates for harnessing the best that tech has to offer without getting sucked into the attention economy. His prose style is lean and powerful and the research is meticulous and carefully documented."

That said, the book could have been 1/3 the size. Way too much repetition. Too much stuff on time management. The book could have been about time management instead of Digital Minimalism.

The addictiveness of sites, apps, and phones is not an accident, but rather a result carefully engineered to be just so.In addition, “darker emotions attract more eyeballs than positive and constructive thoughts”, so we are pushed towards outrage, anxiety, and despair.Various attempts have been made to lessen the negative side effects and addictive properties of modern attention-economy technologies, but they’ve largely been unsustainable. What to do? Newport Recommends **Digital Minimalism**.# Manifesto_Digital Minimalism_ - _A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support the things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else._Digital Minimalism includes avoiding “low-value activities that can clutter up [our] time and attention and end up hurting more than they help.” It also means asking ourselves “is this the best way to use technology to support this value?” The law of diminishing returns also applies, here.## The Principles1. Clutter is costly2. Optimization is important3. Intentionality is satisfyingSummary quote from this section:> The sugar high of convenience is fleeting and the sting of missing out dulls rapidly, but the meaningful glow that comes from taking charge of what claims your time and attention is something that persists.# Digital Declutter ProgramNewport recommends an intentional process to reassess your needs and values.> Put aside a thirty-day period during which you will _take a break from optional technologies_ in your life. During this thirty-day break, explore and rediscover activities and behaviors that you find satisfying and meaningful. At the end of the break, _reintroduce optional technologies_ into your life, starting from a blank slate. For each technology you reintroduce, determine _what value it serves_ in your life and how specifically you will use it so as to maximize this value. ## Taking the Break:Evaluating “optional” can be grey, but Newport gives this guideline:> [C]onsider the technology optional unless its temporary removal would harm or significantly disrupt the daily operation of your professional or personal life.Newport also warns us to not confuse “convenient” with “critical”, when analyzing our needs during this period.Two methods to “take a break” are **bans** and **operating procedures**. A ban is simply not using that site, tech, app, etc. during the period. Operating procedures entail using it under certain rules. For example, many test participants in the program moved many tasks to their laptop/desktop that they had often completed on their phones, or checked certain apps/sites only once a week, or during a certain window, or in a certain place.In summary:> In the end, you’re left with a list of banned technologies along with relevant operating procedures. _Write this down and put it somewhere where you’ll see it every day._## Reintroducing TechnologiesTo be reintroduced, a technology must:1. Serve something you _deeply_ value2. Be the _best_ way to use technology to serve this value3. Have a role in your life that is constrained with a standard operating procedure that specifies how you use itFor the last item, this means asking “How am I going to use this technology…to maximize its value and minimize its harms?”# PracticesOne of the side effects of the engineered attention economy is that we’ve become accustomed to distract ourselves at the slightest moment of boredom or uncomfortable introspection. In addition, cutting out mindless swiping and browsing will introduce a lot of free time. If we don’t have a plan to proactively use our freed time, our Digital Minimalism practice is likely to fail.Thus, Newport introduces some possible practices to help us positively spend some time with our own thoughts, reclaim our free time as quality leisure, and further join the “Attention Resistance.”During your tech break and again in your reintroduction, see which of these would be good to include in your habits.## Practice Area: Spend Time AloneOne of the challenges of the attention economy is that we are frequently stuck in:> _Solitude Deprivation_: A state in which you spend close to zero time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from other mindsTime with our own thoughts is important, in short, for mindfulness. It’s important for the ability to consider problems, to examine & regulate emotions, reflect on values, and more.Newport refers to the mounting evidence regarding how the attention-economy is drastically driving up anxiety levels. As I mentioned at the beginning, we know our negative emotions are targeted for reaction, but on top of that we are also repeatedly presented with “curated” versions of others’ selves, and finally, the systems are designed for us to continually seek the repeated micro-approvals of others. The attention economy is engineered in a way that drives anxiety.Thus, the following practices help us have time without input from “other minds”, to help restore some control, attention, and mindfulness to our lives.Through these practices, Newport recommends:> _Conversation Centric Communication_: Conversation is the only form of interaction that in some sense counts toward maintaining a relationship....Anything textual or non-interactive—basically, all social media, email, text, and instant messaging—doesn’t count as conversation and should instead be categorized as mere connection. In this philosophy, connection is downgraded to a logistical role. This form of interaction now has two goals: to help set up and arrange conversation, or to efficiently transfer practical information.... Connection is no longer an alternative to conversation; it’s instead its supporter.On to the practices:### Practice: Leave Your Phone at HomeIt may feel impossible, but this is a very recent feeling. If you’re concerned about emergencies, consider leaving it off, or in the glovebox of your car, for example. (Again, this is implementing operating procedures.)### Practice: Take Long WalksBy yourself. Without your phone.### Practice: Write Letters to YourselfAKA write in notebooks. Take notes, journal, brainstorm, plan. ### Practice: Don’t Click “Like”“No reacts plz”, we might say. This goes back to the micro-approvals and anxiety I mentioned above, as they drive the slot-machine behavior of social media sites. If you must react, share a comment. Or your own writing. Or even better, have a conversation with the person. “Adopt the baseline rule that you’ll no longer use social media as a tool for low-quality relationship nudges.”### Practice: Consolidate TextingKeep your phone in Do Not Disturb and only check according to an operating procedure. Setup your DND to allow calls through from critical contacts. ### Practice: Hold Conversation Office HoursPick a time when you are open for free conversation. Maybe it’s your commute. Maybe it’s literally open office hours. Maybe it’s a recurring walk. Whatever it is, offer this time as an opportunity for conversations. ## Practice Area: Reclaim LeisureAll this freed time can lead to existential anxiety or produce negative behaviors (mindless consumption, alcohol/drug abuse, etc.) to fill the void. Newport claims giving more thought, attention, and effort to our leisure will make it more fulfilling and restorative, and help us keep on the Digital Minimalism path.Here are the three principles, then, of leisure:1. Prioritize demanding activity over passive consumption2. Use skills to produce valuable things in the physical world3. Seek activities that require real-world, structured social interactions“The value of the pursuit is often proportional to the energy invested.”### Practice: Fix Or Build Something Every WeekPer principle #2, this should be analog. Newport recommends trying to learn and apply a skill each week over Digital Declutter period.### Practice: Schedule Your Low-Quality LeisurePer your operating procedures, you should decide when, how much, how, etc. For example, maybe you only stream TV with family and friends, and only for X hours on the weekends. Maybe you only check in on Facebook events, groups, and family pictures for an hour on the weekends. In Newport’s findings, “the vast majority of regular social media users can receive the vast majority of the value these services provide their life in as little as twenty to forty minutes of use per week”, as opposed to the 3+ hours that the average person spends daily on their smartphones.### Practice: Join SomethingJoin a club, meetup, organization, etc. Or start your own!### Practice: Follow Leisure PlansThis may sound backwards, but actually planning your leisure may give you more opportunities to do it, by prioritizing it in your schedule.Newport recommends a seasonal plan and weekly planning. > A good seasonal plan contains two different types of items: objectives and habits that you intend to honor in the upcoming season. The objectives describe specific goals you hope to accomplish, with accompanying strategies for how you will accomplish them. The habits describe behavior rules you hope to stick with throughout the season.> For each of the objectives in the seasonal plan, figure out what actions you can do during the week to make progress on these objectives, and then, crucially, schedule exactly when you’ll do these things.## Practice Area: Join the Attention ResistanceAt this point in history, “[e]xtracting eyeball minutes, the key resource for companies like Google and Facebook, has become significantly more lucrative than extracting oil.”### Practice: Delete Social media from Your PhoneOnce you have your operating procedures around use, you probably don’t need it there, anyway.### Practice: Turn Your Devices Into Single-Purpose ComputersThis is about focus and not multi-tasking. Of course computers are general purpose machines, but “the power of a general-purpose computer is in the total number of things it enables the user to do, not the total number of things it enables the user to do simultaneously.”### Practice: Use Social Media Like a ProfessionalPeople who work with Social Media for their job typically have operating procedures to be effective.> Have a careful plan for how you use the different platforms, with the goal of “maximizing good information and cutting out the waste.”For example, fix the signal-to-noise ratio by being careful about what and who you follow.### Practice: Embrace Slow MediaSlow Media or Slow News is like the Slow Food or [Slow Church](https://amzn.to/2Xg6DkK) movement. Embrace the patient, high-quality, well-considered sources and conversations.Avoid junk and reactivity. Avoid “Breaking News”, which is almost always low-quality, error-prone, and often emotionally manipulative. Seek opposing viewpoints. Follow feeds from good writers. Save/bunch stories to read once a week. ### Practice: Dumb Down Your SmartphoneConsider a dumbphone, no phone, or something like the [Light Phone](https://www.thelightphone.com/) or the [Punkt Phone](https://www.punkt.ch/en/products/mp02...).# ConclusionI liked this book and look forward to implementing my break and examination during Lent.

108,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/234905-molly-ferguson,3,"3.4 stars. I have very mixed feelings about this book and Newport's suggestions for living a digital minimalist life. First of all, the author is a little off-putting - he's like that dude at work who swears by the Keto diet and every time someone mentions food he launches into how they should go on the Keto diet. He himself doesn't use any social media, and uses his phone sparingly, which makes me think that since they have kids his wife Julie is the one who manages play dates, the school sending messages midway through the day about a school lockdown, the different apps extracurricular activities use to contact you (Remind, Band, etc.), sending photos to relatives, etc. He used a LOT of examples from early American writers, especially Thoreau, and I would have liked to see more examples of women or minorities (there was one from MLK and another from a person named Jennifer, but overall it was very white-male-dominated). Only once at the end did he briefly check his privilege, but I can imagine that being able to simply opt out of using a smartphone or checking texts, etc. is something that you have to have a certain type of job and lifestyle to be able to do. Now that I've tackled my misgivings, there were some really smart and thought-provoking takeaways here. The basic premise is that we are letting technology seep into every crevice of our lives, and we need to strategically deploy the aspects of technology that serve us and dip out before we become the product. I really enjoyed the cognitive science parts, and I liked all of the different practical suggestions for ways to limit your time and focus being fractured by the digital world. There are definitely a few I will be adopting - I removed the Facebook app from my phone and I'll be using bookmarks to strategically gather content from websites I enjoy rather than surfing the whole site, as well as setting rules for under what circumstances I will use the most time-sucking media and technology tools. I already have quality leisure activities, so I definitely rolled my eyes about the chapter suggesting that I get out there and learn to make things (carpentry! welding! clearing brush!) as an adequate substitute for Netflix. This book provided excellent food for thought and some practical tips, but I think you could get the gist from a summary of it rather than enduring the author's smugness."

This lack of control makes us uncomfortable and robs us of the intentionality that leads to satisfaction. However willpower, simple hacks, and vague resolutions don’t seem to help long term. Creating behavioral addictions is the goal of these companies that profit from the time we spend with them. Newport extends a bold invitation to adopt digital minimalism to gain back control of our time.Digital Minimalism Definition: A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else.I also loved the points about the crucial need for solitude and quiet. Practices I especially agree with and want to focus on: solitary walks, writing in a journal, deleting social media from my phone, turning off app notifications, and intentionally setting aside more time for face to face connection with others. The only reason I didn’t rate it higher was because although I appreciated the philosophies and ground work Newport laid out, a lot of the specific plans and tips he spent time explaining didn’t suit me. While I have areas I want to improve on... I’m not overusing social media enough to warrant some of the extreme interventions. I would have personally preferred for him to focus more on the why’s than the super specific how’s that have worked for the heavier users. Lastly, I developed a new disdain for the word conglomerate after about the 20th time he used it. 😜"

That’s ok because the author doesn’t use any type of social media, so he’ll never see this. I previously listened to Cal Newport’s previous book “Deep Work” and I really enjoyed this, so I thought I would pick this up. At first I was skeptical when the author announced at the beginning that he had \never\ used Facebook in his life, and didn’t understand why anyone would. His perspective is that this achievement puts him at a distinct advantage to advocate why quitting social media is necessary. I thought maybe he was missing the “why” for millions of people who use social media, and surely not everyone can be lumped in the same category. As I got into the middle of the book, the author advocates something much more reasonable: a middle path, intentionality, or to be supper trendy, mindfulness. This book feels like it was called Digital \Minimalism\ to harken to the trend of minimalism in general. But this should be called digital intentionality. In essence, large corporations are sucking our time, energy, trust, and even values under the guise of connectedness while just using us to sell us things. This isn’t new, but the interactive elements of social media make it even stickier than one way communication like TV or radio. The author implores to think about using all media to benefit our own values. This might require a person to get a flip phone and move off the grid, but for most of us it isn’t. I don’t know exactly how much of his advice I’ll follow. I probably won’t do the digital detox that the first chapter describes, but I will be looking at my values and my intentions and seeing how I can use digital services to enhance my life and remove it when I’m no longer benefiting from it. ★★★★☆ • Audiobook • Non-fiction - self help, self improvement, productivity • Purchased from Audible. ◾︎"

If not, I guess I can't blame the book. Either way, I believe his ideas are worth considering. We live in any age when digital technology companies beckon us into their domains with vague notions of how they will make our lives better, only to use every trick in the book to steal countless hours of our time. Who benefits? The digital technology companies themselves who sell all that attention they've stolen from us to advertisers for big bucks. Newport's solution is ""digital minimalism"", a philosophy of digital engagement in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value and then happily miss out on everything else. His logic is sound, his research is compelling, and the lifestyle he describes is appealing, so I’m giving it a shot. "
112,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5535668-tess-malone,4,"This is the first book on taking control of your digital life that has actually led me to make concrete changes. Newport does a great job of mixing history, science, examples from real people now, and action plans, making this one of the most effective tech self-help books. I really appreciated how Newport puts the attention economy in context. No, this is not the first time advertisers have vied for our attention (that started in the 19th century), but he also explains the science well enough so we can understand why smartphones are so effective at it now. Unlike a lot of books in this genre that spend the first half of the book freaking you out about the science of smartphones then giving a detox plan (I'm thinking mostly of Catherine Price's How to Break Up With Your Phone), Newport blends this background with practical tips in every chapter, so we are building on our strategies every chapter. Although Newport (in)famously has never used social media, he is never pedantic or patronizing. He has a few firm rules (really take a month cold turkey because these services are too addictive otherwise) and then focuses on building a life that doesn't need to be supplanted by a smartphone. My one complaint is Newport suffers from too much academic signposting in his writing, but otherwise this is a quick and truly helpful read."

This book struck me as Thoreau's playbook for the modern man who wants to live intentionally in the strange times we find ourselves. I've been giving this topic a lot of thought since Apple introduced the screen time tracker and I've been watching my usage and data. It's not that technology or social media is evil but that we need to be more intentional and judicious in how we use it.

It’s been a great reminder to continue to lessen my time spent looking at screens and increase my time living in the real world. I really love the emphasis on getting away from all the noise and distractions that social media makes. The emphasis on walks outside and time without my phone are also great reminders. We need to be intentional with our free time. Doing ‘nothing’ leads to low quality engagements like swiping through social media which really has very little reward. We often think we’ll be satisfied by scrolling and scrolling, thinking we need to keep up with everyone. Yet, we are never satisfied and we don’t find real fulfillment in doing so. A sense of fulfillment comes instead when we converse with people in real life, learn something new, or create something with our hands. And, by cutting out distractions, we realize we’re not really missing out."

Being noncompliant and already being in tune with minimalism (in theory more than in practice, alas), I’m probably not the ideal reader for this. But Cal Newport arguably isn’t the ideal writer for this book, either, as he’s never used social media or had a digital overuse problem. He has no need for social media, so he can’t understand why anyone else would use it when they could be doing something more “strenuous” and “high-quality.” I think that disconnect made this book shallow.There was some good stuff towards the beginning, reminding me that intentionality is what gives satisfaction in life. It’s not about ditching our devices—it’s about retaining our autonomy and not feeling like a slave to them. When you can figure out what your values are (though no advice about how to do so, unfortunate given that life-through-screens tends to dull our self-awareness regarding what we truly value) and appreciate the need to protect your time, you can zero in on the technology that’s worth it and tune out the rest.I also appreciated his points on how doing nothing is overrated and on the need for solitude in our noisy world. Technology use is a way to avoid feelings of loneliness, but a nonstop diet of other people’s thoughts in our mental feeds prevents us from enjoying the benefits of solitude such as knowing our own minds, clarifying hard problems, and regulating our emotions.Newport realizes that you can’t just cut out compulsive phone use and call it a day—you have to fill your leisure time with something else, ideally something that provides the deep satisfaction and sense of self-worth that social media dangles before us but consistently fails to deliver. His advice is hit or miss but mostly feels like padding, with a lot of think piece boilerplate lionizing Thoreau, Lincoln, Benjamin Franklin, and the like sandwiched between random anecdotes and tangents.Many reviews say the book’s points were covered better and more succinctly in Newport’s previous book Deep Work—I wish I’d read that instead.Title in Spanish: No Spanish translation"

So when I read books like Digital Minimalism I feel like I might come across as a baffled elderly man; someone woefully out of touch with the modern times.Cal Newport explores the relationships between humanity and technology as he discusses how often people look at their cell phones for every little thing that happens. We live in a distracted world. Unfortunately, this world is also very complex.I would say that I have an internet addiction. I go on it for most of my free time. However, I am not tethered to my phone as many people seem to be. Newport’s main argument is that the technology we use is undermining our relationships and our mental health.

I've been thinking about how to reshape my relationship to digital media for a while now, particularly with the desire to move beyond hacks into an actual system for engaging with technology without letting it control my life, and I've already gleaned so many ideas from reading this. The TL;DR of the rest of this review is that the book is concise and well structured with some excellent ideas in it.Newport divides this book into two sections: ""Foundations"" provides a brief synopsis of our current predicament and outlines the principles of digital minimalism, then ""Practices"" gives ideas about steps you could take to follow those principles and live a less distracted, more joyful life. The heart of the book is the idea that you should cut back on all but those digital activities which actually add significant value to your life, and use them strategically towards that end. Building a philosophy of technology based on your core personal values makes so much sense to me! I also thought that his suggested practices covered an excellent breadth of ideas, and I especially enjoyed the reflection on the importance of solitude and the benefit of structured sociality.I also liked that this book was well structured and written - the chapters were internally cohesive, key ideas were broken down then elaborated upon, and it was informative but very direct.

The previous book I did by this author, Deep work, wasn't amazing by any means, but it was at least informative and persuading enough for me to seriously evaluate how I go about work. Here, though, I was left unimpressed. I'm already an abstainer of social media and don't feel like I have an issue with the amount of 'screen time' I subject myself to. So you'd think I'm a low-hanging fruit for the idea of digital minimalism. Somehow though, the author actually made me reconsider my own stance on the topic by how utterly poor and unconvincing his arguments were.I get that many people can be persuaded by anecdotes of famous people, but the examples in this book were baffling. Abraham Lincoln? On a book about digital minimalism? Sure, I understand the point was about trying to prove that solitude is both necessary and beneficial for your mental well-being, but what about the thousands of people who get by perfectly fine without deliberate seclusion? Basically, all the anecdotes had the same issue: ""But what about all the people who cope just fine in this digital world without this bit of advice""? And that's the annoying part. There are so many arguments one could make that don't rely on famous and random people saying how much better their lives are after cutting their use of social media. Also, I get that social media is a big time sink for many people, but this is supposed to be about digital minimalism, not social media minimalism. Very little in this book actually talked about all the other distractions the digital world has to offer and how one could go about balancing that with a more satisfying life. There are a number of practical tips and ideas though, some of which aren't that bad, but most were very impractical and had little regard for the concept of habit. Working with your hands, making extensions to your house and being supremely useful sounds great in theory, but getting the skills, space and, more pertinently, the tools and resources to actually do those things is out of the realm of most people. Telling all your close contacts to call you during specified hours also sounds great, but most people much prefer texting for a number of reasons, most of which aren't associated with the negative connotations the book insinuates about the medium. I could go on like this for pretty much every piece of advice this book brought up.I really hate to have to give this book such a poor rating since I genuinely believe the core message and intention is important for many people in this digital age. You definitely should be more mindful of how you use every bit of technology, especially the supposedly free platforms vying for your constant attention. Unfortunately, this book does an awful job of trying to convince you of that fact and the advice it doles out is woefully impractical. The fact that there's a significant amount of fluff also doesn't endear me to it and makes recommending this book so hard to do. There will be those people who are persuaded by these arguments and that's great. The idea of digital minimalism is flawed, but potentially beneficial to many people. It's just a shame that this is the book many people will pick up on the topic."

Cal Newport keeps it succinct, offering his rationale behind minimized technology use, and different ways, as well as examples, of how others have done so — with the benefits greatly outweighing the costs. Besides just shedding light into the dangerously addictive side of technology, I appreciate Cal's exploration into the  focused life  more in-depth, imparting life advice on how time should be spent intentionally. For one, the importance of face-to-face communication, and the need to distinguish conversation from mere connection is probably what I loved the most; he emphasizes that constant connection, seen through likes and retweets, don't actually make for a substantial relationship — and it's dangerous if we allow this low quality version suffice for what should be healthy conversation, effectively displacing the latter.Though I personally wouldn't sort myself on the extreme spectrum, consciously controlling my social media usage, Cal's tips helped clarify social media consumption; instead of frantically looking to maximize the plethora of applications out there, we should be looking to maximize our pursuits and goals, and see which applications can supplement that cause."

Whenever this book mentioned how websites and tech companies try their best to keep our eyes on the screens by making it feel like a slot machine or how they monitor our likes and interactions and use it to push ads based on that information - it felt like we're living in a dystopian world. But it's real life and it's insane how dependent we became on these devices. Did I want to hammer my phone as Ron did though? No. Actually, maybe a little bit.This book has some good advice when it comes to filling the void that your phone already has in your time, it's motivating to think of the activities I could be doing that would benefit me much more than mindless scrolling. These leisure activities are encouraged which include knitting or woodworking (think: Ron Swanson)  However, it's nothing new. Maybe to a full-on phone addict, it would be something they never considered but I actually finished a crochet scarf to this audiobook so I was already on my way to digital minimalism son.The part that I loved a lot is the ""Spend Time Alone"" and it talks about how important it is to have time to our own thoughts and wonderings with no distraction. it talks about the numerous well-known figures in history that valued their -what I like to call- ""me time"". (again, think: Ron Swanson)Personally, I think the cause of our phone addiction isn't each individual app. It's not just facebook and it's not just twitter. It's all of them, we simply have too many options. After taking a look at the apps on my phone, I have almost 4 messaging apps but I need them all because there's always a person who has one app but not the other three. Too many apps for one purpose.Now I'm not going to say that I don't even use my phone that much because, while this may be somewhat correct, there are still days when I would go to bed and think what the fuck did I do today? and the answer is nothing. So this helped me be more cautious of the time spent on my phone. I definitely recommend it to people who think they can't live without their phones."

Things were getting better even though some days after I deleted them, there are times I find myself looking mindlessly at my phone screen and my fingers keep scrolling to find those apps that already have been deleted. I come to read this book in a situation like that. I want to find a way to cut me from that toxic and meaningless behavior, I want to learn how to use social media ""correctly"" and gladly I found answers for my problem. Below are some of the practices that have been tried by volunteers in Cal Newport's experiments and proved to be effective, and I find them work or (I think) will work in my case. • Spend time alone by leaving your phone at home/taking long walks/journaling. • Reclame leisure: Schedule your low-quality leisure (web surfing, social media checking); join something (any social organization that interest you); follow leisure plan (seasonal and weekly). • Join the attention resistance: delete social media from your phone, dumb down your smartphone.Newport also built a digital declutter process that I think will work well but haven't tried it yet. The idea is you'll take a break from optional technologies in your life in 30 days; in that one month, explore and rediscover activities and behaviors that you find satisfying and meaningful; at the end of the break, reintroduce optional technologies into your life after having determined what value it serves in your life and how specifically you will use it to maximize this value.Facebook and Instagram are deleted from my phone, I somehow moved to Reddit like an alternative. Even though the time I waste on Reddit is not as much as Facebook and Instagram, I find myself falling down another rabbit hole. That's why the digital declutter will be my next attempt to practice digital minimalism. Wish me luck."

Also I found some of his sources questionable/vaguely problematic. Personally, I'm always a little skeptical of anyone who references Thoreau as much as this guy does, and I was also a little put off by his choice to reference FIRE bloggers for the leisure section. In particular, I find the Frugalwoods insufferable, and I wish Newport had used other sources to make the point that you should substitute your mindless scrolling time with some hard work. But I still gave this book four stars because the book outlines really well the reasons why you should want to do digital minimalism, and provides some actionable strategies to achieve this without being alarmist or judgmental or sanctimonious. He makes clear that this should not be treated as a ""detox"" -- he advocates going cold turkey and mindfully re-integrating certain digital tools, kind of like a Whole 30 diet.As of right now, I'm somewhere in the middle of the spectrum. It took me literally years of hemming and hawing and temporarily deactivating to finally fully delete my Twitter and Facebook accounts last year. I honestly don't see myself ever trading my iPhone in for a dumbphone, and I also don't see myself learning how to change my own oil just for the hell of it -- I really just wanted a push to cut down the time I spend on Instagram and my beloved puzzle games. And this book gave me some good ways to do that (with the option of also teaching myself how to change my own oil just for the hell of it). "

How do you want to utilise technology ? And how can you use it to live a meaningful life? 2nd readAlmost a year has passed since I last read this book, and it impresses me still. After my previous read, I ditched Netflix and other media for a while, have had Instagram deleted for around 5 months and keep downloading and kicking it off my phone again and again.Many of the things Newport talks about still circulate around my brain and I even have three pages of notes jotted down in my commonplace book. Still I wanted to read this book again. To remind me of the things I do and do not want in life. I do not want to be caught up watching youtube videos when I am bored or tired, binge-watch Netflix (though even here I significantly reduced my time online) and get bombarded with stories on Instagram (I do not mind the actual posts often) or imagine myself to have “no time”, when significant hours keep vanishing as I peruse Pinterest (even though I tell myself it is for embroidery inspiration), scroll on my phone or read on reddit. I think I will return to this book many more times, on my journey towards a more intentional digital life - and I can urge ANYONE to do the exact same."
148,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4568480-giuseppe-d,3,"Feels weird reviewing this book on a social network website. However, I don't think this book is about deleting all your social media accounts but rather regain control of your attention. It's about realising that your attention is a valuable resource and that's exactly what those platforms are fighting for: the author compares receiving notifications at unpredictable times to pulling the lever of a slot machine, highly addictive.On the other hand, to be completely honest, I didn't think that some of the examples of minimalist people could fit my lifestyle. Do I need to join a Amish community? Do I need to build my own furniture or house? No, I don't think I'll ever do any of those things.With all that said, I did deactivate a couple of social media accounts and deleted some of the apps from my phone. And to be honest, it's nice to have that time back for doing other things, going to the gym, swimming, reading, studying, being alone with myself. And, if anything, I think that's my key takeaway from this book: don't just give out your attention mindlessly but consider what return is provided."

This book forced me to do that - and I didn’t like what I saw. To list out what Cal mentions about social media addiction is basically just looking in the mirror for me and many people. We pick our phones to fill time, creating a loop of services that provide us with variable rewards that keep us coming back for more.He’s careful to say that social media (or any service that we mindlessly consume) isn’t bad, but our relationship with it can be unhealthy.One thing that stuck with me was the idea that all that time spent makes it feel like we’re connected to people, but in reality we aren’t. It’s time away from building real friendships and growing real relationships. After reading this I immediately decided to do my own 30-day digital declutter. 4 days in now and I’ve already stopped checking my phone constantly - although that’s mostly because every app is organized and I’ve written Goodreads reviews for everything I’ve read. Looking forward to seeing where this goes next."

This book is needed in our smartphone-controlled, social-media-crazed, always-connected culture. Disclaimer: I was already a convert before I read this book. I got rid of my smart phone over a year ago and read 100 books in under 7 months. That's more books than I have read in the other 27 years of my life put together. Is that all because I got rid of my smartphone and was distraction free? No, but it was a big factor.

Newport not only points out our socially destructive habits, but he gives comprehensive steps to improve them. Newport never comes off as condescending towards users of social media. He uses a wonderfully motivational and helpful tone throughout this book, and it is extremely impactful. The “Reclaiming Leisure” chapter is particularly genius, and will have you up and ready to seize the day.I took so much away from this read and would recommend to anybody who feels as though they could use some help in better prioritizing their time away from their devices!

Rather, I am giving this 5 stars because it is a book that forced me to re-think they ways I have spent SOOO many hours of my life, specifically my life attached to my phone. I have had whispers in the back of my mind that my phone-life is a problematic one, that I have spent too many hours connected to my phone instead of the world around me (family, friends, colleagues) - and increasingly so. I took one Cal's challenges and deleted many of the apps from my phone, social and games mainly, and you know what? (A) It was very peaceful, and (B) I really didn't miss those interactions much. I highly recommend a digital detox - and for you to read this book with some intention. "

This book has objectively covered reasons why we are so addicted nowadays to social media and smartphones and offered real tools, routines and practices how to consciously use these technologies for the best benefits.“Because of technology, I’m a better humain being than I ever was before” - I hope I can tell such words in the future after applying what I learned in this rich book. I recommend this book to anyone who feel too much into technologies like social media, gaming, phone checking.

The numerous accounts of examples of what some person did, as opposed to a more argumentative style of why this or that is effective, makes it feel like reading children's literature or self help meant for people who rarely read. His style in Deep Work, for example, is much more nuanced. This however feels unpolished. But maybe it works better this way for a larger audience?So despite the style, the book is necessary. Reading his works always motivates me to be more productive, stay more in the present moment, do more stuff that uses more parietal functions than occipital, and i am dearly grateful for the positive effects this yields.

We know that it ticks us off but we couldn't really pinpoint why exactly. We wanted to quit social media and have an inkling that it'll help us somehow but always found ourselves back at it. I think the key to come to terms with any conflict in our lives is to understand exactly why do we feel the way we do with certain things. In this case, cognitive function and social media in essence. Reading this book helps in a sense that it helps you ground your principles, and connect them with the values your upholding in lives and how to use technology to maximize the potential of these things. In summary, it helps you understand how to use technology to better yourself, not the other way around."

He brags almost in all his books how he never used social media (Facebook etc). But how am I going to take advice from someone who has never been in a particular position in the first place? It's the same as getting weight loss advice from a 55 kg person who has never experienced what an over-weight person struggles.

This one is not life-changing as ""Deep work"" was for me, but it brings great insights on technology in general.I'm not a big fan of social networks in general, they are mostly a waste of time in my point of view. Cal shows something even worst about them in this book, which is how companies explore your attention. This is something I saw in many other books already, but this one goes a bit more deeply on the topic. It makes me reconsider many of the apps I still use.Currently, I'm a hard user of the DnD (Do not Disturb) mode of my phone, so I receive almost no notifications. From time to time, I disable the DnD mode and there they are, many notifications of things ""I have to see"". This will be the next step of my quest, remove the apps or at least silence them all.This book is great and I know MANY people that would benefit from the tips here. The main problem is that these people do not care much about spending their time on these apps. With that in mind, I will still recommend it to some or at least try to exemplify the problems, maybe they will change their mind (or maybe not, and it's fine).Here are my notes about this book:The biggest companies in social media should admit they are tobacco sellers of our time, selling addictive drugs to children in the form of likesNon Profit: time well spentIrresistible bookUnpredictable positive reinforcement triggers our will to do things more (receive likes)Social networks exploit our craving for social approval. The number of likes shows the group approves what you're doingDigital minimalists are OK on losing small things to focus on others that make their lives good. e.g. the small advantages of Facebook doesn't pay for the overall problems of using itChoose the right technology and use it in a meaningful way that goes in the same way as your goalsClutter is costly. Many apps may have such a negative effect that surpass the positive effect of apps isolatedOne should not only consider the financial return if things, but also the amount of lifetime investedWhile considering the advantages of social media, take into account the time you're spending to have that advantage. Does it worth it? Is it the best way to achieve what you want? Be deliberate about it.Many people limit Netflix to social events like watching with their partners -- that's exactly what I do 🤔Intention trumps convenienceDuring the digital detox, remove every app (or games) that are optional for your life. It will take 30 days, and you will have time to reevaluate their usage. Break the habits of checking these apps from time to time and fill this time with something meaningful. After 30 days, reevaluate from scratch if you really need it.Players of rock, paper, scissors usually exploit the body language of their opponents to adjust their moves accordingly. It's not about luck or statistics as everyone expectedSince we're a baby, our brains use the non-focused time to think about social things. It's part of who we are. It happens even when we don't even know what social is (the same region of the brain is activated with the same patterns)The usage of apps like Facebook can increase or decrease your happiness. For the general public, it reduces happiness overall and has a strong correlation with loneliness. The increase in happiness only happens in small doses, when interacting with people we know. These interactions are not so good as face to face interactions, but they let us think 'our social interaction is done.'Invest your time in conversation (real-time, in-person when possible), not connections (Facebook post, online chat, Instagram likes, etc.). At first, you will lose contact with many people, but in the end, you will be strengthening your relationship with people that matter for your life""I remember the anxiety if calling my friends and not knowing which family member will pick up and how they would feel the intrusion.""Trade text and likes to a real-time conversation. It's ok not to be ""on-call"" 100% of the time.Reserve periodic time for meaningful conversations with people.

177,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2169934-kelly,0,"Earlier this year, author Roni Loren blogged about her 30-day social media break, and credited Cal Newport's books, Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World and Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World for the greater part of her amazing productivity during that time. I found her experiment truly inspiring, particularly as for the earlier part of this year, I was feeling overwhelmed by the demands on my time, and exhausted by the effort of maintaining a social media presence. I'd had four titles release in quick succession (one a month) in the latter half of 2018, and was working my way toward the release of Purple Haze. Generally, I enjoy interacting with friends and readers on Facebook, in the few groups I'm active in and on my personal timeline. I try hard not to spam any of these places with news of my upcoming releases and have always tried to maintain a consistent activity level so that when I do talk about my books, the post isn't a serious departure from ""what Kelly posts about."" Writing is an integral part of my life, therefore it's a part of my timeline. I've always had a difficult relationship with social media, though. I often have to make myself go online and do the thing. I assumed it was because I was old and more extroverted than introverted. I like spending time with people. I also prefer to converse face-to-face, where I can read facial cues and body language. I'm often confused by the tone (or lack thereof) of text messages. Like most older people I know, I use a lot of emojis when texting, because they help intonate. That's me grimacing and smiling and winking. Even while texting, I'm still trying to tell you with my face how I feel about this. Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World explained a lot of my difficulties with texting and my ambivalence toward the true value of social media. There are times when interacting with the people in what I call my Facebook Book Club immeasurably brightens my day. On the flip side, I often close the Facebook tab feeling depressed about my writing career. I've been reminded how many other writers are releasing a book this month and how much better they're doing (ratings, number of reviews, traction with readers, random reader posts telling everyone how much they love the book). I can never tell how I'm going to feel after being online.The solution? Make more deliberate choices. One of the practices Newport recommends is to remove social media from your phone. I've tried this before with limited success, but after reading this book, I feel better prepared for it. Facebook can wait until I get home and I often forget to check Twitter anyway. I'll keep Instagram, but I intend to use it more spontaneously, rather than try to think of something to post. What I really got out of this book, aside from a strategy to reduce my time spent mindlessly scrolling and perhaps taking a hit to my delicate writerly ego, is what to do with the time I gained. I had vague ideas of wanting to draw again, of reducing my TBR pile. Of watching more movies at home (like I used to do), instead of half-hour TV shows that I only half watch while I'm scrolling through Facebook. I want to pay more attention to my offline life, and the only way to effectively do that is to step away.I also really enjoyed the historical anecdotes and wealth of scientific information. Honestly, even if you don't feel the need to minimalize your digital life, this book is worth the read simply for the history of social media and how it's designed to hijack your spare time."
178,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98681744-m---the-long-hot-spell,4,"“Digital minimalists see new technologies as tools to be used to support things they deeply value—not as sources of value themselves. They don’t accept the idea that offering some small benefit is justification for allowing an attention-gobbling service into their lives, and are instead interested in applying new technology in highly selective and intentional ways that yield big wins. Just as important: they’re comfortable missing out on everything else.” (Cal Newport)I enjoyed Newport’s other books, Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World and So Good They Can't Ignore You, but to be honest I wasn’t expecting to like this one as much. I felt this subject has been done a lot—in books and on the internet—and I felt it would rehash parts from his other books. The surprise was that (though there was a little rehashing) I liked this one just as much.This book is for those who appreciate technology but who also see the problems it brings with it. We have been funneled into a new way of living that has some benefits and some drawbacks but really, it’s all happened so fast that we didn’t really know what we were getting into.Newport provides a background of how our lives have changed, what some problems are and then shows us how we can use technology more effectively. Meaning, how we can get the maximum benefit with the minimum drawbacks. It’s about knowing what you use, why you use it, how you use it, what you gain and lose from it. It’s about being mindful of technology and social media use.Digital Minimalism gives many examples including some from everyday people who took part in Newport’s research project on the subject. I appreciated those examples because it gave me some ideas on changes I might make. To illustrate, if staying up to date with news is important to you but you get lost in too many news sites each day then other options might be: Listening to news on the radio, choosing one site or a certain number of sites you look up and being strict about not going further than that, getting news the old-fashioned way by a newspaper or some other paper-based news subscription. The point though is you can look for solutions, do things differently to improve your situation.You feel Newport is describing his life. He’s really into productivity and, on a side note, I remember reading some books in the early 2010s by a few different young, American, white guys who were sooo into productivity. To be honest, I lost patience with that whole scene pretty quickly. But I have become a fan of Newport because he’s an academic and there’s something about his attitude towards things that speaks to me. Anyway, so you get to know a lot about him, what he values, how he lives, and I enjoy that. But you don’t have to do everything the way he does. Again, the key is to make mindful choices instead of just being swept along by every new tech option without analysing it first.There was an interesting discussion of how the Amish decide on which technology they will adopt and which they won’t and describes them as living a different form of modernity. It’s not blanket praise but praise on the way the decisions are made consciously. Digital Minimalism includes a practical plan for removing ‘optional’ tech, apps etc for 30 days before reintroducing some of it (conscious choices) with operating procedures in place for how and when you will use it. Newport is thorough, which is something I like about him, and I'm glad I didn't skip this new book.This review is also published on my blog: The Long Hot Spell"

The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run. I LOVED THIS BOOK! Newport is so great at writing self-improvement books that are filled to the brim with useful information, as opposed to other authors who effectively write a padded out blog post with plenty of references to their 'online communities' and 'add on purchases'. At this point, I think I'd basically read anything he wrote. The point of this book is to move away from being a ‘digital maximalist’ to a ‘digital minimalist’ – instead of using a digital tool that has any value in your life, Newport recommends that you selectively incorporate only those tools that have an outsized impact on your life and goals, and only use this tool very selectively. The reason for this approach is that technology, and particularly social media, focuses on trying to absorb as much of your attention as it can, leading you to waste time in ways that aren’t value-additive or enjoyable, and perpetuate a cycle of addiction. Principles1.	Clutter is costly. Digital minimalists recognize that cluttering their time and attention with too many devices, apps, and services creates an overall negative cost that can swamp the small benefits that each individual item provides in isolation.2.	Optimization is important. Digital minimalists believe that deciding a particular technology supports something they value is only the first step. To truly extract its full potential benefit, it’s necessary to think carefully about how they’ll use the technology.3.	Intentionality is satisfying. Digital minimalists derive significant satisfaction from their general commitment to being more intentional about how they engage with new technologies. This source of satisfaction is independent of the specific decisions they make and is one of the biggest reasons that minimalism tends to be immensely meaningful to its practitioners.Newport recommends that you put aside a 30 day period during which you take a break from optional technologies in your life – he emphasizes that during this time, you should be exploring your interests and rediscovering activities and behaviours you enjoy that aren’t technology-aided (or rather, social-media-aided – making calls to your loved ones is allowed!), but that add value and meaning to your life. After these 30 days, reintroduce technologies into your life, starting from a blank slate – for each one you reintroduce, determine what value it serves in your life, and how you’ll specifically use it to maximize that value. You shouldn’t be treating this as a detox, but rather as the start of a permanent adjustment you’re making to your life. Something else I really enjoyed about this book were the conversations about the attention economy, our need for being physically engaged in tasks (personally love knitting so this was music to my ears), and especially the section on how we've effectively lost solitude in our lives. I've had moments where my earphones have died in the middle of a walk listening to a podcast and I've thought 'hey, this hasn't happened for a long time', and that's pretty worrying! We can't really be alone with ourselves for long stretches anymore, and Newport really encourages us to rediscover this state. Overall, I'll be recommending this book to anyone that asks. A really necessary exercise, and super well-structured!"

Don't expect to it to reveal something you already don't suspect or that you already know and have ignored for a long time, but it still is a pretty entertaining read and provides some interesting tips and examples about how to improve your relationship with technology. I believe it will provide value to most readersThe author introduces the subject by exposing how tech companies have:•	Made us consume information and news constantly.•	Increase our inclination towards multi-tasking.•	Deployed platforms that have been proven to be addictive, since they have negative psychological impacts and reduce our autonomy. This is not accidental, since these are designed to capture as much attention as possible.•	The platforms are addictive since they provide intermittent positive reinforcement and social approval.•	Some negative psychological manifestations are anxiety and depression•	Used negative or polemic info to attract more attention.Therefore, he proposes a philosophy regarding technology use which he labels ""digital minimalism"". This aims at regaining control over our attention by only using a small and optimized set of communication tools and discard all the rest, therefore, you will only retain tools that provide great benefits.It is based on:•	Clutter is costly: too much info has diminishing returns, hence in this case ""less is more"". **In this chapter there is a great Thoreau's reflection on time as an asset.•	Optimizations is important: know why you are using the tech. Choose carefully why and how•	Intention is satisfactory: you find meaning in doing what you really want. By evaluating your priorities and choosing your tech according to what is valuable you will feel fulfilledHe proposes to adopt it by starting from scratch and doing a 30 day abstinence: For 30 days remove all optional tech from your life, focus on activities and behaviors that provide you with meaning.1. Define which tech is optional and a strategy to remove it. It is optional if its removal will not have harm or obstruct daily operations in your life.2. Execute for thirty days, this is important so you take an unbiased decision after. You should also re-connect with things you value dearly3. Decide what to re-insert: does it provide something really valuable? is it the best way to connect? how to use it to avoid pitfalls.In the book the author provides some great examples and tips about what to do and avoid in the process. Some examples are (only pointing the two that I found most appealing):Cultivate solitude: solitude provides greater insights and emotional balance, it enables original and creative thoughts, greater introspection and closeness to others.Cultivate high quality leisure since we have filled our free tine with unrewarding digital distractions.1st approach: do virtuous activities that require effort and mental intensity, prioritize action. 2nd: do things that require skill and that create or engage with something in the physical world.3rd: engage in complex and hierarchical social interactions.And as a conclusion he invites the reader to think about why we are supposed to be connected.The only points I disagreed with the author were: he draws some conclusions about why people tend to use more social media in detriment of real interactions that I believe are wrong, and the explanation he gives for the default mode network seems contradictory to what other authors tend to point out."

I loved Deep Work so I bought Digital Minimalism and started reading, rather smugly, ready to pat myself on the back for having been able to restrain myself from social media use so well.Of course the book is actually about ""digital"" minimalism, not just social media. It dawned on me that without noticing, I have filled every second of my day with some sort of digital media.""solitude is about what’s happening in your brain, not the environment around you. Accordingly, they define it to be a subjective state in which your mind is free from input from other minds.- I wake, put on my headphones, and listen to a podcast while I run. - I drive to work (listening to a podcast in the car). - I arrive at work and open: slack, teams, skype, skype for business, work email, personal email.- At lunch, I take a walk (listening to headphones), call my partner, maybe read some articles in pocket/rss, etc- After work, driving to music or podcasts- At home, over dinner, we likely watch some TV- I read before bed- I fall asleep to a (boring) podcastIn the whole day, there are very, very few gaps where I am not stuffing something into my brain. Even those moments are generally spent with family, not in solitude. Solitude has become what happens when my headphones run out of battery.I am a digital maximalist, to my surprise.In the past, I have done some purges, cutting down the number of rss feeds and podcasts I follow to 50 each, removing old pocket articles, etc., but that was about making the feed less overwhelming, not reducing the amount of media I was actually consuming. It was about becoming more efficient in my maximalism.In the book, Cal Newport explains his 'Digital Minimalism' philosophy. Talks about why it is necessary. Suggests a detox (no digital media for a month, then add back what you think is valuable), then gives some suggestions on how to use digital media _well_.The book reminds me strongly of Marie Kondo actually (this is a good thing).""Digital Minimalism: A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else.He focuses heavily on why and how to use digital media with intention, instead of out of habit.""As with the Amish who find contentment without modern conveniences, an important source of Laura’s satisfaction with her smartphone-free life comes from the choice itself. “My decision [to not use a smartphone] gives me a sense of autonomy,” she told me. “I’m controlling the role technology is allowed to play in my life.” After a moment of hesitation, she adds: “It makes me feel a little smug at times.” What Laura describes modestly as smugness is almost certainly something more fundamental to human flourishing: the sense of meaning that comes from acting with intention. He also doesn't really try and show that social media etc. is actively harmful using studies or correlations with suicide rates. Instead, he approaches it more from the angle that digital media crowds out real life interaction, that it is an inferior substitute, and that is why it should be avoided.He is also pragmatic and suggests continuing to use those tools that provide value:""I’m pointing this out to push back on the idea that high-quality leisure requires a nostalgic turning back of time to a pre-internet era. On the contrary, the internet is fueling a leisure renaissance of sorts by providing the average person more leisure options than ever before in human history. It does so in two primary ways: by helping people find communities related to their interests and providing easy access to the sometimes obscure information needed to support specific quality pursuits.Overall, I found this an effective book in making me reevaluate my media consumption.You might already know some of the content, there are probably plenty of blog posts that cover the same concepts. This works better. This is a kick up the pants type book. It shakes you out of your inertia."

He already had me completely convinced within the Introduction & first small bit of this book, to make a major change in my social media + screen habits. I’ll definitely be trying out the detox method. The idea of naming what benefit(s) each app gives you, and asking yourself if that is the best method to achieve those goals, and if those things are given in equal measure based off the amount of time you spend on it. ____________________________________Example: Twitter〰️benefits = sometimes positive business connections + staying up to date with news. 〰️questions to ask = i spend ~3 hours daily on Twitter. Do I get 3 hours worth of connections AND fulfillment for my need to be up to date on the news? And, is this the best way to achieve those goals? 〰️ if not, what if I spent one day a month attending professional meetings (for goal of business connections) and only 2 days a week reading Twitter. Etc. Etc. _______________________________________It really had me thinking how I could do so many of my desired things in other, better ways. There were lots of great examples and instruction on how to implement each idea, which I really appreciated. The discussion about “solitude deprivation” was especially alarming and all too real today, in observing the younger kids in my life. I’ll definitely be implementing intentional solitude into my schedule after listening to this section. Many times, we attribute social media’s role in anxiety by to everyone comparing themselves to “picture perfect” things they see online. But he argues that it is (also) due to the lack of solitude in our lives , (which is what allows our minds to decompress, solve problems, and just be bored and think about things). When was the last time we’ve gone on a walk without listening to music or a podcast?? Or taken a long car ride just in silence? Or spent any long stretch of time without any noise? For me? A long long long time. My only critique/confusion was the very small bit about different Presidents and famous musicians being so successful due to their intentional habits of solitude (I.e. spending alone time to properly write a speech, or spending alone time to compose a musical piece). Some of the examples of “success because of solitude” may just be due to the individual being, say, an introvert. Or being free from distraction in that day, or moment. And maybe not necessarily a proven theory for WHY we NEED solitude. Granted, I do agree that we need solitude and it’s scary how children today don’t know how to function in it, but just had a slight problem with that one tiny portion explaining the reason why. But didn’t harm the overall point. Overall, loved this one and recommended it to several of my friends and family already."

In a similar way, I have recurring fantasies of shutting down my social media profiles, deleting my website, and generally trying to erase my presence from the Internet.And so, I need to read a book called Digital Minimalism like a depressed person needs a lecture on antinatalism.Of course, I read it anyway. It’s not often that I’m excited enough about an upcoming book to mark the release date on my calendar, but Cal Newport is one of my favorite authors. His writing has had a major impact on me, especially Deep Work, so I asked him for an advance copy. I figured some of you would be interested, too.Now the book is out publicly, and I’ve had enough time to digest it, I can report the following:Digital Minimalism makes a solid case for cutting down on technological distractions and enjoying the benefits of an offline life. It contains detailed case studies, suggested strategies, an outline of a 30-day digital declutter, and all the careful caveats you might wish for. I was nodding my head like a metronome all the way through.While it didn’t have the same ‘wow’ factor as Deep Work, I’m not sure if my experience is representative.A lot of this stuff is already common knowledge, and I might be unusually obsessed with it. Everyone is at least vaguely aware that too much screen time can be harmful, that tech companies are competing to strip-mine our attention, and using all sorts of creepy tricks to do so. I’ve seen the interviews with Tristan Harris—the ex-Googler dubbed “the closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience”—written about the various Facebook scandals, and coincidentally happened to be re-reading Thoreau, who features prominently throughout the book.In short, Digital Minimalism is not only preaching to the choir; I’m standing in the front row furiously doing jazz hands. I could try to summarise the main points, but that wouldn’t be any fun. If you want detailed arguments, you can read the book.Instead, I want to use this review as a jumping-off point to sketch out some broader stuff I’ve been thinking about lately: on tradeoffs, personal identity, and following through on good intentions.[Read the rest of the review]"
185,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6424859-dominic-carlin,1,"A couple of weeks ago, bemoaning my iPhone use which was averaging over 4 hours a day, I started looking for a way out. The options were terrible. Make your phone's screen grayscale. Use a dumb phone. Turn off all notifications and delete social media. Okay, so that last two aren't actually terrible, but come on who hasn't done that already? Since then I've reduced my phone use to an average of about 100 minutes per day. This isn't a life hack post, I'm not about that life, but my own personal solution involved keeping the phone on 'Downtime' between 9pm at night and 4pm the next day.In Digital Minimalism, often cited as an inspiration by those looking to cut down their smartphone use, Cal Newport suggests a different approach. Instead of using technology to correct your problems with technology, Newport takes it back ancient times by suggesting you need a whole new philosophy to help you. Philosophy has become a bit of a bad word around these parts, corrupted by charlatans like Roberto Martinez and dickheads who think Seneca walked on water. So has minimalism. The two together? Oh god, why didn't I heed the warning signs and stop there. Probably because, hidden beneath the anecdotes and the innumerable references to Thoreau and Walden - okay, there were 111, I searched on my Kindle - there were grains of truth. Because yes, identifying the things which, ahem, spark joy and which annoy you is the first step towards solving the problem. You can then find a way to maximise the good and minimise the bad. That's more or less what I did myself, I just didn't need a 300 page book to tell me that. Nor did I need a 30 day 'digital declutter' to help me identify them. Of course, if this book was truly about reducing your technology use, then it would just be a short article on a webpage. I mean, come on, I've given you the gist of it in a couple of paragraphs. No, this is another 30-something white man harking back to how things were better in the good old days of Teddy Roosevelt and Benjamin Franklin (HOUSE!!!) when people had values and knew what was truly important.Maybe this is too cynical. Maybe this book actually will help some people. Maybe it won't lead to people feeling superior to other people who can't put their phones down. Or maybe I just need to stop reading books like this. I've read them all before now."

I've actually started reading Newport's 'Deep Work' since reading 'Digital Minimalism', and that has simply left me questioning why Newport even wrote this book, given that all the good material in it is already in Deep Work. Having read three of Newport's other books besides Digital Minimalism and Deep Work, I can confidently say that he excels at doing qualitative research (e.g. interviewing students, trawling through speeches and books) and then demonstrating, summarising and linking together trends in the research in order to create a cohesive guide for optimising whatever it happens to be that he is writing about. This is the same approach he has tried to take for Digital Minimalism, but unfortunately it is the wrong approach. The arguments that are useful in this discussion are not whether Abraham Lincoln or Theroux or some judges spent time alone and did well at life. There is so much of this unimportant and uninformative content that I frequently yelled ""I don't care!"" at my audiobook. What is needed with this topic is the hard science. There is a smidge of this in Digital Minimalism, but for some reason Newport is imprecise and misleading at times with how he presents it, saying, for example, that a correlation between greater smartphone use and levels of anxiety across a population ""implies"" that smartphones are giving us anxiety. He also is quite insistent that smartphones are the source of all anxiety for young people, not even entertaining the idea that other pressures could be causing the anxiety that is then only exacerbated by smart phone use - or possibly even that anxious teens use smart phones as a kind of self-medicating tool. The world's climate and politics seem to be going mad, but nope, it's definitely only the smartphones making everyone anxious.Taking his usual approach on a topic which is not suited to it has created a book that feels like bad philosophy and filler-content with just a sprinkling of actual advice to bump it up to the 2.5 star mark. Pretty disappointed, but I'm keen to keep reading Deep Work."

Make no mistake, I am not so gullible that a single book can alter my life view. It did, however, push me over the edge. While the premise of the book is grounded on developing the ability to be strategic and intentional about our social media use, the visceral disenchantment that Cal Newport - the author - has about its pernicious effects is apparent in his writing. He goes on to great lengths to explain not just the psychology behind people falling under the effect of social media addiction but also to untangle the business model behind it and the value that technology companies generate by selling our attention to third-parties advertisers.At its core, this is a self-help book. But it refrains from being didactic - the author makes his argument with utmost respect to us. The book starts with discerning the effects of prevalent social media habits and the long-term effects that it will have if we don't change them. The next step Cal suggests is to go on a 30 day detox to flush it out completely from your systems. Only then can we reintroduce it back to our lives - but in a way that we can extract maximum value from it.The remainder of the book explains practical approaches to be more intentional and strategic about our online habits. Cal achieves this through narrating several incidents and real-life experiences from people who are well known and successful in their respective fields. The sheer number of articles, books, and other references he quotes demonstrates his thorough research on the subject and solidifies his credibility.About three-forth of my way to the end, I was convinced that my life would be more meaningful if I had harvested lesser ""connections"" and more ""communications"". Cal Newport - like me - doesn't have a Facebook account himself and he doesn't plan to have one either."

If you adopt this philosophy, you’ll almost certainly reduce the number of people with whom you have an active relationship. Real conversation takes time, and the total number of people for which you can uphold this standard will be significantly less than the total number of people you can follow, retweet, “like,” and occasionally leave a comment for on social media, or ping with the occasional text. Once you no longer count the latter activities as meaningful interaction, your social circle will seem at first to contract.” ― Cal Newport, Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy WorldDigital Minimalism struck me as a cross between Kondo's book The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing and The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business by Charles Duhigg. (I read Duhigg's book in 2013.) This is like the Marie Kondo method for the digital world. Great research with very practical advice that reinforced techniques I used in 2015 to disengage from social media on my phone specifically. I deleted Messenger and most texting apps back then. I removed other social networks, including Twitter, from my phone last year and set personal boundaries for myself and for others. My friends know when to reach me and how to reach me.

He argues that we are constantly exposed to distractions by social media and the internet, especially since the triumphal march of the smartphone.

I really do think it will become the next “Big Tobacco.” About halfway through, I decided to buy the book because it was convincing enough I will want to give it a re-read any time I find myself slipping back into patterns of mind numbing, aimless scrolling. I hope to be dramatically more intentional with the way I use my time. Tech and social media companies dedicate so much time and effort to design products that literally undermine our autonomy. I want to be sure that I’m using tech in a way that truly does enrich my life, instead of ultimately detracting from it. Plus, it scares me that we’re raising a generation of kids who don’t even realize that life has ever been any different.

And it's great. Its primary use for me is its deconstruction of the unspoken myths surrounding media generally and social media specifically: that it's indispensable, that you're a weirdo if you don't actively use it, and so on. Instead, Newport points out an important (and surprisingly obvious) truth: these services thrive on your attention while providing comparatively little value for the time invested. I like his description of the book as a manifesto; it's both an explication of the philosophy of Digital Minimalism and a guide for how to apply the principles in your life. The book loses a star simply because, as with his blog posts, Newport writes this book like the computer scientist he is. There's something of the technical manual in it, even with its interesting case studies, anecdotes, and Newport's stories of his personal quirks. I was deeply interested in the material, and it had a significant impact on me, and I still too often felt like I was slogging through it. "

I’ve practiced a lot of what Dr. Newport suggests – I gave up Facebook years ago after a thirty day trial run – and one thing I would add to his suggestions: it’s a constant push-and-pull. Much like eating healthy, minimizing the effect of technology on your life takes constant work. What works for six months can stop being effective, but the effort to avoid passive indulgence is worth it. If nothing else, I’m glad I read Digital Minimalism for some new tricks and a reminder that, much like eating doughnuts, I almost always regret mindless browsing and how it wastes time. Highly recommended. "

This mostly meant a shift away from media towards books and exercise. I still felt a constant struggle to establish a healthy relationship with technology, going back and forth in terms of intensity. This book was a big confirmation of my already instilled believe that technology is often consuming too much of our time and this constant flow of input negatively impacts our lives in our current relationship with it.Best about the book is that its message goes way beyond only advocating digital minimalism. It's about actually leading a life with intention and prioritizing things you value. In this age I highly believe there is a symbiotic relationship between digital minimalism and living fully. A strong read for everyone interested to live!"

When considered this way, it's downright damning the amount of time each of us spends on mindless websites and iPhone apps. Newport suggests eliminating as much digital distraction as possible, and then slowly adding them back as long as they match your values. This was a valuable exercise. The summary on Facebook's many transgressions alone is worth reading and should be enough to convince anyone to stop using it.A quick easy read with some common sense suggestions for anyone who needs a digital reset.

He spends a lot of time explaining why we need to get away from our screens, which wasn’t as helpful for me, since I’m definitely already on board with that. But the HOW was where things got interesting.One of my favorite pieces of advice was to start investing your time in hobbies/activities that enrich your life, and your phone will suddenly be less of a temptation. I’ve already been trying this and it’s been so refreshing. When I’m on my phone, it’s usually because I’m wanting rest, but I never actually feel rested afterwards. Things that require more energy and effort (woodworking, crafts, writing, reading, etc.) actually are more restorative and will make you feel more rested, even though you were expending more energy while doing them. You gotta give energy to get energy! Another thing I appreciate about this book is that the author doesn’t take the stance that technology is inherently bad or that we should all throw our phones in the trash and go back to landlines. Instead, he reminds us that technology was originally meant to be used as a tool to assist with life, not replace it, and he gives great suggestions for optimizing your phone to best meet your needs so that you can be in control of your phone and not the other way around.Some of his suggestions are a little extreme (like never text for any reason other than logistical), but he’s pretty good at giving people freedom to find what works for them and not prescribing a one-size fits all solution. If you are at all concerned with your screen usage, I’d say this is a must read. And maybe don’t read it on your smart phone like I did...."

(keep your FB friends under 150). - The amount of useful content that you could miss out on social media is far less of an importance to your true meaningful and joyful life than you would expect. - If you need to catch up on what's happening in the world around you, try subscribing to a few reliable news sources or websites and spend designated amount of time each week to be updated such as BBC or Joe Rogan podcast :-).

240,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85852005-sato,4,"I'm still impressed by Carl Newport's Deep Work and I sort of applied its lessons in my daily life and it is quite possible to use it not only for workplace but also for the whole process of our hyper-connected lifestyle. I don't mean to underestimate Digital Minimalism which is also quite valuable like Deep Work. Before starting to read this book, you need to know that this book is not anti-technology at any point. I guess you need to know this fact about all of the writer's books!Digital Minimalism: “A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else.”To be a digital minimalist, you need to be quite careful about your presence in a certain (technological) environment. The problem is that social media primarily tries to train digital maximalists using their attention engineering tricks. Of course you want to know how!We are normally welcomed to social media with good promises and then over a fairly long time we get to realize that we’ve already overstayed the welcome and now it has turned us into captives desperate to get out of this supposedly friendly environment. They are well aware of your psychological vulnerability and they do the trick long before you realize it.Digital minimalist philosophy rests on three principles:Clutter is costly”More often than not, the cumulative cost of the noncrucial things we clutter our lives with can far outweigh the small benefits each individual piece of clutter promises.”Optimization is important “It states that optimizing how we use technology is just as important as how we choose what technologies to use in the first place.”Intentionality is satisying “Approaching decisions with intention can be more important than the impact of the actual decisions themselves. the very act of being selective about your tools will bring you satisfaction, typically much more than what is lost from the tools you decide to avoid.”Before starting the practical part of the book, Carl offers Digital Declutter which is a strategic term and it is more like a warm-up step to well prepare you for the rest of the process. The Digital Declutter Process:1. Put aside a thirty-day period during which you will take a break from optional technologies in your life.2. During this thirty-day break, explore and rediscover activities and behaviors that you find satisfying and meaningful.3. At the end of the break, reintroduce optional technologies into your life, starting from a blank slate. For each technology you reintroduce, determine what value it serves in your life and how specifically you will use it so as to maximize this value.Afterwards, the book tries to provide ideas and strategies for shaping your digital minimalist lifestyle into something sustainable over the long term. Spend Time AloneThe value of solitude is underscored as Edward Gibons states:“Conversation enriches the understanding, but solitude is the school of genius.” Solitude Deprivation is a serious problem following our hyper-connected generation and is a state in which you spend close to zero time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from other minds.The writer offers three steps for solving this problem with details:1: Leave your phone at home2:Take long walks3:Write letters to yourselfThe next practice offered is Don’t click likesThis is much clear these days provided that Facebook and Instagram are trying to remove this option due to its psychological impact. Reclaim your leisure is the next practice:the goal of this chapter is to help you cultivate high-quality leisure in your own life.Leisure Lesson #1: Prioritize demanding activity over passive consumption.We gotta turn our virtual world into a physical world in praise of craftLeisure Lesson #2: Use skills to produce valuable things in the physical world.Leisure Lesson #3: Seek activities that require real-world, structured social interactions.The last practice proposed is Join the Attention ResistanceYou need to realize how these attention engineering companies are working to go against their tricks and strategize to become a digital minimalist.Digital minimalists see new technologies as tools to be used to support things they deeply value—not as sources of value themselves. They don’t accept the idea that offering some small benefit is justification for allowing an attention-gobbling service into their lives, and are instead interested in applying new technology in highly selective and intentional ways that yield big wins. Just as important: they’re comfortable missing out on everything else."
241,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55262518-eugenia,1,"i think this man should simply stop writing. the book is poorly argumented, the tone is patronising, the advice is too obvious. there must be dozens of more useful and more readable books on the topic. "
242,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9735854-shmuli,5,"When coronavirus started, I quit social media. In a way it was the hardest time to quit because social isolation meant that I couldn’t connect with people in the real world and most of the interesting things in life were cancelled. I wanted any social interaction I could get.But in a way it was also the easiest time to deactivate. I had always said that I kept my social media to stay informed about events. I knew I was addicted to social media, but it seemed worth trading endless hours of scrolling, liking, and checking notifications for the real world social interactions that I also found through social media.But with coronavirus there were no more real world events, and so it was time to put my money where my mouth was.Coronavirus also made deactivating easy for other reasons. Social isolation meant that I was already putting energy into maintaining one-on-one relationships outside of social media. It also meant that I was spending a lot of time at home. So if there was ever a time to work on personal skills or read through the non-fiction on my to-read list, it was during corona. And so, thanks to corona, I got around to reading this incredible book. And I’m so happy I did. I’m hesitant to admit it, but it’s rare that I find a book that aligns so closely with my own outlook.In my experience, self-help books are split into one of two categories:Either they are values-centric - that is, they talk about the bigger picture of life, but don’t get into the practical aspect of how to implement those values.Or they are pop-therapy - they provide an accessible rehash of psychological tools and hacks for a better life, but don’t necessarily talk about the big picture of what is important.This book is a beautiful combination of both. It asks us to think about what we want from life, and by extension, our time on digital technology. And then, the book gives a toolset of how to use technology (and our time) in a way that meets those values.--In short, the book argues that small tweaks to social media habits, like blocking notifications, simply aren’t enough when technology has been deliberately designed to hijack your attention. Addiction is a strong word. If your phone was taken away for a time, you probably wouldn’t sneak out in the middle of the night for a quick fix. But you may regularly feel the urge to check your phone three times in a row while you are sitting at your desk/dinner table/work/etc and are trying to do something else. The starting point therefore needs to be that we first consider our own values and then consciously apply them to our tech use. We first need to ask what we want out of life and only then can we use technology to get us there. Otherwise, we end up falling into ‘attention traps’ set by technology companies that don’t align with what we actually want.Importantly, this approach acknowledges that tech has some genuinely useful benefits. But the book distinguishes between the digital maximalist who will adopt any technology which has a benefit (for example, a digital maximalist might buy a smart watch because there is a benefit in owning a smart watch), and the digital minimalist who acknowledges the benefit of the technology, but is willing to trade it off because it isn’t the best way of achieving their values.The book sets out three core tenets of a philosophy of ‘digital minimalism’:(1) Overuse of technology matters. The book gives the example of a farmer who chooses to work extra fields for an additional crop yield, but never stops to ask why they need the extra money in the first place. Similarly, checking twitter incessantly may give you some additional benefit, but it makes no sense in the bigger picture.(2) You need to choose how you use technology. For example, if social media is your way of advertising your business, you probably don’t need to be friends with or follow anyone else. The fact that a technology gives you some benefit is not a reason to use it without limits. (3) Intentionality is satisfying. Yes, there is a loss to cutting out your social media profile but there is also a huge benefit in putting your energies into what really fulfills you. To become a digital minimalist, the book argues that you need to take a 30 day break from technology and reconnect with what you actually value. Thirty days gives you time to get over the withdrawal symptoms and properly assess your needs without the addictive pull of technology clouding your decisions. During this time, you can make clear operating procedures of when and how you will use technology to directly support the things that you deeply value. --The second part of the book is more thematic.The first chapter argues that solitude is an important part of being human that has become a scarcity in modern times. Modern technology may create ‘solitude deprivation’ where we never spend time alone with our own undisturbed minds. To address this, the author proposes three practices: (1) Spend time each day going out without your phone, (2) take long walks, and (3) journal.The second chapter explores the neuropsychology of social media. In short, while some studies seem to show psychological benefits associated with using social media, they don’t account for the costs in missing out on real-world offline socialisation which our brains have evolved to need. And yet, we may make this trade off because, for example, a text message is quicker than a phone call or perhaps because, as above, tech companies have hijacked our social instincts. The book argues that non-interactive forms of communication (e.g. text messages, email, likes, etc) don’t count as quality 'conversation-centric communication’ and should only be used as a tool for setting up ‘real’ communication. For example, you might text to see if someone is available to go for a coffee. Although this may shrink your circle of contacts, once you discount non-real communication, you can see that it was only illusory to begin with, while what really matters will now have room to grow.The chapter suggests three practices for cultivating ‘real’ communication: (1) Don’t click the like button. Otherwise, your brain will mistakenly learn that this is a meaningful form of communication; (2) Consolidate texting into blocks, so it works like emails and you are no longer on a ‘leash’; (3) Schedule conversation ‘office-hours’ when you are available to take phone calls.The third chapter observes that cutting out social media is often difficult because it leaves a void in its wake. Accordingly, the remedy is to use leisure time consciously and intentionally. To this end, the book suggests three general goals: (1) Prioritise demanding leisure activities (e.g. building something) over passive consumption (e.g. watching television), the former being more meaningful;(2) Use skills to produce valuable things in the physical world. Humans have evolved to put effort into physical craft. Contrast the involved process of a meaningful long-term craft project with social media giving positive feedback everytime you post a picture of yourself in a cafe; (3) Seek activities that require real-world structured social interactions.Paradoxically, technology can be a useful tool for achieving some of the above, e.g. learning how to craft something. The chapter also offers practical examples on how these three goals might be achieved: (1) Fix or build something every week. Although you can pay someone to repair something for cheaper than doing it yourself, maximising efficiency is not the only goal. Try committing to this for six weeks, and see how it goes. (2) Schedule your low-quality leisure time so that it doesn’t take over your life. This also avoids having to make all sorts of ‘exceptions’ if you quit cold turkey.(3) Join something. Anything.(4) Follow leisure plans and strategize free time, just as you would do with your professional work. Make a seasonal and weekly plan. A seasonal plan covers a few months a year with objectives (learn the guitar) and habits to achieve the objective (practice on weeknights). Each week, review the seasonal plan and plan your leisure schedule for the week (- I am free Tuesday and Thursday night this week, so I will practice then). It can be good to keep a scorecard of how well you are following your plans and see if they need reviewing. This process removes some spontaneity from free time, but it may also open opportunities in your schedule. The author makes the point here that doing nothing is ‘overrated’ and usually devolves into mindless browsing anyway. I would suggest that doing nothing is important, but it can be easily included in your scheduled low-quality leisure time. The final chapter offers a series of tools to successfully “conduct surgical strikes on popular attention economy services - dropping in to extract value, and then slipping away before these attention traps set by these companies can spring shut… It’s important to approach these activities with a sense of zero-sum antagonism. You want something valuable from their networks, and they want to undermine your autonomy - to come out on the winning side of this battle requires both preparation and a ruthless commitment to avoiding explitation. Vive la resistance!” (- isn’t this just delightful?):(1) Delete social media from your phone.(2) Turn your devices into single purpose computers. For example, use tools to block social media websites on your laptop during work hours by default. Modern devices may be good for doing multiple things, but don’t do those things all at the same time.(3) Use social media intentionally and purposefully to maximise the good and cut the waste. Browsing in search of entertainment is a trap.(4) Embrace slow media: With the rise of fast-food, a movement emerged to consume good ‘slow’ food. With the rise of fast-internet and clickbait content, a movement is emerging to spend time on ‘slow’ quality media. (An alternative solution to this is the Tim Ferriss low-information diet, which eliminates information sources to free up resources for other pursuits).(5) Dumb down your smart phone. Maybe have a phone for exercising and a dumb phone you take to work.--Reading the book, I found myself enthusiastically agreeing with the author. I really enjoyed the analogy of the farmer who never stops to ask why they are still farming and the way the book acknowledges that technology does have some positive benefit, but we shouldn’t let that compromise the bigger picture. I also really appreciate the emphasis on leading intentional value-driven lives.As I reflected on my own social media use, I felt the book gave me a much-needed push to kick my digital habits and live intentionally.Admittedly, actually applying the book is challenging. The most ironic example of this is that I am now very conflicted about keeping this Goodreads account. Spending time reading books is something I want to do with my time. Spending time on social media sites about books is, let’s face it, probably not. Am I then like the farmer who farms an extra field of Goodreads, when I could spend the time on something of real value (reading books)?And it gets worse. Have I been drawn into this website by a company that has psychologically manipulated me to write book reviews? Is there sufficient benefit to my life in writing this review, let alone the whole social media aspect of this site? And while there are good uses to this website, like keeping a to-read list of books that I would otherwise forget, there are many other ways to do this that don’t hook me into a social media website.Which all makes me wonder whether I should just pick up and leave this site.Perhaps the solution lies in the optimisation part of the book; I can still use this website if I find a way to optimise my use of it. I could, for example, only use the site after every 5 books I read, instead of after each book. I could also cancel the email updates I get from Goodreads so that I am not hooked onto the social media element of it.But then, I wonder if that’s all just a cop out. If I am brutally honest about my values, I should probably just quit. And if I see deep value in discussing books with friends, would I not get more benefit by, for example, asking a friend to read a book with me, or perhaps, calling friends who I think would enjoy the book and giving them the recommendation? What do you think?--Some other reviewers have commented that the book doesn’t draw on scientific data to make its point. I didn’t feel this was an issue when reading the book, perhaps because I found myself in agreement with most of what was being said. (Though, that itself is a reason to question my own biases and see what the hard data says). I found that even where this was the case, there was still a lot of insight in the author’s perspective. In addition, the author does go into the scientific literature in detail in the second half of the book to explain the neuroscience behind social media. Even where the author draws on his own experience, I think it still has value, given that the author is relying on, for example, data gathered from the more than 1600 people who signed up for his month-long digital declutter challenge. While this may not have been conducted as a scientific study, it is not an insignificant data sample. That said, I do agree that hard evidence would further enhance the arguments being made. I also found that at times I questioned whether the author started with the conclusion and then looked for evidence to support it. Nonetheless, overall, I still wholeheartedly recommend this book.Other reviewers seem to take issue that this book is a rehash of previous books by the same author. I can’t comment on this as this is the first book I have read by Cal Newport."
243,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56535709-gianluca,3,"Digital Minimalism: ""A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else.""This is not Newport's greatest book—the content is sparse and the execution is underwhelming—but it's one of his more important ones. The concepts and behaviours underpinning the digital minimalism movement are truly valuable. This book is absolutely worth reading if you find yourself feeling short of time or constantly distracted. Newport starts by providing context to the issue—""people don’t succumb to screens because they’re lazy, but instead because billions of dollars have been invested to make this outcome inevitable""—and then outlines his recommendations for drilling down to only the essentials, based on feedback from his many readers. His approach is to first perform a Digital Decluttering, in which one defines strict rules (e.g. no social media outside of a 10-minute window) and embarks on a 30-day break from the deluge, after which one gradually introduces the most valuable tools one at a time. I found this exercise is extremely valuable.Newport also describes how the 30-day break is a good opportunity to develop high-value leisure practices that will continue afterwards: ""If you begin decluttering the low-value digital distractions from your life before you’ve convincingly filled in the void they were helping you ignore, the experience will be unnecessarily unpleasant at best and a massive failure at worse.""To help select leisure activities, he suggests The Bennett Principles: 1. Prioritize demanding activity over passive consumption;2. Use skills to produce valuable things in the physical world; and3. Seek activities that require real-world, structured social interactions.The remainder of the book feels a lot more like filler, but looks at:1. The impact of constant ""connection"" vs. meaningful ""conversation.""2. Solitude Deprivation: A state in which you spend close to zero time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from other minds. 3. Using long walks (without phone) to clear and revitalise the mind.4. Not clicking ""Like"" and other ways to make social media less addicting.5. How to join the ""Attention Resistance"" by deleting social media from your phone, turning your devices into single-purpose computers, using social media like a professional, embracing slow media, and dumbing down your smartphone.There are numerous anecdotes, bits of research, and useful lifehacks in the book. Some of my favourites are:""The urge to check Twitter or refresh Reddit becomes a nervous twitch that shatters uninterrupted time into shards too small to support the presence necessary for an intentional life.""""On one extreme, there are the Neo-Luddites, who advocate the abandonment of most new technologies. On another extreme, you have the Quantified Self enthusiasts, who carefully integrate digital devices into all aspects of their life with the goal of optimizing their existence. Of the different philosophies I studied, however, there was one in particular that stood out as a superior answer for those looking to thrive in our current moment of technological overload. I call it digital minimalism, and it applies the belief that less can be more to our relationship with digital tools.""""Scientists have known since Michael Zeiler’s famous pecking pigeon experiments from the 1970s that rewards delivered unpredictably are far more enticing than those delivered with a known pattern. Something about unpredictability releases more dopamine—a key neurotransmitter for regulating our sense of craving.""""the notification symbol for Facebook was originally blue, to match the palette of the rest of the site, “but no one used it.” So they changed the color to red—an alarm color—and clicking skyrocketed.""""Another optimization that was common among the digital minimalists I studied was to remove social media apps from their phones. Because they can still access these sites through their computer browsers, they don’t lose any of the high-value benefits that keep them signed up for these services. By removing the apps from their phones, however, they eliminated their ability to browse their accounts as a knee-jerk response to boredom. The result is that these minimalists dramatically reduced the amount of time they spend engaging with these services each week, while barely diminishing the value they provide to their lives—a much better personal technology process than thoughtlessly tapping and swiping these apps throughout the day as the whim strikes.""""The Amish prioritize the benefits generated by acting intentionally about technology over the benefits lost from the technologies they decide not to use. Their gamble is that intention trumps convenience—and this is a bet that seems to be paying off. The Amish have remained a relatively stable presence in America for over two hundred years of rapid modernity and cultural upheavals.""""The Digital Declutter Process Put aside a thirty-day period during which you will take a break from optional technologies in your life. During this thirty-day break, explore and rediscover activities and behaviors that you find satisfying and meaningful. At the end of the break, reintroduce optional technologies into your life, starting from a blank slate. For each technology you reintroduce, determine what value it serves in your life and how specifically you will use it so as to maximize this value.""""I also noticed a lot of creativity surrounding how people throttled back streaming media in contexts where they didn’t want to eliminate it altogether. A college freshman named Ramel abstained from streaming media except when doing so with other people, explaining: “I did not want to isolate myself in social situations where entertainment was playing.” A professor named Nathaniel, on the other hand, didn’t mind high-quality entertainment in his life but worried about binge-watching, so he adopted a clever restriction: “no more than two episodes of any series per week.”""""My first indication that this hyper-connected generation was suffering came a few years before I started writing this book. I was chatting with the head of mental health services at a well-known university where I had been invited to speak. This administrator told me that she had begun seeing major shifts in student mental health. Until recently, the mental health center on campus had seen the same mix of teenage issues that have been common for decades: homesickness, eating disorders, some depression, and the occasional case of OCD. Then everything changed. Seemingly overnight the number of students seeking mental health counseling massively expanded, and the standard mix of teenage issues was dominated by something that used to be relatively rare: anxiety.""""in 90 percent of your daily life, the presence of a cell phone either doesn’t matter or makes things only slightly more convenient. They’re useful, but it’s hyperbolic to believe its ubiquitous presence is vital.""""abandon the belief that not having your phone is a crisis. As I argued above, this belief is new and largely invented, but it can still take some practice before you fully accept its truth. If you’re struggling at first, a useful compromise is to bring your phone where you’re going, but then leave it in your car’s glove compartment. This way, if there’s an emergency that requires connection, you can always go retrieve your device, but it’s not right there with you where it can destroy solitude at a moment’s notice. If you’re not driving but out with someone else, it can work just as well to have them hold your phone for you (assuming you can convince them to do so)—as before, you have emergency access, but not easy access.""""After crunching the numbers, the researchers found that the more someone used social media, the more likely they were to be lonely. Indeed, someone in the highest quartile of social media use was three times more likely to be lonelier than someone in the lowest quartile. These results held up even after the researchers controlled for factors such as age, gender, relationship status, household income, and education. Primack admitted to NPR that he was surprised by the results: “It’s social media, so aren’t people supposed to be socially connected?” But the data was clear. The more time you spend “connecting” on these services, the more isolated you’re likely to become... if you increase the amount of likes or links clicked by a standard deviation, mental health decreases by 5 to 8 percent of a standard deviation. These negative connections still held when, like in the Primack study, they controlled for relevant demographic variables.""""The philosophy of conversation-centric communication takes a harder stance. It argues that conversation is the only form of interaction that in some sense counts toward maintaining a relationship. This conversation can take the form of a face-to-face meeting, or it can be a video chat or a phone call—so long as it matches Sherry Turkle’s criteria of involving nuanced analog cues, such as the tone of your voice or facial expressions. Anything textual or non-interactive—basically, all social media, email, text, and instant messaging—doesn’t count as conversation and should instead be categorized as mere connection. In this philosophy, connection is downgraded to a logistical role. This form of interaction now has two goals: to help set up and arrange conversation, or to efficiently transfer practical information (e.g., a meeting location or time for an upcoming event). Connection is no longer an alternative to conversation; it’s instead its supporter.""""Don’t click “Like.” Ever. And while you’re at it, stop leaving comments on social media posts as well. No “so cute!” or “so cool!” Remain silent. The reason I’m suggesting such a hard stance against these seemingly innocuous interactions is that they teach your mind that connection is a reasonable alternative to conversation. The motivating premise behind my conversation-centric communication philosophy is that once you accept this equality, despite your good intentions, the role of low-value interactions will inevitably expand until it begins to push out the high-value socializing that actually matters. If you eliminate these trivial interactions cold turkey, you send your mind a clear message: conversation is what counts—don’t be distracted from this reality by the shiny stuff on your screen.""""a technology executive in Silicon Valley who innovated a novel strategy for supporting high-quality interaction with friends and family: he tells them that he’s always available to talk on the phone at 5:30 p.m. on weekdays. There’s no need to schedule a conversation or let him know when you plan to call—just dial him up. As it turns out, 5:30 is when he begins his traffic-clogged commute home in the Bay Area.""""the value you receive from a pursuit is often proportional to the energy invested. We might tell ourselves there’s no greater reward after a hard day at the office than to have an evening entirely devoid of plans or commitments. But we then find ourselves, several hours of idle watching and screen tapping later, somehow more fatigued than when we began. As Bennett would tell you—and Pete, Liz, and Teddy would confirm—if you instead rouse the motivation to spend that same time actually doing something—even if it’s hard—you’ll likely end the night feeling better.""""In 1727, Franklin created a social club called the Junto, which he describes as follows in his autobiography: I had form’d most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of mutual improvement, which we called the Junto; we met on Friday evenings. The rules that I drew up required that every member, in his turn, should produce one or more queries on any point of Morals, Politics, or Natural Philosophy, to be discuss’d by the company; and once in three months produce and read an essay of his own writing, on any subject he pleased.""""a nontrivial percentage of people who deleted the apps discovered that they essentially stopped using social media altogether. Even the small extra barrier of needing to log in to a computer was enough to prevent them from making the effort—revealing, often to their admitted surprise, that services they claimed were indispensable were in reality providing nothing more than convenient hits of distraction.""""It’s a general rule of slow movements that a small amount of high-quality offerings is usually superior to a larger amount of low-quality fare."""

247,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2617038-julie-bestry,3,"UGH. I'm inclined to give this 2 stars, and if I could give it 2 1/2 I would. I generally save ratings belong 3 stars for books with book grammar and inferior editing. But this book, despite the author's acclaim (or perhaps, because of it, and he chose not to give his full measure of effort), this book was very disappointing. Newport isn't a jerk; he just fails to recognize how rarified the air is that he breathes.First, the positive. Although I often find that those who push for minimalism are going overboard, Newport carefully avoids the idea that people must be Luddites and throw their phones into the river. And the first half of the book delivers some decently researched material to set the foundations for the book. He talks about the development of apps and the iPhone and how we could not necessarily have anticipated how quickly we would become addicted to the dopamine hits of novelty that having the internet in our pockets has wrought. He notes how we, the consumers, have become the consumed, how (just as with traditional media), our eyeballs are sold to the highest advertising bidder, and the longer we are using our devices, the bigger benefit to the creators of the apps and the technology. So far, so good. There's nothing novel in his research, nothing you won't have read in dozens or hundreds of blogs in the past decade. But it's fine.I'm even good with his early practical advice: define your personal rules for using technology (when/where), give yourself limits that work for you, remove some apps, try a 30-day break, slowly reintroduce technology. This is all reasonable, if not particularly inventive. And his suggestions at the end of the book on how to use social media the way social media professionals do (with different types of technology creating convenient limits to keep us from going down rabbit holes) are smart and workable. Had the book been one-half on the psychological, sociological, and commercial issues and one-half practical suggestions, it would have been a far more appealing book.I fault the book in two ways, however. First, I felt like I was reading a term paper rather than a book. He takes the research of others and fails to examine it in any depth and delivers everything other researchers have supplied (for good or ill) as if he were paraphrasing a journal abstract; even his look at Thoreau lacks any deeper understanding of the fact that the only way Thoreau could remove himself from the world in the way that he did was because his mother and sister did everything for him -- shopping, cooking, laundry -- so that he could potter around and think. I've rarely read a reference to Thoreau in the past decade that didn't give a tip of the hat to that realization that it was the labor of others (generally women) who allowed him to have his leisure, and thus his intellectual productivity. And that's important because much of the technology we embrace ALSO, like Thoreau's wife and sister, can take care of that labor -- the mapping, the banking, the reminding, the acquiring of information.And this leads to the second fault of the book, or really, of Newport, and it is endemic of many (most?) of the men who write about productivity. He seems to envision everyone who needs to embrace digital minimalism as looking pretty much exactly like Cal Newport: white collar, able-bodied workers with nary a whiff of anxiety (social or otherwise), depression, ADD/ADHD, or social needs that can't be met in Newport's narrowly defined way. He seems to envision everyone as either a digital minimalist or knuckle-dragging Facebook addict. (His only acknowledgment of depression relates to that which he sees as caused by social media; it's a valid point, but a narrowly derived one.)Indeed, he seems to feel that anyone using social media or other digital tools more than he thinks they ought (rather than more than THEY think they ought) is using them too much. He feels strongly that users consider the possibility of convenience rather than the actual utility of an item, and throws out suggestions as though we are small children who have never considered options. No, I would not rather try to read a map in the dark while driving when my phone's GPS can safely navigate to get me there. No, my friends would not prefer to replace their smart phones with flips phones and prick their fingers and test their blood glucose 10 times a day when they could be using a continuous glucose monitor linked to an app on their phones. No, I would not like to wait until tomorrow to call to find out the hours of a restaurant or government building when I can find out now and plan my day.His book is full of judgments. Let's start with the chapter on leisure. He feels it's key to creating a life of digital minimalism to identify and embrace things that are better/more important than spending time on one's phone so that pulling back from the digital life will be easier. OK, fair enough. It's easier to let go of something you'd like to do less of if you can identify things that you value more highly.But Newport's narrow definition is that leisure must (with the exception reading and occasional forays into attending ""cultural events"") require physicality -- traipsing through the forest, woodworking and metalworking, changing one's oil, and constructing things (he does allow for knitting). There's not a single acknowledgment that there are people who lack the ability or strength to walk, or lift, or use their hands. Indeed, one of his essential practice lists is subtitled ""fix or build something every week."" Amusingly, ""figuring out how to precisely calibrate the tone arm on your turntable"" is one of his suggestions. I guess listening to music digitally is also out in Newport's world view. Similarly, it seems there are no people who labor for a living in Newport's imagination, as he requires that one's downtime should be fairly strictly scheduled. He writes, ""Doing nothing is overrated."" and warns that ""...after a particularly trying morning of childcare, it's temping to crave the release of having nothing to do"" and he admonishes that free time will be filled with ""low-quality activities"" that yield ""muted rewards."" Watching favorite shows? Bad. Interacting w/friends online? Defacto ""mindless."" You must craft physical ""objectives"" for your leisure time, he says.Newport repeatedly uses the phrasing ""high-quality leisure,"" taking his cue from Aristotle's remarks on the same subject. But Aristotle was also his era's equivalent of a privileged white-collar (if togas had collars) dude and he could not have imagined a world in which our choices of television programming ranged from Keeping Up With the Kardashians at one end to PBS and BBC, documentaries, international films, and drama superior to what might be found in a millennium of stage performances. Who is Newport to define the depth and height of quality of leisure merely by assuming he has the right to be the arbiter? He also doesn't consider that there are people who work at physical labor all day, people with jobs that exhaust them and ravage their bodies, for whom leisure may very well be playing a game online, talking to friends via text, or catching up on the news from their own preferred sources. Similarly, in a chapter where he invokes Sherry Turkle's delineation between connection and communication, he goes full-throttle into the notion that communication online isn't REAL communication. (Turkle does talk about ""low-bandwidtch interactions"" but Newport, who doesn't use (and has apparently never used) any social media platform assumes that all online communication is low-bandwidth. He leaves no room for the robust relationships that are built across geographic and other boundaries. He leaves no room for professional or personal communication outside the realm of the physical, relationships that amplify quality of life.Apparently, unless people are speaking and hearing one another's voices, it can only be a much weaker connection. So, Newport doesn't consider how the deaf community might take such a pronouncement. (Again, ableist.) He takes Turkle's good, if flawed and narrow research, and narrows the parameters further. He doesn't consider that there are people with social anxiety who can communicate online but would never be able to chat with strangers (or even friends) on the phone or in person. Newport ignores the fact that certain populations (let's say LGBTQ teens) are often in geographic communities where they have no emotional support, and digital/online communities literally save their lives. He ignores how the elderly, who are often sidelined due to geographic and physical limitations, are now delighting in reconnecting with friends, old and new, via the internet and apps. Newport's assumption, lifting up one media appearance by Turkle as though her word were gospel, is that true conversation cannot exist digitally. Nobody would doubt that some people use online communication as hit-and-run connection, but Newport never takes even a line of text to allude to the fact that his take isn't the only take.I have at least one friend in the productivity field who thinks Newport is a genius. But Digital Minimalism is no Deep Work. It belies Newport's narrowly constrained world view, and it is ableist, classist, and Newport is unaware of how his gentle, nice-guy approach is dripping with arrogance and unacknowledged privilege. And honestly, the book's just not that well-written.[Note: I'd feared I'd put too much emphasis on some of these issues but found widespread complaints in the disability community about this book. I'm sure members of that group can do a much better job providing their take on this issue.]"

Regardless, this is when the Kindle version became available during the library queue, so here I am.This is an incredibly useful book for anyone even remotely worried about their smart phone and social media habits. Newport lays it all out for readers in a succinct, practical, and convincing way: how apps are DESIGNED to keep you scrolling, how your brain is deteriorating, how meaningful leisure is a better use of time. Practical and NOT anti-technology, I wish a lot of people would read this book. Highly recommended."

I like to think that social media has never been a big problem for me. First, I was born in 78, so for the longest time my iPhone has just been an “iPod that makes phone calls.” I was an early adopter for most of the “web 2.0” stuff, I remember FriendFeed, last.fm, I created a Facebook account as soon as they opened it up to the general public, but I soon became disappointed in how it encourages shallow interactions. I log on FB maybe once or twice a week because my family sends me messages sometimes through Messenger, but I’m getting to a point were I absolutely get no value from it. Instagram and Twitter however I do get some value from it. On Instagram I follow a lot of fantastic and interesting photographers and I can easily get lost infinitely scrolling double tapping like. I need to work on this. Twitter took a while for me to get into, but I have curated a list of people I follow that brings me joy every time.Anyway, with all this said, you should read this book no matter we’re in the spectrum your at in terms on how you are using technology, specially smartphones and social media. We need to take a hard look at this shit and start asking ourselves if this is the best use of our time. Is it making our lives better? That’s the key question. "

I'm one of Cal's ""self-selectors"" -- don't use a smart phone, leave my dumb phone at home, don't have a TV etc. I've read Zuboff's lengthy tome on the exploitation of digital exhaust (great work) and, tutored by reddit, have cobbed up a strong privacy guard against corporate surveillance -- but still, major pieces of the puzzle seemed to be missing. So much in this book is of value, as I see especially in hindsight while discussing it with my partner -- from alternative ways of evaluating the benefits of new technology, to the skill of consolidation, to curating and optimizing media you do go ahead and use (we do this, but lacked sharpness in the concept). The dips into brain function, such as the default circuit, and the illustrations of the depth of the analog mind, as he shows in a simple children's game and many other examples -- and especially the attention paid to clarifying low-bit interactions -- turn out to be tremendously useful as a frame going forward to evaluate what might be covertly flattening our relationships to each other, and even our consciousness. Which is a tricky piece of business indeed since that's what we look out at the world through, often unaware of forces that shape it. And in fact, we're continually conditioned to think of our mind as a poor, slow, inefficient computation device, instead of a vastly richer and more nuanced analog device, with even some of the smartest and most sincere young reformers taking this unfortunate view. The unusual defense of solitude is also appreciated. Many thanks to the author."

After finishing the book, I am definitely inspired to do a digital detox next month. Even though I have already stepped down from using Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Snapchat, Twitter etc a lot, I still use my phone and laptop quite a lot each day.However, only ⅓ of the book is dedicated to the digital detox plan, and the rest of the book is filled more with background information and anecdotes. In my opinion, this background information was not thorough enough, and although the anecdotes were interesting, they did not necessarily add much. For example, Cal writes a lot about how social media wants to grab your attention to sell it, but unfortunately not about how social media companies can use your data to sell as well. I would have loved to read a bit more about that aspect too! Overall, I think the book has an important message, and the digital detox does sound like a good challenge, but I do think there was a bit too much fluff."

Some practices he offers that he didn’t even think of include scheduling time for low-quality leisure activities (like scrolling and streaming) and staying away from it the rest of the day, consolidating articles and sources of information to save and read at a predetermined time, or laying out a “leisure plan”. A book I want to own so I can take time to apply the practices and develop a personal philosophy of digital minimalism. Newport makes good points that are hard to argue with, even as much as I want to. "

Anyway, the whole idea was good, but I believe it was written for the audiences who are much more drown in social media and digital world (comparing to me) [there is also a huge chance that I false classify myself!] The whole idea was:- social media, binge watching and crazy access to internet and phone is bad so lets do something about it. - things you can start with (if you are highly addicted):  1- Delete the social media apps from your phone, and you'll see you use them less.  2- Dedicate some specific time in a day to kill your time in the internet. 3- Add some rule to your netflix and other streaming habits (ex just watch that with friends and in group) 4- Learn to do some hobby that is not related to internet, and write an action plan for that.  5 - There are some apps and websites that you can use to ban you from using some websites in some times (ex. not letting yourself to use facebook in the morning, or weekends)  6- Dumb phone movement is good!  7- Look at Amish people for instance! They are good in some ways! I have already did item#1. Also item #3 is not my case since I don't use subscription streaming services. I found item 4 interesting and I believe #6 is against my non-digital minimalism since I use my phone to read (kindle, new yorker and ...) Anyway the good part is I am a little bit more aware about my digital habits, Although I guess you don't need to read 300 pages to get to this point. Also I don't know who has this argument about social media that ""you don't know maybe something good is there"". The author tries to answer this argument in several parts of the book! "
265,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56943009-joshua-r-taylor,3,"A very interesting book, very contemporary in its subject matter, but with its flaws.Cal Newport sets forth here a 'philosophy of technology use'. When I first read this phrase, it was met with a raised left-eyebrow. Why does something as banal and pedestrian as technology use require a 'philosophy'? Could it really be that complicated?It turns out that it can. As screen-time is taking up an ever-increasing portion of our waking lives, it makes sense to evaluate it. An attempt to do so is the following dialogue:Do I really find the hours spent on my phone and laptop meaningful during leisure time? Most of the time, not especially. Scrolling through Facebook is a pretty passive thing to do, and it doesn't make me happy. Watching Netflix doesn't require much out of me, but it feels like a waste of time.Ahh, but do these devices provide an indispensable utility? Why yes they do! I couldn't stay in contact with my family with FaceTime, and I need to check my emails.So shouldn't I spend time on technology only when it's making use of this utility?Yes, it makes sense not to waste time. Now I can take up my suppressed hobby of lumber jacking.---Hmm I'm not sure what happened at the end there, but that was my take of the philosophy Cal presented in this book, the 'title philosophy' if you will, called 'Digital Minimalism'.Around this he also spends time explaining why we've gotten into the habits of scrolling passively through Facebook and fiddling with our phones repeatedly. Explaining how the 'attention economy' of new tech companies such as Facebook and Google don't optimize for user satisfaction but instead for total time engaged with their products. This time doesn't have to be useful, satisfying, or have any positive impact on the user. In fact it could even induce mental illness, but to a product manager at Facebook if the 'user engagement' metrics go up then whatever they're doing must be correct! It is a clear conflict of interest between Facebook as a business and its users. This can be seen most readily in how addicted people seem to have become in passively engaging with Facebook, precisely because it was designed in that way.After a description of the philosophy, the second section of the book provides many 'suggested practices' for implementing this philosophy in your life. To give you a flavour, the chapter titles for this section are 'Spend time alone', 'Don't click ""Like""', 'Reclaim Leisure' and 'Join the Attention Resistance'. For me this is where the book began to degrade from an interesting train of philosophical thought into the usual self-help spiel. Sentiments like 'maybe you'll find that team sports are more satisfying than going to the gym' started to creep in and felt obvious to the point of ridicule.However I do commend this section for providing concrete practices at the end of each chapter, i.e. some non-vague way through which you can start pushing your life in the direction of the chapter's suggestions. These are quite useful pointers. Again some are extremely obvious, but here I think it's worth stating the obvious because it can help validate some actions which your peers may find strange.For example when I mentioned the practice 'Leave your Phone at Home' (on occasion) to some close friends, the reactions were quite shocked. Some thought that I was going through some emotional toughness. Others found it an offensive move by myself to disconnect from the community. If I had come up with this practice on my own, I feel like it would be much more difficult to justify continuing it with these reactions. Having it written in a book which appears on face value to be well-researched definitely makes it feel less like I'm rocking the boat.So in summary, interesting but sometimes ridiculous. Will definitely be implementing some ideas from the philosophy in my life and will enjoy chatting about it with friends. I'll likely revisit this at a later stage to memorise some of the 'practices'."

This book provides some useful methods on how to review the time you spend with technology to either cut out services or better manage the relationship you have with them, depending on how essential they are. I do wonder if most people who pick up this book are like me and have already taken steps before to curb their use of technology whereas the severely addicted who can't sit through a movie or a dinner without going through their phone would never give material like this the time of day. Cal has never been one to sign up for social media but luckily he had quite a lot of his readers volunteer to attempt his 30 day detox where they cut out (or at least cut back on) optional technology. Reading their experiences makes it more relatable than reading an entire book on digital minimalism written by someone who has never struggled with it.I've already deleted almost all social media, the latest and hardest being Reddit but the biggest mental hurdle for me attempting this 30 day detox is YouTube. I really feel like an addict as I can't even begin to fathom how I wouldn't watch YouTube for a week, let alone 30 days. Luckily this book offers advice on how to plan for the detox as well as how to fill that newly opened time - with a lot of examples that did not appeal to me at all but your mileage may vary.My favorite part of the book that resonated with me the most was on solitude, and how many of us have become deprived of it. The shocking realization I had was that I'm already someone who keeps to myself a lot and spends quite a lot of time alone yet something I barely practice is true solitude. Always listening to podcasts, YouTube, reading other's comments and articles on the internet doesn't leave my mind much of time for reflection. Before the iPod I went on walks and did chores without having to listen to something.3/5This book will make you more mindful of when you're picking up your phone to reflexively open an app. Why am I doing this? How much time is this taking from my life? How much am I benefitting from using this? It will remind you that Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. are all competing to rob you of your time and make money off your attention. At times the book's order was counterintuitive and confusing, some quotes or anecdotes from historical or literary figures could be pretentious, but altogether this book gave me more tools to ensure my relationship with technology is healthier.Now here's some lyrics from Open Mike Eagle's ""Check to Check"" because this song is a BOP but when I'm only reading the lyrics it makes me extremely anxiousLiving from check to check, I keep checkingIncoming call, directly reject itIf you want to talk, suggest you leave messageI check, check, check like every three secondsI'm recording right now and I'm checking between takesEvery notification that my phone machine makesI put it down whenever, but it's never a clean breakI should get a heavy phone and pretend it's a free weightI'm checking at red lights like school nurse check for head liceLike sound men check for dead micsJust like I'm merging, checking the left laneI'm trying to get home so I can check if my check came"

As one of billions raised in the high tech era, I've willfully accepted what the ""attention economy"" has subliminally offered me over the last decade and a half, slowly divulging my most private thoughts and information whilst gradually surrendering the quiet spaces of my mind to invasive technologies, whose present form I would have never accepted if offered to me when I first signed on years ago. I wouldn't have wanted to become so addicted to social media, yet here I stand with the rest, numbly refreshing my feeds looking for another dopamine hit of likes or content. My blind submission is part of the problem, and it's time to fight back.I love the way the author presents and explores the problem. His goal is not to encourage luddism nor condemn social media or modern communication technologies outright. His aim is instead a pragmatic one. As autonomous human beings with established value systems, we must seriously consider the pros and cons of each new form of technology we adopt instead of wholesale buying into its functions and promised benefits. An excellent example he provides is that of the Amish who, despite misinformed stereotypes, are not ignorant luddites, but strategic technology adopters. The Amish test and meticulously consider each new technology and how it might fit into their system of beliefs and values before deciding to use it in their communities. Their example provides a template for the rest of us in an increasingly distracting age as we wrestle with the adoption of new technologies and the constant mutation of existing ones.There is a lot of practical wisdom contained within this book that I did not expect. The chapter on healthy, strategic leisure was one I particularly enjoyed, as well as that on the importance of solitude and silence. I would contend that the author did not consider the full socioeconomic spectrum of his audience, for whom certain forms or durations of leisure might not be feasible, yet the principle is appreciated nonetheless. Good rest requires intentionality, and thus ""vegging"" in front of a TV or phone screen is, through its passive norm, the opposite of leisure, but mind-numbing detachment.The emphasis on conversation over connection was also appreciated. Without going into too much detail, the author pointed out some of the problems social media has generated in our culture, particularly in regards to the growing political divide and inability of diverse parties to converse reasonably. The tendency of humans towards confirmation bias, and the incentive of news media conglomerates to market towards their own base, has undoubtedly exacerbated what was once a minor issue resolved through face-to-face human interaction. The main exhortation of the book is towards Newport's own brand of ""digital minimalism"", which is essentially a limited usage of technology as determined by one's own needs for it balanced with his individual beliefs, values and responsibilities. Technology should never be ""invasive"", rather we should use it for our ends. He encourages limiting notifications and usage times of devices, particularly of mobile phones, of which he is extremely critical. In fact, the greater part of a chapter is dedicated to explaining how the Apple iPhone was the perfect tool in the hands of voracious media moguls' whose profit-driven aim for ubiquitous advertisement turned them into vacuums of our time and attention.I am grateful for the clarity of purpose and structure that comprise this book. It is likely one of the most necessary reads for anyone struggling to regain free time, clarity of thought and freedom from distraction in this ever-connected, ever-complicated world. It is also an encouraging reminder that we can, and we must, regain our ""humanity."" We are, after all, social animals. We need real conversation. We mustn't settle for mere connection."

I've read a few of his books, a majority of his blog posts, and am subscribed to his email list. His thinking has really influenced me.After finishing Digital Minimalism, I don't necessarily feel like I've learned all that much. Most of the ideas in the book feel like things I already was aware of. Part of this is because I follow Cal Newport, but part of it is just because I read Hacker News and keep up with the tech world.Here are the ideas that I think people who read Hacker News and keep up with the tech world already know:- Digital things are addictive and bad for you.- Tech empires spend billions to get and keep you addicted because it's their business model (the attention economy).- The techniques that tech empires use to get you addicted are built on deep evolutionary drives.- Saying something like ""I'm just going to stop using Facebook so much"" usually doesn't work. It takes more than willpower. It takes aggressive changes to your life.And here are the ideas that I probably was only aware of because I follow Cal closely:- The Digital Declutter is a cool way of getting rid of your bad screen time habits (I was one of the participants in the original experiment).- Solitude is something that is really important, and something that most of us are severely lacking in todays world.- It is important to find fulfilling hobbies before you start reducing the time you spend staring at screens.However, despite the fact that I don't feel like I've learned all that much, this was still one of my favorite books. It provided some really cool new examples that I hadn't heard before, it solidified things for me, and it inspired me. So even if you feel like you already know what this book is going to say, I'd still recommend reading it. And if you aren't familiar with the sort of stuff this book talks about, then I'd definitely recommend Digital Minimalism. I can't think of a better starting point."

It wasn't necessarily a better life back then, but it was different -- I had to make more conscious decisions about my free time, I had more awareness of how I'm spending my time. But increasingly, I feel like I'm trapped in a state of passive life experience where time passes faster than light. Checking my emails and notifications have become a habit. I become more impulsive as I give way to my need to be connected, to be up-to-date with the current events -- to feel included. I feel like I have become addicted. Social media and ad-driven online services are not addictive by chance. These platforms are engineered to maximize the likelihoods of you revisiting them and spending as much time on them as possible. The central philosophy of this book is to approach technology with a mindful, active state of mind. Do not open Instagram just because you are bored. If you adopt this philosophy, you quickly realize that you do not need most of the technology you use. It is the digital minimalism. And the result? Among many benefits, you become more mindful of the valuable seconds of your life.

I appreciate that Digital Minimalism approached technology philosophically, asking important questions about WHY we use certain software or services in the first place and HOW we can use them to align with our values. Newport makes important distinctions between digital minimalism as a long-term method of intentional technology use, rather than a short-term detox. There are plenty of practical, in-depth suggestions for accomplishing this, several of which I've adopted and will never go back from. Newport draws attention to the many problems of the attention economy, and he wraps the whole thing up with some surprisingly beautiful thoughts on the human need for true connection.The issues of privilege that I noted in Deep Work (namely, that women with children or single parents are typically unable to dive into uninterrupted work the way Newport suggests) weren't present in this book, which was a pleasant surprise. Newport was careful to note suggestions for people who have to use social media for work or who require a smartphone because they need Google Maps, drive for Uber, etc. I expected this one to be mildly interesting and ended up being completely blown away by it.

285,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/548936-suebee,5,"Digital Minimalism by Cal NewportRead August 2019Every American adult (and teenager with autonomy regarding screens!) needs to read this book. Newport speaks to more than just how to adjust your life to use less tech. It’s about choosing and purposely pursuing a life of quality connections, hobbies, rest, and interests. Quotes that are meaningful to me:P. 24As argued, our current unease with new technologies is not really about whether or not they’re useful. It’s instead about autonomy. We signed up for these services and bought these devices for minor reasons - to look up friends’ relationship statuses or eliminate the need to carry a separate iPod and phone - and then found ourselves, years later, increasingly dominated by their influence, allowing them to control more and more of how we spend our time, how we feel, and how we behave. The fact that our humanity was routed by these tools over the past decade should come as no surprise. As I just detailed, we’ve been engaging in a lopsided arms race in which the technologies encroaching on our autonomy were preying with increasing precision on deep-seated vulnerabilities in our brains, while we still naively believed that we were just fiddling with fun gifts handed down from the nerd gods. When Bill Maher joked that the App Store was coming for our souls, he was actually onto something. As Socrates explained to Phaedrus in Platos’ famous chariot metaphor, our soul can be understood as a chariot driver struggling to rein two horses, one representing our better nature and the other our baser impulses. When we increasingly cede autonomy to the digital, we energize the latter horse and make the chariot driver’s struggle to steer increasingly difficult - a diminishing of our soul’s authority.P.104 - part of the chapter “Spend Time Alone” / Solitude DeprivationPrioritization of communication over reflection becomes a source of serious concern. For one thing, when you avoid solitude, you miss out on the positive things it brings you: the ability to clarify hard problems, to regulate your emotions, to build moral courage, and to strengthen relationships. If you suffer from chronic solitude deprivation, therefore, the quality of your life degrades. Eliminating solitude also introduces new negative repercussions that we’re only now beginning to understand. A good way to investigate a behavior’s effect is to study a population that pushes the behavior to an extreme. When it comes to constant connectivity, these extremes are readily apparent among young people born after 1995 - the first group to enter their preteen years with access to smartphones, tablets, and persistent internet connectivity. As most parents or educators of this generation will attest, their device use is constant. (The term constant is not hyperbole: a 2015 study by Common Sense Media found that teenagers were consuming media - including text messaging and social networks - nine hours per day on average.) This group, therefore, can play the role of a cognitive canary in the coal mine. If persistent solitude deprivation causes problems, we should see them show up here first. And this is exactly what we find.My first indication that this hyper-connected generation was suffering came a few years before I started writing this book. I was chatting with the head of mental health services at a well-known university where I had been invited to speak. This administrator told me that she had begun seeing major shifts in student mental health. Until recently, the mental health center on campus had seen the same mix of teenage issues that have been common for decades: homesickness, eating disorders, some depression, and the occasional case of OCD. Then everything changed. Seemingly overnight the number of students seeking mental health counseling massively expanded, and the standard mix of teenage issues was dominated by something that used to be relatively rare: anxiety. She told me that everyone seemed to suddenly be suffering from anxiety or anxiety-related disorders. When I asked her what she thought caused the change, she answered without hesitation that it probably had something to do with smartphones. The sudden rise in anxiety-related problems coincided with the first incoming classes of students that were raised on smartphones and social media. She noticed that these new students were constantly and frantically processing and sending messages. It seemed clear that the persistent communication was somehow messing with the students’ brain chemistry. A few years later, this administrator’s hunch was validated by San Diego State University psychology professor Jean Twenge, who is one of the world’s most foremost experts on generational differences in American youth. As Twenge notes in a September 2017 article for the Atlantic, she has been studying these trends for over 25 years, and they almost always appear and grow gradually. But starting around 2012, she noticed a shift in measurements of teenager emotional states that was anything but gradual:[Twenge quote:] The gentle slopes of the line graphs charting how behavioral traits change with birth year became steep mountains and sheer cliffs, and many of the distinctive characteristics of the Millennial generation began to disappear. In all my analyses of generational data - some reaching back to the 1930s - I had never seen anything like it. [end quote]Young people born between 1995 and 2012, a group Twenge calls “iGen,” exhibited remarkable differences as compared to the Millennials that preceded them. One of the biggest and most troubling changes was iGen’s psychological health. “Rates of teen depression and suicide have skyrocketed,” Twenge writes, with much of this seemingly due to a massive increase in anxiety disorders. “It’s not an exaggeration to describe iGen as being on the brink of the worst mental-health crisis in decades.”What instigated these changes? Twenge agrees with the intuition of the university mental health administrator when she notes that these shifts in mental health correspond “exactly” to the moment when American smartphone ownership became ubiquitous. The defining trait of IGen, she explains, is that they grew up with smartphones and social media, and don’t remember a time before constant access to the internet. They’re paying a price for this distinction with their mental health. “Much of this deterioration can be traced to their phones,” Twenge concludes. When journalist Benoit Denizet-Lewis investigated this teen anxiety epidemic in The New York Times Magazine, he also discovered that the smartphone kept emerging as a persistent signal among the noise of plausible hypotheses. “Anxious kids certainly existed before Instagram,” he writes, but many of the parents I spoke to worried that their kids’ digital habits—round-the clock responding to texts, posting to social media, obsessively following the filtered exploits of peers—were partly to blame for their children’s struggles.Denizet-Lewis assumed that the teenagers themselves would dismiss this theory as standard parental grumbling, but this is not what happened. “To my surprise, anxious teenagers tended to agree.” A college student he interviewed at a residential anxiety treatment center put it well: “Social media is a tool, but it’s become this thing that we can’t live without that’s making us crazy.”As part of his reporting, Denizet-Lewis interviewed Jean Twenge, who made it clear that she didn’t set out to implicate the smartphone: “It seemed like too easy an explanation for negative mental-health outcomes in teens,” but it ended up the only explanation that fit the timing. Lots of potential culprits, from stressful current events to increased academic pressure, existed before the spike in anxiety that begins around 2011. The only factor that dramatically increased right around the same time as teenage anxiety was the number of young people owning their own smartphones.“The use of social media and smartphones look culpable for the increase in teen mental-health issues,” she told Denizet-Lewis. “It’s enough for an arrest - and as we get more data, it might be enough for a conviction.” To emphasize the urgency of this investigation, Twenge titled her article in the Atlantic with a blunt question: “Have Smartphones Destroyed a Generation?”Returning to our canary-in-the-coal-mine analogy, the plight of iGen provides a strong warning about the danger of solitude deprivation. When an entire cohort unintentionally eliminated time alone with their thoughts from their lives, their mental health suffered dramatically. On reflection, this makes sense. These teenagers have lost the ability to process and make sense of their emotions, or to reflect on who they are and what really matters, or to build strong relationships, or even to just allow their brains time to power down their critical social circuits, which are not meant to be used constantly, and to redirect that energy to other important cognitive housekeeping tasks. We shouldn’t be surprised that these absences lead to malfunctions. Most adults stop short of the constant connectivity practiced by members of iGen, but if you extrapolate these effects to the somewhat milder forms of solitude deprivation that have become common among many different age groups, the results are still worrisome. As I’ve learned by interacting with my readers, many have come to accept a background hum of low-grade anxiety that permeates their daily lives. When looking for explanations, they might turn to the latest crisis - be it the recession of 2009 or the contentious election of 2016 - or chalk it up to a normal reaction to the stresses of adulthood. But once you begin studying the positive benefits of time alone with your thoughts, and encounter the distressing effects that appear in populations that eliminate this altogether, a simpler explanation emerges: we need solitude to thrive as human beings, and in recent years, without even realizing it, we’ve been systematically reducing this crucial ingredient from our lives. Simply put, humans are not wired to be constantly wired. "

287,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91127-herbie,4,"Digital minimalismI initially thumbed through this in an airport terminal, and thought it might not be worth reading. I had encountered most of the ideas already, and had adopted or at least been exposed to many of the practices for reclaiming one’s attention - things like not clicking like, scheduling social media use, taking breaks from social media and from your phone, etc. If anything I thought I had taken a harder line on some of these things than even Newport advocates, having fully deleted Facebook and almost completely abstaining from Instagram, not for “minimalist” reasons but out of something closer to a moral boycott. I lingered over the book for a while and felt like I had skimmed it for all its worth, then I caught my plane.But later, when I really read the book, I quite enjoyed it. Yes, I had heard these ideas before, and I had tried these practices already. I’d not, however, heard a case so cogent and careful for rethinking our relationship with the attention-industrial complex: the companies and services that profit by capturing our attention and tracking us for sale to advertisers. The view here is long and detached, the tone measured. Newport manages to make a convincing and fleshed-out case for the benefits of some almost trite practices, like taking walks, or being handy around the house. When I closed the book, I was energized to continue to overhaul how I approach my phone and social media, and felt a sense of promise for what this could bring to my life. Essentially, this is a self-help effect, and I’m embarrassed to say that I love the rush of self-help, of a cheerleader made out of text, convincing me that I can live a better life. This one worked on me because it was careful, quiet, and built on the groundwork of a cohesive philosophy.There is a blind spot here about gender, for sure: so many of the examples he cites about focused and deep work are by men. The section on crafting and being handy is especially blind to the ways in which different kinds of crafting are gendered. And it struck me that when Newport talked about how he structures his own time, he had so little to say about spending time caring for his children. It's a little crazy to talk about free time and leisure without talking about gendered disparities in unpaid domestic work.I remain convinced that the questions of how to relate to the offerings of the attention-industrial complex, and how to wisely handle, rather than be handled by, this new appendage that is our cell phone, will continue to be important and central to contemporary life. We will continue to grapple with them and our answers will continue to have far-reaching implications for our productivity, our relationships, our very well-being."

I use it to pay bills, book movie tickets, transfer money, book hotels, railway tickets, flights, taxis, order food, read news, navigate maps, watch videos, text friends, etc etc etc. A smartphone is the most advanced little piece of bar available for the common man to ease a lot of things which he needed to spend hours and days before to get done, using different tools either. So, there is no going back there, except a little tweaking here and there.But, here comes the problem. The addiction—streaming platforms, social media, news feed, porn (which the author hadn't addressed), youtube....Smartphones, laptops, and tablets not just hinder us from having meaningful relationships, but it takes away our rights to quality solitude time either. Because, whenever we get a little alone-time, be it even in washrooms, we are constantly looking at the screen so much as to not be alone in the pure sense—we are constantly peeking into the minds and thoughts of others. True contemplation gets hijacked. Digital Minimalism is a good starter book for those who haven't yet thought about the adverse effects of screen-addiction. It had a few tips and tricks to spare, but nothing much I hadn't come across already. I think his previous well-written book 'Deep Work' is enough to get the ideas."
289,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343650-mike,5,"""I used to be a human being..."" what a good way to start out, and unfortunately by the end of this book it is clear that for a lesser or greater extent the shiny glowing screens have gradually and and craftily sucked our humanity out of us.Takeaways:1. The majority of social networks do not meet the ""social"" requirements we have evolved to need. In an apt analogy, like fast food they provide something that appears to be food but is not nourishing. In fact it is causing self-evident harm in our ability to be social animals.2. Social networks run on a principle that YOUR time = THEIR money. You are the product, and you are being sold. In exchange you are given shiny candies to keep you looking at the screen, but if you step back and try to describe the value you are receiving, it is clearly thin and not worth the time you traded for it.3. Glowing screens and ""social networks"" are likely at the root of a vast increase in mental illnesses, loneliness, partisanship and anger in society. They lead to habits which limit discourse and critical thinking. 4. Like similar attempts to dominate attention before it, The National Enquirer and other gossip rags, social networks are designed to push emotional buttons giving an illusion of importance, relevance and social-ness. If you look closely though, those are easily shown to be parlor tricks with little substance.5. Humans evolved to have and maintain deep social relationships with a dense supply of information and depth to our interactions. ""Social networks"" provide only a simulacrum of that ""social nutritional need"". They provide sugar, not nutrition.6. The services are designed to be addictive, and weaning yourself off of them will demonstrate the signs of addiction. However, with a bit of time away, you will be able to look back and see how unfulfilling they are. This is similar to how an alcoholic or smoker will look back on their former addiction.7. In an age of dissatisfaction and loneliness, minimizing and targeting digital device use can lead to much greater happiness, focus and depth of relationships.This was a fantastic read which I will recommend to all of my friends to give a different perspective on their own habits for consideration. As for myself, I've deleted my Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, and Instagram accounts to take the author's 30 day detox challenge. I'm very curious on if I'll let those back into my life. I suspect this will be one of those books which nudges my life on to a slightly different track, and I expect I'll be much happier for it."

If only he hadn't been killed in the ring by Uwe Boll, he would be sweating with pride as we speak.In addition to stupid, it makes you twitchy, sad, and weird. Sort of like the allegations against toxiplasma gondii. If you have a cat and an active social media presence, you're a goner.Cal Newport is a rare breed of academic in that he is young, and seems relatively intelligent. As we know, most academics are wizened absent-minded sorceror caricatures with a mean age of 65. They're also broke. Cal Newport is not broke, because he's turned his experiences of ""being in school for a long time"" into a series of self-help books that mostly focus on improving your ability to study and, thus, be in school for a long time. And from this well springs Digital Minimalism, the idea that constant tethering to social media results in a cycle addiction identical to, well, every other cycle of addiction. The central idea is that smartphones are slot machines, by design. Tech companies like Apple and Facebook are deliberately trying to monopolize your time by drawing your attention to your phone as frequently as possible, resulting in your seeing more ads, and their gathering more ad revenue. This produces money from nothing, and also, chicks for free.The thing is, it's not from nothing. Nothing can be had for nothing, as promised by Epictetus. You pay for the little dopaminergic zing of digitized social approval with the minutes of your life. Every time you disengage from the present to check how many likes you've collected over the past fifteen minutes, you're putting more money in Zucc's heat-rock and mealworm fund, and training yourself like a puppy to get dribs and drabs of the feel-good chemical from the glowing space-screen in your pocket. But you're not a puppy. You might be subject to the same classical and operant conditioning, but your wiring is infinitely more complex, and thus subject to more opportunities to go haywire. Social approval is one of the most important things to the average human being (average in this instance meaning freshly minted, all other factors controlled for; the fictional human baseline and duerrogotype template), because when ostracized by the tribe, we got eaten by wolves. We turned the wolves into chiuahuas and ostracization means more time to watch Netflix, but we're still running on that old sapiens hardware. If we perceive our social standing as sinking, the alarm bells start to go off.Social media creates an imaginary system of social feedback where the highs are virtually nonexistent, but sufficient to reinforce your attention, and continued exposure to the lows can result in long-term psychological disorders. As the author puts it:""Online discussion seems to accelerate people's shift toward emotionally charged and draining extremes. The techno-philosopher Jaron Alnier convincingly argues that the primacy of anger and outrage online is, in some sense, and unavoidable feature of the medium; in an open marketplace for attention, darker emotions attract more eyeballs than positive and constructive thoughts. For heavy internet users, repeated interaction with this darkness can become a source of draining negativity -- a steep price that many don't even realize they're paying to support their compulsive connectivity.""And then the effect: Until recently, the mental health center on campus had seen the same mix of teenager issues that have been common for decades: homesickness, eating disorders, some depression, and the occasional case of OCD. Then everything changed. Seemingly overnight the number of students seeking mental health counseling massively expanded, and the standard mix of teenage issues was dominated by something that used to be relatively rare: anxiety. From there, he long-windedly (academic, remember) draws the connection between suddenly pandemic anxiety and smartphone use among the first generation raised with this level of constant connectivity.A good argument, but untestable, and so relegated to hypothesis. He rolls in some solid science afterward and it starts to look better, citing research by psychologist Matthew Lieberman whose elaborate PET-scan reindeer games determined that the social parts of the brain automatically switch on when you're not doing anything else.  He now believes ""we are interested in the social world because we are built to turn on the default network during our free time"". Put another way, our brains adapted to automatically practica social thinking during any moments of cognitive downtime, and it's this practice that helps us become really interested in our social world.""Lieberman ran similar scans on newborns and found their default (social) network lit up during attentional downtime before the infant's eyes were even able to focus. It's instinct for us to think socially when we're not doing anything else, and the constant Matrix linkup ensures that something is always subconsciously on the line for us, and every time we don't harvest a fat crop of either heart reacts or Farmville turnips it's evidence of our evolutionary failure and alienation from our fellows. But big Cal is not all about shaking his head and ominously whispering, ""We live in a society"". He's got a solution, and it's dumbing down your phone. He recommends: a loosely organized attention resistance movement, made up of individuals who combine high-tech tools with disciplined operating procedures to conduct surgical strikes on popular attention economy services -- dropping in to extract value, and then slipping away before the attention traps set by these companies can spring shut. I strongly resent being manipulated, in any context. The concept that minutes of my life are units of currency, converted by Wish into actual legal tender, then given to Mark Zuckerberg, makes my blood boil. I've still got a 12-year-old anarchopunk festering somewhere under my sternum, and he absolutely will not abide the prospect of trading time from my life, a nonrenewable resource, to someone else's profit in an exchange where I get nothing but limbic table scraps. Newport describes it as the social equivalent of ""snacking on Doritos instead of eating a meal"".It seems worth a try to me. I stripped my own phone down to nothing but GPS and Duolingo (and IG, but I hid that in three subfolders, to be accessed only when required for my blog). I've caught myself fiending. Every time I check my phone, for any reason, muscle memory tries to flick Messenger or Facebook back open, and that goddamn owl is flailing and screaming at me to get moving on the Russian leaderboards.Cal was right about one thing, though; when you cut loose the low-quality leisure, you find time you didn't know you had for things you actually want to do. I got through six books this week. Expect a deluge of reviews. "

Different reasons why one should walk regularly:To make progress on a professional problemSelf-reflection on some particular aspect of lifeGratitude walks, where he just enjoys particularly good weatherOr just to let his mind wanderWhat Thoreau sought in his experiment at Walden was the ability to move back and forth between a state of solitude and a state of connectionWriting a letter to yourself provides a platform to organise your thinking when faced with demanding or uncertain circumstancesBy the time you’re done composing your thoughts, you’ll often have gained clarity. It’s easy to deploy, but also incredibly effectiveThe Social Media Paradox: Social media makes you feel both connected and lonely, happy and sadThe more you use social media, the less time you tend to devote to offline interaction, meaning you’re more likely to feel lonely and miserableThe loss of social connection triggers the same system as physical painThey joined Facebook to stay in touch with friends across the country, and then ended up unable to maintain an uninterrupted conversation with the friend sitting across the tableEvery time you post something on social media, you’re gambling: Will I get likes or will I get no feedback?Comments and heart and likes feel like the tribe is showing us approval, while a lack of positive feedback creates a sense of distressChecking likes is the new smokingAddiction is a condition in which a person engages in use of a substance or in a behavior for which the rewarding effects provide a compelling incentive to repeatedly pursue the behavior despite detrimental consequencesOur new technologies are particularly well suited to foster behavioral addictions – Adam AlterPeople don’t succumb to screens because they’re lazy, but instead because billions of dollars have been invested to make this outcome inevitableAddictive properties of new technologies are carefully engineered design featuresThe notification symbol for Facebook was originally blue, to match the palette of the rest of the site, but no one used it.

Digital minimalists believe that deciding a particular technology supports something they value is only the first step. To truly extract its full potential benefit, it’s necessary to think carefully about how they’ll use the technologyPrinciple 3: Digital minimalists derive significant satisfaction from their general commitment to being more intentional about how they engage with new technologies. This source of satisfaction is independent of the specific decisions they make and is one of the biggest reasons that minimalism tends to be immensely meaningful to its practitionersA life well lived requires activities that serve no other purpose than the satisfaction that the activity itself generatesThe cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long runBuild something.

292,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5856399-debby,2,"[Warning: I'm not going to painstakingly edit this review, as I would normally.]I read this close on the heels (2+ weeks) of ""How to Break Up with Your Phone"" by Catherine Price, which I read to be companionable in an online reading group. I rated it 3-minus. I'm not really the target for either book—I'm already pretty mindful of how I use my tools and spend my precious resources.The Price book was brief and mainly instructional. I took a couple tips from it, but hardly followed the 30-day process.Reading this book made me think of how much I dislike Charles Dickens' writing. There's clearly merit; but, Newport (like Dickens) takes forever and a day to say something that could have been handled admirably in much less time.I was irritated (to put it kindly) at Newport's inability to recognize that people have different communication styles. [Comment inspired by this: “When someone instigates a low-quality connection—say a text message conversation or social media ping—suggest they call or meet you during your office hours sometime when it is convenient for them.”] If you want to share discussion on this topic, I'd be happy to . . . but don't call me!I can agree with this conclusion (maybe I should have skipped to the last page at the start): ""Digital minimalists see new technologies as tools to be used to support things they deeply value, not as sources of value themselves. They don't accept the idea that offering some small benefit is justification for allowing an attention-gobbling service into their lives, and are instead interested in applying new technology in highly selective and intentional ways that yield big wins.""Overall, the book is long on extended anecdotes about famous historical figures' habits of solitude and judgment on what constitutes meaningful experiences and communication, and short on substantive advice on how to use new technologies as useful tools vs. mindless time-sucks."
293,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9750859-michelle-beginandendwithbooks,5,"I highly recommend Digital Minimalism for your next non-fiction read. Every adult with a smart phone could find something worthwhile in this book, even if they don’t want to adopt all, or any, of the suggestions. My American Lit teacher friends can apply excerpts to classroom instruction, as the author makes connections to Thoreau’s writings. All teenagers could benefit from reading portions and discussing these ideas with their parents, as well, as they establish their technological habits.The book asks the reader to evaluate how, why, and when we are using the newest technologies made available to us and how we can best use technology in line with our own values and priorities. It asks us to take back control of our lives so that technology is a tool to enhance the quality of our lives, not a distraction from how we truly want to be spending our time. Technology should be in a supporting role, not a controlling role. The book encourages us to discover our passions and cultivate “high quality leisure time” rather than scroll away our lives. It goes into how social media companies want our time and are profiting from distracting us, and these companies want us to believe that social media is a necessity in our lives. (The book explores texting, apps, news, social media, streaming, notifications, etc.)As the author states in the conclusion, “digital minimalism is much more than a set of rules, it’s about cultivating a life worth living in our current age of alluring devices.” My main takeaway from the book is that if we wish to live deliberately, then we need to evaluate the role that the technology that is constantly at our fingertips is playing in our lives and how it is affecting our quality of life."
294,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12957403-sarah-olson,2,"While Newport's book is good in theory, he seemed to have nothing new or relevant to add to the conversation. I had come to the same conclusions he made by the time I even picked up his book: using social media less and preventing myself from constantly scrolling on my phone improves my quality of life. Although Newport's book is intended to be useful, his target readers will likely already be considering moving away from social media use, so he's preaching to the choir. I also took issue with his blatant admiration of Amish and Mennonite communities and their rejection of technology: he resigned their poor treatment of women to a single sentence and shrugged off the idea that their rejection of technology is really just a tool of oppression. Newport also has NO experience with social media, an issue he addresses in a single, two-sentence footnote, and this greatly diminishes his expertise. He appears to have little understanding of why someone would use social media and his book is a very superficial investigation. Of course, he's a white dude, so he's got that strange sense of entitlement to write a book on a topic he appears to have little knowledge about or expertise in, other than wielding his title as a computer scientist (which doesn't exactly translate to knowledge and experience in social media usage). Basically, not a book worth wasting your time on. You get the same information from the (many) articles he's written about the subject, which are worth reading instead."

I've had this sense of unease about my smart phone usage but this book gave me clarity on why. It's not anti-technology, Cal believes tech can help us live our lives well, but what he questions is whether our current usage is doing that - whether we need to be spending as much time on our phones as we are. The answer might be obvious but his explanations on how apps are now built to be addictive to make the companies money shifted something in me. Moreso though was the exploration of our need for solitude - being away from the influences of other voices. This resonated with me. I need space and quiet at the end of the day, and that includes digitally. I've deleted Facebook and Instagram apps and feel better for it. The book goes on some tangents making it longer than it needed to be but it's definitely helped me be more intentional with my phone usage - focusing my energy rather than switching through apps mindlessly. And there's no judgement there - just learning what works for me.[This review was written at the end of January. I have to say I've slipped back into old habits but I can understand and accept that given what's happening at the moment. Still, I've been on more walks this year where I've not been listening to a podcast or audiobook, instead just giving myself time to be present and mindful, or to process what I might need to. Posting this review is a good reminder though to be aware of my screentime, and how much better I feel when I spend my time differently]"
296,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14408579-the-conch,5,"The author, Cal Newport, is an associate professor of computer science at Georgetown University and prolific writer. The goal of the book is to educate smartphone users about influence of smartphone in human psychology and social behavior and effective mitigation measures called ""Digital Minimalism"". While smartphone floods one with all types of apps, games, social medias, news so on and so forth, users often immerse themselves in endless clicking and swapping. Author asks user of smartphone to raise question, whether is the technology / app supporting something which anyone deeply values? Further analysis as per author's recommended way proves that users of smartphone unconsciously spend hours after hours without gaining anything substantial. They are in trap of attention seeking industries like Facebook, Instagram etc. where user's time = their money. After reading this book, one must ready to get a jolt about how much attention this smartphones are gobbling silently which affect human society and psychology. People are becoming more anxious and impatient all time without any reason. They are always afraid of missing something without their glowing 5"" screen. It is now challenge to stay without smartphone and that is de-cluttering of digital life or ""Digital Minimalism"". Cal Newport's books are refreshing and this is not exception. So get ready to ""dumb down your phone"". "

For starters, suggesting that mental work isn’t real work is one way that women’s domestic management and relationship management skills have been undervalued for generations. Newport shows his hand by quoting “philosopher-mechanic” Matthew Crawford, who writes, to paraphrase, “boys think, but MEN build things,” without even a footnote to acknowledge how retrograde that is. It's a huge blind spot that confirmed for me how cursory the research surrounding this book must have been.Recommended if you are a productivity-obsessed tech bro with a John Galt tattoo, I guess?"

In the past several months, I've been worried that screens have been taking over my life. I didn't like that I was spending so much time online, and I didn't feel that I had enough to show for my time online in relation to the amount of time I'd been spending. One day, something in me snapped and I quit Facebook for a month. It was just after that month that I picked up this book, which ironically suggests right off the bat that you take a month off from social media. So you might say that this book crossed my path at just the right time in life.There was something magical about taking a month off from Facebook. I'd done weeklong detoxes before, but the length of the month (and the fact that I actually suspended my account instead of just relying on willpower) really made the difference for me. The rest of the book gives myriad suggestions for becoming a digital minimalist beyond just quitting social media for a month, and goes into each of these ideas deeply and thoroughly, using writings and personal experiences to drive the points home.I highly recommend this book for anyone who would like to make lasting choices leading to less screen use and a better life.
