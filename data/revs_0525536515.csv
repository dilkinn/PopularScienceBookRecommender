0,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/732347-kelly,0,"Although at times it made me annoyed for how into only citing dudes or dude-centric work it is (hi, the Craft movement has been in the women's spheres for forever, but it didn't become ""cool"" to do crafts -- whatever craft you prefer -- until dudes ""reclaimed"" it over the last few decades), this is a really smart, thoughtful, and practical book about how to make sure that social media works for you, rather than you becoming a tool of the social media. I've been doing some of these things in my own life and it's neat to see what some others have done. Newport's big suggestion is scheduling when you'll be mindless on social media and spend time creating ways to let the tools do the work you want them to do in the other time. Likewise, the suggestions for a digital detox are easy enough and some of the other ideas, including don't put apps on your phone, are things I've been doing and finding to be valuable, for sure. More on this one soon. It doesn't necessarily tread new ground, as (How to Break Up with Your Phone: The 30-Day Plan to Take Back Your Life and others like it do this...but I guess since they're by women, y'know. "

2,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36137204-carl-rannaberg,3,"I badly wanted to like this book. I really did. Because I have very much enjoyed other books by Cal Newport: So Good That They Can’t Ignore You and Deep Work. Both have inspired me a lot and I have recommended these to others in many occasions.This book was way below my expectations. I'm afraid it’s not the book, it’s me. The practical value for me was minimal as I have already implemented a lot of things he proposes in the book.As Cal Newport mentions that he sees the digital minimalism trend gaining momentum I thought this book has the potential to be the bible for this movement. But I don’t believe that happens because the message in this book is not clear enough. There are really no core underlying principles for this digital minimalism philosophy that Cal Newport tries to communicate in this book or he just did a poor job at it. I would have expected that he would lay out the laws or principles of digital minimalist at the start of the book and reinforce them through anecdotes in the rest of the book. For me there were only loosely related anecdotes where sometimes I scratched my head and thought: “how is that relevant to this topic?”This book seems to have identity crisis. As Cal himself mentioned at the start of the book he usually doesn’t write practical books. And this book is neither theoretically coherent nor is it well-structured practical book. It’s somewhere between and it’s a shame. His research in this topic is very thorough and the examples and tips he offers are actually useful.One thing that irritated me a little was his dismissive attitude towards blog posts with tips to turn off notifications on your smartphone and then he goes on in the book and does exactly the same thing. Of course he also talked about that you need a more deeper philosophy to actually make these changes in your life but for me he failed at communicating it clearly enough.One of the biggest grievances for me was lack of authors understanding of how habits work. This book would have been sooo much better when he would have actually connected our harmful digital behaviours with fundamental habit changing theory.If you would like to get pretty much the same content in a much clearer and practical form I would highly recommend you read “Atomic Habits” by James Clear and “Make Time” by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky. Former gives a very solid understanding of the psychology behind habit change and the latter gives over 80 highly practical tactics to find better focus and more energy in this distracting world."
3,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57797254-cindy-pham,3,"3.5 stars. I appreciate the thesis that by choosing to minimize technology in our day-to-day lives, we're choosing to be more deliberate with how we spend our time. I liked some of the advice to consolidate texting, hold conversation office hours, and in general, choose to be more purposeful with what energy we give to reacting to others. I think this book would have been stronger if he provided research to this points rather than random anecdotes about people who decide to step away from technology. A few pieces throughout the middle also felt like fluff to fill up the book (i.e. the rock-paper-scissors championship, the fantasy board game groups, and anecdotes about old white dudes like Henry David Thoreau). It would have served better to take more stories of the modern-day person who has to be ingrained in technology, like someone working in Silicon Valley, and solutions for how to balance professional requirements with self-preservation and mindfulness."
4,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,4,"I know the irony of writing such a review on a social media platform, but as always there is potential for both good and for bad, for modest consumption or addiction.One should always keep in mind that humans are social animals, prone to getting addicted to interacting with each other. Online. 24/7. Until real life (which one was that still...) collapses Probably the one or the other reader might tend to eat too much sugar, fat, has quit smoking or even worse things like online gaming. In each of these cases, a different strong bodily and or physical addiction has triggered the craving for more. It´s not difficult to see the problem when the doctor tells you that you ought probably lose weight, quit this, reduce that, yada yada yada, what does he know, it´s my body, health and life. Now we get stimulated with each like (Please, oh please, click the button under the review, I need it so desperately, my whole life circles around it, click it, damn!), message, comment, etc. Our brains are wired to social interaction because happy apes in groups meant survival while lonely apes in the dark jungle meant yum yum for predators. So some of us (except a large, but underrepresented group of introverts, ahem) get pretty stressed as soon as the confirmation of popularity doesn´t grow, stagnates, or even, inconceivable goes down. Why don´t those complete strangers don´t support me anymore? In nature, we could be dead now. No more drug-like hormone exposition in the brain, so that the flow kicks in, just sadness. Any company with an allegedly free business model, running a social media site, search engine, etc. knows that. So thousand of high skilled experts do nothing except of trying to get as many people as hooked on as possible, considering age, gender, social status. It´s as if an organized drug dealing cartel had employed people to tailor and advertise their products to each possible customer base. But hey, humans have a free will, at least in theory. What the book is trying to tell us is the same thing each monk and Buddhist says all day long each day of her/his life. Get your mind trained, meditate, stay calm, check your feelings, needs and especially cravings. Ask why your construct of personality in this wet mess up there seems to do what it wants. You are the ego it simulates, so you should really try to at least take control for a few moments every day and expand to longer periods, perhaps half hours or so. Ideology might play a large part here too. Completely ignoring the social and human part can lead to a technocratic, cold and alienated world. Doing as if no social media exists can destroy possibilities to something that might get closer to Gaia than nothing before. It´s, as many wise doctors often said, the dosage that makes the poison. Or the demonization of the poison, although it would be the only possible cure for many problems. It could be easy by just checking social media once or twice a day for a certain time and take a day, weekend or even holiday (Is he crazy?) off. A mini-hiatus. Just like computer gaming addiction, the social media addiction is something just existing in your mind and as someone who quit smoking (many times) I can tell you that there are really other burdens that come with real physical cravings and not just the inability to control the delay of the answer to the question of how many people have shared and liked my precious, precious review of this book that can also be read on my:Fictional twitter link Fictional Facebook linkFictional whatever the latest freaking popular overhyped social media thing, app may be.

Where we want to be cautious . . . is when the sound of a voice or a cup of coffee with a friend is replaced with ‘likes’ on a post.
Read. This. Book. Have you ever told someone in your life you just didn't have enough time in the day to get everything done? Have you thought about why that is? Maybe look down and see what you've been doing for the last 5, 10 or even 60 minutes. Probably scrolling through your phone. Sometimes with intention but sadly a lot of the time we are on our phones because of we are boredom or we are addicted and fear FOMO.A little background before I get into this book and why it's very important. I've always been into tech. I started at a young age, went to college and got a Web Dev/Interactive Media degree and I've had jobs in Digital Marketing, Email Marketing and now Cyber Security. I use tech each and everyday so you may be asking why I think this book is so important and questioning why I agree there is a problem? Well because I started to notice it in my own life and around me. I'd go meet a friend and they'd sit there scrolling through their phone while i'm trying to talk to them. I've watched family members sit on their phones while we're supposed to be ""spending time"" together. I looked around my train car the last couple days at 95% of people sat there scrolling through their phones and most of it was social media, not work. I watch families of 4 go out to eat and all 4 (parents and kids) are on their phones. Why bother going out? I know you may thinking well that's their choice and I agree but I personally don't want to lose human interaction to my phone or my time to my phone/other tech. Mindless scrolling because I'm bored or that I'm afraid I'm going to miss out just isn't worth my mental health or relationships. I also started to recently feel depressive and sad feelings while being on social media. It made me feel sad watching others thrive in their life and I felt insignificant in a way. The ""Facebook effect"" is real and I firsthand have felt it. Just remember there was once a time when we didn't have all this tech or phones and we were more connected, less anxious and we still survived. I realize I'm typing this on a digital site and it has to be read here but just hear me out...DIGITAL MINIMALISM takes us through different steps that you can go through to become a digital minimalist. What is one you ask? ""They’re the calm, happy people who can hold long conversations without furtive glances at their phones. They can get lost in a good book, a woodworking project, or a leisurely morning run. They can have fun with friends and family without the obsessive urge to document the experience. They stay informed about the news of the day, but don’t feel overwhelmed by it. They don’t experience “fear of missing out” because they already know which activities provide them with meaning and satisfaction.""Newport takes us through almost ""detoxing"" yourself from doing tech activities without intention. So if you spend 2 hours a day on facebook, try taking it off your phone so you can get over the urge of automatically opening it and then set aside specific time to go on it and try to use it with high intention so that you really get something out of it. Technology is not good or bad and Cal is actually a Computer Scientist, it's moreso about how we use it and how we can change that to be more healthy.I personally made a few changes - my husband and I do not look at our phones during dinner or any meal together. In fact, I try to leave my phone in the car or at home as much as I can. I put on night mode at night. I put my phone farther away at night. I turned off almost all phone notifications. The next step is to delete some low intention (social media) apps.If you are ready to take back control of your time and not feel like you need your phone attached to you every second then definitely read this book. It's simple but powerful and it has a lot of interesting studies/background on technology as a whole. I personally love technology (it is my job after all!) but I'm ready to use it more intentionally then mindlessly and strengthen my human face-to-face connections rather than hoovering behind a screen. I think my neck, thumbs and hands will probably thank me too!"
6,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86598133-amora,3,"I liked this book, but I will be sincere. The methods offered here to be a minimalist aren’t realistic for many of us, including me. It’s not that I, and many others, don’t have the will to be a minimalist but it’s that we can’t. Newport does show the benefits of reducing technology use quite nicely but unfortunately this book wasn’t made for everyone. Newport’s previous book was significantly better."
7,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1213607-julie-christine,5,"Every rare once in awhile a Facebook friend announces their imminent departure from Facebook. Or simply quietly slips away, leaving behind a shadow profile in my friends list. I send up a silent cheer when I realize they have deactivated their account, knowing in my belly they are better off without this ubiquitous social media overlord. For a long time, I've felt a sense of disquiet about social media, but the disturbance has become a growing alarm and a deep sadness in recent months. I feel that we, all of us who are connected, have just lost our way. Then two things occurred almost simultaneously, one horrific, one glorious. First, The New York Times ran a feature on child pornography, a hideous crime that's exploded in volume because of social media. The wretched creeps who exploit and abuse children have multiple platforms that make it harder to track their behavior and make it all the easier for children to be preyed upon. The social media companies, like Facebook with its Messenger platform, are complicit in these crimes, just as they were in the travesty that was the 2016 election. They want users, regardless of the consequences. And then a friend of mine fulfilled a lifelong dream, which also happens to be one of mine: hiking the Camino de Santiago. She chronicled every day through photos and anecdotes posted on Insta and Facebook. As much as I treasured joining her journey from afar, I also wanted to plead with her to put down the phone, forget all of us, and be there, in her head and body and heart and just walk. Walk for the sake of it, not for the instagrammable moments. Being disconnected from the world is natural, healthy, necessary. I imagine my own Camino and know that I want it to be private, meditative, transformative, not shared, not liked or retweeted. Pure. Into all this walked Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport, giving me yet more reasons, and now a strategy, to reframe and redo my relationship with social media. Cal Newport isn't a Luddite. He's not against social medial or digital technology. He does throw down the gauntlet, however; challenging his readers to look their use and habits squarely in the screen, to recognize and deeply register the power Silicon Valley has in nearly every aspect of our lives, our time, our children's brains, our attention, our pocketbooks. Few want to spend so much time online, but these tools have a way of cultivating behavioral addiction. And as Newport demonstrates throughout Digital Minimalism, while some of these addictive qualities are accidental, many have been exploited by tech and social media companies whose driving purpose is to keep us online as often, and for as long, as possible. Through intermittent, unpredictable social approval (likes, loves, retweets), we become dependent on the feedback that shows someone, somewhere, has noticed us.I've moved around so much as an adult- cities, states, countries- and it's precious to keep in touch with friends from lifetimes ago. Facebook and Twitter have brought me into communities of writers that were crucial to the development of my career; I might never have started writing if it weren't for this very space: Goodreads. Writing thoughtfully about the books I read became a DIY MFA. I learned story structure, narrative depth, character development, and how to construct a beautiful sentence not only by reading great (and not so great) books, but by being a part of a community that discusses them. It's not that any of these tools is bad. To be fair, they can bring pleasure and satisfaction. It's just that they are too much. And we, no matter how professional, intelligent, disciplined, have been manipulated to respond like rats to a sugar drip. Our brains are tired. We're overstimulated, over-connected, over-info'ed. It's not natural to have hundreds of ""friends,"" to share not only the minutiae of our daily lives, but its most intimate details, with people we wouldn't recognize if we passed them on the street, to constantly seek social approval, not to spend time in solitude, not to look up and observe the world around us. Newport, and his co-frères/sœurs James Clear, Atomic Habits, Jenny Odell How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy ,among others, are part of the emerging Attention Resistance, a loosely-knit group of educators, researchers, artists, and business professionals who are decrying the outsize role digital technology and social media play in our lives. 'Sean Parker, the first president of Facebook, has called the platform a “social-validation feedback loop” built around “exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology.” Tristan Harris, who worked as a “design ethicist” at Google, has said that smartphones are engineered to be addictive.' ""What It Takes to Put Your Phone Away,"" by Jia Tolentino,The New Yorker April 22, 2019.This just isn't right. I don't want to play the game anymore. Or more accurately, I don't want to be played anymore. I am accepting, moving toward embracing, that time spent on social media is ""low quality"" time. No matter how much I appreciate the connections, the sharing of fun moments or commiseration over the bad, I am coming to accept that I will be happier, more focused, productive, and peaceful the less time I spend on social media. I already take periodic breaks, employing various tips and technologies to reclaim my time and attention, but as Newport states, “willpower, tips, and vague resolutions are not sufficient by themselves to tame the ability of new technologies to invade your cognitive landscape.” Social media isn't that big a part of my life. I have a full-time + day job and rarely check social media during the day, even though my actual job requires that I post on both Facebook and Instagram. I am finishing the first draft of my fourth novel; most days I work out at twice a day; I read copiously. I'm busy, engaged in the real world. But still. I think social media is compromising my—and our society's at large—mental, intellectual, physical, and communal health. It's time to start doing things differently. Hey, there's an app for that! (actually, quite a few: Moment, Forest, Freedom, Focus, and one new to this Mac user: Ulysses, which looks an awful lot like Scrivener). Seriously, Cal Newport has a plan. Detox for thirty days, And then, once your 30-day detox is over, rebuild your relationship with digital technology from the ground up, with intentionality and minimalism, where technology serves you and what you deeply value. ""The goal is not simply to give yourself a break from technology, but to instead spark a permanent transformation of your digital life."" Newport recommends that you spend your time away from optional technology by discovering, or rediscovering, what you enjoy. It's the Marie Kondo approach to a digital life: if it's not useful or doesn't bring you joy, it needs to go, as much as is reasonable. Most of us have aspects to our jobs that make some of these technologies, including emails or texting, inevitable. There are engrossing sections of this book that discuss the beauty of solitude- a beauty we've all but lost with constant presence of our phones in our pockets, sharing the carefully curated moments of our lives or reading about others'. He argues that we are suffering from Solitude Deprivation - A state in which you spend close to zero time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from other minds. . There are also alarming looks at younger generations who've never known life without iPads or smartphones: the stunted growth of empathy, focus, motivation, and observation. It's not just terribly sad and weird, I believe it's a public health crisis. So, in a couple of weeks, beginning November 1, I will be starting my digital declutter. The first step is a 30-day digital declutter/detox from optional technologies. For me, that will be Facebook, including Messenger, Twitter, and Instagram. I may also let go of Goodreads and just upload my book reviews after I come back online, but I don't feel a digital drain here.I'll journal my detox, maybe I'll return to loving my blog, that I always seem to be too busy to post on. I won't force myself to finish this first draft of my novel by the end of November, but at the rate I'm going even before I begin my detox, I just might! I look forward to all that I will add to my life, as I let go of the ubiquity, the artificiality, of ""connection."" I want to learn to be better connected to and present in my real world life."
8,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,3,"I like the idea in here--less is more. We do not need all the apps and the social platforms. He's definitely talking to someone like me here. I am not a huge consumer of these platforms (mostly this is age-related). However, I listened to his book using audible and some apps have really helped me expand my mind (meditation apps and audible are two). There is no room in Newport's framework for using smartphones in a good way. He's sort of an intellectual luddite. I get this and sometimes I think it's easier to draw crisp and bright lines and never walk over them lest you get sucked in, but perhaps we need to think more about our relationship with our app-filled phones before we just swear them off. I think the better plan would be to practice radical consciousness when dealing with tech. To not walk numbly and dumbly into each platform and let it take our free will. "
9,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4753619-k-j-dell-antonia,5,"I've been thinking a lot these days about making more deliberate tech choices. No one human--not even Steve Jobs--ever expected technology to invade our lives the way it has. Instead, keeping us tethered to our tech and pulling that lever became the most popular and obvious way to monetize the Internet, and we individuals became, not the consumers, but the product being sold. And instead of cutting ourselves some slack--billions of dollars have been spent in the name of making the screens around us stickier and sticker, is it any wonder we're drawn in?—we feel guilty, as I did the other night, about being too weak to just shut it off and look away. The perfect antidote to that guilt is Cal Newport's Digital Minimalism. Newport skips the guilt (noting that we didn't ask for this and really could not have been prepared for it) and challenges to ask ourselves: what am I trying to do when I use this technology—and is this the best way to serve that goal? Build a philosophy around your tech use and you’ll use your tech more wisely. I'm trying, and this book is helping."
10,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47417894-laura-noggle,4,"Deleted Facebook and Facebook messenger off my phone thanks to this book!Hard not to feel guilty over phone use after reading, probably because I know I waste too much time on it.Would read this one again to help ingrain the importance of living the minimally digital life.“The tycoons of social media have to stop pretending that they’re friendly nerd gods building a better world and admit they’re just tobacco farmers in T-shirts selling an addictive product to children. Because, let’s face it, checking your 'likes' is the new smoking.”***UPDATE***It's been almost 2 months since I deleted FB and FB Messenger off my phone. Still loving it, and checking it less and less in general. This book has remained top of mind since I read it, and keeps popping up in my life. If you're interested in a good discussion around Newport's books and ideas, Rich Roll interviewed Cal on his podcast and its an excellent episode.""No longer need anyone ever be bored. Alone with one’s thoughts. Or simply present with one’s self. The result is a global epidemic of distraction. A fomenting of loneliness and isolation. And a degradation of our humanity.The solution isn’t Ludditism. Instead it’s agency. We need not be victims of technology. We have the power to liberate ourselves from the tether of digital dependency. And the freedom it creates isn’t just the salve to what ails us, it’s the gateway to that which we seek most. Meaning. True human connection. And a reconnection with our innate humanity.Indeed, there is no substitute for real relationships. Boredom is useful. And focus is the new superpower."" (RRP Episode 447)Newport is the Marie Kondo of digital tidiness. Solitude is essential for creating new ideas, solitude as in the freedom from input from other minds.""Many people mistakenly associate [solitude] with physical separation—requiring, perhaps, that you hike to a remote cabin miles from another human being. This flawed definition introduces a standard of isolation that can be impractical for most to satisfy on any sort of regular basis. As Kethledge and Erwin explain, however, solitude is about what’s happening in your brain, not the environment around you. Accordingly, they define it to be a subjective state in which your mind is free from input from other minds."" — Cal Newport, Digital MinimalismNewport doesn't have to convince me, I'm a big fan of my personal time. Cal's call to Spend More Time Alone makes me think of Virginia Wolf's A Room of One's Own.Really, I'll accept any theories that justify my proclivity for reading ... alone. Reframing Solitude in the Digital Age"
11,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6151731-heather,2,I continue to wonder if Newport ever bears primary caregiving duties for anyone. 
12,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13650342-mindful-librarian,5,"If you are ready to make radical changes in your approach to tech in your life, this book is for you. It has been life altering in the best possible ways for me. I’m noticing that the people who aren’t ready to make changes tend to get defensive and call Newport a Luddite 🤷🏼‍♀️However, if you almost never use your phone except for making phone calls or don’t use social media, you can probably skip it. Or if you’ve already read other books on the topic, maybe this covers the same ground? I haven’t read some of the other popular titles so I’m not sure about that."
13,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/811928-forrest,4,"A little over a year ago, I posted an entry to my blog softly decrying the place that social media and screen time was playing in my life. A few months later, as I was preparing for a trip to Europe, I vowed to go without social media for two weeks while I was away (outside of texting my kids). I was . . . mostly successful. I was on very little, far less than ""normal"". And my strategy of taking a notebook with me and writing every night proved successful. But I didn't drop everything all the way. Now, as I said in the blogposts referenced above, I am no luddite. Not by a long shot. Okay, so I'm not on the bleeding edge of technology, either, but I am facile in the use of technology and catch on fairly quickly. But I do recall a time, many years ago, when I spent far less time online and was more satisfied with life, in general. I think that the quality of my online experience has diminished a great deal since those early days. Some of it has to do with the fact that those days were the ""wild west"" of the web when you could code your own (admittedly crappy) web page, you had to look hard to actually find information (remember webcrawler?), and the internet was far less homogenized. So, I decided I'd give Newport's book a read. I was leaning this direction anyway (c.f., my blog posts), and I'm not one to just swallow people's advice, but I was curious what he had to say about ""choosing a focused life in a noisy world"". I expected to read a lambasting of those who spend time online, a hard stance against distracting technology, a flaggelant's guide to the evils of the internet.I was pleasantly surprised to find this was not the case at all. Newport's arguments are measured and logical in a way that isn't derisive or condescending. It can be brutally honest, at times, and a touch too ascetic for my tastes. But only a touch. There is a lot here to learn from.Rather than go through Newport's arguments, I'd like to present what I've done already and will be doing as a result of this book. First of all, my habits on Goodreads are not changing at all. In fact, I would expect to see more action out of me, rather than less. Because reading is one of my core values, and I need to feed those core values. And I love other readers, for the most part. Goodreads, despite it's difficulties, feeds my soul.Facebook is dead to me. Yes, I'm there, but only to see cute pictures of my grandkids. I can do without Facebook, and am barely ever on there now. I keep a presence there so old high school friends can keep in touch and for family stuff, but I am now barely ever on there. Newport's book didn't start my process of leaving, but it definitely accelerated it.I love Twitter. I know, there's a lot to hate, but I do love it. However, I have changed my presence there dramatically. I followed about 4,000 people at one time. I've cut that down to under 1,000 and feel pretty great about that. Because now I can actually see the posts my friends make and the free static is much diminished now. I spot more articles and art that I like (loving art is another core value of mine), much of which I missed before because of all the flotsam and jetsam surrounding the really good posts.One habit I have changed on Twitter as a result of reading Newport's book is that I no longer ""like"" posts on Twitter. If I really like the post enough, I'll retweet it. Even better, if I really, really like the post, I will respond to the poster directly, rather than just clicking the little heart icon. I mean, really, who remembers who has ""liked"" their posts? Almost no one, in the long run. But I can recall some meaningful conversations that have happened between me and others on Twitter because I chose to respond and engage in real interaction rather than just satisfying my conscience by clicking like. I value those qualitatively-better conversations more and more as I avoid hitting the like button. This has made a huge difference in how I feel inside when I go online. Sounds corny, but it's true. Next month is February. I plan on taking the month offline except for Goodreads and blog posts. I have several blog posts that I have promised myself (hello, bullet journal) I would create, but have not. It's easier to go around liking stuff than it is actually creating stuff. And far less satisfying . . . I plan on re-engaging for that month as a creator. I have a denim jacket I got for Christmas that I'm going to sew over with patches I've bought. I will write more. I will read more. I will practice guitar more. I will RPG more. I will, in essence, live more. I will have to, in order to avoid boredom. Or, rather, to engage with and tackle boredom again. Then I'll come back and reassess my relationship with social media. You know, in some ways I really, really miss boredom. I need to go get into more trouble.Again, Goodreads friends need not worry. I will be here. And for the few people who actually read my blog, there will be posts. Many more posts. I've got to fill all that extra time up.Speaking of which, I need to do a few blog posts about my trip to Europe. I took lots of pictures . . . with my phone. See? I told you I wasn't a luddite!"
14,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6296289-tyler-j-gray,2,"2.25I have somewhat complicated feelings on this book. I feel like I need to say these are all just my opinions. Anyway..Through-out there were so many times I was internally screaming ""DISABLED PEOPLE EXIST!"" and wanting to DNF it. I almost wish I had. There is so much privilege that goes unseen that I wanted to scream. That's not to say I didn't get anything good out of this book, because I did, but it was a chore to wade through the privilege, so much of it I don't have myself, and the pretentiousness as well as an almost complete lack of being able to acknowledge the good social media has done. I know it has it's cons and flaws and people can definitely have an unhealthy relationship with it and the internet. Many do. That's a part of why I picked up this book. That doesn't mean it's evil, and I had heard that this book doesn't paint it as completely evil, and it doesn't. But it still drove me up a wall. The author even admits he has never used social media so you can take that how you want to as well.Personally I am physically disabled (as well as mental health issues that i've had long before social media-PTSD, Depression, Anxiety-that I have had my entire life due to my medical issues and I did grow up in a time before social media and the internet like it is today-mentioning that because it talks about how teens today are more anxious then ever before due largely to social media) as well as queer (non-binary trans and bisexual specifically), and i'll get to why I mention that in a second.Social media, even with it's cons, has given me a world of good. I grew up with VACteRL Association (used to be called VAteR syndrome) (capitalized like that because it's an acronym). I have rare medical issues and grew up with doctors constantly telling me ""never heard of that"" and looking at me like I got 3 heads. I still, less than 2 weeks away from being 31, have never, to my knowledge, met, in person, a SINGLE other person with vacterl. Not one. I grew up feeling all alone and like a freak of nature, in constant physical pain, like a burden because of the way people (including parents-not all of them-had 4 with stepparents) treated me, and like no one understood or even cared to. Add to that fact that at 13 I realized i'm bisexual and grew up thinking that's a sin and that I was going to hell for it. So I tried to pray myself straight for a few years. Obviously it didn't work. I'm proud to be queer now but man was it a journey. I also was confused as to my gender all my life but never had the words to describe how I felt.What does that have to do with social media? As an adult I found facebook groups for people with vacterl. Finally, I can talk to others that have the same medical issues, have had the exact same pain and problems, that understand because they go through it too. Some even older than me despite being told if I was born just years earlier i'd be dead. Do you know how valuable this is? In addition to realizing i'm not alone and that there are others out there that understand and care...we can also share medical information. This can save lives or at least help each other live a little better. With rare medical issues this is an understatement. Feeling all alone is the worst feeling.With social media I can now find many other disabled people who even when we have different issues we can often relate in certain ways. And I can find many other queer people now and see what teen me didn't get the chance to, that being queer isn't a bad thing. And now I know the word non-binary...finally, I understood my issue with not being able to describe my gender growing up. I knew how I felt LONG before I had the words. The word may be new to me, but the feelings aren't. Someone knowing that they aren't alone can save their LIFE. Many people don't have the privilege of having someone in their real life that understands or seems to care.Time and time again this book talks about strenuous activity and walking. Umm...physically disabled here. I can't walk much or physically do a lot. Some people...can't walk at all. It even says (talking about someone named Thoreau) ""But if we remain inspired by his vision, and try to spend as much time as is reasonable on foot and engaging in the ""noble art"" of walking, we too will experience success in preserving our health and spirits."" I didn't know I had picked up a fitness book. ""Noble art"" of walking? So what about those that can't walk? That can't get out much? My medical issues keep me home-bound and i'm far from the only home-bound disabled person. Through-out this book it completely forgets disabled people exist, that not everyone can walk or do strenuous activity, or get out of the house often, or has people around them in real life that actually care about them or that understand them in some way.It talks about craftsmanship, making things with your hands (not everyone has hands), and how making something in the physical real world is superior and seems to be what makes a person...matter. Time and time again it gives off the impression that if you are disabled, if you can't be handy in someway, you don't matter. Granted it seems to completely forget disabled people exist. The pretentiousness oozing off the pages made me want to throw it.It also constantly mentions smartphones and to use your desktop computer once in awhile and you're smartphone a lot less so you are on the internet less. I'm sure that can work for some people but it believes that everyone HAS a desktop computer. Many people are too poor and the only access they have to the internet is their smartphone. I'm quite the opposite, smartphones confuse the fuck out of me. I do have a tablet but I use that for ebooks mainly. I do have a desktop...that i'm always on. Because i'm home-bound.It also constantly says that downtime is overrated. Why must we always be productive? Why can't we just relax once in awhile? We aren't machines. We are human. Downtime can be necessary. Why must leisure activity be yet another thing to use as a measure of productivity and why must how productive someone is be tied to their worth as a human? When talking about leisure activities it kept saying ""high quality"" leisure activities aka strenuous and productive stuff.If you are wondering why I even picked it up, it's because I do want to be on the internet/social media less because I want to do other things. I want to draw, paint, write, read more. I thought maybe I could get something out of this book. And as I said in the beginning, I did. It's not without some words of wisdom or information that is useful as well as some things I wish more people knew. I don't actually regret reading it, I just didn't like reading it and it was hell to get through. I can't really recommend it and I feel like I wasted my money on it because I bet I could've just googled stuff. But the good stuff in it is why it gets a strong 2 stars from me, rather than ya know, 1 star.It talks about how we are social animals and how that evolved in our brains and why social media is kinda fucking with it. And how we aren't wired to be constantly wired, which i'd agree with. How we could generally use some solitude to be with our thoughts. A part of me hates to give it a low rating because of how valuable I actually do find the good in it. I would love a book on this topic but more nuanced and inter-sectional. I'm glad for what I got out of it and i'll try to take that and forget the rest of my frustrations with it.This review can also be found on my blog

15,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5501950-kate,3,"Cal Newport’s Digital Minimalism is Marie Kondo’s tidying philosophy applied to technology: technology isn’t inherently bad or good, but it should be judiciously curated to fit your pre-existing values of what constitutes a good life. Rather than going to Facebook or Instagram or a news feed of breaking news to find human connection and entertainment, pre-decide what you value in the spheres of entertainment and connection and then tailor the tools of social media to achieve those pre-defined objectives. The structure of Newport’s arguments: social media tools like Facebook and Twitter have been ruthlessly engineered to take up as much of our time as possible; the human brain is built in such a way that we become anxious and stressed seeking these notifications, yet their arrival fails to meet our need for real social communication; eliminating the things we’ve come to take for granted – constant access to a mobile phone, social media, and the internet – is much more possible than it sounds and is likely to result in significant long-term benefits. This last point forms the crux of much of what this book is based on, an experiment Newport ran with 1,600 of his e-mail list subscribers who already agreed to a 30-day “digital detox” and then shared their experiences with him. Many of Newport’s insights come from what his readers discovered, and throughout the book, he lays out various ways to try this detox in your own life.I suspect it will be difficult to fully appreciate this book unless you implement the recommended intervention. Without trying it, this book borders being viewed as one of the many get-rid-of-your-smartphone writings that have begun to appear over the last few years (I’ve read most of Newport’s previous books, and this was the first time I felt he published in the middle of a trend, rather than being at the forefront, or even being the catalyst for, a trend). Part of this is the fault of the book itself: unlike Deep Work or So Good They Can’t Ignore You, it’s poorly structured. The guide to follow the digital detox is all over the place, with some steps in the first few chapters and some in the last few; Newport introduces it before he’s had you buy in to the idea with background information on why digital addiction is bad, etc. That also means even readers who do try to implement the detox might not do so the way Newport intended, and fall off the wagon before they achieve the end goal. Due to being a longtime reader of Newport, I actually participated in his initial digital detox experiment and can say: it works, and it can significantly change your life. It’s why I gave this book 3 starts instead of 2 (in addition to the structural issue, Newport’s examples are often superficial and mainstream and unlikely to be new to many readers). Newport also offers three key points that might be lost if you’re not paying attention closely. First, he is not advocating for the elimination of all social tools. He is advocating instead for an intentional approach to your life: understanding your values, understanding what you need, and then crafting how you approach social media in response to that. With the recent “disconnect” trend, his work risks being labeled as a “get rid of everything” – when instead he’s only advocating “get rid of everything for 30 days as a way to gather data about what’s truly important to you.” Second, and possibly even more important: you will not succeed at removing social media and other distracting digital agents from your life unless you have something substantive to fill them with. Great, you stopped bingewatching Netflix for 3 hours each night – but if you haven’t cultivated something intentional to fill that three hours with (rock climbing, in-person dinner with friends, mastering the art of cooking, whatever), you’ll feel restless and empty and slide back into your previous habits. Finally, there is a difference between “connecting” with your network (passively liking someone’s new baby photos) and truly cultivating a relationship with them (going over to friend’s house to meet said new baby). We are being pushed more and more to connect, but connections are meaningless without those deeper underpinnings. Up until now, we’ve tended to talk about technology as “all good.” Newport encourages us to view it, “some parts of this are useful – use only those parts.” Time, as he discusses, is literally money – and your time starting a screen is making other people money. The people who built Facebook could not have done so if they had spent hours every day on social media platforms. So, in summary: An important message but you have to do Newport’s actual detox; that being said, this book is poorly structured and is a lot of repackaging of other people’s ideas."
16,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27482054-huyen-chip,0,The entire thesis of the book is: uninstall all your apps and only reinstall those that actually serve a purpose. The rest of the books is just examples.
17,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,4,"I've been trying to write this review for nearly a week, which has been repeatedly stymied by lack of focus and exhaustion due to sleeping badly. Consequently I have lowered my standards and invite you to lower your expectations.I was bitterly amused when, six months after I reserved a copy, 'Digital Minimalism' turned up in the library the day before lockdown. Amazing timing. Once my initial desire to read only escapist fiction had abated, however, it suddenly seemed like an ideal read at the moment. Lockdown has profoundly changed my relationship with technology, which will undoubtedly have long term effects. What most struck me when reading Newport's book, though, was that I still seem to qualify as a digital minimalist and possibly always have without being aware of it. The practicalities of digital minimalism are wildly different during a pandemic, though.For context, I have long believed that personal communication technology was fine until 2004, whereupon it went too far. Consequently, I hate touch screens, returned to using an unsmart phone after trying the smart kind, and relied solely upon second-hand electronics seven or more years old. I switched off my router for an entirely internet and screen free day once a week and restricted my social media use in various ways. Then coronavirus emerged. Initially, this led me further restrict my internet access, as the news and twitter were so anxiety-inducing. Almost exactly a month ago, though, Britain went into lockdown. I live alone and have been working at home, so haven't had a face-to-face conversation for more than a month. Being outside and anywhere near other human beings now feels like a terrifying threat. The same technologies I tried to reduce my use of are now absolutely essential, as they allow me connection with other human beings. Consequently, I've stopped having internet free days, allowed myself much more social media use, and, most significantly, purchased a new laptop. My creaky 7 year old machines repeatedly crashed during video calls. Part of my rationale for using old laptops and phones was to discourage their use through unreliability and inconvenience. I did not foresee the need to rely entirely upon them for human companionship.That's enough about me for the moment. 'Digital Minimalism' is the work of an American associate professor of computer science, whose central thesis is that technology use should be based on personal utility rather than reflexive adoption due to novelty. This is consistent with and complimentary to The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power, as it sets out strategies of personal resistance to the global phenomenon explained in Zuboff's book. Newport emphasises the deliberately manipulative design of social media, apps, and smart phones, which aim to consume as much of your time and attention as possible. The book makes its points via specific voices of authority and personal anecdote backed by academic research, as it is written to be widely accessible. The style is very easy to read, yet I was pleased to spot a thorough set of endnotes with citations as well.I appreciate that Newport distills his thesis into a single sentence for ease of quoting: Digital Minimalism.A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimised activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else.In other words, articulate the purposes of the time you spend on particular apps or websites. At present, goodreads lets me track my favourite hobby and read other people's book reviews. Twitter allows me to keep up with certain friends and their cats. Whatsapp allows me to keep up with other friends. Tumblr is a fashion and meme magazine. Netflix is my TV and cinema. Spotify is my stereo. Etc. However, I did not take Newport's suggested route to select these websites. He suggests you ask, ""Is this the best way to use technology to support this value?"" Before lockdown, probably not. I had additional and often better ways to keep up with nearby friends and pursue my interests in books, fashion, and films. Now those are not available. It is important to emphasise, though, that the online versions feel inferior. I miss hugging my friends and eating meals with them; I miss libraries; I miss browsing charity shops and spotting stylish outfits on passersby; I miss cinemas. Of course, I fully accept the need for lockdown and do not begrudge the lack of nonessential diversions in order to save lives. There are some tiny pleasures to this period of time, my favourite of which is walking on the road rather than the pavement on my daily walk. If you haven't tried this and the traffic has vanished from your roads too, I highly recommend it. While looking and listening carefully for vehicles, wander down the middle of a residential street - an experience to be savoured while it lasts. Cycling on empty roads is also pretty great. The principles of digital minimalism certainly chime with my pre-existing views: clutter is costly, optimisation is important, and intentionality is satisfying. I hate clutter in physical or digital realms, consider it important to use technology with specific aims in mind, and (as Newport admits is very common) can be a bit smug about it. There is something satisfying about seemingly getting one over on big tech in a tiny way. This is part of the reason I'm amused by the bizarre book recommendations that goodreads gives me (notably the Extraordinary Chickens saga); they suggest I'm not providing particularly helpful data. I don't want targeted recommendations! I love choosing books using my own arbitrary tastes and happenstance, rather than essentially being marketed them by amazon in a wig. Despite not always being amenable to Newport's choice of illustrative examples, due to transatlantic cultural differences, I approve of what he's saying in this book and enjoyed the structured and systematic way in which he explained it. To embrace digital minimalism, the recommendation is to spend 30 days taking a break from optional technologies (after carefully defining these in your own specific context). Although theoretically you could do this during lockdown, it seems like a dubious idea. For a start, my mind isn't clear enough to judge what is and isn't optional as at least a third of it is busy yelling PANIC PANIC DEATH DEATH at all times. Moreover, during the next 30 days the technologies that are optional in my life might change substantially as lockdown restrictions and/or work demands change. Most importantly, however, the idea is to rediscover non-digital pursuits during the 30 days, which is simply impossible at present. To rediscover an activity at the moment, everything required for it must already be within your home. Crucially, this includes motivation and energy, both of which are scarcer than flour and yeast. (I actually have both flour and slightly expired yeast, but more than a month into lockdown have not tried baking bread. I feel quite guilty about that.) After describing the 30 day digital break procedure, Newport suggests a range of thoughtful practises to manage your new relationship with technology. Unfortunately these begin with a chapter titled, 'Spend Time Alone'. There will undoubtedly be many books written about feeling alone or otherwise during the pandemic. The core of the matter is, I think, that how alone we feel is no longer under our control in the same way. I live alone, so am alone all the time that I'm not on a video call whether I like it or not. Colleagues and friends with partners, housemates, and/or children are barely ever alone whether they like it or not. This lockdown has certainly caused me to reflect on what I do and don't miss about human companionship, as I'm sure is the case for many. More than a month in, I still think that for me being in lockdown alone is the least worst alternative. I wish I had a cat, though. Newport is a great advocate for taking walks alone without your phone and I fully agree with that. He considers time spent alone with your thoughts to be very important, which is no less relevant indoors than outside. Sticking your head out of the window and listening to the changed tempo of sounds is a pleasant little mindfulness exercise I've been trying. While at the moment I consider video calling vital to avoid total isolation, I wonder to what extent my insomnia, absence of concentration, and inability to relax at all is exacerbated by constant screentime and increased social media scrolling. I think of the latter as a tranquiliser, while fully aware that reading a book has a much more calming effect (if I can concentrate on a book). On twitter there is the constant risk of falling down a rabbit hole of extremely worrying and totally unconfirmed pandemic content, even when you take precautions. I lock my twitter, follow only 50 accounts the majority of which are IRL friends, and always keep my timeline set to Latest Tweets.The big question raised by lockdown in the context of this book is where to direct your attention. The Big Five tech companies obviously want it, to provide them with data. In the time before the pandemic there were plenty of other things to pay attention to that are now on hold: meeting up with friends and family, going to the cinema, visiting beautiful places, going to museums, art galleries, and libraries, etc, etc. I adore reading, but even I could not face being at home for >23 hours a day, working for 8, sleeping badly for 7ish, and reading the rest of the time. Technology's addictive glow is more attractive when there's such a terrifying reality to be distracted from. I think lockdown requires a very different personal agreement to be negotiated with technology. I definitely haven't got it right yet; scrolling twitter at 2am is obviously not conducive to sleeping well and distraction by further fragmenting my attention isn't very calming.Being a digital minimalist requires, 'stripping away superfluous features of new technologies to allow them to access functions that matter while avoiding unnecessary distraction'. This can be genuinely difficult, as functions I consider superfluous after often complex or even impossible to switch off. There is also the question of how much distraction is genuinely necessary right now. I am still closely controlling my news access, because the ever-growing coronavirus death toll and shockingly incompetent political responses in the UK and US are very distressing. No-one gains from my being too weepy or anxious to work from home because of news overload. Rewatching my favourite sitcom (Community) and looking at pictures of pets feel like necessary distraction right now. Nonetheless, I worry that too much screentime is going to worsen my eyesight and create habits that will be difficult to modify. On the other hand, I've been reassuring my students that this is a time of crisis so they should not expect themselves to be able to work as normal. I could maybe listen to my own advice and not pressure myself to cope in a totally optimised and systematically thought out manner. I suspect some would find 'Digital Minimalism' grating at the moment, as parts of it do provoke sighs of amazement and sadness at what we took for granted a mere few months ago. While I still found it worthwhile, it basically confirmed my pre-existing views and pre-lockdown behaviour so your mileage may vary substantially. For those not overloaded with caring responsibilities and other work, lockdown potentially offers the time for introspection combined with utterly unsuitable conditions for it. A state of intense anxiety and total lack of certainty about the future is making it difficult for me to think at all and I'm definitely not the only one. Nonetheless, spending more time than ever using digital technologies should really encourage us to consider what we're using them for and whether that's actually what we want, now and once we can venture outside again. Minor tweaks to technology use can really improve morale. With the disclaimer that I have no authority to recommend anything to anyone, here are my tips for digital minimalism during a pandemic:- Daily walks. In the UK, you can go outside for one form of exercise a day. I've been forensically exploring my local area to improve the scope and detail of my mental map. Appreciate the lack of traffic while you can. All I take with me on these walks (or bike rides) are my keys, never my phone or headphones.- When watching TV or a film, do some simple crafts that you already knew how to do. I've knitted a somewhat slapdash cowl.- Limit your time reading news. I only allow myself 30 minutes a day. All articles, absolutely no liveblogs. I don't follow any news accounts or journalists on any social media. If someone I know retweets lots of news, I switch off their retweets or even mute them. - Prune who and what you follow on social media. Tweak your feeds so they provide what you actually want: cat pictures, news from your friends, etc. I hate facebook so suggest not using that at all.- Keep a paper diary. I began one at the start of the year and of course it has turned into The Coronavirus Chronicles. I'm finding it very helpful, given that time has become such a peculiar frangible thing, to record at the end of the day what I actually did with myself. What work did I manage, what did I read, who did I talk to or exchange messages with, what do I remember of the news articles I read, how do I feel about it all, etc. - Two of Newport's suggestions that are still absolutely relevant and I already did: don't click like and consolidate your text-based messaging into a single service if remotely possible. Finally, for personal amusement reasons I've adopted Victorian terminology for my newly digitalised social life. I think it sounds less awkward! Examples: ""I paid a call on my parents yesterday evening"" = we videochatted via an iPad propped on the kitchen worksurface. ""I will be at home to callers on Friday evening."" = catch me on whatsapp at the end of the week. ""Here is my calling card."" = this is the link for the Zoom meeting. ""How would you prefer me to call upon you?"" = do you want to use skype, zoom, or hangouts? ""I am not at home to callers."" = this evening I prefer to be alone with netflix and my knitting. There's no real connection to digital minimalism, but I find being archaically formal makes total separation from people I love very slightly less depressing."

I've found myself sitting down with a cup of coffee for a quick scroll of content, looking up to find 30 minutes or more have passed. The thing is, these social media scrolls rarely leave me feeling the way, say, a great book does: rewarded, challenged, or that I have just spent my time doing something useful. All the same, I found it harder and harder to pull away from my screen (I'm sure the feeling is nigh-universal these days). I decided to veer away from my typical reading and try out a self-help book about how to remodel my relationship to these new technologies.I started out this audiobook and had some major worries: would this book work as well in audio when so much is given as ""practices and exercises?"" I was right to feel tentative since this book, for most people, is going to work a lot better in print than it is playing through your ears. Nonetheless, for my purposes the book was able to deliver its thesis and provide some helpful tips on how to curb social media/screen time use. Cal Newport does a good job providing helpful tips and educating the listener about how exactly these apps can sap your will to be functional. Occasionally I found the book to be a touch on the preachy side, but that's not to be entirely unexpected in a self-help book. More often than not I found myself able to take a piece of Newport's suggested practice and put it into play in my daily life. My phone is now entirely black and white (a change that my friends describe as Schindler's List: iPhone edition), all social media (excepting Goodreads!) has been scrubbed from my phone, and I've been doing my best to divert my time to more fulfilling activities. My wife and I have even been engaging in a modified digital declutter! I'm not going to take up all of the practices that Newport describes--indeed, there's a lot here that just doesn't jive with some of my professional requirements--but it's been enough to make a real difference.Definitely a step outside of my reading comfort zone, but one that has had pretty positive effects on my screen time. I'll be recommending this to a few friends over the coming year."
19,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,4,"I picked this book up on a whim at Helsinki airport a week ago. For a few months, I've been trying unsuccessfully to reduce the amount of time I spend browsing social media on my phone. The screen time report has been dismal reading. I also realize that when I am tired after a long day at the office, my capacity to resist is next to nil.I am now going to make a serious attempt at decluttering my digital life. Tonight I will delete all social media on my phone and take a 30 day break. I feel horrible. I absolutely don't want to do it. However, after months of failed attempts to curtail my use , I do see that a sabbatical is the only way. After 30 days I presume I will go back to using Facebook at least, and absolutely Goodreads. Goodreads is the only one I am considering not blocking completely. Maybe I'll log in on PC once a week on Saturday? But no. I can do it. I can be strong. For 30 days I will only review with paper and pen and I'll write up my reviews in May. ""Your monthlong break from optional technologies resest your digital life. You can now rebuild it from stratch in a much more intentional and minimalist manner. To do so, apply a three-step technology screen to each optional technology you're thinking about reintroducing.""""To allow an optional technology back into your life at the end of the digital declutter it must:1. Serve something you deeply value (offering some benefit is not enough.)2. Be the best way to use technology to serve this value (if it's not, replace it with something better).3. Have a role in your life that is constrained with a standard operating procedure that specifies when and how you use it.""So my friends - good bye! I will be back on May 1. There is no doubt in my mind that Goodreads will be on my re-introduction list. I love books and this community, that has let me discover so many great stories I might otherwise have overlooked. "

I loved this book -- it spurred me to take a 30-day break from Instagram, and I look forward to re-reading it in the future to keep me thinking about the role of social media and general technology in my life!"
21,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62650776-luke-bacich,5,Deep work (Cal's previous book) is my favourite book; it overhauled how I stay focused during the work day in an age of distraction.

22,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13198822-settare,2,"During the first half of 2019, I was reading mostly about environmental issues, which led me to read a few books on the Zero Waste lifestyle, which then led me to read a few books on minimalism (or rather, starting a few books on minimalism, getting through most of them, but almost never finishing them). I have implemented many minimalist and zero waste practices in my own life since, and it has benefited me. Then, as I have always been struggling with social media addiction, I came across this book. This book is alright. It's well written, interesting, and its logos is so convincing that it made me deactivate all of my social media accounts and go -almost- completely offline for around six months during the second half of 2019. The book makes some very interesting (and unsettling) points about how our infatuation with the screen of our phones and laptops has had many negative effects on our lives and minds as a whole. Then in the last part of the book, Newport lays out his suggestions for how to become a ""digital minimalist"" and how to reduce social media time (and online time in general) into the absolute minimum. While I think his suggestions are all nice and applicable and even liberating for someone in his situation (A middle-class white person living in a developed country, who has most of his loved ones within a rather short distance and whose life isn't constantly disrupted by political news and also doesn't rely on the internet to make a living or advocate for his work), they simply do not work for many of us in less privileged situations and/or less developed countries. I live in Iran, I have most of my friends and loved ones scattered around the globe, each in a different time zone, I get to see them once every few years, and my life is constantly disrupted by heated political news and war threats in the region. I don't see myself being able to implement Mr. Newport's full recipe to digital oblivion in my own life in any way, and thinking about the fact that I can't live up to them gives me a lot of anxiety. I have certainly benefited from the tips and methods, but I don't see myself being able to convert to complete digital minimalism.In short, it's an interesting book, it makes some important points, it's worth the read, I've learned some habits and tips from it, and that's great. If you can consider adopting only a few of the practices it suggests to any extent that is possible for you, or even be a bit more mindful of your online life, then I think the book has had its impact, and it can, in my opinion, improve your life even if just a little bit.

27,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25226945-ashley,4,"Reviewed on: Ashes Books & Bobs.The moment I saw the cover for this book, I knew I had to pick it up. I often find myself overwhelmed by technology. While others seem at ease holding a conversation, scheduling an Uber, and texting 3 different friends, my mind struggles to keep up with one task at a time. I feel strained and exhausted by information overload. I want to be on social media less and in the real world more. Yet, when ten different people are needing ten different things in one moment, how are we to keep up, if not for technology?Since this book released, I’ve seen many negative reviews berating this book on bookstagram. Yet, I think it’s important to examine the source of the reviews here. As a bookstagrammer myself, it’s easy to get sucked into the black hole of beautifully cozy book pictures and chatting with fellow book lovers. The next time you look up, 2 hours have vanished in a flash. The internet is addictive, and like the addicts some of us are, it’s hard to admit we have a problem. Earlier this year I decided to take stock of my social media usage and I came to a few realizations about how the internet environment was affecting me. Since then, I’ve drastically reduced the amount of time I spend online. Some of the things I’ve found helpful were even mentioned in this book, like turning off social media notifications and creating set times to check my online accounts. These tools and others mentioned in this book have helped the level of overwhelm I feel on a daily basis, allowing me to reclaim pockets of time that were whittled away online. Still, I feel that addictive pull urging me to log in and scroll.In many ways, I’m technologically inept. It took a weekend away in Richmond, VA to learn how to use the AirDrop feature on my phone. I’m sure there are plenty of features I don’t know how to use, but I’m still severely dependent upon my smartphone. I was hoping this book would allow me to evaluate ways to manage that dependence on an even deeper level. You see, my husband doesn’t have a cell phone at all. He is the essence of what this book is about. I see how stressfree his life is, how much free time he’s able to claim, and how little the pings, dings, and rings affect him. When someone isn’t accessible, people find someone else to bother. And I’m a little envious.Cal Newport did an exceptional job of relaying the information in this book in a highly interesting way. It’s rare that I find a nonfiction book I can’t stop thinking about. Since I’ve finished reading the book, I’ll notice things that were mentioned in the writing in my daily life, sparking thoughts and ideas. I especially loved the use of Henry David Thoreau’s Walden as a prime comparison for the Digital Minimalism philosophy. Thoreau’s writings are some of my all-time favorites, sparking a sense of wonder and motivation in me to live a simpler life. Why not apply the same principals to the modern world that often constrains us in the tightest boxes while forcing us to believe we have ultimate freedom? The first time Thoreau’s name was mentioned, I was sold.Furthermore, I appreciated the depth in which Newport was able to detail how deeply our fast-paced, hyper-connected society is affecting our mental health and physical well -being. Depression and anxiety are at all-time highs, especially in our teens and young adults and yet we can’t seem to correlate that with our social media consumption. We truly aren’t able to understand the effects of smartphones on our overall health because they are still relatively new inventions. How much of our attention, concentration, and self-worth are these tools diminishing?There are so many thought-provoking aspects of this book, I could discuss it for days. It made a profound impact on my thinking and reaffirmed many things I already knew. Most importantly, however, this book is not attacking anyone for their smartphone use. It’s simply asking us to evaluate our needs for our own lives and adjust in a way that will benefit our lifestyle. If you’re like I was and feeling a sense of constant overwhelm, I think this book is worth a purchase. I honestly think it could benefit every single smartphone user if read with an open mind. I highly recommend it!"
28,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4243437-viv-jm,4,"There seems a certain irony in the fact that I read this on an electronic device and am reviewing it on a social media site...ho hum.Newport casts an enquiring and sceptical eye over our use of social media and addiction to smart phones. The history of social media and how it is engineering to be so compelling was an eye opener. He gives very useful ideas about how we can rebel against the ""attention economy"". The author stresses the importance of spending time being bored and being alone with our thoughts, which is definitely something to mull over!A useful book with practical advice that will change my approach to technology. Recommended. "
29,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12889617-anne,4,I found this book insightful - it's important conversation that we need to have with ourselves to take more conscious control over the degree to which we allow our digital devices to suck up our time. Newport provides some helpful concrete changes that make a lot of sense! 
30,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53304148-tim-casteel,5,"Shockingly, Newport has never ever had a social media account. So why write a book on technology?Because he (rightly) sees that our screens are ""the single biggest factor shaping our lives today.”Digital Minimalism was written to help us find a way ""to be fully human.”The main obstacle= our phones.We need something to keep us from staring into the abyss (most choose to be distracted by their phones). Newport espouses active leisure and community as that replacement: ""quality activities fill the void your screens were previously tasked to help you ignore.” Which is brilliant and true. But not sufficient (more on that below).Newport’s unique and important contribution to the technology conversation is he does not merely dwell on the negative psychological effects of technology (distraction, envy, lust). Newport suggests the main problem:""I want to bypass a discussion of the potential pathologies of the social media universe and keep our focus on the zero-sum relationship between online and offline interaction.I believe this to be the most fundamental of the issues caused by the digital communication era.""Newport’s other unique insight: in order to displace the gravitational pull of our phones, we need to replace it with something (high value activities and community). He begins with Why. Why give up hours on your phone? Because you want more time to invest in things that actually satisfy - more time in face-to-face relationships, more time to invest in active leisure. Reminds me of Chalmer’s “the only way to dispossess it of an old affection, is by the expulsive power of a new one.”As much as I loved Digital Minimalism (5 stars for sure!) Newport lack of faith prevents him from seeing spiritual solutions. His diagnosis is spot on. But his cure of active leisure falls short.Here's my quick spiritual analysis of Digital MinimalismBad - mindless phone scrolling* We vindicate our worth through likesBetter - active leisure in community (where Newport leaves us)* We vindicate our worth through intentional living and producing real things of real valueBest - rest and community * We can rest because we are vindicated by Christ. We don't need to DO anything (not even active leisure) to validate our existence.(Philosopher Josef Pieper powerfully makes this connection in Leisure: the Basis of Culture- ""leisure is not possible unless it has a durable…link with…divine worship.""An easier to read version is found in Buchanan's The Rest of God)"
31,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33041331-rian-merwe,5,"I read this book over the weekend, and it exceeded my expectations. I was a little worried it would just be a re-hashing of his previous book Deep Work, through a slightly different lens, but it’s not that at all. Cal brings in lots of psychology, and provides practical (and pragmatic) recommendations for cultivating a better relationship with technology.He also draws heavily from the experience of about 1,600 people who undertook a 30-day “technology declutter” during the research phase for the book. Cal uses their stories to share what worked for them, what didn’t work, and ways to address some of the most common pitfalls of trying to become a digital minimalist.I won’t lie, this book is scary. It’s making me rethink every single online service I use, and I realize that I’m going to give up a lot of it. But I also somehow feel lighter and freer, having come to those conclusions.Cal isn’t dogmatic in his approach in this book. He lays out the evidence for why the intermittent positive reinforcement and drive for social approval that are built into social media is detrimental to our mental health and relationships. He gives practical advice on how to choose and use the tools that will provide benefit to you. But then he also tells you to use the principles behind what he’s saying, but do what works for you. I really appreciate that."
32,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27649191-justin-weiss,4,"I liked this a lot better than I expected to. A few years ago I made a real effort to more intentionally use social media and online news, moving toward more of an ""I find it"" vs ""it finds me,"" and really heavily restricting what comes into my brain. It was _amazing_, really changed my mood and my attitude. So I was expecting this to be a rehash of what I had already bought into, along with the typical 200 pages of padding.There was some really great stuff in here, though! I loved the sections about finding high-quality real-life activities to replace optional online media with, instead of just giving it up. I liked the focus on using social media purely to set up real-world conversations and meetings.There was enough here to recommend it even to people who've already bought into the premise. And if you haven't yet, this was probably the second most frightening book I've read this year after Why We Sleep."
33,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44176714-goce,5,"Since I already kind of have a few principles on using social media and digital devices, this book helped me confirm my principles and maybe even nudged me to think about these topics a bit more.I would recommend this book to anyone, especially to those ""addicted"" to social media. What I liked the most is that every information presented in the book was linked with a scientific article, or another book, or some study, meaning that they are true and not just some stories about some people who found technique X useful to improve their Y as all the self improvement books are made of.Furthermore, I identified even more with the author's thinking since we are more or less working in the same industry (Computer Science) and are both critically evaluating the products and tools that we (not we directly, but we as an industry) are building."
34,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4636758-vanessa,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this. It's the first time in a while that I've read a non-fiction text that deals with minimising digital life but actually finds new and fresh ways to suggest how to make changes. The inclusion of everyday people and their experiences with Newport's steps really helped bring a more practical, realistic nature to the book. I also liked the fact that this didn't completely demonise social media in the same way other books can do. I kind of wish I'd read this in physical format though, as the audiobook isn't narrated by Newport and I'd have liked to have heard him read it himself. I'll probably end up picking up a physical copy though and re-reading it at some point because I want to annotate the shit out of this as I try and implement some of Newport's suggestions."

But this could have been a Medium blog post. Not sure if a full blown book format was required...I also must confess that the tone and phrasing the author uses in his books keeps riling me up. It could be me, but I feel patronised reading his books. So I ended up skipping some bits.So if screen time takes a toll on your life - give it a go. Otherwise you can press on to better reads."

38,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,3,"Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noise World is a self-help book for those who wish to change because their real life has been negatively impacted by their digital life. Among many devices, apps and entertainment tools, the author sets his eyes mostly on mobile phones and social medias when arguing about the principles of digital minimalism and their implementation. I like the psychology part. As a computer engineer, I know very well that mobile apps and social medias are not ""gifts from Nerd gods building a better world"", but money making machines designed to make users spend as much time as possible on their sites or apps. Time is money. Your attention and your data are their money. Adam Alter's book Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked (my review) is quoted in this book. Two common psychological tools--intermittent positive reenforcement and our internal drive for social approval--are what employed to make us addicted. In 2013, DSM5 first time included behavior addiction.However, the focus of the book is not psychology, but self-help. The main steps of the author's digital minimalism are digital de-clutter and building a meaningful, high-quality leisure. Some arguments are philosophical, such as the necessity of solitude. The author is a fan of Thoreau and earlier Presidents of the United States.I agree with the principles of the digital minimalism. Some of his advices are useful, and some are not. Removing all social medias from your mobile phone is a good idea. I often compulsively check my phone because it's a distraction from tasks at hand that I do not like. To implement digital minimalism is to evaluate and re-construct your daily life.The chapter about real life socializing is impractical to a lot of the people in today's busy ultra-metropolitan life. The author has not considered introverts. Introverts seldom seek out social gatherings. It's not saying introverts don't need social connections. They prefer deep, meaningful connections that are increasingly hard to find. For these introverts, no much difference between superficial, light-touch connections and relationships in real life or online.This book is good for those not yet qualified as behavior addiction and without complications such as OCD or anxiety disorder."
39,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31175254-sudheendra-fadnis,4,"Another master piece from Cal Newport. While the book Deep Work stresses on how to thrive professionally, this one is all about how to flourish in our personal lives through discretionary use of social media. We should be the masters of the technology we use, and not the other way around. We live in an age of dramatic distractions , which is driven by the attention merchants such as Facebook, Instagram , Twitter etc.Now a these days one's attention has become one of the most valuable resources in the world. And companies such as Google or Facebook for that matter, do all they can to hijack our attention and make us spend as much time as we could on the social media , because it drives their revenue. This should not sound like a conspiracy though. That is how their business models are built. Spending time on social media is like playing a slot machine. Once you are in, you get addicted to it.However, as Cal Newport makes it clear in the book, it is the unexpectedness of the information updates that makes social media an addictive phenomenon. The only remedy for this , as Cal Newport suggests is to go on a Digital Detox for a month, which might revolutionize the way you live your life. However, the digital diet should be based on the philosophy of technology, which states that you take stock of the digital distractions you have in your life, conduct an audit of the activities which are valuable and meaningful to you, and subtracts the digital distractions that add little or no value to your life. The most interesting thing about this book was the importance of solitude. The greats like Arthur Schopenhaeur, Fredreich Nietzsche, Soren Kierkegaard, Descartes, and many others harnessed the power of solitude to come up with world-changing ideas. In today's world, what we commonly observe is 'solitude deprivation'.The next highlight which I liked about this book is the importance of long walks. The greats such as Henry David Thoreau and Fredreich Nietzsche could get their game-changing ideas through long walks. Most recently, Steve Jobs. The one advice which particularly stuck with me was: ""never hit the like button'. Also, the importance of High quality leisure also deserves an honorable mention. This is not some thing only the FI(Financially Independent) can afford. Anybody can do it. The free time that we have at our disposal should not be spent on passive consumption of social media, which requires little or no cognitive effort. Rather it should be directed towards activities which require concentrated effort such as reading a difficult piece of literature or a strenuous workout. The next value add activity which he mentions is writing letters to self. Through this, we develop the ability of thinking on the paper. Abraham Lincoln and Dwight D Eisenhower, I learnt had this habit. It is very encouraging to learn that I am already implementing some of the tips given in the book. All in all, it was a great read."
40,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59737478-amine,4,"For starters, I recommend this book to anyone struggling with this fast noisy age of information and social media we live in today, that is, I recommend this book to almost anyone, but especially to people of my generation.I have come to see this book as some kind of survival guide in the wilderness. Only, surviving means how to make the best of, and you may be inclined to miss that you are in a wilderness, and are being preyed on.Digital minimalism is a philosophy followed by many in this time and world, and from what I saw, adopting this philosophy if the best way to conquer and thrive in the age of information.The main issue this book deals with is social media. Cliché a bit I know. A subtle downside to this book is that Cal Newport never entered the social media sphere. So you are told how to quit an addiction by someone who has never experienced it. That proves to be an advantage of sorts sometimes, and he makes up for it with extensive research.This book starts by convincing you that the life you are living with social media is inconvenient at best. Moving on, you get introduced to digital minimalism and the various techniques that come with it to overcome an addiction, and use digital tools without letting them use you.Over the course of the book, Cal Newport draws from the wisdom of great thinkers, from Nitzsche to Teddy Roosevelt, as well as various examples from people like you and me, who emphasize his arguments for digital minimalism.If you are here, reading this review, you should probably pick this book up, read it, and apply what it prescribes to the best of your ability."

Many of the platforms we use carefully engineer their products to compete for the little attention we have left and sell it to advertisers.

Digital MinimalismA philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else.
I logged out of Facebook since late March because of misleading news related to Covid-19. I told my self that it's temporary and that I'm going to go back using it ASAP. But those months of freedom tasted different. Words can't describe how I felt not using the only social media I use. Just know that I'm not addicted as many people I know, but dumping it made me realise how it used to drain my energy, and that I'm well off without it. Back to this amazing book. We're almost back to college, and I really need FB in my studies. I was anxious because I didn't want to fall in that hole again, until this book was recommended to me. What I liked about this book is that it's full of real stories from different kinds of people. Different and manageable practices are mentioned too, some of them I'm currently practicing, others I'm willing to try. What I'm writing right now is like a letter to the future me. I want her to remember how I felt not using social media, a d how this book has changed her mind. If you didn't read this book, JUST READ IT!!  You'll thank me later. Ps. Thanks to my friend Emy who recommended this book. You really saved me ❤️"
43,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1974052-milan,3,There is nothing path-breaking in this book by Cal Newport. Most of the stuff he mentions I’m already aware of. The hard part is implementing it. The good part is – it is all collected together in a book. The basic idea is – less is more. But that is true for most things in life. A few points from the book:•	Delete social media apps from the phone (only have one installed)•	Install apps that limit mobile apps usage (don't find it too useful)•	Downgrade to a dumb phone like in the old days (very tough to do)•	Remove all notifications (already doing it)•	Delete unnecessary files and programs from your laptop (already doing)•	Stop online gaming or binge TV watching (don't do either)•	Provide a fixed timing for people to call you (not very practical in India)•	Look for leisure activities in the real world (doing sometimes)•	Live off grid if you are financially independent (not yet financially independent)•	30-day fast “declutter” from optional technologies (already use bare minimum)•	Don't use your device as a computer (have to do for a few things)•	Join social groups/clubs offline (difficult to manage time-wise)•	Plan downtime (this one I find easy to do)•	Make room for more high-quality time while limiting low-quality activities (trying)•	Unsubscribe from anything you don’t need (in progress)•	Solitude is one way to feeling more meaningful (doing sometimes)•	Read more books (trying to do all the time)

Rather than being just a way to connect with our friends, facebook has mastered the art of the slot machine, giving us random and variable rewards. That has been found to be the most addictive of all; just look at slot machines, the Japanese Pachinko or channel surfing. I totally agree with this. 2. The only way out is Digital Minimalism. There are many ways to do it: 2.1. Deleting the mobile facebook app, using only the desktop version. 2:2. Install apps that limit mobile apps usage. 2.3. Downgrade to a dumb phone2.4. Remove all notification, even to the permanent ‘Do not Disturb’ mode. 2.5. Provide a fixed timing for people to look for you or call you, but no random texting and expecting instant answers. 2.6. Stop online gaming or binge TV watching. Maybe limit this only with friends. 3. Find something else to do:3.1. Social gym going3.2. Book clubs3.3. Relearn the musical instrument that you used to play3.4. Crafting something3.5.

Newport gives ample historical and modern evidence for the benefits seen in adopting the digital minimalism philosophy, which is using technology to focus on a small number of things that you value and (happily) missing out on everything else.

The man gives you material for the long haul and we have no choice but to stan.I would definitely buy this book irl (my mom actually got a copy for herself #myimpact) to highlight and annotate the heck out of because this bad boy is full of good info. if you're like me and have been feeling like social media, your phone, or other optional technologies have become an unnecessary weight, i HIGHLY recommend this book. however, if you go in with the mindset of 'meh. old people just don't get the wonderful joys of the technology captured lifestyle' this book may not be for you.or maybe it's especially for youfood for thought"

50,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28266634-liza-fireman,3,"I am quite torn about this book. I value real life activities and relationships a lot, and on that front I agree with the author that we should make sure to keep our time protected and not just be on screen all the time. It is especially a challenge for people who were born into this situation and maybe never learned enough about human connection and how to get off the screen. On the other hand, I didn't like the tone or the preaching. I didn't like the warnings and the negativity. Technology is also awesome, and I would hope that there are other ways to keep it in check.The book also contradicts itself many times with its ambivalent attitude towards technology. I think the author meant to show balance, but ended up being quite confused. The advice in the book are also not going to be practical for many people, so I felt a miss there too.Overall, I will give it 3 stars, even though it is a bit below. I hope everyone will try to keep real life and real connections a priority, even if they enjoy the occasional like or being up to date with far high school friends. "
51,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84849916-alex-go,4,"I always tell myself that a digital detox would be great, that I need to get away from social media. This book is what allowed me to push myself over the edge to delete social media from my phone. In this book, Newport does not only do a great job in explaining why it is so important to be a digital minimalist, but he also gives concrete steps on how to approach and maintain this lifestyle. I would strongly recommend this book to people who want to get rid of social media, but never could commit to it. I would also recommend it to people who do not believe society's addiction to social media is a problem. Newport rightfully prompts readers to think critically about all the relationships you have through social media. If the relationship only exists or primarily exists in this medium, is it really worth keeping?"
52,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1562431-melissa-mann,4,"“Digital minimalism: A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else.”I read this book while hiking across the tropical savannah of central Brazil, six days entirely out of carrier range aided by a battery that died mid-crossing and that was met at campsites by rain-imposed power outages cosmically meant to ensure it remain entirely disregarded deep in the depths of my backpack. My out-of-office message did not instruct people whom to contact in the case of an interpreting/translating/voiceover emergency nor did it justify my absence with an explanation of where I was or why I was there, just: “I’m offline. I’ll be back on such-and-such day. – M.” I know I lost some work; I don’t know if I lost any clients. But I am sure I surrendered to my lack of control.Newport does a spectacular job engagingly explaining the science behind our digital behavior and increasingly digital addictions, first teasing out what we social beings ultimately must have to ensure ongoing healthy and necessary interactions, then guiding his readers through his recipe for resetting and reconfiguring our relationship with online media. He is no Luddite; he does use a computer and a cell phone and he streams movies and music. By all means, he offers, we should certainly use the online social tools at our disposal, but only once we’ve figured out where within the digital fog we find ourselves, having found a method in the madness we must reflect upon.The most salient point Newport makes is how critical it is that we tune into INTENTIONALITY: being intentional in what we do, how we do it, why we do it and when we do it in the digital universe. After bemoaning how we’ve collectively come to a point of vast solitude deprivation (“a state in which you spend close to zero time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from other minds”), he launches into a straightforward primer for training our monkey minds by doing a deep-clean of the digital clutter we accumulate every day.He preaches a hard-core digital detox for a month – accessing/keeping only those apps/sites absolutely necessary for survival, a threshold that obviously shifts depending on one’s professional and personal circumstances; and setting up strict rules for when and how the apps/sites/tools allowed during the detox are to be used – that I have (sigh!) yet to implement. This is to be followed by a guided, deliberate reintroduction of the bare bones digital necessities only once two questions have been answered in the affirmative: “Does this technology directly support something that I deeply value?” and “Is this technology the best way to support this value?”. Honestly I have not detoxed not because I am addicted to social media and digital tools (see next paragraph), but because I have not set aside time to think deeply about the rules for my exceptions (plus, gasp, is Goodreads in or out?).Here is what happened upon my emergence from the quiet corner of the unusually lush and flowering Brazilian cerrado: I checked e-mail and WhatsApp (Brazil’s de facto means of client communication) immediately upon my return, allotting myself exactly one hour to answer only the e-mails I deemed professionally critical. I sheepishly admit I spent a fair amount of time over the following days catching up on job-related e-mails as I wasn’t quite in a financial position to throw in the professional towel. But it did actually take me six days to open social media. In the ten weeks since, I have logged a total of under eight hours on Facebook and Instagram combined and I haven’t posted a single photo from the trip. It has been truly liberating.Newport would likely admonish me for cutting corners. “If you begin decluttering the low-value digital distractions from your life before you’ve convincingly filled in the void they were helping you ignore,” he writes, “the experience will be unnecessarily unpleasant at best and a massive failure at worse.” Translation: I am possibly setting myself up for a failed experiment because, for me, Instagram and Facebook are, by and large, low-value digital distractions, ones that I find quite easy to cull from my life. In other words, if you don’t do a full-fledged detox, you’re depriving yourself of truly understanding why you let your attention get so cluttered (in his words, “clutter is costly”) in the first place and are setting yourself up for mucking up your newfound intentionality pretty quickly.Maybe this will be my February resolution. Maybe not. Either way, even without embracing Newport’s very compelling argument to do a month-long, hard-core cleanse, I am still basking in the respite that has resulted from reading this book in a place that pulsed with a million breathtaking reasons to be entirely offline and entirely intentional."

54,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90500036-abby-deane,5,After reading I am only left with the questionShould I reread or tell everyone I love to read this book first? 
55,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25300361-lacey,1,"The most pretentious and rambling book I've ever read.For a book about minimalism, Cal Newport sure does waste a lot of time and words to say very little. Ironically, this whole book could have been a Twitter thread. He does offer a few tidbits of practical advice, but it's all bogged down by pretentious musings and circular prose. Basically, Newport suggests the following: Delete your social apps from your phone. Become more intentional with your social media use; that includes being aware of why you remain on social and how to achieve those goals without mindlessly tapping and swiping. Get ""non-digital"" hobbies. Read real books. Talk walks. Nothing groundbreaking, honestly, but stuff that's good for us all to hear. What really pushed this book from a two-star read to a one-star read is just how smug the author comes off. To begin with, he's never even used social media. We're told this repeatedly. Not really sure how he can relate to the rest of us, as he doesn't seem to fully understand the role that social media plays in a lot of people's lives. I have friends I've met on Twitter -- that I only know from Twitter. No, we're not all BFFs, but I value those connections, especially since we share many interests that my IRL friends and I don't.Privilege is baked into the book. Most of his advice just boils down to being rich or spending money on something. For example, we're told to cultivate more ""non-digital"" habits to break away from our computers. In the chapter, we meet some dude who has somehow achieved financial independence in his 30s (curious as to how he did that? Me too. We never hear the secret behind this major accomplishment. I'm going to guess it's ""having rich parents""). After getting a expensive welding estimate from a metal smith, dude decides to just buy all the equipment himself and teach himself how to weld. He was able to provide his own iron works, as well as sell some to friends and family. It's so out of touch. How do I apply this example to my life? I have a full-time job; I don't have the luxury to while away my days learning how to do underwater basket-weaving. Newport doubles-down on the home improvement angle, telling readers they should start with small projects to build up their handiness and work their way up to bigger projects. But what if you rent and aren't allowed to fiddle with your home's wall color/electricity/plumbing? What if you have kids and don't or can't sacrifice valuable time to build a deck? What if you just don't want to? How does becoming a handyman help someone break away from their digital addiction, especially since Newport suggests readers visit YouTube for tutorial videos? The whole digression was pointless.There's so much more I could touch on. Like his weird shilling for the Mouse Book Club, a subscription book service that charges readers $50 for abridged versions of public domain texts. The idea being you keep their tiny books in your purse/pocket so that whenever you go for your phone, the book is there as a solid reminder of your unplugging goals. Why a $1 copy of the same book from a second-hand shop can't do the same, I don't know. Or his casual assumption that his readers are working at jobs that will allow them to just get up and take a walk in the middle of the day or leave early on a whim. Or his one piece of advice that's literally just ""set a time limit for using social media."" It's like going to your doctor and having him tell you to just be healthy. This book isn't worth it and I can't recommend. It was the cause of my recent two-month reading slump. Just go read Ten Arguments For Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now. At half the length, it's more insightful and more practical. The true minimalist. "
56,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45946197-renee,5,"This was a good quick read. Nothing that was a big revelation, we all know how easily technologies gets a hold and a grip on us. Cal Newport makes many good points but one quote that got me was about how we sometime feel more "" important "" then we ought to be. That we are so indispensable that we need to be reach at all time or that the world we stop turning we we don't have a constant access to others, particularly our own families . So here is the quote. "" young people, for example, worry that even temporary disconnection might lead them to miss out on something better they could be doing. Parents worry that their kids won't be able to reach them in an emergency. Travelers need recommendations for places to eat. Workers fear the idea of being both needed and unreachable. And everyone secretly fears being bored. "" p.113Social media, entertainment, technologies aren't the evil of our days but, the way we use it can become an idol. There are many great way to use this inovation, and I may modorarly disagree with a few points Newport made. Other great points he makes that I am completely onboard with:1. Being afraid to be alone and in solitude. 2. Seeking approval from others aka your tribe3. Time waster4. Not knowing how to use your time more productively or having good hobbies.5. Lack or real interactions in favor on mindless or superficial small talk. I am not saying that this digital minaminilism is something absolutely new, being idle with our time and seeking entertainment because of boredom is nothing new under the sun. And don't get me wrong, relaxing and having some form of entertainment isn't bad, but how would it be better if your choose to , for example say, that you would only watch Netflix with someone else instead of just binging on whole tv series at the time. Or spend time at a coffee shop or restaurant with your phone in the car or home. Newport quotes many quotes from Henry David Thoreau and Wendell Berry, two of my favorite authors ( I have a few favorite and yes you can have more then one favorite 😉)I will leave you with some of those quotes"" The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. They honestly think there is no choice left. But alert and healthy natures remember that the sun rose clear. It is never to late to give up our prejudices "" Walden H.D Thoreau"" we enter solitude, in which also we loose loneliness "" Wendell Berry Over all I recommend the book, it might be preacher to the choir for some but still I think it is a insightful read."
57,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11116469-sebastian-gebski,4,"Hmm, 3.5 stars would be fair, I think.The topic itself is more than important, so it's very good that we're getting books on it, but ... some opinions & statements are either oversimplified or plainly ignorant.Examples? Here you go: I like the general idea of using craftsmanship as a way to gain satisfaction, but I totally disagree with the odd opinion that digital craftsmanship can't produce equal satisfaction, so the outcome has to be physical. It's rubbish. Composing, writing, programming, drawing - all kinds of craftsmanship can be equally important. The fact that you're doing something using computer (e.g. programming) doesn't mean it's the same as spending half of the day on Facebook. Programming can be equally satisfactory AND cause the state of flow. Digital minimalism doesn't have ANYTHING in common with the fact that you have a paid job of producing digital items.It's not the only example, ofc, there are more: the whole ""Don't click 'like'"" chapter is controversial & somehow in conflict with the rest of the book. I think that the clue of achieving DM is in finding the sane border between the kind of relation/interaction you want fully rich & the ones that are perfectly acceptable to remain ""shallow"". ""Like"" (and equivalent tools) is actually very useful when used with reason. I understand the good intentions - I hate ""wish-streams"" on social media when someone has a birthday (like all these people think it's enough to celebrate in such way), I despise ""suggested"" responses on Messenger or LinkedIn (that completely flatten all the interactions), but still - minimal friction interactions have their applicability as well. Btw. they were in use yeeeeeears before so-called social media picked them up - e.g. on the discussion boards.OK, to conclude - still, it's a very good book. A book I'd like to recommend to several people I know who truly & visibly suffer from ""digital addiction"". But it could have been much better, if it got some broader perspective/consultation."
58,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1167415-regina-lemoine,4,"I think this book has some great info on decluttering our interactions with screens. I have an inexpensive basic smart phone that's generally used to play audiobooks and, rarely, to make a call or send a text. Unless I'm meeting someone someone somewhere and they might need to reach me, my phone stays on airplane mode 99% of the time. Now, my iPad is a different story. I can easily hop onto the 'net to Google something and emerge from youtube 3 hours later. So, a lot of Newport's suggestions for dealing with a smartphone habit made me look more closely at how much time I waste with the iPad. It's a great device and I wouldn't want to do without it, but it can be a real time drain.I only have two little quibbles with the book. First, while Newport does have recommendations for leisure time, most of those suggestions are for doing ""productive"" things for relaxation. It's not quite as prevalent as what I've seen of some other books of this kind, but one does come away with the notion that leisure shouldn't be just vegging out every now and then. I think it's fine to turn off the need to be ""productive"" at all times.The second problem is also in relation to leisure and hobbies. Newport writes that doing something with one's hands and making things is very satisfying. I agree, however almost all of Newport's suggested activities are traditionally male-leaning. For example, he writes about learning auto-repair, welding, furniture building, etc. That's fine and women can certainly do those things, BUT, there's barely a mention of traditionally ""female"" pursuits such as needlework, knitting, etc. I won't go so far as to say that Newport doesn't value ""women's"" crafts and skills, but that was how I felt at times during the book. There's also no mention of things like cooking or baking (both very valuable skills) or even much, if any, mention of gardening. All-in-all, I enjoyed the book and came away with some good strategies that I can apply in my own life."

Also, having read, enjoyed and put into practice advice from Cal Newport's previous book So Good They Can't Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love  I figured this book would definitely help. In  Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Nosy World  Cal intended to  make the case for digital minimalism, including a more detailed exploration of what it asks and why it works, and then to teach you how to adopt this philosophy if you decide it’s right for you. I feel, for the most part Cal did put forward a good case for Digital Minimalism, but that was an easy case to put forward because we can all/mostly agree that some of us would benefit significantly from practicing Digital Minimalism. If I am being honest, what Cal intended for the book he accomplished, I just felt it lacked something. For me, most of the ideas put forward wasn't groundbreaking. In fact, the main take away from the book was, ""put down your phone/get a dumb phone and see how your life changes"" I also felt that Cal didn't get to the underline cause of WHY we need to practise Digital Minimalism. WHY are we consuming so much and the whole psyche behind that. I do think someone who is just exploring Digital Minimalism may learn more from the book. However, if you've already started researching and reading up on DM, nothing new may strike you in this book. "

Also, it didn’t feel preachy or “self help,” a quality I cannot abide. Unexpectedly, it was FILLED with practical real world suggestions for addressing the problems presented, something that is left out of this kind of book too often. In fact, there are a few latent problem spots in my digital life that aren’t deliberate and I didn’t quite know what to do about. Much to my joy, there were some practice tips in this book that address those issues precisely and provide innovative solutions I hadn’t thought about... and they are simple enough that I plan to put them into practice immediately!

Sparing you the details, but ""screentime"" on iphone tells me that my total FB+Twitter+browsing usage on avg is less than 30 mins per day. And apart from goodreads and imdb on which serve an important function for me, I am not on any other SM (including Whatsapp or Insta).Wished to take a step further and also compare notes. A lot of it - opting for quality communications and avoiding distractions was intutively clear since the unsavoury aspects of Facebook and Twitter have been in the news, especially since Trump's election. But interestingly it also suggested something I suspected - many Indians lack a quality hobby and hence are SM and WA addicts. If you do not have an activity you love - be it jogging, reading, playing music, sports or even watching cinema etc, you are better off with the blue pill of SM (ref Matrix) :)On the negative side, the self-esteem angle needed to be discussed in depth. While the author talks of pseudo-pleasure derived from likes and Re-tweets, the self-esteem of some ppl atleast has come to depend on their likeability online.Overall, this is a short read at 200 pages and would say it is easily worth your time."

These solutions are real life examples from people who have gotten tired of their smartphone addiction, and have taken steps to be in control of their life. Some have simply implemented some clever, little hacks (albeit very intentional ones) to help them be productive, while others have made radical changes in the ways they interact with technology.Newport is not a Luddite (technology avoider) by any means, but instead he challenges us to make careful, intentional choices about how we use technology.

He also presents a few concrete practice tips to get control over our digital life.But my take away message from this book was the importance of solitude and how it has been diminished from my life by the excuse of “well I am listening to audiobooks instead of surfing on Instagram!”.

It makes us think a lot about our priorities and abusive technology usage. Cal Newport is not anti-technology, but instead, he wants us to reflect how we engage with these tools in order to improve our quality of life.The message is: make deliberate choices and focus on things you care about (I mean, things you REALLY care about).As the author says: “Digital minimalism is much more than a set of rules, it’s about cultivating a life worth living in our current age of alluring devices”.Some notes from the book:* Don't click “likes”: connection is a low-bandwidth interaction (and it defines most of our online social lives). Conversation is much richer and a high-bandwidth communication. We should avoid the former. Clicking in the “Like” button, we teach our mind that connection replaces conversation. Social media can be a useful tool if we decide to use it as one of our conversation-centric communication tools rather than creating low-quality relationships. “Likes"" don’t build relationships.* Avoid the slot machine: social media is built to be a true slot machine. We keep pulling the lever - almost literally when refreshing the timeline - hoping for a reward. Something new to appear and satisfy our apetite. Or a notification saying that a bunch of people approves our post and generating a self-esteem boost.* ""Treat minutes of your life as a concrete substance. check how much of your life you trade for the activities you allow to claim your time. When we confront our habits from this perspective, we conclude that, more often than not, the cumulative cost of non-crucial things we clutter our life with are higher than the small benefits each clutter promises""* Spend time alone: we are always online and connected. We lost the capacity to see the benefits of solitude. Regular doses of self-reflection is healthy.* Take long walks: I'm incorporating more walks to my routine. When it’s possible, I choose walking. When it’s not possible, I'm commuting with the phone in the bottom of my backpack. This allows me to read/listen a book or just stay disconnected preventing the urge to check something in the smartphone without intention.* Reclaim leisure: prioritize demanding leisure activity over passive consumption.* Schedule low quality leisure: you don’t need to eliminate low quality leisure. Just schedule and create a threshold for usage. Remember: Facebook group (including Instagram and WhatsApp), for instance, is one of the most valuable companies in the world and there is a reason for this. They are great to capture the most valuable resource in the world: time.* Follow a leisure plan: if you don’t create a leisure plan, you will do the easiest thing available to you (e.g. scrolling the timeline until the end of the world).* Delete social media from your phone: unless you have a really good reason, you probably don’t need social media apps in your phone. If you need to use in your phone, use in the mobile browser and log out as soon as you finish what you intend to do. It will be an ugly and uncomfortable experience. Create friction for your bad habits (if you are interested about this subject, read ""Atomic Habits"")* Turn your device into single-purpose computers: our computers are powerful and we are capable to run multiple programs at the same time. Context-switching in a computer was never so easy. (Freedom.to / StayFocusd apps may help you)* Embrace slow media (http://en.slow-media.net/manifesto): monotasking, don’t be a passive consumer, choose actively what and how you want to consume, focus on quality rather than quantity.Join the attention resistance, be deliberate, live with intention and enjoy your short period of life without a phone in your face."

With minimalism having its hay-day a few years back the general term is clouded in connotations of rich hipsters. Also, given the ""recommended reads"" based on this book I was worried it would be stock-standard white-man self help. I wasn't sure what to expect.What I got, frankly, was great life advice. As someone who works computationally, like Cal, I think I needed the permission to seek more intentional use of technology. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone, but especially those of us who were introduced to unrestricted internet access during our youth (young millenials and zoomers I'm looking at you)."
76,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7154232-phil-sykora,5,"I like the way that Cal Newport structures the argument against mindless social media use (note: NOT against all technology use) in this book. It's not mere coincidence that you pick up your phone 85 times a day. It's not mere coincidence that, on average, teenagers nowadays spend nine hours of their day staring at screens. Some really smart nerds, after playing a game of ping pong in their offices in Silicon Valley, were able to gamify basic human sociality, and now their product is YOU. They have to keep you clicking, liking, favoriting, and hitting ""Next Episode.""And it's no coincidence that we've seen a sharp decline in general mental health. Almost everyone I talk to, when I ask them whether or not they think social media is a good thing for society, admits that it's not: it decreases their personal productivity, it makes them feel worse about themselves, and it gives them unhealthy ideas of what their peers are REALLY doing (which is never as interesting as it looks when you see the carefully curated content on their Snapchat stories or Instagram posts, which is specifically designed for maximum envy).Also, I like the distinction between high-bandwidth and low-bandwidth conversation. When you talk to someone in person, your brain is firing on all cylinders. It's highly engaged with what the other person is saying because during tribal times ignoring your fellow tribesmen could mean exclusion, and death. Whether you consciously think about it or not, you're paying attention to a person's vocal tonality, facial expressions, body language, and, of course, the words themselves. When you receive a text message, though, you're only getting one tier of that feedback: the words themselves (and maybe an emoji, a weak substitute). In the same way that your body is adapted for single-ingredient, high-fiber, nutrient dense fruits, vegetables, and lean meats, your brain is adapted for high-feedback conversation. Here's how I like to think about it, in academic analogy terms: bologna is to your body as text messaging is to your brain. You can eat bologna every once in a while, just like how you can text people every once in a while, but you don't want to make it a staple of your diet or else you're going to feel like shit all the time. Your brain needs person-to-person communication. Just because we live in a bologna-centric culture doesn't mean that you need to eat bologna all the time. It's okay to tell people that you don't like bologna. Eat a banana. Make a salad. Get a coffee with your best friend. Play Scrabble with your grandma. It's good for you.But what I like most about this book are the strategies within. It made me seriously reconsider my relationship with optional technologies, forcing me to think about who was REALLY in control. As a result, I've started the digital decluttering process and I've already read three books this month. I'm more productive AND more relaxed.If you can't quit for thirty days, can you quit at all?"
77,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5538722-matt-kays,5,"I upped my rating on this one. I finished this last night in one sitting and thought that it was great, however full of a lot of things I was already doing or had read elsewhere. Hence the four star review and not five. Then, I couldn’t sleep and created a list of all the things that I could actually change immediately to become more of a digital minimalist. After making my list I have around 30 action items either taken directly from this book or spurred by actions in this book based on my own digital experiences. That’s the thing I realized though is that there is no way someone could write a be all, end all guide on this subject because although we are all living in a digital world and some of our habits are the same, there are millions of apps out there and millions of websites, newsletters, podcasts and humans to connect with online. With each of us interacting with these in infinite ways, it would be impossible. Are there things in here I likely won’t put into practice? Absolutely. But given the steps I’ve taken in just 24 hours and the productivity and lightness I feel already, I highly recommend this book to literally everyone. As Mr. Newport says in the conclusion “it’s not really about technology, but is instead more about the quality of your life.” And who can argue with that!?"

It's pathetic.Social media is so powerful and can be used for so much good. Be warned of the social media companies, for they are after your attention and without careful notice, they will obtain it a detrimental cost to you. While reading this book I went to dinner and left my phone at home.And guess what??I ate and enjoyed my meal, talking to others, laughing with others... But at a certain point I was left to watch everyone... on their phones. I'm convinced our cellphones are more addictive than sugar. It's scary. Be selective with your time. Schedule social media time and adhere to that schedule. Enjoy and engage in face to face conversations. Soak in what you understand from tone and pitch of voice, from nonverbal communication.Try not to let something important be truncated to a text message.Change your digital ways.After reading this, I will think about what I'm doing every time I grab for my phone.I enjoy change.And change I will.Favourite quote: ""Digital minimalism definitively does not reject the innovations of the internet age, but instead rejects the way so many people currently engage with these tools."""
79,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9146810-paul,4,I talk about this book some in my wrap-up video here: https://youtu.be/c7_ihA6isJg
80,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84317608-javier-lorenzana,4,"Facebook didn’t promise to change our lives -- yet, it did. Digital Minimalism is a phenomenal follow up to Deep Work (and is largely built upon the same foundations). In it, Newport uncovers our underlying assumptions about technology and compares them to their unintended consequences: social media, isolation; notifications, gambling; consumption, anxiety.Technology is supposed to support our values; they should not be the source of value. If you value relationships, use technology to set meetings with friends -- don't text at the dinner table. If you value leisure, use technology to learn how to perfect a skill -- don't mindlessly scroll through your feed during your free time.Essentially: It's not about technology, it's about cultivating a life worth living in the midst of digital distraction.Other points:- Scrolling through social media may lead to a perceived lack of time.- Be comfortable missing out on the shallow content the Facebook news feed presents.- Liking and commenting is not necessarily a form of good communication.I'll be undertaking my 1 month digital declutter now. (Ofc, I still use Goodreads as a reading tracker. Nothing more.)"
81,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12925436-annie,4,"Digital consumption has become like junk food consumption - it's pervasive, addictive, and negatively affecting our overall well-being. There has been a rise in teenage anxiety, depression, and suicides because the generation that grew up on smartphones are being bombarded with carefully crafted posts, which makes their lives seem lacking.The author jumps around a little. First recommending solitude, where you spend time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from others (like using a journal to capture and organize your thoughts). Then the author recommends cultivating relationships. As social beings, we thrive on having richer, deeper relationships with other people. There are various high quality activities that can replace trivial digital consumption; select the ones that add value to your life. If you had to pay for the use of Facebook or Instagram, would you still be checking it 10-20 times a day? Limit your online time to a small number of carefully selected activities that strongly support the things you value."
82,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25252995-charity,4,"What I appreciated most about this book was that Newport spent as much time talking about the why and how of reducing your digital footprint as he did talking about the why and what to replace it with. It reminded me of the passage in Luke about demons returning to the place they were chased out of:“When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’ When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order. Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first.” (Luke 11:24-25)You may clean house - or digitally minimize - but if you do not have good and joyful things to fill that space, there is little chance of making lasting change. I am challenged and inspired about the call to solitude and high-quality leisure and look forward to seeing how this will manifest itself in the upcoming months!"

84,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54283079-laura-fusaro,5,"I have read this book in less than 24 hours. I couldn’t stop. It struck me so much because it’s so revealing and true. I share Andrew Sullivan’s thought on social media and the technology world: “I used to be a human being. And endless bombardment of news and gossip and images has rendered us manic information addicts. It broke me. It might break you too.”Let’s all adopt the philosophy presented in this book! Let’s go back to a life without the obsessive need to take out our phones when bored, or alone, or just because we absolutely need to check our feeds. Does that add something valuable to our lives?As for me, I might try to dumb down my smartphone (I already deleted all social media, I can only browse on my computer - “I don’t think we need to be connected to so many people so frequently anyway“) and be more mindful and present."

Totally enjoyed the book and is a must read. Cal lays out why and how one can embrace Digital Minimalism and the benefits of the same. If you have been thinking about being in more control of how you use social media and other time consuming stuffs on the internet this book would provide you just the inspiration and the method to achieve the same. And if you have never thought of how you consume social media and anything and everything on the net, this book would get you to start thinking about why you should be more intentional in what you consume. "
86,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70353791-terry-maguire,5,"I am a huge fan of Cal Newport's writing and loved this latest one. This book begins by echoing several of the ideas central to Deep Work, but then takes a close look at social media and its effects on human psychology. As one would expect, Newport argues for putting one's core values & most important projects ahead of everything else and stripping away superfluous digital distraction that often ends up being a time sink without adding value. He also makes a compelling argument for bringing back quality conversation over shallow moments of connection. Like in Deep Work, he advocates for harnessing the best that tech has to offer without getting sucked into the attention economy. His prose style is lean and powerful and the research is meticulous and carefully documented."

I appreciated how Cal Newport looked at every side of the issue, provided research, and gave many wonderful suggestions for how to deepen a life of leisure without the digital world following you around. I especially loved his chapter on seeking solitude, which is something I have been thinking about a lot lately. This is one book that everyone needs to read in this day and age!"

It’s about building awareness of how the smartphone in our pocket and the social media apps at our fingertips are hacking into our quality of life and making our connections with others vast but shallow. It’s about awareness of the problems that 24/7 connection often creates and what an intentional consumer can do to make technology a tool in towards building a fulfilling life. Read it, it possibly could change your life! "
89,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19633041-barry,2,"I got two solid takeaways from this book. 1. Incorporate more solitude in my life. I.E., walks, drive without listening to anything (e.g., audiobook, music, radio etc.).2. I deleted 90% of the social media from my phone, and I've been purposely using my phone less for leisure. That said, the book could have been 1/3 the size. Way too much repetition. Too much stuff on time management. The book could have been about time management instead of Digital Minimalism. Finally, the narrator was too polished. Really getting sick of authors not reading their own audiobook. I am looking for the essence of the writing."
90,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7537558-tiffany-freeman,5,"Such an important topic to be talking about right now. I feel like a lot of my acquaintances would accuse the author of being a “tech hater,” but I feel like that couldn’t be farther from the truth if you really listen to what he’s claiming. I’m honestly already on board with a lot of the suggestions he shares, so maybe I was an easy sell. But I enjoyed it and my kids even enjoyed the parts I shared with them. Also, it didn’t feel preachy or “self help,” a quality I cannot abide. Unexpectedly, it was FILLED with practical real world suggestions for addressing the problems presented, something that is left out of this kind of book too often. In fact, there are a few latent problem spots in my digital life that aren’t deliberate and I didn’t quite know what to do about. Much to my joy, there were some practice tips in this book that address those issues precisely and provide innovative solutions I hadn’t thought about... and they are simple enough that I plan to put them into practice immediately! I wish I could convince everyone I know to read this book. I am just ending a three month social media fast and, with the rebirth of Spring just around the corner, I feel like it was the perfect time in my life for this particular nugget of inspiration/transformation.

91,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8676317-a-man-called-ove,4,"3.5/5 Minimalism is something intrinsic to me before I knew about the term, and so was digital minimalism. Sparing you the details, but ""screentime"" on iphone tells me that my total FB+Twitter+browsing usage on avg is less than 30 mins per day. And apart from goodreads and imdb on which serve an important function for me, I am not on any other SM (including Whatsapp or Insta).Wished to take a step further and also compare notes. A lot of it - opting for quality communications and avoiding distractions was intutively clear since the unsavoury aspects of Facebook and Twitter have been in the news, especially since Trump's election. But interestingly it also suggested something I suspected - many Indians lack a quality hobby and hence are SM and WA addicts. If you do not have an activity you love - be it jogging, reading, playing music, sports or even watching cinema etc, you are better off with the blue pill of SM (ref Matrix) :)On the negative side, the self-esteem angle needed to be discussed in depth. While the author talks of pseudo-pleasure derived from likes and Re-tweets, the self-esteem of some ppl atleast has come to depend on their likeability online.Overall, this is a short read at 200 pages and would say it is easily worth your time."
92,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83119544-stan,5,"I couldn't agree with this book more, and would highly recommend it!Cal Newport does a fantastic job of laying out the problem our screen craze is causing--in fact, if you're alive in today's world, you probably have recognized this problem already--and then he proposes some solutions. These solutions are real life examples from people who have gotten tired of their smartphone addiction, and have taken steps to be in control of their life. Some have simply implemented some clever, little hacks (albeit very intentional ones) to help them be productive, while others have made radical changes in the ways they interact with technology.Newport is not a Luddite (technology avoider) by any means, but instead he challenges us to make careful, intentional choices about how we use technology. A very relevant book for our time!"

In this book, Cal Newport explains how these technologies are engineered to make us addicted to the screens and how essential it is to become mindful about using them. He also presents a few concrete practice tips to get control over our digital life.But my take away message from this book was the importance of solitude and how it has been diminished from my life by the excuse of “well I am listening to audiobooks instead of surfing on Instagram!”. This is not the case, even audiobooks and podcasts steal your mindful moments which you can think, reflect and make valuable things. "

I very much disliked this book, though I like the intent and meaning that was the seed of original thought in it.

106,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7154232-phil-sykora,5,"I like the way that Cal Newport structures the argument against mindless social media use (note: NOT against all technology use) in this book. It's not mere coincidence that you pick up your phone 85 times a day. It's not mere coincidence that, on average, teenagers nowadays spend nine hours of their day staring at screens. Some really smart nerds, after playing a game of ping pong in their offices in Silicon Valley, were able to gamify basic human sociality, and now their product is YOU. They have to keep you clicking, liking, favoriting, and hitting ""Next Episode.""And it's no coincidence that we've seen a sharp decline in general mental health. Almost everyone I talk to, when I ask them whether or not they think social media is a good thing for society, admits that it's not: it decreases their personal productivity, it makes them feel worse about themselves, and it gives them unhealthy ideas of what their peers are REALLY doing (which is never as interesting as it looks when you see the carefully curated content on their Snapchat stories or Instagram posts, which is specifically designed for maximum envy).Also, I like the distinction between high-bandwidth and low-bandwidth conversation. When you talk to someone in person, your brain is firing on all cylinders. It's highly engaged with what the other person is saying because during tribal times ignoring your fellow tribesmen could mean exclusion, and death. Whether you consciously think about it or not, you're paying attention to a person's vocal tonality, facial expressions, body language, and, of course, the words themselves. When you receive a text message, though, you're only getting one tier of that feedback: the words themselves (and maybe an emoji, a weak substitute). In the same way that your body is adapted for single-ingredient, high-fiber, nutrient dense fruits, vegetables, and lean meats, your brain is adapted for high-feedback conversation. Here's how I like to think about it, in academic analogy terms: bologna is to your body as text messaging is to your brain. You can eat bologna every once in a while, just like how you can text people every once in a while, but you don't want to make it a staple of your diet or else you're going to feel like shit all the time. Your brain needs person-to-person communication. Just because we live in a bologna-centric culture doesn't mean that you need to eat bologna all the time. It's okay to tell people that you don't like bologna. Eat a banana. Make a salad. Get a coffee with your best friend. Play Scrabble with your grandma. It's good for you.But what I like most about this book are the strategies within. It made me seriously reconsider my relationship with optional technologies, forcing me to think about who was REALLY in control. As a result, I've started the digital decluttering process and I've already read three books this month. I'm more productive AND more relaxed.If you can't quit for thirty days, can you quit at all?"
107,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5538722-matt-kays,5,"I upped my rating on this one. I finished this last night in one sitting and thought that it was great, however full of a lot of things I was already doing or had read elsewhere. Hence the four star review and not five. Then, I couldn’t sleep and created a list of all the things that I could actually change immediately to become more of a digital minimalist. After making my list I have around 30 action items either taken directly from this book or spurred by actions in this book based on my own digital experiences. That’s the thing I realized though is that there is no way someone could write a be all, end all guide on this subject because although we are all living in a digital world and some of our habits are the same, there are millions of apps out there and millions of websites, newsletters, podcasts and humans to connect with online. With each of us interacting with these in infinite ways, it would be impossible. Are there things in here I likely won’t put into practice? Absolutely. But given the steps I’ve taken in just 24 hours and the productivity and lightness I feel already, I highly recommend this book to literally everyone. As Mr. Newport says in the conclusion “it’s not really about technology, but is instead more about the quality of your life.” And who can argue with that!?"

It's pathetic.Social media is so powerful and can be used for so much good. Be warned of the social media companies, for they are after your attention and without careful notice, they will obtain it a detrimental cost to you. While reading this book I went to dinner and left my phone at home.And guess what??I ate and enjoyed my meal, talking to others, laughing with others... But at a certain point I was left to watch everyone... on their phones. I'm convinced our cellphones are more addictive than sugar. It's scary. Be selective with your time. Schedule social media time and adhere to that schedule. Enjoy and engage in face to face conversations. Soak in what you understand from tone and pitch of voice, from nonverbal communication.Try not to let something important be truncated to a text message.Change your digital ways.After reading this, I will think about what I'm doing every time I grab for my phone.I enjoy change.And change I will.Favourite quote: ""Digital minimalism definitively does not reject the innovations of the internet age, but instead rejects the way so many people currently engage with these tools."""

110,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84317608-javier-lorenzana,4,"Facebook didn’t promise to change our lives -- yet, it did. Digital Minimalism is a phenomenal follow up to Deep Work (and is largely built upon the same foundations). In it, Newport uncovers our underlying assumptions about technology and compares them to their unintended consequences: social media, isolation; notifications, gambling; consumption, anxiety.Technology is supposed to support our values; they should not be the source of value. If you value relationships, use technology to set meetings with friends -- don't text at the dinner table. If you value leisure, use technology to learn how to perfect a skill -- don't mindlessly scroll through your feed during your free time.Essentially: It's not about technology, it's about cultivating a life worth living in the midst of digital distraction.Other points:- Scrolling through social media may lead to a perceived lack of time.- Be comfortable missing out on the shallow content the Facebook news feed presents.- Liking and commenting is not necessarily a form of good communication.I'll be undertaking my 1 month digital declutter now. (Ofc, I still use Goodreads as a reading tracker. Nothing more.)"
111,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12925436-annie,4,"Digital consumption has become like junk food consumption - it's pervasive, addictive, and negatively affecting our overall well-being. There has been a rise in teenage anxiety, depression, and suicides because the generation that grew up on smartphones are being bombarded with carefully crafted posts, which makes their lives seem lacking.The author jumps around a little. First recommending solitude, where you spend time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from others (like using a journal to capture and organize your thoughts). Then the author recommends cultivating relationships. As social beings, we thrive on having richer, deeper relationships with other people. There are various high quality activities that can replace trivial digital consumption; select the ones that add value to your life. If you had to pay for the use of Facebook or Instagram, would you still be checking it 10-20 times a day? Limit your online time to a small number of carefully selected activities that strongly support the things you value."
112,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25252995-charity,4,"What I appreciated most about this book was that Newport spent as much time talking about the why and how of reducing your digital footprint as he did talking about the why and what to replace it with. It reminded me of the passage in Luke about demons returning to the place they were chased out of:“When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’ When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order. Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first.” (Luke 11:24-25)You may clean house - or digitally minimize - but if you do not have good and joyful things to fill that space, there is little chance of making lasting change. I am challenged and inspired about the call to solitude and high-quality leisure and look forward to seeing how this will manifest itself in the upcoming months!"

114,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54283079-laura-fusaro,5,"I have read this book in less than 24 hours. I couldn’t stop. It struck me so much because it’s so revealing and true. I share Andrew Sullivan’s thought on social media and the technology world: “I used to be a human being. And endless bombardment of news and gossip and images has rendered us manic information addicts. It broke me. It might break you too.”Let’s all adopt the philosophy presented in this book! Let’s go back to a life without the obsessive need to take out our phones when bored, or alone, or just because we absolutely need to check our feeds. Does that add something valuable to our lives?As for me, I might try to dumb down my smartphone (I already deleted all social media, I can only browse on my computer - “I don’t think we need to be connected to so many people so frequently anyway“) and be more mindful and present."

Totally enjoyed the book and is a must read. Cal lays out why and how one can embrace Digital Minimalism and the benefits of the same. If you have been thinking about being in more control of how you use social media and other time consuming stuffs on the internet this book would provide you just the inspiration and the method to achieve the same. And if you have never thought of how you consume social media and anything and everything on the net, this book would get you to start thinking about why you should be more intentional in what you consume. "
116,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70353791-terry-maguire,5,"I am a huge fan of Cal Newport's writing and loved this latest one. This book begins by echoing several of the ideas central to Deep Work, but then takes a close look at social media and its effects on human psychology. As one would expect, Newport argues for putting one's core values & most important projects ahead of everything else and stripping away superfluous digital distraction that often ends up being a time sink without adding value. He also makes a compelling argument for bringing back quality conversation over shallow moments of connection. Like in Deep Work, he advocates for harnessing the best that tech has to offer without getting sucked into the attention economy. His prose style is lean and powerful and the research is meticulous and carefully documented."

I appreciated how Cal Newport looked at every side of the issue, provided research, and gave many wonderful suggestions for how to deepen a life of leisure without the digital world following you around. I especially loved his chapter on seeking solitude, which is something I have been thinking about a lot lately. This is one book that everyone needs to read in this day and age!"

It’s about building awareness of how the smartphone in our pocket and the social media apps at our fingertips are hacking into our quality of life and making our connections with others vast but shallow. It’s about awareness of the problems that 24/7 connection often creates and what an intentional consumer can do to make technology a tool in towards building a fulfilling life. Read it, it possibly could change your life! "
119,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19633041-barry,2,"I got two solid takeaways from this book. 1. Incorporate more solitude in my life. I.E., walks, drive without listening to anything (e.g., audiobook, music, radio etc.).2. I deleted 90% of the social media from my phone, and I've been purposely using my phone less for leisure. That said, the book could have been 1/3 the size. Way too much repetition. Too much stuff on time management. The book could have been about time management instead of Digital Minimalism. Finally, the narrator was too polished. Really getting sick of authors not reading their own audiobook. I am looking for the essence of the writing."
120,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7537558-tiffany-freeman,5,"Such an important topic to be talking about right now. I feel like a lot of my acquaintances would accuse the author of being a “tech hater,” but I feel like that couldn’t be farther from the truth if you really listen to what he’s claiming. I’m honestly already on board with a lot of the suggestions he shares, so maybe I was an easy sell. But I enjoyed it and my kids even enjoyed the parts I shared with them. Also, it didn’t feel preachy or “self help,” a quality I cannot abide. Unexpectedly, it was FILLED with practical real world suggestions for addressing the problems presented, something that is left out of this kind of book too often. In fact, there are a few latent problem spots in my digital life that aren’t deliberate and I didn’t quite know what to do about. Much to my joy, there were some practice tips in this book that address those issues precisely and provide innovative solutions I hadn’t thought about... and they are simple enough that I plan to put them into practice immediately! I wish I could convince everyone I know to read this book. I am just ending a three month social media fast and, with the rebirth of Spring just around the corner, I feel like it was the perfect time in my life for this particular nugget of inspiration/transformation.

121,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8676317-a-man-called-ove,4,"3.5/5 Minimalism is something intrinsic to me before I knew about the term, and so was digital minimalism. Sparing you the details, but ""screentime"" on iphone tells me that my total FB+Twitter+browsing usage on avg is less than 30 mins per day. And apart from goodreads and imdb on which serve an important function for me, I am not on any other SM (including Whatsapp or Insta).Wished to take a step further and also compare notes. A lot of it - opting for quality communications and avoiding distractions was intutively clear since the unsavoury aspects of Facebook and Twitter have been in the news, especially since Trump's election. But interestingly it also suggested something I suspected - many Indians lack a quality hobby and hence are SM and WA addicts. If you do not have an activity you love - be it jogging, reading, playing music, sports or even watching cinema etc, you are better off with the blue pill of SM (ref Matrix) :)On the negative side, the self-esteem angle needed to be discussed in depth. While the author talks of pseudo-pleasure derived from likes and Re-tweets, the self-esteem of some ppl atleast has come to depend on their likeability online.Overall, this is a short read at 200 pages and would say it is easily worth your time."
122,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83119544-stan,5,"I couldn't agree with this book more, and would highly recommend it!Cal Newport does a fantastic job of laying out the problem our screen craze is causing--in fact, if you're alive in today's world, you probably have recognized this problem already--and then he proposes some solutions. These solutions are real life examples from people who have gotten tired of their smartphone addiction, and have taken steps to be in control of their life. Some have simply implemented some clever, little hacks (albeit very intentional ones) to help them be productive, while others have made radical changes in the ways they interact with technology.Newport is not a Luddite (technology avoider) by any means, but instead he challenges us to make careful, intentional choices about how we use technology. A very relevant book for our time!"

In this book, Cal Newport explains how these technologies are engineered to make us addicted to the screens and how essential it is to become mindful about using them. He also presents a few concrete practice tips to get control over our digital life.But my take away message from this book was the importance of solitude and how it has been diminished from my life by the excuse of “well I am listening to audiobooks instead of surfing on Instagram!”. This is not the case, even audiobooks and podcasts steal your mindful moments which you can think, reflect and make valuable things. "

I very much disliked this book, though I like the intent and meaning that was the seed of original thought in it.

134,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13274832-luiz,5,"This book is a relief in a age where our attention is attracted by so many magnetic tools. It makes us think a lot about our priorities and abusive technology usage. Cal Newport is not anti-technology, but instead, he wants us to reflect how we engage with these tools in order to improve our quality of life.The message is: make deliberate choices and focus on things you care about (I mean, things you REALLY care about).As the author says: “Digital minimalism is much more than a set of rules, it’s about cultivating a life worth living in our current age of alluring devices”.Some notes from the book:* Don't click “likes”: connection is a low-bandwidth interaction (and it defines most of our online social lives). Conversation is much richer and a high-bandwidth communication. We should avoid the former. Clicking in the “Like” button, we teach our mind that connection replaces conversation. Social media can be a useful tool if we decide to use it as one of our conversation-centric communication tools rather than creating low-quality relationships. “Likes"" don’t build relationships.* Avoid the slot machine: social media is built to be a true slot machine. We keep pulling the lever - almost literally when refreshing the timeline - hoping for a reward. Something new to appear and satisfy our apetite. Or a notification saying that a bunch of people approves our post and generating a self-esteem boost.* ""Treat minutes of your life as a concrete substance. check how much of your life you trade for the activities you allow to claim your time. When we confront our habits from this perspective, we conclude that, more often than not, the cumulative cost of non-crucial things we clutter our life with are higher than the small benefits each clutter promises""* Spend time alone: we are always online and connected. We lost the capacity to see the benefits of solitude. Regular doses of self-reflection is healthy.* Take long walks: I'm incorporating more walks to my routine. When it’s possible, I choose walking. When it’s not possible, I'm commuting with the phone in the bottom of my backpack. This allows me to read/listen a book or just stay disconnected preventing the urge to check something in the smartphone without intention.* Reclaim leisure: prioritize demanding leisure activity over passive consumption.* Schedule low quality leisure: you don’t need to eliminate low quality leisure. Just schedule and create a threshold for usage. Remember: Facebook group (including Instagram and WhatsApp), for instance, is one of the most valuable companies in the world and there is a reason for this. They are great to capture the most valuable resource in the world: time.* Follow a leisure plan: if you don’t create a leisure plan, you will do the easiest thing available to you (e.g. scrolling the timeline until the end of the world).* Delete social media from your phone: unless you have a really good reason, you probably don’t need social media apps in your phone. If you need to use in your phone, use in the mobile browser and log out as soon as you finish what you intend to do. It will be an ugly and uncomfortable experience. Create friction for your bad habits (if you are interested about this subject, read ""Atomic Habits"")* Turn your device into single-purpose computers: our computers are powerful and we are capable to run multiple programs at the same time. Context-switching in a computer was never so easy. (Freedom.to / StayFocusd apps may help you)* Embrace slow media (http://en.slow-media.net/manifesto): monotasking, don’t be a passive consumer, choose actively what and how you want to consume, focus on quality rather than quantity.Join the attention resistance, be deliberate, live with intention and enjoy your short period of life without a phone in your face."
135,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20815501-amy,5,"A clear, compelling and well-researched case for the practice of Digital Minimalism. With minimalism having its hay-day a few years back the general term is clouded in connotations of rich hipsters. Also, given the ""recommended reads"" based on this book I was worried it would be stock-standard white-man self help. I wasn't sure what to expect.What I got, frankly, was great life advice. As someone who works computationally, like Cal, I think I needed the permission to seek more intentional use of technology. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone, but especially those of us who were introduced to unrestricted internet access during our youth (young millenials and zoomers I'm looking at you)."
136,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7154232-phil-sykora,5,"I like the way that Cal Newport structures the argument against mindless social media use (note: NOT against all technology use) in this book. It's not mere coincidence that you pick up your phone 85 times a day. It's not mere coincidence that, on average, teenagers nowadays spend nine hours of their day staring at screens. Some really smart nerds, after playing a game of ping pong in their offices in Silicon Valley, were able to gamify basic human sociality, and now their product is YOU. They have to keep you clicking, liking, favoriting, and hitting ""Next Episode.""And it's no coincidence that we've seen a sharp decline in general mental health. Almost everyone I talk to, when I ask them whether or not they think social media is a good thing for society, admits that it's not: it decreases their personal productivity, it makes them feel worse about themselves, and it gives them unhealthy ideas of what their peers are REALLY doing (which is never as interesting as it looks when you see the carefully curated content on their Snapchat stories or Instagram posts, which is specifically designed for maximum envy).Also, I like the distinction between high-bandwidth and low-bandwidth conversation. When you talk to someone in person, your brain is firing on all cylinders. It's highly engaged with what the other person is saying because during tribal times ignoring your fellow tribesmen could mean exclusion, and death. Whether you consciously think about it or not, you're paying attention to a person's vocal tonality, facial expressions, body language, and, of course, the words themselves. When you receive a text message, though, you're only getting one tier of that feedback: the words themselves (and maybe an emoji, a weak substitute). In the same way that your body is adapted for single-ingredient, high-fiber, nutrient dense fruits, vegetables, and lean meats, your brain is adapted for high-feedback conversation. Here's how I like to think about it, in academic analogy terms: bologna is to your body as text messaging is to your brain. You can eat bologna every once in a while, just like how you can text people every once in a while, but you don't want to make it a staple of your diet or else you're going to feel like shit all the time. Your brain needs person-to-person communication. Just because we live in a bologna-centric culture doesn't mean that you need to eat bologna all the time. It's okay to tell people that you don't like bologna. Eat a banana. Make a salad. Get a coffee with your best friend. Play Scrabble with your grandma. It's good for you.But what I like most about this book are the strategies within. It made me seriously reconsider my relationship with optional technologies, forcing me to think about who was REALLY in control. As a result, I've started the digital decluttering process and I've already read three books this month. I'm more productive AND more relaxed.If you can't quit for thirty days, can you quit at all?"

After making my list I have around 30 action items either taken directly from this book or spurred by actions in this book based on my own digital experiences. That’s the thing I realized though is that there is no way someone could write a be all, end all guide on this subject because although we are all living in a digital world and some of our habits are the same, there are millions of apps out there and millions of websites, newsletters, podcasts and humans to connect with online. With each of us interacting with these in infinite ways, it would be impossible. Are there things in here I likely won’t put into practice? Absolutely. But given the steps I’ve taken in just 24 hours and the productivity and lightness I feel already, I highly recommend this book to literally everyone. As Mr. Newport says in the conclusion “it’s not really about technology, but is instead more about the quality of your life.” And who can argue with that!?"

It's pathetic.Social media is so powerful and can be used for so much good. Be warned of the social media companies, for they are after your attention and without careful notice, they will obtain it a detrimental cost to you. While reading this book I went to dinner and left my phone at home.And guess what??I ate and enjoyed my meal, talking to others, laughing with others... But at a certain point I was left to watch everyone... on their phones. I'm convinced our cellphones are more addictive than sugar. It's scary. Be selective with your time. Schedule social media time and adhere to that schedule. Enjoy and engage in face to face conversations. Soak in what you understand from tone and pitch of voice, from nonverbal communication.Try not to let something important be truncated to a text message.Change your digital ways.After reading this, I will think about what I'm doing every time I grab for my phone.I enjoy change.And change I will.Favourite quote: ""Digital minimalism definitively does not reject the innovations of the internet age, but instead rejects the way so many people currently engage with these tools."""

140,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84317608-javier-lorenzana,4,"Facebook didn’t promise to change our lives -- yet, it did. Digital Minimalism is a phenomenal follow up to Deep Work (and is largely built upon the same foundations). In it, Newport uncovers our underlying assumptions about technology and compares them to their unintended consequences: social media, isolation; notifications, gambling; consumption, anxiety.Technology is supposed to support our values; they should not be the source of value. If you value relationships, use technology to set meetings with friends -- don't text at the dinner table. If you value leisure, use technology to learn how to perfect a skill -- don't mindlessly scroll through your feed during your free time.Essentially: It's not about technology, it's about cultivating a life worth living in the midst of digital distraction.Other points:- Scrolling through social media may lead to a perceived lack of time.- Be comfortable missing out on the shallow content the Facebook news feed presents.- Liking and commenting is not necessarily a form of good communication.I'll be undertaking my 1 month digital declutter now. (Ofc, I still use Goodreads as a reading tracker. Nothing more.)"
141,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12925436-annie,4,"Digital consumption has become like junk food consumption - it's pervasive, addictive, and negatively affecting our overall well-being. There has been a rise in teenage anxiety, depression, and suicides because the generation that grew up on smartphones are being bombarded with carefully crafted posts, which makes their lives seem lacking.The author jumps around a little. First recommending solitude, where you spend time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from others (like using a journal to capture and organize your thoughts). Then the author recommends cultivating relationships. As social beings, we thrive on having richer, deeper relationships with other people. There are various high quality activities that can replace trivial digital consumption; select the ones that add value to your life. If you had to pay for the use of Facebook or Instagram, would you still be checking it 10-20 times a day? Limit your online time to a small number of carefully selected activities that strongly support the things you value."
142,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25252995-charity,4,"What I appreciated most about this book was that Newport spent as much time talking about the why and how of reducing your digital footprint as he did talking about the why and what to replace it with. It reminded me of the passage in Luke about demons returning to the place they were chased out of:“When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’ When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order. Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first.” (Luke 11:24-25)You may clean house - or digitally minimize - but if you do not have good and joyful things to fill that space, there is little chance of making lasting change. I am challenged and inspired about the call to solitude and high-quality leisure and look forward to seeing how this will manifest itself in the upcoming months!"

144,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54283079-laura-fusaro,5,"I have read this book in less than 24 hours. I couldn’t stop. It struck me so much because it’s so revealing and true. I share Andrew Sullivan’s thought on social media and the technology world: “I used to be a human being. And endless bombardment of news and gossip and images has rendered us manic information addicts. It broke me. It might break you too.”Let’s all adopt the philosophy presented in this book! Let’s go back to a life without the obsessive need to take out our phones when bored, or alone, or just because we absolutely need to check our feeds. Does that add something valuable to our lives?As for me, I might try to dumb down my smartphone (I already deleted all social media, I can only browse on my computer - “I don’t think we need to be connected to so many people so frequently anyway“) and be more mindful and present."

Totally enjoyed the book and is a must read. Cal lays out why and how one can embrace Digital Minimalism and the benefits of the same. If you have been thinking about being in more control of how you use social media and other time consuming stuffs on the internet this book would provide you just the inspiration and the method to achieve the same. And if you have never thought of how you consume social media and anything and everything on the net, this book would get you to start thinking about why you should be more intentional in what you consume. "
146,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70353791-terry-maguire,5,"I am a huge fan of Cal Newport's writing and loved this latest one. This book begins by echoing several of the ideas central to Deep Work, but then takes a close look at social media and its effects on human psychology. As one would expect, Newport argues for putting one's core values & most important projects ahead of everything else and stripping away superfluous digital distraction that often ends up being a time sink without adding value. He also makes a compelling argument for bringing back quality conversation over shallow moments of connection. Like in Deep Work, he advocates for harnessing the best that tech has to offer without getting sucked into the attention economy. His prose style is lean and powerful and the research is meticulous and carefully documented."

I appreciated how Cal Newport looked at every side of the issue, provided research, and gave many wonderful suggestions for how to deepen a life of leisure without the digital world following you around. I especially loved his chapter on seeking solitude, which is something I have been thinking about a lot lately. This is one book that everyone needs to read in this day and age!"
148,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36839475-philippa-n,5,"How can we use technology to add value and connection to our lives without being sucked into being a money-generating cog in the faceless, attention economy for the mega digital business empires?The book, by computer scientist Cal Newport, is not anti technology. It’s about building awareness of how the smartphone in our pocket and the social media apps at our fingertips are hacking into our quality of life and making our connections with others vast but shallow. It’s about awareness of the problems that 24/7 connection often creates and what an intentional consumer can do to make technology a tool in towards building a fulfilling life. Read it, it possibly could change your life! "
149,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19633041-barry,2,"I got two solid takeaways from this book. 1. Incorporate more solitude in my life. I.E., walks, drive without listening to anything (e.g., audiobook, music, radio etc.).2. I deleted 90% of the social media from my phone, and I've been purposely using my phone less for leisure. That said, the book could have been 1/3 the size. Way too much repetition. Too much stuff on time management. The book could have been about time management instead of Digital Minimalism. Finally, the narrator was too polished. Really getting sick of authors not reading their own audiobook. I am looking for the essence of the writing."
150,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7537558-tiffany-freeman,5,"Such an important topic to be talking about right now. I feel like a lot of my acquaintances would accuse the author of being a “tech hater,” but I feel like that couldn’t be farther from the truth if you really listen to what he’s claiming. I’m honestly already on board with a lot of the suggestions he shares, so maybe I was an easy sell. But I enjoyed it and my kids even enjoyed the parts I shared with them. Also, it didn’t feel preachy or “self help,” a quality I cannot abide. Unexpectedly, it was FILLED with practical real world suggestions for addressing the problems presented, something that is left out of this kind of book too often. In fact, there are a few latent problem spots in my digital life that aren’t deliberate and I didn’t quite know what to do about. Much to my joy, there were some practice tips in this book that address those issues precisely and provide innovative solutions I hadn’t thought about... and they are simple enough that I plan to put them into practice immediately! I wish I could convince everyone I know to read this book. I am just ending a three month social media fast and, with the rebirth of Spring just around the corner, I feel like it was the perfect time in my life for this particular nugget of inspiration/transformation. "
151,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8676317-a-man-called-ove,4,"3.5/5 Minimalism is something intrinsic to me before I knew about the term, and so was digital minimalism. Sparing you the details, but ""screentime"" on iphone tells me that my total FB+Twitter+browsing usage on avg is less than 30 mins per day. And apart from goodreads and imdb on which serve an important function for me, I am not on any other SM (including Whatsapp or Insta).Wished to take a step further and also compare notes. A lot of it - opting for quality communications and avoiding distractions was intutively clear since the unsavoury aspects of Facebook and Twitter have been in the news, especially since Trump's election. But interestingly it also suggested something I suspected - many Indians lack a quality hobby and hence are SM and WA addicts. If you do not have an activity you love - be it jogging, reading, playing music, sports or even watching cinema etc, you are better off with the blue pill of SM (ref Matrix) :)On the negative side, the self-esteem angle needed to be discussed in depth. While the author talks of pseudo-pleasure derived from likes and Re-tweets, the self-esteem of some ppl atleast has come to depend on their likeability online.Overall, this is a short read at 200 pages and would say it is easily worth your time."
152,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83119544-stan,5,"I couldn't agree with this book more, and would highly recommend it!Cal Newport does a fantastic job of laying out the problem our screen craze is causing--in fact, if you're alive in today's world, you probably have recognized this problem already--and then he proposes some solutions. These solutions are real life examples from people who have gotten tired of their smartphone addiction, and have taken steps to be in control of their life. Some have simply implemented some clever, little hacks (albeit very intentional ones) to help them be productive, while others have made radical changes in the ways they interact with technology.Newport is not a Luddite (technology avoider) by any means, but instead he challenges us to make careful, intentional choices about how we use technology. A very relevant book for our time!"

In this book, Cal Newport explains how these technologies are engineered to make us addicted to the screens and how essential it is to become mindful about using them. He also presents a few concrete practice tips to get control over our digital life.But my take away message from this book was the importance of solitude and how it has been diminished from my life by the excuse of “well I am listening to audiobooks instead of surfing on Instagram!”. This is not the case, even audiobooks and podcasts steal your mindful moments which you can think, reflect and make valuable things. "

I very much disliked this book, though I like the intent and meaning that was the seed of original thought in it.

I have so much more time being off social media- I love it!!!

164,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13274832-luiz,5,"This book is a relief in a age where our attention is attracted by so many magnetic tools. It makes us think a lot about our priorities and abusive technology usage. Cal Newport is not anti-technology, but instead, he wants us to reflect how we engage with these tools in order to improve our quality of life.The message is: make deliberate choices and focus on things you care about (I mean, things you REALLY care about).As the author says: “Digital minimalism is much more than a set of rules, it’s about cultivating a life worth living in our current age of alluring devices”.Some notes from the book:* Don't click “likes”: connection is a low-bandwidth interaction (and it defines most of our online social lives). Conversation is much richer and a high-bandwidth communication. We should avoid the former. Clicking in the “Like” button, we teach our mind that connection replaces conversation. Social media can be a useful tool if we decide to use it as one of our conversation-centric communication tools rather than creating low-quality relationships. “Likes"" don’t build relationships.* Avoid the slot machine: social media is built to be a true slot machine. We keep pulling the lever - almost literally when refreshing the timeline - hoping for a reward. Something new to appear and satisfy our apetite. Or a notification saying that a bunch of people approves our post and generating a self-esteem boost.* ""Treat minutes of your life as a concrete substance. check how much of your life you trade for the activities you allow to claim your time. When we confront our habits from this perspective, we conclude that, more often than not, the cumulative cost of non-crucial things we clutter our life with are higher than the small benefits each clutter promises""* Spend time alone: we are always online and connected. We lost the capacity to see the benefits of solitude. Regular doses of self-reflection is healthy.* Take long walks: I'm incorporating more walks to my routine. When it’s possible, I choose walking. When it’s not possible, I'm commuting with the phone in the bottom of my backpack. This allows me to read/listen a book or just stay disconnected preventing the urge to check something in the smartphone without intention.* Reclaim leisure: prioritize demanding leisure activity over passive consumption.* Schedule low quality leisure: you don’t need to eliminate low quality leisure. Just schedule and create a threshold for usage. Remember: Facebook group (including Instagram and WhatsApp), for instance, is one of the most valuable companies in the world and there is a reason for this. They are great to capture the most valuable resource in the world: time.* Follow a leisure plan: if you don’t create a leisure plan, you will do the easiest thing available to you (e.g. scrolling the timeline until the end of the world).* Delete social media from your phone: unless you have a really good reason, you probably don’t need social media apps in your phone. If you need to use in your phone, use in the mobile browser and log out as soon as you finish what you intend to do. It will be an ugly and uncomfortable experience. Create friction for your bad habits (if you are interested about this subject, read ""Atomic Habits"")* Turn your device into single-purpose computers: our computers are powerful and we are capable to run multiple programs at the same time. Context-switching in a computer was never so easy. (Freedom.to / StayFocusd apps may help you)* Embrace slow media (http://en.slow-media.net/manifesto): monotasking, don’t be a passive consumer, choose actively what and how you want to consume, focus on quality rather than quantity.Join the attention resistance, be deliberate, live with intention and enjoy your short period of life without a phone in your face."
165,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20815501-amy,5,"A clear, compelling and well-researched case for the practice of Digital Minimalism. With minimalism having its hay-day a few years back the general term is clouded in connotations of rich hipsters. Also, given the ""recommended reads"" based on this book I was worried it would be stock-standard white-man self help. I wasn't sure what to expect.What I got, frankly, was great life advice. As someone who works computationally, like Cal, I think I needed the permission to seek more intentional use of technology. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone, but especially those of us who were introduced to unrestricted internet access during our youth (young millenials and zoomers I'm looking at you)."
166,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7154232-phil-sykora,5,"I like the way that Cal Newport structures the argument against mindless social media use (note: NOT against all technology use) in this book. It's not mere coincidence that you pick up your phone 85 times a day. It's not mere coincidence that, on average, teenagers nowadays spend nine hours of their day staring at screens. Some really smart nerds, after playing a game of ping pong in their offices in Silicon Valley, were able to gamify basic human sociality, and now their product is YOU. They have to keep you clicking, liking, favoriting, and hitting ""Next Episode.""And it's no coincidence that we've seen a sharp decline in general mental health. Almost everyone I talk to, when I ask them whether or not they think social media is a good thing for society, admits that it's not: it decreases their personal productivity, it makes them feel worse about themselves, and it gives them unhealthy ideas of what their peers are REALLY doing (which is never as interesting as it looks when you see the carefully curated content on their Snapchat stories or Instagram posts, which is specifically designed for maximum envy).Also, I like the distinction between high-bandwidth and low-bandwidth conversation. When you talk to someone in person, your brain is firing on all cylinders. It's highly engaged with what the other person is saying because during tribal times ignoring your fellow tribesmen could mean exclusion, and death. Whether you consciously think about it or not, you're paying attention to a person's vocal tonality, facial expressions, body language, and, of course, the words themselves. When you receive a text message, though, you're only getting one tier of that feedback: the words themselves (and maybe an emoji, a weak substitute). In the same way that your body is adapted for single-ingredient, high-fiber, nutrient dense fruits, vegetables, and lean meats, your brain is adapted for high-feedback conversation. Here's how I like to think about it, in academic analogy terms: bologna is to your body as text messaging is to your brain. You can eat bologna every once in a while, just like how you can text people every once in a while, but you don't want to make it a staple of your diet or else you're going to feel like shit all the time. Your brain needs person-to-person communication. Just because we live in a bologna-centric culture doesn't mean that you need to eat bologna all the time. It's okay to tell people that you don't like bologna. Eat a banana. Make a salad. Get a coffee with your best friend. Play Scrabble with your grandma. It's good for you.But what I like most about this book are the strategies within. It made me seriously reconsider my relationship with optional technologies, forcing me to think about who was REALLY in control. As a result, I've started the digital decluttering process and I've already read three books this month. I'm more productive AND more relaxed.If you can't quit for thirty days, can you quit at all?"

I finished this last night in one sitting and thought that it was great, however full of a lot of things I was already doing or had read elsewhere. Hence the four star review and not five. Then, I couldn’t sleep and created a list of all the things that I could actually change immediately to become more of a digital minimalist. After making my list I have around 30 action items either taken directly from this book or spurred by actions in this book based on my own digital experiences. That’s the thing I realized though is that there is no way someone could write a be all, end all guide on this subject because although we are all living in a digital world and some of our habits are the same, there are millions of apps out there and millions of websites, newsletters, podcasts and humans to connect with online. With each of us interacting with these in infinite ways, it would be impossible. Are there things in here I likely won’t put into practice? Absolutely. But given the steps I’ve taken in just 24 hours and the productivity and lightness I feel already, I highly recommend this book to literally everyone. As Mr. Newport says in the conclusion “it’s not really about technology, but is instead more about the quality of your life.” And who can argue with that!?"

It's pathetic.Social media is so powerful and can be used for so much good. Be warned of the social media companies, for they are after your attention and without careful notice, they will obtain it a detrimental cost to you. While reading this book I went to dinner and left my phone at home.And guess what??I ate and enjoyed my meal, talking to others, laughing with others... But at a certain point I was left to watch everyone... on their phones. I'm convinced our cellphones are more addictive than sugar. It's scary. Be selective with your time.

Digital Minimalism is a phenomenal follow up to Deep Work (and is largely built upon the same foundations). In it, Newport uncovers our underlying assumptions about technology and compares them to their unintended consequences: social media, isolation; notifications, gambling; consumption, anxiety.Technology is supposed to support our values; they should not be the source of value. If you value relationships, use technology to set meetings with friends -- don't text at the dinner table. If you value leisure, use technology to learn how to perfect a skill -- don't mindlessly scroll through your feed during your free time.Essentially: It's not about technology, it's about cultivating a life worth living in the midst of digital distraction.Other points:- Scrolling through social media may lead to a perceived lack of time.- Be comfortable missing out on the shallow content the Facebook news feed presents.- Liking and commenting is not necessarily a form of good communication.I'll be undertaking my 1 month digital declutter now.

First recommending solitude, where you spend time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from others (like using a journal to capture and organize your thoughts). Then the author recommends cultivating relationships. As social beings, we thrive on having richer, deeper relationships with other people. There are various high quality activities that can replace trivial digital consumption; select the ones that add value to your life. If you had to pay for the use of Facebook or Instagram, would you still be checking it 10-20 times a day? Limit your online time to a small number of carefully selected activities that strongly support the things you value."

It reminded me of the passage in Luke about demons returning to the place they were chased out of:“When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’ When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order. Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first.” (Luke 11:24-25)You may clean house - or digitally minimize - but if you do not have good and joyful things to fill that space, there is little chance of making lasting change. I am challenged and inspired about the call to solitude and high-quality leisure and look forward to seeing how this will manifest itself in the upcoming months!"

I share Andrew Sullivan’s thought on social media and the technology world: “I used to be a human being. And endless bombardment of news and gossip and images has rendered us manic information addicts. It broke me. It might break you too.”Let’s all adopt the philosophy presented in this book! Let’s go back to a life without the obsessive need to take out our phones when bored, or alone, or just because we absolutely need to check our feeds. Does that add something valuable to our lives?As for me, I might try to dumb down my smartphone (I already deleted all social media, I can only browse on my computer - “I don’t think we need to be connected to so many people so frequently anyway“) and be more mindful and present."

Totally enjoyed the book and is a must read. Cal lays out why and how one can embrace Digital Minimalism and the benefits of the same. If you have been thinking about being in more control of how you use social media and other time consuming stuffs on the internet this book would provide you just the inspiration and the method to achieve the same. And if you have never thought of how you consume social media and anything and everything on the net, this book would get you to start thinking about why you should be more intentional in what you consume.

This book begins by echoing several of the ideas central to Deep Work, but then takes a close look at social media and its effects on human psychology. As one would expect, Newport argues for putting one's core values & most important projects ahead of everything else and stripping away superfluous digital distraction that often ends up being a time sink without adding value. He also makes a compelling argument for bringing back quality conversation over shallow moments of connection. Like in Deep Work, he advocates for harnessing the best that tech has to offer without getting sucked into the attention economy. His prose style is lean and powerful and the research is meticulous and carefully documented."

I appreciated how Cal Newport looked at every side of the issue, provided research, and gave many wonderful suggestions for how to deepen a life of leisure without the digital world following you around. I especially loved his chapter on seeking solitude, which is something I have been thinking about a lot lately. This is one book that everyone needs to read in this day and age!"

It’s about building awareness of how the smartphone in our pocket and the social media apps at our fingertips are hacking into our quality of life and making our connections with others vast but shallow. It’s about awareness of the problems that 24/7 connection often creates and what an intentional consumer can do to make technology a tool in towards building a fulfilling life.

I.E., walks, drive without listening to anything (e.g., audiobook, music, radio etc.).2. I deleted 90% of the social media from my phone, and I've been purposely using my phone less for leisure. That said, the book could have been 1/3 the size. Way too much repetition. Too much stuff on time management. The book could have been about time management instead of Digital Minimalism. Finally, the narrator was too polished. Really getting sick of authors not reading their own audiobook. I am looking for the essence of the writing."

I feel like a lot of my acquaintances would accuse the author of being a “tech hater,” but I feel like that couldn’t be farther from the truth if you really listen to what he’s claiming. I’m honestly already on board with a lot of the suggestions he shares, so maybe I was an easy sell. But I enjoyed it and my kids even enjoyed the parts I shared with them. Also, it didn’t feel preachy or “self help,” a quality I cannot abide. Unexpectedly, it was FILLED with practical real world suggestions for addressing the problems presented, something that is left out of this kind of book too often. In fact, there are a few latent problem spots in my digital life that aren’t deliberate and I didn’t quite know what to do about. Much to my joy, there were some practice tips in this book that address those issues precisely and provide innovative solutions I hadn’t thought about... and they are simple enough that I plan to put them into practice immediately! I wish I could convince everyone I know to read this book. I am just ending a three month social media fast and, with the rebirth of Spring just around the corner, I feel like it was the perfect time in my life for this particular nugget of inspiration/transformation.

Sparing you the details, but ""screentime"" on iphone tells me that my total FB+Twitter+browsing usage on avg is less than 30 mins per day. And apart from goodreads and imdb on which serve an important function for me, I am not on any other SM (including Whatsapp or Insta).Wished to take a step further and also compare notes. A lot of it - opting for quality communications and avoiding distractions was intutively clear since the unsavoury aspects of Facebook and Twitter have been in the news, especially since Trump's election. But interestingly it also suggested something I suspected - many Indians lack a quality hobby and hence are SM and WA addicts. If you do not have an activity you love - be it jogging, reading, playing music, sports or even watching cinema etc, you are better off with the blue pill of SM (ref Matrix) :)On the negative side, the self-esteem angle needed to be discussed in depth. While the author talks of pseudo-pleasure derived from likes and Re-tweets, the self-esteem of some ppl atleast has come to depend on their likeability online.Overall, this is a short read at 200 pages and would say it is easily worth your time."

These solutions are real life examples from people who have gotten tired of their smartphone addiction, and have taken steps to be in control of their life. Some have simply implemented some clever, little hacks (albeit very intentional ones) to help them be productive, while others have made radical changes in the ways they interact with technology.Newport is not a Luddite (technology avoider) by any means, but instead he challenges us to make careful, intentional choices about how we use technology.

In this book, Cal Newport explains how these technologies are engineered to make us addicted to the screens and how essential it is to become mindful about using them. He also presents a few concrete practice tips to get control over our digital life.But my take away message from this book was the importance of solitude and how it has been diminished from my life by the excuse of “well I am listening to audiobooks instead of surfing on Instagram!”.

194,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13274832-luiz,5,"This book is a relief in a age where our attention is attracted by so many magnetic tools. It makes us think a lot about our priorities and abusive technology usage. Cal Newport is not anti-technology, but instead, he wants us to reflect how we engage with these tools in order to improve our quality of life.The message is: make deliberate choices and focus on things you care about (I mean, things you REALLY care about).As the author says: “Digital minimalism is much more than a set of rules, it’s about cultivating a life worth living in our current age of alluring devices”.Some notes from the book:* Don't click “likes”: connection is a low-bandwidth interaction (and it defines most of our online social lives). Conversation is much richer and a high-bandwidth communication. We should avoid the former. Clicking in the “Like” button, we teach our mind that connection replaces conversation. Social media can be a useful tool if we decide to use it as one of our conversation-centric communication tools rather than creating low-quality relationships. “Likes"" don’t build relationships.* Avoid the slot machine: social media is built to be a true slot machine. We keep pulling the lever - almost literally when refreshing the timeline - hoping for a reward. Something new to appear and satisfy our apetite. Or a notification saying that a bunch of people approves our post and generating a self-esteem boost.* ""Treat minutes of your life as a concrete substance. check how much of your life you trade for the activities you allow to claim your time. When we confront our habits from this perspective, we conclude that, more often than not, the cumulative cost of non-crucial things we clutter our life with are higher than the small benefits each clutter promises""* Spend time alone: we are always online and connected. We lost the capacity to see the benefits of solitude. Regular doses of self-reflection is healthy.* Take long walks: I'm incorporating more walks to my routine. When it’s possible, I choose walking. When it’s not possible, I'm commuting with the phone in the bottom of my backpack. This allows me to read/listen a book or just stay disconnected preventing the urge to check something in the smartphone without intention.* Reclaim leisure: prioritize demanding leisure activity over passive consumption.* Schedule low quality leisure: you don’t need to eliminate low quality leisure. Just schedule and create a threshold for usage. Remember: Facebook group (including Instagram and WhatsApp), for instance, is one of the most valuable companies in the world and there is a reason for this. They are great to capture the most valuable resource in the world: time.* Follow a leisure plan: if you don’t create a leisure plan, you will do the easiest thing available to you (e.g. scrolling the timeline until the end of the world).* Delete social media from your phone: unless you have a really good reason, you probably don’t need social media apps in your phone. If you need to use in your phone, use in the mobile browser and log out as soon as you finish what you intend to do. It will be an ugly and uncomfortable experience. Create friction for your bad habits (if you are interested about this subject, read ""Atomic Habits"")* Turn your device into single-purpose computers: our computers are powerful and we are capable to run multiple programs at the same time. Context-switching in a computer was never so easy. (Freedom.to / StayFocusd apps may help you)* Embrace slow media (http://en.slow-media.net/manifesto): monotasking, don’t be a passive consumer, choose actively what and how you want to consume, focus on quality rather than quantity.Join the attention resistance, be deliberate, live with intention and enjoy your short period of life without a phone in your face."
195,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20815501-amy,5,"A clear, compelling and well-researched case for the practice of Digital Minimalism. With minimalism having its hay-day a few years back the general term is clouded in connotations of rich hipsters. Also, given the ""recommended reads"" based on this book I was worried it would be stock-standard white-man self help. I wasn't sure what to expect.What I got, frankly, was great life advice. As someone who works computationally, like Cal, I think I needed the permission to seek more intentional use of technology. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone, but especially those of us who were introduced to unrestricted internet access during our youth (young millenials and zoomers I'm looking at you)."
196,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7154232-phil-sykora,5,"I like the way that Cal Newport structures the argument against mindless social media use (note: NOT against all technology use) in this book. It's not mere coincidence that you pick up your phone 85 times a day. It's not mere coincidence that, on average, teenagers nowadays spend nine hours of their day staring at screens. Some really smart nerds, after playing a game of ping pong in their offices in Silicon Valley, were able to gamify basic human sociality, and now their product is YOU. They have to keep you clicking, liking, favoriting, and hitting ""Next Episode.""And it's no coincidence that we've seen a sharp decline in general mental health. Almost everyone I talk to, when I ask them whether or not they think social media is a good thing for society, admits that it's not: it decreases their personal productivity, it makes them feel worse about themselves, and it gives them unhealthy ideas of what their peers are REALLY doing (which is never as interesting as it looks when you see the carefully curated content on their Snapchat stories or Instagram posts, which is specifically designed for maximum envy).Also, I like the distinction between high-bandwidth and low-bandwidth conversation. When you talk to someone in person, your brain is firing on all cylinders. It's highly engaged with what the other person is saying because during tribal times ignoring your fellow tribesmen could mean exclusion, and death. Whether you consciously think about it or not, you're paying attention to a person's vocal tonality, facial expressions, body language, and, of course, the words themselves. When you receive a text message, though, you're only getting one tier of that feedback: the words themselves (and maybe an emoji, a weak substitute). In the same way that your body is adapted for single-ingredient, high-fiber, nutrient dense fruits, vegetables, and lean meats, your brain is adapted for high-feedback conversation. Here's how I like to think about it, in academic analogy terms: bologna is to your body as text messaging is to your brain. You can eat bologna every once in a while, just like how you can text people every once in a while, but you don't want to make it a staple of your diet or else you're going to feel like shit all the time. Your brain needs person-to-person communication. Just because we live in a bologna-centric culture doesn't mean that you need to eat bologna all the time. It's okay to tell people that you don't like bologna. Eat a banana. Make a salad. Get a coffee with your best friend. Play Scrabble with your grandma. It's good for you.But what I like most about this book are the strategies within. It made me seriously reconsider my relationship with optional technologies, forcing me to think about who was REALLY in control. As a result, I've started the digital decluttering process and I've already read three books this month. I'm more productive AND more relaxed.If you can't quit for thirty days, can you quit at all?"

I finished this last night in one sitting and thought that it was great, however full of a lot of things I was already doing or had read elsewhere. Hence the four star review and not five. Then, I couldn’t sleep and created a list of all the things that I could actually change immediately to become more of a digital minimalist. After making my list I have around 30 action items either taken directly from this book or spurred by actions in this book based on my own digital experiences. That’s the thing I realized though is that there is no way someone could write a be all, end all guide on this subject because although we are all living in a digital world and some of our habits are the same, there are millions of apps out there and millions of websites, newsletters, podcasts and humans to connect with online. With each of us interacting with these in infinite ways, it would be impossible. Are there things in here I likely won’t put into practice? Absolutely. But given the steps I’ve taken in just 24 hours and the productivity and lightness I feel already, I highly recommend this book to literally everyone. As Mr. Newport says in the conclusion “it’s not really about technology, but is instead more about the quality of your life.” And who can argue with that!?"

It's pathetic.Social media is so powerful and can be used for so much good. Be warned of the social media companies, for they are after your attention and without careful notice, they will obtain it a detrimental cost to you. While reading this book I went to dinner and left my phone at home.And guess what??I ate and enjoyed my meal, talking to others, laughing with others... But at a certain point I was left to watch everyone... on their phones. I'm convinced our cellphones are more addictive than sugar. It's scary. Be selective with your time. Schedule social media time and adhere to that schedule. Enjoy and engage in face to face conversations. Soak in what you understand from tone and pitch of voice, from nonverbal communication.Try not to let something important be truncated to a text message.Change your digital ways.After reading this, I will think about what I'm doing every time I grab for my phone.I enjoy change.And change I will.Favourite quote: ""Digital minimalism definitively does not reject the innovations of the internet age, but instead rejects the way so many people currently engage with these tools."""

200,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84317608-javier-lorenzana,4,"Facebook didn’t promise to change our lives -- yet, it did. Digital Minimalism is a phenomenal follow up to Deep Work (and is largely built upon the same foundations). In it, Newport uncovers our underlying assumptions about technology and compares them to their unintended consequences: social media, isolation; notifications, gambling; consumption, anxiety.Technology is supposed to support our values; they should not be the source of value. If you value relationships, use technology to set meetings with friends -- don't text at the dinner table. If you value leisure, use technology to learn how to perfect a skill -- don't mindlessly scroll through your feed during your free time.Essentially: It's not about technology, it's about cultivating a life worth living in the midst of digital distraction.Other points:- Scrolling through social media may lead to a perceived lack of time.- Be comfortable missing out on the shallow content the Facebook news feed presents.- Liking and commenting is not necessarily a form of good communication.I'll be undertaking my 1 month digital declutter now. (Ofc, I still use Goodreads as a reading tracker. Nothing more.)"

There has been a rise in teenage anxiety, depression, and suicides because the generation that grew up on smartphones are being bombarded with carefully crafted posts, which makes their lives seem lacking.The author jumps around a little. First recommending solitude, where you spend time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from others (like using a journal to capture and organize your thoughts). Then the author recommends cultivating relationships. As social beings, we thrive on having richer, deeper relationships with other people. There are various high quality activities that can replace trivial digital consumption; select the ones that add value to your life. If you had to pay for the use of Facebook or Instagram, would you still be checking it 10-20 times a day? Limit your online time to a small number of carefully selected activities that strongly support the things you value."
202,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25252995-charity,4,"What I appreciated most about this book was that Newport spent as much time talking about the why and how of reducing your digital footprint as he did talking about the why and what to replace it with. It reminded me of the passage in Luke about demons returning to the place they were chased out of:“When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’ When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order. Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first.” (Luke 11:24-25)You may clean house - or digitally minimize - but if you do not have good and joyful things to fill that space, there is little chance of making lasting change. I am challenged and inspired about the call to solitude and high-quality leisure and look forward to seeing how this will manifest itself in the upcoming months!"

Let’s go back to a life without the obsessive need to take out our phones when bored, or alone, or just because we absolutely need to check our feeds. Does that add something valuable to our lives?As for me, I might try to dumb down my smartphone (I already deleted all social media, I can only browse on my computer - “I don’t think we need to be connected to so many people so frequently anyway“) and be more mindful and present."

Totally enjoyed the book and is a must read. Cal lays out why and how one can embrace Digital Minimalism and the benefits of the same. If you have been thinking about being in more control of how you use social media and other time consuming stuffs on the internet this book would provide you just the inspiration and the method to achieve the same. And if you have never thought of how you consume social media and anything and everything on the net, this book would get you to start thinking about why you should be more intentional in what you consume.

This book begins by echoing several of the ideas central to Deep Work, but then takes a close look at social media and its effects on human psychology. As one would expect, Newport argues for putting one's core values & most important projects ahead of everything else and stripping away superfluous digital distraction that often ends up being a time sink without adding value. He also makes a compelling argument for bringing back quality conversation over shallow moments of connection. Like in Deep Work, he advocates for harnessing the best that tech has to offer without getting sucked into the attention economy. His prose style is lean and powerful and the research is meticulous and carefully documented."

I appreciated how Cal Newport looked at every side of the issue, provided research, and gave many wonderful suggestions for how to deepen a life of leisure without the digital world following you around. I especially loved his chapter on seeking solitude, which is something I have been thinking about a lot lately. This is one book that everyone needs to read in this day and age!"

It’s about awareness of the problems that 24/7 connection often creates and what an intentional consumer can do to make technology a tool in towards building a fulfilling life.

I.E., walks, drive without listening to anything (e.g., audiobook, music, radio etc.).2. I deleted 90% of the social media from my phone, and I've been purposely using my phone less for leisure. That said, the book could have been 1/3 the size. Way too much repetition. Too much stuff on time management. The book could have been about time management instead of Digital Minimalism. Finally, the narrator was too polished. Really getting sick of authors not reading their own audiobook. I am looking for the essence of the writing."

I feel like a lot of my acquaintances would accuse the author of being a “tech hater,” but I feel like that couldn’t be farther from the truth if you really listen to what he’s claiming. I’m honestly already on board with a lot of the suggestions he shares, so maybe I was an easy sell. But I enjoyed it and my kids even enjoyed the parts I shared with them. Also, it didn’t feel preachy or “self help,” a quality I cannot abide. Unexpectedly, it was FILLED with practical real world suggestions for addressing the problems presented, something that is left out of this kind of book too often. In fact, there are a few latent problem spots in my digital life that aren’t deliberate and I didn’t quite know what to do about. Much to my joy, there were some practice tips in this book that address those issues precisely and provide innovative solutions I hadn’t thought about... and they are simple enough that I plan to put them into practice immediately! I wish I could convince everyone I know to read this book. I am just ending a three month social media fast and, with the rebirth of Spring just around the corner, I feel like it was the perfect time in my life for this particular nugget of inspiration/transformation.

Sparing you the details, but ""screentime"" on iphone tells me that my total FB+Twitter+browsing usage on avg is less than 30 mins per day. And apart from goodreads and imdb on which serve an important function for me, I am not on any other SM (including Whatsapp or Insta).Wished to take a step further and also compare notes. A lot of it - opting for quality communications and avoiding distractions was intutively clear since the unsavoury aspects of Facebook and Twitter have been in the news, especially since Trump's election. But interestingly it also suggested something I suspected - many Indians lack a quality hobby and hence are SM and WA addicts. If you do not have an activity you love - be it jogging, reading, playing music, sports or even watching cinema etc, you are better off with the blue pill of SM (ref Matrix) :)On the negative side, the self-esteem angle needed to be discussed in depth. While the author talks of pseudo-pleasure derived from likes and Re-tweets, the self-esteem of some ppl atleast has come to depend on their likeability online.Overall, this is a short read at 200 pages and would say it is easily worth your time."

These solutions are real life examples from people who have gotten tired of their smartphone addiction, and have taken steps to be in control of their life. Some have simply implemented some clever, little hacks (albeit very intentional ones) to help them be productive, while others have made radical changes in the ways they interact with technology.Newport is not a Luddite (technology avoider) by any means, but instead he challenges us to make careful, intentional choices about how we use technology.

In this book, Cal Newport explains how these technologies are engineered to make us addicted to the screens and how essential it is to become mindful about using them. He also presents a few concrete practice tips to get control over our digital life.But my take away message from this book was the importance of solitude and how it has been diminished from my life by the excuse of “well I am listening to audiobooks instead of surfing on Instagram!”. This is not the case, even audiobooks and podcasts steal your mindful moments which you can think, reflect and make valuable things. "

I very much disliked this book, though I like the intent and meaning that was the seed of original thought in it.

224,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13274832-luiz,5,"This book is a relief in a age where our attention is attracted by so many magnetic tools. It makes us think a lot about our priorities and abusive technology usage. Cal Newport is not anti-technology, but instead, he wants us to reflect how we engage with these tools in order to improve our quality of life.The message is: make deliberate choices and focus on things you care about (I mean, things you REALLY care about).As the author says: “Digital minimalism is much more than a set of rules, it’s about cultivating a life worth living in our current age of alluring devices”.Some notes from the book:* Don't click “likes”: connection is a low-bandwidth interaction (and it defines most of our online social lives). Conversation is much richer and a high-bandwidth communication. We should avoid the former. Clicking in the “Like” button, we teach our mind that connection replaces conversation. Social media can be a useful tool if we decide to use it as one of our conversation-centric communication tools rather than creating low-quality relationships. “Likes"" don’t build relationships.* Avoid the slot machine: social media is built to be a true slot machine. We keep pulling the lever - almost literally when refreshing the timeline - hoping for a reward. Something new to appear and satisfy our apetite. Or a notification saying that a bunch of people approves our post and generating a self-esteem boost.* ""Treat minutes of your life as a concrete substance. check how much of your life you trade for the activities you allow to claim your time. When we confront our habits from this perspective, we conclude that, more often than not, the cumulative cost of non-crucial things we clutter our life with are higher than the small benefits each clutter promises""* Spend time alone: we are always online and connected. We lost the capacity to see the benefits of solitude. Regular doses of self-reflection is healthy.* Take long walks: I'm incorporating more walks to my routine. When it’s possible, I choose walking. When it’s not possible, I'm commuting with the phone in the bottom of my backpack. This allows me to read/listen a book or just stay disconnected preventing the urge to check something in the smartphone without intention.* Reclaim leisure: prioritize demanding leisure activity over passive consumption.* Schedule low quality leisure: you don’t need to eliminate low quality leisure. Just schedule and create a threshold for usage. Remember: Facebook group (including Instagram and WhatsApp), for instance, is one of the most valuable companies in the world and there is a reason for this. They are great to capture the most valuable resource in the world: time.* Follow a leisure plan: if you don’t create a leisure plan, you will do the easiest thing available to you (e.g. scrolling the timeline until the end of the world).* Delete social media from your phone: unless you have a really good reason, you probably don’t need social media apps in your phone. If you need to use in your phone, use in the mobile browser and log out as soon as you finish what you intend to do. It will be an ugly and uncomfortable experience. Create friction for your bad habits (if you are interested about this subject, read ""Atomic Habits"")* Turn your device into single-purpose computers: our computers are powerful and we are capable to run multiple programs at the same time. Context-switching in a computer was never so easy. (Freedom.to / StayFocusd apps may help you)* Embrace slow media (http://en.slow-media.net/manifesto): monotasking, don’t be a passive consumer, choose actively what and how you want to consume, focus on quality rather than quantity.Join the attention resistance, be deliberate, live with intention and enjoy your short period of life without a phone in your face."
225,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20815501-amy,5,"A clear, compelling and well-researched case for the practice of Digital Minimalism. With minimalism having its hay-day a few years back the general term is clouded in connotations of rich hipsters. Also, given the ""recommended reads"" based on this book I was worried it would be stock-standard white-man self help. I wasn't sure what to expect.What I got, frankly, was great life advice. As someone who works computationally, like Cal, I think I needed the permission to seek more intentional use of technology. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone, but especially those of us who were introduced to unrestricted internet access during our youth (young millenials and zoomers I'm looking at you)."
226,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7154232-phil-sykora,5,"I like the way that Cal Newport structures the argument against mindless social media use (note: NOT against all technology use) in this book. It's not mere coincidence that you pick up your phone 85 times a day. It's not mere coincidence that, on average, teenagers nowadays spend nine hours of their day staring at screens. Some really smart nerds, after playing a game of ping pong in their offices in Silicon Valley, were able to gamify basic human sociality, and now their product is YOU. They have to keep you clicking, liking, favoriting, and hitting ""Next Episode.""And it's no coincidence that we've seen a sharp decline in general mental health. Almost everyone I talk to, when I ask them whether or not they think social media is a good thing for society, admits that it's not: it decreases their personal productivity, it makes them feel worse about themselves, and it gives them unhealthy ideas of what their peers are REALLY doing (which is never as interesting as it looks when you see the carefully curated content on their Snapchat stories or Instagram posts, which is specifically designed for maximum envy).Also, I like the distinction between high-bandwidth and low-bandwidth conversation. When you talk to someone in person, your brain is firing on all cylinders. It's highly engaged with what the other person is saying because during tribal times ignoring your fellow tribesmen could mean exclusion, and death. Whether you consciously think about it or not, you're paying attention to a person's vocal tonality, facial expressions, body language, and, of course, the words themselves. When you receive a text message, though, you're only getting one tier of that feedback: the words themselves (and maybe an emoji, a weak substitute). In the same way that your body is adapted for single-ingredient, high-fiber, nutrient dense fruits, vegetables, and lean meats, your brain is adapted for high-feedback conversation. Here's how I like to think about it, in academic analogy terms: bologna is to your body as text messaging is to your brain. You can eat bologna every once in a while, just like how you can text people every once in a while, but you don't want to make it a staple of your diet or else you're going to feel like shit all the time. Your brain needs person-to-person communication. Just because we live in a bologna-centric culture doesn't mean that you need to eat bologna all the time. It's okay to tell people that you don't like bologna. Eat a banana. Make a salad. Get a coffee with your best friend. Play Scrabble with your grandma. It's good for you.But what I like most about this book are the strategies within. It made me seriously reconsider my relationship with optional technologies, forcing me to think about who was REALLY in control. As a result, I've started the digital decluttering process and I've already read three books this month. I'm more productive AND more relaxed.If you can't quit for thirty days, can you quit at all?"
227,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5538722-matt-kays,5,"I upped my rating on this one. I finished this last night in one sitting and thought that it was great, however full of a lot of things I was already doing or had read elsewhere. Hence the four star review and not five. Then, I couldn’t sleep and created a list of all the things that I could actually change immediately to become more of a digital minimalist. After making my list I have around 30 action items either taken directly from this book or spurred by actions in this book based on my own digital experiences. That’s the thing I realized though is that there is no way someone could write a be all, end all guide on this subject because although we are all living in a digital world and some of our habits are the same, there are millions of apps out there and millions of websites, newsletters, podcasts and humans to connect with online. With each of us interacting with these in infinite ways, it would be impossible. Are there things in here I likely won’t put into practice? Absolutely. But given the steps I’ve taken in just 24 hours and the productivity and lightness I feel already, I highly recommend this book to literally everyone. As Mr. Newport says in the conclusion “it’s not really about technology, but is instead more about the quality of your life.” And who can argue with that!?"

It's pathetic.Social media is so powerful and can be used for so much good. Be warned of the social media companies, for they are after your attention and without careful notice, they will obtain it a detrimental cost to you. While reading this book I went to dinner and left my phone at home.And guess what??I ate and enjoyed my meal, talking to others, laughing with others... But at a certain point I was left to watch everyone... on their phones. I'm convinced our cellphones are more addictive than sugar. It's scary. Be selective with your time. Schedule social media time and adhere to that schedule. Enjoy and engage in face to face conversations. Soak in what you understand from tone and pitch of voice, from nonverbal communication.Try not to let something important be truncated to a text message.Change your digital ways.After reading this, I will think about what I'm doing every time I grab for my phone.I enjoy change.And change I will.Favourite quote: ""Digital minimalism definitively does not reject the innovations of the internet age, but instead rejects the way so many people currently engage with these tools."""

230,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84317608-javier-lorenzana,4,"Facebook didn’t promise to change our lives -- yet, it did. Digital Minimalism is a phenomenal follow up to Deep Work (and is largely built upon the same foundations). In it, Newport uncovers our underlying assumptions about technology and compares them to their unintended consequences: social media, isolation; notifications, gambling; consumption, anxiety.Technology is supposed to support our values; they should not be the source of value. If you value relationships, use technology to set meetings with friends -- don't text at the dinner table. If you value leisure, use technology to learn how to perfect a skill -- don't mindlessly scroll through your feed during your free time.Essentially: It's not about technology, it's about cultivating a life worth living in the midst of digital distraction.Other points:- Scrolling through social media may lead to a perceived lack of time.- Be comfortable missing out on the shallow content the Facebook news feed presents.- Liking and commenting is not necessarily a form of good communication.I'll be undertaking my 1 month digital declutter now. (Ofc, I still use Goodreads as a reading tracker. Nothing more.)"
231,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12925436-annie,4,"Digital consumption has become like junk food consumption - it's pervasive, addictive, and negatively affecting our overall well-being. There has been a rise in teenage anxiety, depression, and suicides because the generation that grew up on smartphones are being bombarded with carefully crafted posts, which makes their lives seem lacking.The author jumps around a little. First recommending solitude, where you spend time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from others (like using a journal to capture and organize your thoughts). Then the author recommends cultivating relationships. As social beings, we thrive on having richer, deeper relationships with other people. There are various high quality activities that can replace trivial digital consumption; select the ones that add value to your life. If you had to pay for the use of Facebook or Instagram, would you still be checking it 10-20 times a day? Limit your online time to a small number of carefully selected activities that strongly support the things you value."
232,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25252995-charity,4,"What I appreciated most about this book was that Newport spent as much time talking about the why and how of reducing your digital footprint as he did talking about the why and what to replace it with. It reminded me of the passage in Luke about demons returning to the place they were chased out of:“When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’ When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order. Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first.” (Luke 11:24-25)You may clean house - or digitally minimize - but if you do not have good and joyful things to fill that space, there is little chance of making lasting change. I am challenged and inspired about the call to solitude and high-quality leisure and look forward to seeing how this will manifest itself in the upcoming months!"

I share Andrew Sullivan’s thought on social media and the technology world: “I used to be a human being. And endless bombardment of news and gossip and images has rendered us manic information addicts. It broke me. It might break you too.”Let’s all adopt the philosophy presented in this book! Let’s go back to a life without the obsessive need to take out our phones when bored, or alone, or just because we absolutely need to check our feeds. Does that add something valuable to our lives?As for me, I might try to dumb down my smartphone (I already deleted all social media, I can only browse on my computer - “I don’t think we need to be connected to so many people so frequently anyway“) and be more mindful and present."

As one would expect, Newport argues for putting one's core values & most important projects ahead of everything else and stripping away superfluous digital distraction that often ends up being a time sink without adding value. He also makes a compelling argument for bringing back quality conversation over shallow moments of connection. Like in Deep Work, he advocates for harnessing the best that tech has to offer without getting sucked into the attention economy.

That said, the book could have been 1/3 the size. Way too much repetition. Too much stuff on time management. The book could have been about time management instead of Digital Minimalism. Finally, the narrator was too polished. Really getting sick of authors not reading their own audiobook. I am looking for the essence of the writing."

I feel like a lot of my acquaintances would accuse the author of being a “tech hater,” but I feel like that couldn’t be farther from the truth if you really listen to what he’s claiming. I’m honestly already on board with a lot of the suggestions he shares, so maybe I was an easy sell. But I enjoyed it and my kids even enjoyed the parts I shared with them. Also, it didn’t feel preachy or “self help,” a quality I cannot abide. Unexpectedly, it was FILLED with practical real world suggestions for addressing the problems presented, something that is left out of this kind of book too often. In fact, there are a few latent problem spots in my digital life that aren’t deliberate and I didn’t quite know what to do about. Much to my joy, there were some practice tips in this book that address those issues precisely and provide innovative solutions I hadn’t thought about... and they are simple enough that I plan to put them into practice immediately! I wish I could convince everyone I know to read this book. I am just ending a three month social media fast and, with the rebirth of Spring just around the corner, I feel like it was the perfect time in my life for this particular nugget of inspiration/transformation.

Sparing you the details, but ""screentime"" on iphone tells me that my total FB+Twitter+browsing usage on avg is less than 30 mins per day. And apart from goodreads and imdb on which serve an important function for me, I am not on any other SM (including Whatsapp or Insta).Wished to take a step further and also compare notes. A lot of it - opting for quality communications and avoiding distractions was intutively clear since the unsavoury aspects of Facebook and Twitter have been in the news, especially since Trump's election. But interestingly it also suggested something I suspected - many Indians lack a quality hobby and hence are SM and WA addicts. If you do not have an activity you love - be it jogging, reading, playing music, sports or even watching cinema etc, you are better off with the blue pill of SM (ref Matrix) :)On the negative side, the self-esteem angle needed to be discussed in depth. While the author talks of pseudo-pleasure derived from likes and Re-tweets, the self-esteem of some ppl atleast has come to depend on their likeability online.Overall, this is a short read at 200 pages and would say it is easily worth your time."

These solutions are real life examples from people who have gotten tired of their smartphone addiction, and have taken steps to be in control of their life. Some have simply implemented some clever, little hacks (albeit very intentional ones) to help them be productive, while others have made radical changes in the ways they interact with technology.Newport is not a Luddite (technology avoider) by any means, but instead he challenges us to make careful, intentional choices about how we use technology.

In this book, Cal Newport explains how these technologies are engineered to make us addicted to the screens and how essential it is to become mindful about using them. He also presents a few concrete practice tips to get control over our digital life.But my take away message from this book was the importance of solitude and how it has been diminished from my life by the excuse of “well I am listening to audiobooks instead of surfing on Instagram!”. This is not the case, even audiobooks and podcasts steal your mindful moments which you can think, reflect and make valuable things. "

254,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13274832-luiz,5,"This book is a relief in a age where our attention is attracted by so many magnetic tools. It makes us think a lot about our priorities and abusive technology usage. Cal Newport is not anti-technology, but instead, he wants us to reflect how we engage with these tools in order to improve our quality of life.The message is: make deliberate choices and focus on things you care about (I mean, things you REALLY care about).As the author says: “Digital minimalism is much more than a set of rules, it’s about cultivating a life worth living in our current age of alluring devices”.Some notes from the book:* Don't click “likes”: connection is a low-bandwidth interaction (and it defines most of our online social lives). Conversation is much richer and a high-bandwidth communication. We should avoid the former. Clicking in the “Like” button, we teach our mind that connection replaces conversation. Social media can be a useful tool if we decide to use it as one of our conversation-centric communication tools rather than creating low-quality relationships. “Likes"" don’t build relationships.* Avoid the slot machine: social media is built to be a true slot machine. We keep pulling the lever - almost literally when refreshing the timeline - hoping for a reward. Something new to appear and satisfy our apetite. Or a notification saying that a bunch of people approves our post and generating a self-esteem boost.* ""Treat minutes of your life as a concrete substance. check how much of your life you trade for the activities you allow to claim your time. When we confront our habits from this perspective, we conclude that, more often than not, the cumulative cost of non-crucial things we clutter our life with are higher than the small benefits each clutter promises""* Spend time alone: we are always online and connected. We lost the capacity to see the benefits of solitude. Regular doses of self-reflection is healthy.* Take long walks: I'm incorporating more walks to my routine. When it’s possible, I choose walking. When it’s not possible, I'm commuting with the phone in the bottom of my backpack. This allows me to read/listen a book or just stay disconnected preventing the urge to check something in the smartphone without intention.* Reclaim leisure: prioritize demanding leisure activity over passive consumption.* Schedule low quality leisure: you don’t need to eliminate low quality leisure. Just schedule and create a threshold for usage. Remember: Facebook group (including Instagram and WhatsApp), for instance, is one of the most valuable companies in the world and there is a reason for this. They are great to capture the most valuable resource in the world: time.* Follow a leisure plan: if you don’t create a leisure plan, you will do the easiest thing available to you (e.g. scrolling the timeline until the end of the world).* Delete social media from your phone: unless you have a really good reason, you probably don’t need social media apps in your phone. If you need to use in your phone, use in the mobile browser and log out as soon as you finish what you intend to do. It will be an ugly and uncomfortable experience. Create friction for your bad habits (if you are interested about this subject, read ""Atomic Habits"")* Turn your device into single-purpose computers: our computers are powerful and we are capable to run multiple programs at the same time. Context-switching in a computer was never so easy. (Freedom.to / StayFocusd apps may help you)* Embrace slow media (http://en.slow-media.net/manifesto): monotasking, don’t be a passive consumer, choose actively what and how you want to consume, focus on quality rather than quantity.Join the attention resistance, be deliberate, live with intention and enjoy your short period of life without a phone in your face."
255,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20815501-amy,5,"A clear, compelling and well-researched case for the practice of Digital Minimalism. With minimalism having its hay-day a few years back the general term is clouded in connotations of rich hipsters. Also, given the ""recommended reads"" based on this book I was worried it would be stock-standard white-man self help. I wasn't sure what to expect.What I got, frankly, was great life advice. As someone who works computationally, like Cal, I think I needed the permission to seek more intentional use of technology. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone, but especially those of us who were introduced to unrestricted internet access during our youth (young millenials and zoomers I'm looking at you)."
256,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7154232-phil-sykora,5,"I like the way that Cal Newport structures the argument against mindless social media use (note: NOT against all technology use) in this book. It's not mere coincidence that you pick up your phone 85 times a day. It's not mere coincidence that, on average, teenagers nowadays spend nine hours of their day staring at screens. Some really smart nerds, after playing a game of ping pong in their offices in Silicon Valley, were able to gamify basic human sociality, and now their product is YOU. They have to keep you clicking, liking, favoriting, and hitting ""Next Episode.""And it's no coincidence that we've seen a sharp decline in general mental health. Almost everyone I talk to, when I ask them whether or not they think social media is a good thing for society, admits that it's not: it decreases their personal productivity, it makes them feel worse about themselves, and it gives them unhealthy ideas of what their peers are REALLY doing (which is never as interesting as it looks when you see the carefully curated content on their Snapchat stories or Instagram posts, which is specifically designed for maximum envy).Also, I like the distinction between high-bandwidth and low-bandwidth conversation. When you talk to someone in person, your brain is firing on all cylinders. It's highly engaged with what the other person is saying because during tribal times ignoring your fellow tribesmen could mean exclusion, and death. Whether you consciously think about it or not, you're paying attention to a person's vocal tonality, facial expressions, body language, and, of course, the words themselves. When you receive a text message, though, you're only getting one tier of that feedback: the words themselves (and maybe an emoji, a weak substitute). In the same way that your body is adapted for single-ingredient, high-fiber, nutrient dense fruits, vegetables, and lean meats, your brain is adapted for high-feedback conversation. Here's how I like to think about it, in academic analogy terms: bologna is to your body as text messaging is to your brain. You can eat bologna every once in a while, just like how you can text people every once in a while, but you don't want to make it a staple of your diet or else you're going to feel like shit all the time. Your brain needs person-to-person communication. Just because we live in a bologna-centric culture doesn't mean that you need to eat bologna all the time. It's okay to tell people that you don't like bologna. Eat a banana. Make a salad. Get a coffee with your best friend. Play Scrabble with your grandma. It's good for you.But what I like most about this book are the strategies within. It made me seriously reconsider my relationship with optional technologies, forcing me to think about who was REALLY in control. As a result, I've started the digital decluttering process and I've already read three books this month. I'm more productive AND more relaxed.If you can't quit for thirty days, can you quit at all?"
257,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5538722-matt-kays,5,"I upped my rating on this one. I finished this last night in one sitting and thought that it was great, however full of a lot of things I was already doing or had read elsewhere. Hence the four star review and not five. Then, I couldn’t sleep and created a list of all the things that I could actually change immediately to become more of a digital minimalist. After making my list I have around 30 action items either taken directly from this book or spurred by actions in this book based on my own digital experiences. That’s the thing I realized though is that there is no way someone could write a be all, end all guide on this subject because although we are all living in a digital world and some of our habits are the same, there are millions of apps out there and millions of websites, newsletters, podcasts and humans to connect with online. With each of us interacting with these in infinite ways, it would be impossible. Are there things in here I likely won’t put into practice? Absolutely. But given the steps I’ve taken in just 24 hours and the productivity and lightness I feel already, I highly recommend this book to literally everyone. As Mr. Newport says in the conclusion “it’s not really about technology, but is instead more about the quality of your life.” And who can argue with that!?"

It's pathetic.Social media is so powerful and can be used for so much good. Be warned of the social media companies, for they are after your attention and without careful notice, they will obtain it a detrimental cost to you. While reading this book I went to dinner and left my phone at home.And guess what??I ate and enjoyed my meal, talking to others, laughing with others... But at a certain point I was left to watch everyone... on their phones. I'm convinced our cellphones are more addictive than sugar. It's scary. Be selective with your time. Schedule social media time and adhere to that schedule. Enjoy and engage in face to face conversations. Soak in what you understand from tone and pitch of voice, from nonverbal communication.Try not to let something important be truncated to a text message.Change your digital ways.After reading this, I will think about what I'm doing every time I grab for my phone.I enjoy change.And change I will.Favourite quote: ""Digital minimalism definitively does not reject the innovations of the internet age, but instead rejects the way so many people currently engage with these tools."""

260,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84317608-javier-lorenzana,4,"Facebook didn’t promise to change our lives -- yet, it did. Digital Minimalism is a phenomenal follow up to Deep Work (and is largely built upon the same foundations). In it, Newport uncovers our underlying assumptions about technology and compares them to their unintended consequences: social media, isolation; notifications, gambling; consumption, anxiety.Technology is supposed to support our values; they should not be the source of value. If you value relationships, use technology to set meetings with friends -- don't text at the dinner table. If you value leisure, use technology to learn how to perfect a skill -- don't mindlessly scroll through your feed during your free time.Essentially: It's not about technology, it's about cultivating a life worth living in the midst of digital distraction.Other points:- Scrolling through social media may lead to a perceived lack of time.- Be comfortable missing out on the shallow content the Facebook news feed presents.- Liking and commenting is not necessarily a form of good communication.I'll be undertaking my 1 month digital declutter now. (Ofc, I still use Goodreads as a reading tracker. Nothing more.)"
261,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12925436-annie,4,"Digital consumption has become like junk food consumption - it's pervasive, addictive, and negatively affecting our overall well-being. There has been a rise in teenage anxiety, depression, and suicides because the generation that grew up on smartphones are being bombarded with carefully crafted posts, which makes their lives seem lacking.The author jumps around a little. First recommending solitude, where you spend time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from others (like using a journal to capture and organize your thoughts). Then the author recommends cultivating relationships. As social beings, we thrive on having richer, deeper relationships with other people. There are various high quality activities that can replace trivial digital consumption; select the ones that add value to your life. If you had to pay for the use of Facebook or Instagram, would you still be checking it 10-20 times a day? Limit your online time to a small number of carefully selected activities that strongly support the things you value."
262,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25252995-charity,4,"What I appreciated most about this book was that Newport spent as much time talking about the why and how of reducing your digital footprint as he did talking about the why and what to replace it with. It reminded me of the passage in Luke about demons returning to the place they were chased out of:“When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’ When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order. Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first.” (Luke 11:24-25)You may clean house - or digitally minimize - but if you do not have good and joyful things to fill that space, there is little chance of making lasting change. I am challenged and inspired about the call to solitude and high-quality leisure and look forward to seeing how this will manifest itself in the upcoming months!"

I share Andrew Sullivan’s thought on social media and the technology world: “I used to be a human being. And endless bombardment of news and gossip and images has rendered us manic information addicts. It broke me. It might break you too.”Let’s all adopt the philosophy presented in this book! Let’s go back to a life without the obsessive need to take out our phones when bored, or alone, or just because we absolutely need to check our feeds. Does that add something valuable to our lives?As for me, I might try to dumb down my smartphone (I already deleted all social media, I can only browse on my computer - “I don’t think we need to be connected to so many people so frequently anyway“) and be more mindful and present."

If you have been thinking about being in more control of how you use social media and other time consuming stuffs on the internet this book would provide you just the inspiration and the method to achieve the same. And if you have never thought of how you consume social media and anything and everything on the net, this book would get you to start thinking about why you should be more intentional in what you consume.

This book begins by echoing several of the ideas central to Deep Work, but then takes a close look at social media and its effects on human psychology. As one would expect, Newport argues for putting one's core values & most important projects ahead of everything else and stripping away superfluous digital distraction that often ends up being a time sink without adding value. He also makes a compelling argument for bringing back quality conversation over shallow moments of connection. Like in Deep Work, he advocates for harnessing the best that tech has to offer without getting sucked into the attention economy. His prose style is lean and powerful and the research is meticulous and carefully documented."

It’s about awareness of the problems that 24/7 connection often creates and what an intentional consumer can do to make technology a tool in towards building a fulfilling life.

That said, the book could have been 1/3 the size. Way too much repetition. Too much stuff on time management. The book could have been about time management instead of Digital Minimalism.

I’m honestly already on board with a lot of the suggestions he shares, so maybe I was an easy sell. But I enjoyed it and my kids even enjoyed the parts I shared with them. Also, it didn’t feel preachy or “self help,” a quality I cannot abide. Unexpectedly, it was FILLED with practical real world suggestions for addressing the problems presented, something that is left out of this kind of book too often. In fact, there are a few latent problem spots in my digital life that aren’t deliberate and I didn’t quite know what to do about. Much to my joy, there were some practice tips in this book that address those issues precisely and provide innovative solutions I hadn’t thought about... and they are simple enough that I plan to put them into practice immediately!

Sparing you the details, but ""screentime"" on iphone tells me that my total FB+Twitter+browsing usage on avg is less than 30 mins per day. And apart from goodreads and imdb on which serve an important function for me, I am not on any other SM (including Whatsapp or Insta).Wished to take a step further and also compare notes. A lot of it - opting for quality communications and avoiding distractions was intutively clear since the unsavoury aspects of Facebook and Twitter have been in the news, especially since Trump's election. But interestingly it also suggested something I suspected - many Indians lack a quality hobby and hence are SM and WA addicts. If you do not have an activity you love - be it jogging, reading, playing music, sports or even watching cinema etc, you are better off with the blue pill of SM (ref Matrix) :)On the negative side, the self-esteem angle needed to be discussed in depth. While the author talks of pseudo-pleasure derived from likes and Re-tweets, the self-esteem of some ppl atleast has come to depend on their likeability online.Overall, this is a short read at 200 pages and would say it is easily worth your time."

These solutions are real life examples from people who have gotten tired of their smartphone addiction, and have taken steps to be in control of their life. Some have simply implemented some clever, little hacks (albeit very intentional ones) to help them be productive, while others have made radical changes in the ways they interact with technology.Newport is not a Luddite (technology avoider) by any means, but instead he challenges us to make careful, intentional choices about how we use technology. A very relevant book for our time!"

In this book, Cal Newport explains how these technologies are engineered to make us addicted to the screens and how essential it is to become mindful about using them. He also presents a few concrete practice tips to get control over our digital life.But my take away message from this book was the importance of solitude and how it has been diminished from my life by the excuse of “well I am listening to audiobooks instead of surfing on Instagram!”. This is not the case, even audiobooks and podcasts steal your mindful moments which you can think, reflect and make valuable things. "

I very much disliked this book, though I like the intent and meaning that was the seed of original thought in it. The tokenizing of women's experiences in this book was severely disappointing and off-putting. Nope, nope and nope. "

He does it again in this book. He’s no Luddite and he doesn’t encourage mindless tech adoption but instead argues for what he calls “digital minimalism.” The latter two thirds of the book on “practices” were my favorite parts of the book."

I deleted it from my phone over the weekend and was able to read this entire book in that time, decluttering my house in many areas, do more yard work, sell things on FB market and exercise more!!! I can see how getting off this app is going to be good for me- it was not fulfilling and I felt obligated to check it daily :( especially as an influencer! I have one more post to share- ironically it's about another book for an author! Then I am going to start my 30-day digital detox! I may even learn to play an instrument or learn new skills! I have so much more time being off social media- I love it!!! I highly recommend this book if you need some data behind the way you are feeling toward your phone, maybe you need to read the goals of FB & IG toward your time-guess what? it makes them more $$$$ the more you check it!

284,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13274832-luiz,5,"This book is a relief in a age where our attention is attracted by so many magnetic tools. It makes us think a lot about our priorities and abusive technology usage. Cal Newport is not anti-technology, but instead, he wants us to reflect how we engage with these tools in order to improve our quality of life.The message is: make deliberate choices and focus on things you care about (I mean, things you REALLY care about).As the author says: “Digital minimalism is much more than a set of rules, it’s about cultivating a life worth living in our current age of alluring devices”.Some notes from the book:* Don't click “likes”: connection is a low-bandwidth interaction (and it defines most of our online social lives). Conversation is much richer and a high-bandwidth communication. We should avoid the former. Clicking in the “Like” button, we teach our mind that connection replaces conversation. Social media can be a useful tool if we decide to use it as one of our conversation-centric communication tools rather than creating low-quality relationships. “Likes"" don’t build relationships.* Avoid the slot machine: social media is built to be a true slot machine. We keep pulling the lever - almost literally when refreshing the timeline - hoping for a reward. Something new to appear and satisfy our apetite. Or a notification saying that a bunch of people approves our post and generating a self-esteem boost.* ""Treat minutes of your life as a concrete substance. check how much of your life you trade for the activities you allow to claim your time. When we confront our habits from this perspective, we conclude that, more often than not, the cumulative cost of non-crucial things we clutter our life with are higher than the small benefits each clutter promises""* Spend time alone: we are always online and connected. We lost the capacity to see the benefits of solitude. Regular doses of self-reflection is healthy.* Take long walks: I'm incorporating more walks to my routine. When it’s possible, I choose walking. When it’s not possible, I'm commuting with the phone in the bottom of my backpack. This allows me to read/listen a book or just stay disconnected preventing the urge to check something in the smartphone without intention.* Reclaim leisure: prioritize demanding leisure activity over passive consumption.* Schedule low quality leisure: you don’t need to eliminate low quality leisure. Just schedule and create a threshold for usage. Remember: Facebook group (including Instagram and WhatsApp), for instance, is one of the most valuable companies in the world and there is a reason for this. They are great to capture the most valuable resource in the world: time.* Follow a leisure plan: if you don’t create a leisure plan, you will do the easiest thing available to you (e.g. scrolling the timeline until the end of the world).* Delete social media from your phone: unless you have a really good reason, you probably don’t need social media apps in your phone. If you need to use in your phone, use in the mobile browser and log out as soon as you finish what you intend to do. It will be an ugly and uncomfortable experience. Create friction for your bad habits (if you are interested about this subject, read ""Atomic Habits"")* Turn your device into single-purpose computers: our computers are powerful and we are capable to run multiple programs at the same time. Context-switching in a computer was never so easy. (Freedom.to / StayFocusd apps may help you)* Embrace slow media (http://en.slow-media.net/manifesto): monotasking, don’t be a passive consumer, choose actively what and how you want to consume, focus on quality rather than quantity.Join the attention resistance, be deliberate, live with intention and enjoy your short period of life without a phone in your face."
285,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20815501-amy,5,"A clear, compelling and well-researched case for the practice of Digital Minimalism. With minimalism having its hay-day a few years back the general term is clouded in connotations of rich hipsters. Also, given the ""recommended reads"" based on this book I was worried it would be stock-standard white-man self help. I wasn't sure what to expect.What I got, frankly, was great life advice. As someone who works computationally, like Cal, I think I needed the permission to seek more intentional use of technology. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone, but especially those of us who were introduced to unrestricted internet access during our youth (young millenials and zoomers I'm looking at you)."
286,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7154232-phil-sykora,5,"I like the way that Cal Newport structures the argument against mindless social media use (note: NOT against all technology use) in this book. It's not mere coincidence that you pick up your phone 85 times a day. It's not mere coincidence that, on average, teenagers nowadays spend nine hours of their day staring at screens. Some really smart nerds, after playing a game of ping pong in their offices in Silicon Valley, were able to gamify basic human sociality, and now their product is YOU. They have to keep you clicking, liking, favoriting, and hitting ""Next Episode.""And it's no coincidence that we've seen a sharp decline in general mental health. Almost everyone I talk to, when I ask them whether or not they think social media is a good thing for society, admits that it's not: it decreases their personal productivity, it makes them feel worse about themselves, and it gives them unhealthy ideas of what their peers are REALLY doing (which is never as interesting as it looks when you see the carefully curated content on their Snapchat stories or Instagram posts, which is specifically designed for maximum envy).Also, I like the distinction between high-bandwidth and low-bandwidth conversation. When you talk to someone in person, your brain is firing on all cylinders. It's highly engaged with what the other person is saying because during tribal times ignoring your fellow tribesmen could mean exclusion, and death. Whether you consciously think about it or not, you're paying attention to a person's vocal tonality, facial expressions, body language, and, of course, the words themselves. When you receive a text message, though, you're only getting one tier of that feedback: the words themselves (and maybe an emoji, a weak substitute). In the same way that your body is adapted for single-ingredient, high-fiber, nutrient dense fruits, vegetables, and lean meats, your brain is adapted for high-feedback conversation. Here's how I like to think about it, in academic analogy terms: bologna is to your body as text messaging is to your brain. You can eat bologna every once in a while, just like how you can text people every once in a while, but you don't want to make it a staple of your diet or else you're going to feel like shit all the time. Your brain needs person-to-person communication. Just because we live in a bologna-centric culture doesn't mean that you need to eat bologna all the time. It's okay to tell people that you don't like bologna. Eat a banana. Make a salad. Get a coffee with your best friend. Play Scrabble with your grandma. It's good for you.But what I like most about this book are the strategies within. It made me seriously reconsider my relationship with optional technologies, forcing me to think about who was REALLY in control. As a result, I've started the digital decluttering process and I've already read three books this month. I'm more productive AND more relaxed.If you can't quit for thirty days, can you quit at all?"
287,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5538722-matt-kays,5,"I upped my rating on this one. I finished this last night in one sitting and thought that it was great, however full of a lot of things I was already doing or had read elsewhere. Hence the four star review and not five. Then, I couldn’t sleep and created a list of all the things that I could actually change immediately to become more of a digital minimalist. After making my list I have around 30 action items either taken directly from this book or spurred by actions in this book based on my own digital experiences. That’s the thing I realized though is that there is no way someone could write a be all, end all guide on this subject because although we are all living in a digital world and some of our habits are the same, there are millions of apps out there and millions of websites, newsletters, podcasts and humans to connect with online. With each of us interacting with these in infinite ways, it would be impossible. Are there things in here I likely won’t put into practice? Absolutely. But given the steps I’ve taken in just 24 hours and the productivity and lightness I feel already, I highly recommend this book to literally everyone. As Mr. Newport says in the conclusion “it’s not really about technology, but is instead more about the quality of your life.” And who can argue with that!?"

It's pathetic.Social media is so powerful and can be used for so much good. Be warned of the social media companies, for they are after your attention and without careful notice, they will obtain it a detrimental cost to you. While reading this book I went to dinner and left my phone at home.And guess what??I ate and enjoyed my meal, talking to others, laughing with others... But at a certain point I was left to watch everyone... on their phones. I'm convinced our cellphones are more addictive than sugar. It's scary. Be selective with your time. Schedule social media time and adhere to that schedule. Enjoy and engage in face to face conversations. Soak in what you understand from tone and pitch of voice, from nonverbal communication.Try not to let something important be truncated to a text message.Change your digital ways.After reading this, I will think about what I'm doing every time I grab for my phone.I enjoy change.And change I will.Favourite quote: ""Digital minimalism definitively does not reject the innovations of the internet age, but instead rejects the way so many people currently engage with these tools."""

290,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84317608-javier-lorenzana,4,"Facebook didn’t promise to change our lives -- yet, it did. Digital Minimalism is a phenomenal follow up to Deep Work (and is largely built upon the same foundations). In it, Newport uncovers our underlying assumptions about technology and compares them to their unintended consequences: social media, isolation; notifications, gambling; consumption, anxiety.Technology is supposed to support our values; they should not be the source of value. If you value relationships, use technology to set meetings with friends -- don't text at the dinner table. If you value leisure, use technology to learn how to perfect a skill -- don't mindlessly scroll through your feed during your free time.Essentially: It's not about technology, it's about cultivating a life worth living in the midst of digital distraction.Other points:- Scrolling through social media may lead to a perceived lack of time.- Be comfortable missing out on the shallow content the Facebook news feed presents.- Liking and commenting is not necessarily a form of good communication.I'll be undertaking my 1 month digital declutter now. (Ofc, I still use Goodreads as a reading tracker. Nothing more.)"
291,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12925436-annie,4,"Digital consumption has become like junk food consumption - it's pervasive, addictive, and negatively affecting our overall well-being. There has been a rise in teenage anxiety, depression, and suicides because the generation that grew up on smartphones are being bombarded with carefully crafted posts, which makes their lives seem lacking.The author jumps around a little. First recommending solitude, where you spend time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from others (like using a journal to capture and organize your thoughts). Then the author recommends cultivating relationships. As social beings, we thrive on having richer, deeper relationships with other people. There are various high quality activities that can replace trivial digital consumption; select the ones that add value to your life. If you had to pay for the use of Facebook or Instagram, would you still be checking it 10-20 times a day? Limit your online time to a small number of carefully selected activities that strongly support the things you value."
292,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25252995-charity,4,"What I appreciated most about this book was that Newport spent as much time talking about the why and how of reducing your digital footprint as he did talking about the why and what to replace it with. It reminded me of the passage in Luke about demons returning to the place they were chased out of:“When an impure spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’ When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order. Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first.” (Luke 11:24-25)You may clean house - or digitally minimize - but if you do not have good and joyful things to fill that space, there is little chance of making lasting change. I am challenged and inspired about the call to solitude and high-quality leisure and look forward to seeing how this will manifest itself in the upcoming months!"

I share Andrew Sullivan’s thought on social media and the technology world: “I used to be a human being. And endless bombardment of news and gossip and images has rendered us manic information addicts. It broke me. It might break you too.”Let’s all adopt the philosophy presented in this book! Let’s go back to a life without the obsessive need to take out our phones when bored, or alone, or just because we absolutely need to check our feeds. Does that add something valuable to our lives?As for me, I might try to dumb down my smartphone (I already deleted all social media, I can only browse on my computer - “I don’t think we need to be connected to so many people so frequently anyway“) and be more mindful and present."

Totally enjoyed the book and is a must read. Cal lays out why and how one can embrace Digital Minimalism and the benefits of the same. If you have been thinking about being in more control of how you use social media and other time consuming stuffs on the internet this book would provide you just the inspiration and the method to achieve the same. And if you have never thought of how you consume social media and anything and everything on the net, this book would get you to start thinking about why you should be more intentional in what you consume.

This book begins by echoing several of the ideas central to Deep Work, but then takes a close look at social media and its effects on human psychology. As one would expect, Newport argues for putting one's core values & most important projects ahead of everything else and stripping away superfluous digital distraction that often ends up being a time sink without adding value. He also makes a compelling argument for bringing back quality conversation over shallow moments of connection. Like in Deep Work, he advocates for harnessing the best that tech has to offer without getting sucked into the attention economy. His prose style is lean and powerful and the research is meticulous and carefully documented."

I appreciated how Cal Newport looked at every side of the issue, provided research, and gave many wonderful suggestions for how to deepen a life of leisure without the digital world following you around. I especially loved his chapter on seeking solitude, which is something I have been thinking about a lot lately. This is one book that everyone needs to read in this day and age!"

It’s about building awareness of how the smartphone in our pocket and the social media apps at our fingertips are hacking into our quality of life and making our connections with others vast but shallow. It’s about awareness of the problems that 24/7 connection often creates and what an intentional consumer can do to make technology a tool in towards building a fulfilling life. Read it, it possibly could change your life! "
299,0525536515,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19633041-barry,2,"I got two solid takeaways from this book. 1. Incorporate more solitude in my life. I.E., walks, drive without listening to anything (e.g., audiobook, music, radio etc.).2. I deleted 90% of the social media from my phone, and I've been purposely using my phone less for leisure. That said, the book could have been 1/3 the size. Way too much repetition. Too much stuff on time management. The book could have been about time management instead of Digital Minimalism. Finally, the narrator was too polished. Really getting sick of authors not reading their own audiobook. I am looking for the essence of the writing."
