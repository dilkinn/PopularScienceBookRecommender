The writing was atrocious, and made me want to stab people, starting with the author. The book gets an extra star for putting the very well done chapter on probability up front, so I could get through it before I began to hate the very existence of the universe for leading to the study of science and thus the writing of this book."
1,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237421-joe,1,"Annoying is the fairest word I could come up with to describe The Canon after suffering through it for these past weeks. In fact, this is easily the most annoying book I've ever read, not because the science is poor or the topics contrived. In fact, the subject areas Angier chooses to describe are somewhat intuitive and logically ordered (for the most part). She just has this writing style that, well... it just makes me want to scream. ""Peppers"" isn't even the appropriate word. She sort of... ""vomits"" alliterative phrases into every possible nook and cranny of her work. Nine out of ten paragraphs (I said paragraphs, not pages or chapters) ends with an exhausting colloquialism, contrived personal experience or mixed metaphor. And ten out of ten of those literary devices is gunked up with painfully clunky alliteration, some of which doesn't even make sense.I don't think you understand how systemic it is though. Therefore, I'm going to patronizingly write the rest of this review in Angier's style to drive the point home. Here goes:My gut tells me the author thinks this syntactical tactic is either intellectually illustrative or seductively scholarly, like James Bond giving a Powerpoint presentation, but with slightly less ass slapping. It would be valuable if these stylistic stutters were better thought out or perhaps just better spread out across this accursed anthology. But they're not. They're uncomfortably packed together like the reliably rude commuters crammed onto the N train during my mundane morning migration to work.There is value in this book though, and that is the actual science. Unfortunately, it stands stoic and silent, drowned out by the ostensibly clever but officious and indefensible affectations we readers are brought to bear. To recapitulate my reticence and perhaps to highlight this haphazard heads-up: It's like a mighty mastodon masticated a healthy handful of diamonds and then defecated onto my lawn. Sure there are some gems in there, but I'd rather stay poor than fervently forage such feces.Don't read it."
2,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/649064-matthew,1,"I gave up on this one after about 100 pages. I hate not finishing books, but this one was so irritating it started to make me angry. Too often it seemed like the book was less about science than about showcasing Angier's insufferable cleverness. She couldn't seem to decide whether she wanted to be playfully incomprehensible in a Finnegan's Wakean way, or drolly incisive in a kind of Popish verse. The result was a bastard child caught somewhere between the two that had an annoying sing-song quality, a Dr. Seussical nonsensicall-ness that extended to making up words, a ludicrous love of alliteration (just like that last two clauses, in fact, but found in virtually every paragraph), and pop culture allusions so obscure that I spent more time on the semiotics than the science. For example, it took me a few minutes to puzzle out the connection between the Earth's core, soccer, and the name Wilson, until I finally realized she was referring to Castaway--some of the difficulty coming from the fact that Wilson was a volleyball, not a soccer ball--and by the time this all clicked together I had forgotten that the whole point of the weird connection was supposed to help explain atomic nuclei. This got to the point that I started to feel dumb, not because I couldn't understand the science, but because I couldn't parse her goddamn sentences. Anyway, if there's a main idea here, it's that the book blew."
3,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147289-jason-pettus,2,"(Reprinted from the Chicago Center for Literature and Photography [cclapcenter.com]. I am the original author of this essay, as well as the owner of CCLaP; it is not being reprinted illegally here.)The more I learn about the history of science, the more I realize why it has such a precarious, semi-mystical reputation with so much of the general public by now; because when the modern ""scientific process"" was first formed in the 1600s, the first few generations of ""scientists"" were starting almost from scratch, meaning that the average member of the public could go out and replicate the experiments these people were doing, and understand for themselves what science is and why it's so important. (Indeed, it was this activity that got us both the terms ""gentleman scientist"" and ""dilettante,"" descriptions you hardly ever hear applied to members of the general public anymore.) But as we all know by now, the collective body of scientific knowledge we now have actually grows exponentially, not in a linear fashion; and that means, for example, that 400 years after the subject was invented, most working scientists anymore are forced to devote their entire adult lives to studying and understanding everything that came before them in their field's history, leaving their current work looking in the eyes of most laypeople like incomprehensible gibberish. How nice would it be, then, to have a simple yet smart guide to just the basics of science all over again, the building blocks of each field first discovered back during the Renaissance and Enlightenment by the exact proto-scientists just mentioned, the same material covered in school during childhood but in this case written expressly for grown-ups.Well, that's exactly what The Canon is supposed to be, the newest book by Pulitzer winner and New York Times columnist Natalie Angier, in which she approached a whole series of scientists and asked them, ""What are the four or five most basic things about your profession that you wish the general public all knew?"" But unfortunately I wasn't able to actually get through much of The Canon, because it's sadly written in a style that I simply can't stand, the ""quirky narrative magazine feature journalism"" style -- you know, where every interview has to start with a description of what the person is wearing, and some funny metaquote from the beginning of the interview about the ground rules of the interview (""The first thing,"" Prince said to me as we sat down at the cafe, ""is no questions about the baby""), and is just filled with inane psychoanalysis and personal observations by the quirky journalist in question, all of it infused with what's supposed to be a jokey sense of humor but is more often snide little passive-aggressive statements of jealousy concerning the people being interviewed.I can't freaking stand this style of journalism; and unfortunately the entirety of The Canon is written in this style, meaning I could barely make it through chapter one before quickly giving up altogether. And that's why, like I always do in these cases, I'm recusing myself from giving the book a formal 10-point score, because I simply didn't read enough of it to give it a fair rating. Sigh. Dear journalism industry: Please stop teaching generation after generation of young impressionable students to write this way, and certainly please stop handing them Pulitzer f-cking Prizes when they do. Give me sober, give me reflective, give me genuinely funny -- hell, give me unedited transcripts; but enough already with the quirky narrative magazine feature style of presenting interviews. Seriously, enough.Out of 10: N/A "
4,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/379386-jessica,1,"The goal of this book is to recapture science from the nerdy margins of society. Angier does this by bimboizing everything, referring to David Trump's toupee as a force of nature and with a giddy, Tourettes-like prose (at the end of one paragraph anecdote involving the Bronx: ""Gee, thonx, said the Bronx. I feel richer already. Do you mind if I give a Bronx cheer?"") If this is the only way to popularize science, let's leave it unpopular. "
5,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1063661-woodge,4,"Science is cool. I didn't think so back in high school but I like to think I've matured since then. Back then I evaded chemistry by taking an earth science course (Rocks for Jocks). Seems a shame because now I find that stuff very interesting. What Ms. Angier so ably and entertainingly covers in this slim -- under 300 pages -- volume is the scientific method, probabilities, physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and astronomy. You don't have to be a Ph.D. to understand it either. I only wish some of my teachers in high school had been as interesting as Ms. Angier. (In particular, my physics teacher in high school was a waste of meat.) I've read about several of these subjects before in some other entertaining books. Two that come to mind are Innumeracy by John Paulos and A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson. I'd recommend all of these books as they complement each other and if you're interested in learning cool stuff and filling in a few gaps in your knowledge, these three books are excellent and a good place to start. And Ms. Angier has some fun turning a good phrase here and there. One passage that stood out was one in which she explains just what it means to be a scientific theory. It should be taught in school. The rigorous work and facts behind an established theory (like, say, evolution) makes a statement like ""Of course, it's just a theory,"" sound especially obtuse."
6,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10886285-aimee,1,"I am reading this book slowly. It has some great ideas and I love the premise of laying out in simple, brief terms the basic tenets of science, but the writing style drives me crazy, and not in a good way.She uses similes and ""cleverly"" written conversational comments and she doesn't stop, there are 1-5 on every single page. These phrases have no value, they don't help illustrate or clarify a concept; they just comes across as oh-so-clever. That's okay once in a while, and I understand the desire to liven up what could be written in a very dull way, but it's a constant stream and you just want to put your hands on her shoulders, look her in the eye, and with a gentle tone tell her to stop trying so hard and if that doesn't work, scream ""knock it off!!!""Here are five examples from a randomly selected page, pg 170: ""...grow tall like aspiring totem poles..."" Not just totem pole, but aspiring. Okay, whatever, but then one sentence later, ""If you bought a euphorbia and nicknamed it Saguaro, your aunt from Tucson might not see any cause to correct you."" What? ""...the echidna looks like a Muppet."" Does it? ""...a stomach as rugged as a cement mixer..."" am I reading a book written for children? ""...through the guiding hand and cracking cat-o'-nine whip of natural selection..."" STOP!Just a few more, I have to share. I randomly open the book again. This time to page 143. Let's see what's there...""If you combine sodium and chlorine, poof, they'll react instantaneously, heatedly: Sodom meets Gomorrah, and we're left with a pillar of salt."" Ack! Then when she writes something useful like explaining that cells generate trace amounts of alcohol when burning energy and that's why a locker room can smell like a pub, I instinctively roll my eyes, but then realize that the that was actually useful information tucked away between all the clutter.Whew. Needed to get that off my chest. Overall though, I encourage and applaud her work as science basics need to be written about and read, and I'm sure some people love her writing style. It might just be me who feels bitchy after reading a few pages."
7,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/391739-kaylee,1,"Perhaps I hated this book because I have a science background. Perhaps I despised being talked to like a second grader because I actually know how to ""think scientifically"". And perhaps I loathed every second of my multiple tries at reading this because I'm no fun.But really, science background or not, this book is written like a kids book -- except with ""witty"" phrases every damn sentence instead of illustrations. I might not have had as much of a problem with it had I felt like she intended to dumb down everything, but she explicitly said she feels that the problem with science being ""uninteresting"" is that people gloss over many topics to make them more palatable. While not glossing over them, she certainly didn't give any depth. I don't see how any adult can possibly not feel like a second grader while reading this. Science is interesting only if you have an interest in it -- creating an interest is a worthy goal, and my kudos to her for trying. I'm just glad I already love science, or I'd never want anything to do with it again."
8,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3892251-marie-desjardins,2,"I was really looking forward to reading this book, which purports to be a layperson's introduction to all things beautiful in science. But I can't imagine any layperson ever actually reading it. It's unbelievably long and dull -- the first chapter is 17 small-type pages about how people should like science more than they do, and makes the same points over and over again. The second chapter is 29 small-type pages about how science is cool. But it just meanders from point to point, with no particular organizational structure, and it very quickly becomes boring and tedious.I really only skimmed the rest of the book, because by this time I'd realized that this was really not an introduction to anything; it was more of a collection of random musings about random science-related topics. The chapter on Probability gives a few interesting examples of how probability theory, applied correctly, can lead to some nonintuitive results. Well, that's interesting, yes, but so what? The book doesn't go much of anywhere with it.Basically, I just thought this was a big disappointment: I can't imagine anybody who's not already really interested in science struggling their way through it (and those people are supposedly the intended audience); and somebody who's already interested and knows something about science isn't likely to learn much."
9,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2703554-kate,1,"The subtitle"" A whirligig tour of the beautiful basics of science, should have been my first clue, but i translated whirligig as more whirlwind and i bought the book. I assumed we would dash through the basic concepts of science, and through the race it would be a fun read for a topic I long to get my hands into again. But whirligig is actually a more accurate term for the spinning, circular prose, cliched phrases, lists of adjectives, and nonsensical metaphors plucked from thin air without bothering to establish a relationship to the topic. Reading the book was like watching a whirligig beetle dash in circles on the water, tossed about by its own wake and with no real direction or purpose. By way of example I give you this gem from page 134 , ""Perhaps nothing underscores carbon's chemical genius better than the breadth of its packaging options, from the dark, slippery, shavable format of graphite on one extreme, to fossilized starlight on the other- translucent, mesmeric, intransigent diamond, the hardest substance known, save for a human heart grown cold."" Now, overlooking that this paragraph is one long rambling sentence, the author almost lost me when she described diamonds as fossilized starlight. The description struck me as overly fanciful, and if she had stopped there i would have given a nod to the poetry and continued to read. But the next part of the sentence offered me a long list of characteristics including the word mesmeric. In a book that is striving to be conversational, she chooses rather obscure and heady words to toss around. This gives me the feeling that while breaking down the science concepts into bite sized bits, she still wants to emphasize that she is a big, important writer. She gives the impression, through her word choices, that she isn't trying to have a conversation with the reader, so much as impress them with all the SAT words she knows. But even that is forgivable up to a point. She is very knowledgeable and I can trust she has done her homework and is writing accurately about her subject. However, then we come to the last part of the sentence, tacked on as if it were ashamed to even be a part of it. ""Save for a human heart grown cold."" made me stop reading, full stop. I couldn't get past it. Oh, eventually I did, but I had to take a break. There are many books and many pages in the world I want to read, and it is generally advisable for authors never to give readers an excuse to put down their book and pick up someone else's, because we may never pick their book up again. There was also this gem on page 119, ""It is a cold, hard, tepid, flaccid, probabilistic truth."" that was both an unnecessary list combined with terrible and nonsensical metaphors with an SAT word thrown in at the end that represents all I disagreed with about the writing style of this book. The prose is also littered with popular cultural references to try and draw parallels between the cool things everyone knows and the cool things Natalie Angier wants us to know about science. The problem was that while i understood the science concepts just fine, I often got stumped on the cultural reference that was supposed to make it clearer. (PBS broadcasts of Suze Orman?) The chapters were so littered with random metaphors and references that I found them to be distracting rather than further illuminating of her point. She likens chemical bonds to James Bond, referencing several actors who played the character out of context from the original comparison, which then drags the metaphor in fits and starts along for five or six pages. She talks about incompetent sewing in home ec, likens polarized molecules to Mickey mouse, and mentions how the grand canyon was made in the most convoluted way possible: ""Give polarized water molecules about 6 million years, and they'll squeeze blood read beauty from stone, chipping 6,000 feet deep and 277 miles wide into Arizona's northern plateau, through limestone and sandstone and iron-rich shale, to scoop out a canyon the whole world can call Grand."" pg 131All of these widely disparate cultural references, packed into a chapter and overlaid with the long running James Bond allegory made me feel like a Whirligig indeed. She has obviously limited herself to a strictly American audience by including so many cultural markers, but even as an American myself, her references spanned so many topics and generations that I lost more than a few myself. Scattered amidst the whirling prose were solid facts, truly witty quotes from scientists, and interesting ideas. The problem became there were so many bugs littering the surface, it was impossible to find the gems underneath. "
10,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2922699-genia-lukin,1,"You know the joke that goes ""sip, don't gulp""?It's about this book.It's only possible to read it without annoyance in very, very small pieces. I found myself reading a half a chapter - a chapter at most - every day, but no more. Go further, and the alcoholic intoxication induced by severe overdose of puns and jokes gave me vertigo.It's not that the jokes are all bad; no, some of them are moderately clever, many of them made me at least smile. I am quite benevolent towards puns. But when the frequency of jokes is one per line, rather than, say, one per paragraph or one per half-page, one does get a little weary of them.But, really, this is not my biggest quibble with the book. I confess, I expected something entirely different under the name ""The Canon"". I was eagerly awaiting the exploration of the scientific canon in its literary sense; what great works form the foundations of a modern scientific education? What sort of texts every scientist must have read? What great works define our understanding of the world?Instead, I got a 'science for beginners'. And that is a pity, because other books, more focused, do a much better job of enlightening beginners as to the basics of what each science does and is. However, we are sorely lacking in books that are intended for the middle levels; those of us who do understand what a quark is, how an electron cloud forms, how old the universe is, but are not professional astronomers, chemists or microbiologists.Since I do have something of a scientific background, and I did not flunk my high school chemistry, I found the book rather tedious, and sometimes more than a little dull - amid all the jokes, that is. Not to mention that, while it's obvious Angier is enthusiastic for her subject, she can get immeasurably preachy, letting that superior attitude get away with her. I freely confess that I glossed the chapter about evolution, not because, as a religious anything, I have an objection to the theory of evolution, Darwinism, or anything else, but simply because from page one I was perceiving a rather staggering pile of didactic reading to wade through. By all means, could we focus on the basics of science, and leave the hammering of morals for some other book?The moderate drizzle of moralisms doesn't focus on that chapter alone. It's less pervasive, but not at all nonexistent.It wasn't all bad, though. The chapter on geology I found moderately entertaining, geology being the 'weakest' of my sciences. even there, though, I thought she missed her mark as an author when she went away from plate tectonics to talk about the formation and propagation of life.In short, if you actually know anything about science, don't read this book. Pick up something else, let the good Ms. Angier preach to the as yet unconverted, and the generally uninformed."
11,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1191018-dale,4,"The Canon is exactly what its subtitle says: a tour of the basics of science. Natalie Angier is a science writer; that is, a writer who is a knowledgeable observer of science and who is able to get scientists to explain things in terms the rest of us might understand. Her writing style is very light, loaded with enthusiasm, and a bit chatty at times. At first I found the chattiness to be slightly off-putting, but when I got to the chapters on material that I didn't know much about (molecular biology and chemistry), the light-hearted distractions were actually helpful in keeping me focused on the main points.There are chapters on scientific method, the scale of things, basic physics, chemistry, molecular biology, geology, and astronomy. I found that the less I knew about a subject the more I enjoyed the material. So the chemistry and molecular biology chapters really stood out. I had not really learned anything new about cellular biology since high school (except for inferred 'facts' from reading newspaper and magazine articles about new drugs or new viruses). So I found the chapter on molecular biology especially interesting. She devotes many pages to the busy activity inside every cell, ranging from protein synthesis to cell division to communication with other cells. This is really interesting stuff.Highly recommended. "
12,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14925176-ryan,2,"My compulsion with finishing a text once I've started it us the only reason I made it to the final page of The Canon. Angier gets a C for effort - many interesting topics are considered and there were a number of thought-provoking passages. Two things made The Canon a tough read for me. First, Angier cannot go more than two paragraphs without throwing in some want-to-be-clever non sequitur. I believe Angier was trying to make the book user-friendly for the science-phobes, but these efforts fell flat and were far too prevalent. Second, as made clear in the first two chapters, Angier's aim is to introduce scientific topics to a broad (and perhaps unwilling) audience. She then takes every attempt to disparage the use of mathematics in science - which seems to contradict her higher purpose. Overall, a lackluster book that did not meet its own expectations. "
13,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2366630-eal,5,"Science is beautiful.Me reading this book was like a fish going to a lecture about why water is important. In other words, Angier is preaching to the converted. But, even if I didn't already consider science fascinating and amazing and completely utterly awesome, I'd soon come around to that point of view. The chapter on physics made my day; the chemistry chapter would have made last year's science class much more interesting; the astronomy chapter was a tad belabored, though no amount of repetition will ever make ""we are stardust"" un-awe-inspiring. After reading this book, I want to dive straight into the 500s in my local Dewey Decimal-organized library and come out in maybe ten years. There's so much we know about the universe, and so much left to go, all within the realms of hard science - reading this book one day after fighting through a philosophy survey was like climbing to the top of a mountain to stargaze after a week suffocating in a crowd trapped into thinking only in human scale. Science, I repeat, is beautiful."
14,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5900232-heather-browning,3,"I liked this more than I thought I might, given the reviews. The writing style was occasionally annoying but quite readable and often entertaining. My real issue was the lack of structure - the chapters seemed to wind through an unmarked path and the writing style meant this journey took a lot longer than perhaps it needed to. As someone familiar with science, it wasn't an issue, I could provide my own signposts, but I think it would be a major barrier to someone hoping to learn. Overall, I can't see this book succeeding in its aim of introducing science to people previously unfamiliar, as it was far to long and dense and I think it would be quite overwhelming. "
15,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10601562-shawn,3,"I am torn...  I enjoyed the ideas in this book (though I really didn't learn anything new) and in general I liked that the author worked to make the science approachable. The author obviously loves language and finds ways to bring pop culture references in to help non-scientifically minded readers understanding. I do think that this will in the longer term give the book a ""dated"" feel and someday make it unreadable by younger audiences. The problem I had was that at times the author seemed to be more focused on finding cute ways to say things than on the ideas themselves. The biggest reason for this seemed to be to avoid scaring any unwary readers with ""math"" or ""hard"" science. The best example of this comes right at the end when the author talks about the Drake equation. Rather than just give the equation and tell what the variables mean (to me a wonderful way to understand how astronomy intersects historical sciences), the author mentions, almost off-handedly, a few of the variables and then only really explains the last one. In all, a good way to bring the science fearful into a basic understanding that could be nurtured into interest or even love. However, probably not a book for someone who has seen their way through less flowery, more information dense tomes."
16,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23428788-john-kaufmann,2,"It was hard to give this two stars. The author gets the science right, and tells it in an lively, interesting way. But the reason I gave it only two stars was because it beats a dead horse. She gives an example of something, but not to leave anything to the imagination, she gives another example to illustrate her point, then another. All correct. All interesting. But enough already. Move on to the next topic."
17,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/189972-lisa,3,"Natalie Angier writes wonderful columns which frequently appear in the New York Times. While her style can become a bit draining after a while, it is easy to see how much she loves science. And, perhaps for that reason alone, I enjoyed this book. I should have read this book only one chapter at a time. It would have been more enjoyable that way."
18,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/835446-katie,4,"Very cool book. Everything you ever wanted to know about all kinds of scientific stuff -- from the names and sizes of the tiniest of particles, to the way static electricty really works.

19,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8372569-lee,2,"Horrid forced humor and content that drove in no particular direction. What was supposed to keep me turning the pages? A bunch of references to things with no depth or explanation connected by a string of sophomoric puns worthy of a college feature writing student? I wanted so much to like this book; unfortunately, I couldn't even finish it."
20,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23975834-lee,1,"There was some interesting science in here, but for me the book was ruined by her very annoying writing style, which made it a real chore. If you're looking for a concise introduction to general science, with some wit thrown in, then I'd say avoid this book altogether; Bill Bryson did it so much better in A Short History of Nearly Everything."
21,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68583290-jamie,3,"There is a lot of good information in this book, basic science clearly described. No technical knowledge is assumed, and no math is required, so it is easy to follow, and it has the added benefit of explaining recent developments in the areas it covers. There are chapters on probability, calibration, physics, chemistry, evolutionary biology, molecular biology, geology, and astronomy. As a well known, Pulitzer Prize winning science writer, Natalie Angier was able to get access to leading scientists and researchers from top universities, who answered questions, explained what was going on in their fields, and made an effort to communicate what they would like non-specialists to know.Chapters usually start with a bit of human interest (an old journalist trick) as a narrative hook to ease the reader to the topic. For instance, the chapter on molecular biology starts with a discussion of the author’s nightly tooth brushing and flossing routine and uses it as a jumping off point for a discussion of bacteria. It then moves on to cells, and then to their inner workings: the nucleus, mitochondria, DNA, protein synthesis, and replication. The description of how enzymes unzip specific sections of a cell’s DNA to read the code for the specific protein needed at that moment is very good, just in-depth enough to give the general reader a sense of the wondrous complexity that is going on constantly within the trillions of cells that make up a person. There are plenty of moments like that in the book, the kind that make you say, “Wow, I didn’t know that – how interesting!”So, if it is a good introduction to modern science for the general reader, with lots of information provided by some of the leading specialists in their fields, why does this book have so many negative reviews? It is the writing style, which, in an attempt to be conversational and lighthearted, devolves into an endless series of puns, bad jokes, and cultural references. It just goes on and on. At first it seems odd, then distracting, then seriously annoying. Who writes like that, at least who outside of smart-alecky teenage contributors to high school newspapers? I found myself saying, “Please stop. Just stop. Stick with the subject at hand; it needs no puerile humor to make it interesting.”The book did have editors, I checked: Amanda and Jayne (last names not given, probably to protect their reputations). What were they thinking when they allowed the manuscript to be published like this? They should have wrestled the computer from the Angier’s hands and not allowed her to touch the keyboard again until she was safely back on her meds.The science content of this book is interesting and accessible, and there are many things to help a reader better understand the world around us. The strange and annoying writing style, however, made me wish it had been a better book."

23,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2000229-suzanne,3,"Smart, fun, friendly book about the sciences, with a separate chapter for each: statistics, geology, astronomy, biology, chemistry, physics, etc. Clears up a lot of bunk, and would be useful as a refresher to get a handle on each subject."
24,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11934349-jimbo,5,"I had learned or heard about over 90% of the topics in the book, but it was a great refresher. I understand all those ideas better now, and I can express them to others better too.This is a perfect science book for the masses. I do have a science background, but the ideas are simple without being dumbed down.Or if you're looking for useful analogies to help you teach others, this is a great source."
25,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64009217-jonathan-donihue,3,"I was really kind of disappointed with this book. It's not that it was poorly researched or badly written. It contained all the usual material that a non-mathematical, science overview might be expected to contain. It's just that there were two problems really should have been addressed. If they had been, it would have made the book so much better. Firstly, the author started by promising the reader that she was going to take a different approach from the typical introductory science book or class. She was going to explain the why of things rather than just listing off a bunch of facts. She didn't deliver on this promise. To be fair, she did present the material in a linear order that made it relatively easy for me to see how one freestanding fact might follow naturally from the one(s) preceding it. But for me, someone who asks a lot of whys and hows, a lot was left unexplained.Secondly, the author writes like a columnist. But again, to be fair, she is a science writer for a newspaper. The problem is, there's a difference between writing a column and writing a book. The primary purpose of a column is to entertain. A column needs to be pithy, attention grabbing, and droll. Angier's writing is perfect for that kind of short, entertaining, and comical medium. She mixes jokes, puns and one-liners in with her science facts at a ratio of about one to one. It's fun for a little while, but a whole book of it is just exhausting.In my opinion, she should have changed her writing style for this project. A book needs to carry the attention like a camel on a journey through the desert. Stopping and starting and lurching and joking just distracts the mind from being absorbed in the wonders of the scientific landscape. If the author had pulled out 99 percent of the jokes and puns and filled in that space with genuine prose, rich imagery, and flowery anecdotes, the book would have benefited greatly from it."
26,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23948922-gary,3,"This book is a fine review of about nine or ten meta-categories of introductory college science concepts. Presented in an easily understood format by Natalie Angier who calls herself, not a scientist, but a science writer.There are several types of literature. The large bulk of material which does a fine job of presentation on the professional stage, but doesn't have a big wow factor. And then a small group at the very top which knock you over with the beauty of their well crafted work.Ms. Angier strives, and STRIVES for the beautiful, well-crafted WoW! And with the first sentence, you think, yup, this is it. But then another beautiful sentence is thrown at you and you go, OK. With the next (beautiful) sentence you go, umm... the aim may be for beautiful, but the target is way overshot, and ends up on cute, and beyond even that and hits cutsey (this is not a compliment).It makes me think of when I was a little kid. I loved cotton candy, and only got it once a year at the county fair. Expectations ran high. My first bite was all I remembered and dreamed it could be. My second bite was great. My third bite was, wow, this is a lot of sugar. By the time I got to my last bite it was sickeningly sweet, and I didn't really enjoy it, just endured it. That was this book. A few beautiful sentences scattered naturally throughout the book, would have made it a masterwork. But being force fed every other sentence? Well kudos for writing creativity, but by the end of the book I was throwing it out with the last of my cotton candy. Too, too much syrupy sweetness.Edit (2015.06.24)This review was flagged as 'inappropriate.' I edited paragraph three to make it clear I was reviewing the writing style of this book and not the writer herself. Hopefully this addressed the flagger's concern, while staying true to my original evaluation."
27,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7346029-joanne,1,"This book just annoyed me. I didn't get far, what with the small font and lots of analogies and metaphors that I either didn't understand or were completely unnecessary and actually detrimental to anyone who seriously just picked up this book to get a basic understanding of science.The entire idea of the book is to teach science and yet I found myself floundering in a rant about how more people should just learn science and go into science and people really need to start valuing science and for god's sake why can't anyone see that I'M RIGHT ... SCIENCE!! That sums up the introduction for you (unless you want to read an extended rant including Angier's sister in law her ""pubescent children"" and the science museum. Spoiler alert: it's not necessary).I normally don't read reviews until I've finished the book (unless I read it because of the reviews), but the reviews of this book really turned me off (but in a good, thanks-for-saving-me-loads-of-time, way). I didn't like the tone of the book and the sort of passive-aggresive half-not funny way that Angier writes. It would be really nice if she could just present the science without all of the metaphors and analogies. For example in chapter 4 (physics) does the imagined asteroid really have to resemble a t-rex, or a giant trilobite, or Steven Spielberg? Can't you just say an asteroid and move on? It's this annoying beating around the bush that really put me off reading this.Overall, I found 'The Canon' to fall short of expectations and I hope that I find a book that delivers on it's promise to make the basics of science interesting and accesible. Basically, just don't read it. Whatever science is in there, it's not worth scrounging through this book to find it."
28,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/160042-starry,5,"I really enjoyed this book. The author manages to be entertaining, informative, and at times even lyrical as she gives an overview of the basics in the basic sciences (chemistry, physics, molecular biology, evolutionary biology, geology, astronomy). Sounds dry but she keeps it moving along and funny. I was especially curious about her writing on molecular biology (I have a PhD in this field and get frustrated with poorly written newspaper articles on mol.bio. research advances). She did a nice job in this section, as with the other sections. Warning though: the beginning of this chapter brought out my inner hypochrondriac -- I now brush with periodontal paranoia instead of just toothpaste.) It was also nice to read a primer on geology and astronomy. When you focus your education on one area of science, others get missed -- I've never taken courses in these fields and, sadly, I tuned out my dad's hiking lectures on geology.As a Christian and a scientist (but NOT a Christian Scientist; sorry, Tom!), all the author's criticism's of creationists especially hit home. Once again, I would like to take my fellow Christians aside and explain to them that all fields of science (even those that didn't yet exist in Darwin's day, such as genetics and mol.bio.) provide strong support for evolution. I can't say that more strongly. If a literal interpretation of the Genesis account is necessary to your faith in God, then please accept the 6-day creation account on faith alone, knowing that all evidence in God's creation itself supports evolution. And it's beautiful. "
29,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44772800-laura-hp,2,"This book is an interesting concept, of covering the founding principles of the major fields of science (or at least the ones that made the cut - stats, physics, evolutionary bio, molecular bio, chem, geology and astronomy). As someone with a science background, it didn't cover a lot of new ground for me (although the astronomy chapter was interesting and covered material you probably didn't learn in high school). Still, the book is full of important concepts that are valuable to learn and remember for understanding the world around us. That said, the way the book is written - every sentence literally stuffed with puns and plays on words and metaphors and references - makes it hard to muddle through! The point the author was trying to get across was often lost and it was hard to follow the meandering, pun-filled paragraphs. Some chapters were worse than others - I found the evolutionary biology chapter fairly readable, but the molecular biology chapter was hopeless. After the first few chapters, you do get used to it and I found myself learning to skim over the filler to get the overall message, but it's a barrier to understanding the point of the book - the beautiful basics of science!Overall, an interesting concept but I wish it had been presented with a different style and tone."
30,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/713538-kaitlyn-dennis,3,"Angier is thorough (a lot more so than I expected going into this) and accessible, and while some chapters covered more familiar ground than others, I felt I got something from each of them. Even in the driest sections, the conversational tone was intact and my interest was held. There are a lot of little literary/cultural winks thrown in with the substantive material, some working better than others. For some reason, the only one explained with a footnote was the reference to Rosencrantz & Guildenstern are Dead in the chapter on probability. My guess on that is is that the Stoppard reference was actually useful in understanding the concept, and thus the context was necessary. A lot of the others seem tacked on and as a way for the author to show off her cleverness. And besides the references, there are bits in here that seem like Angier was trying to prose it up and failing to do it well, falling into the trap of being overly cutesy. Unless you're talking to an eight year old, sentences like ""Star light, star bright, Brown wishes you'd try this trick at night"" are not really appropriate. She should have gone a little easier on the lit dust when it wasn't being used in a particularly helpful way. Which was often."
31,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3457236-peggie,3,"I started reading this book--well, listening to it on CD, really--over a year ago because I thought that it would be good for me to learn something about the basics of science. It has taken me a long time to finish it because science is not something I read for fun. I have always been an ""arts and letters"" person, and faked my way through high school chemistry with lots of help (and free answers) from a friend. Truly, I liked what I could understand about chemistry, but never really ""got"" it, and didn't even have the clarity of mind to know what questions to ask. So along came The Canon, and it seemed to be something that would help. Unlike the other reviewers, I didn't mind the author's self-aware, flippant style of writing (other than several sneery references to creationists). It held my interest which otherwise would have flagged. I thought that the author also did a great job of presenting all those basics that I somehow couldn't understand all along. I really am grateful that I know more about physics and chemistry now than I did before. I read a few of the other chapters, but not the whole thing, because that's as much as I wanted to know; and that worked fine, which is another good thing about this book. "
32,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15072306-dennis-mitton,3,"Angier has written a useful and expansive book that just does not carry me. I don’t argue – much – with the content: she aptly explains the foundations of modern science from math to physics to biology and things in between. She offers a broad view with a thousand rabbit trails to explore. But as much as I enjoyed the book, her writing simply wears me out. One reviewer calls the book ‘exuberant’: that’s an understatement. She writes with almost religious wonder. Her wide eyed descriptions lead to some choppy prose: “And this! And this! And this too!” Her over the top writing leads to all manner of over the top descriptions: DNA urges. Probabilities argue. Anthropomorphisms abound. I’m not sure who her anticipated audience is. Experienced science wonks will tire of the presentation – her enthusiasm sometimes overcomes clarity and adherence to strict definitions. But had someone handed me this when I was about fifteen? I would have devoured it.I give three stars. Lots of good content. And if anyone gets as excited about science as Angier is that’s no bad thing. "
33,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35683-shirley,4,"My inner science nerd felt confused (the chapter on physics), nostalgic (molecular/cell biology), and downright fascinated and amazed (geology and astronomy) (but never bored) as I traversed through the whirligig tour. This book was great learning/review on the beautiful basics of science bundled with a rather random, charming, and accessible writing style. Although she apparently interviewed hundreds of eminent scientists for this book, Angier's appreciation of what the average layperson would find interesting shines especially in her details revealing the scale of things. (It apparently rained for tens or even hundreds of thousands of years straight to create the Earth's oceans!) Overall a fun and informative read."
34,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1015304-frank-jude,4,"Go to the top scientists in the fields of physics, biology, chemistry, geology and astronomy and ask them what principles (not data or factoids) are central to their discipline and what they wish the general public knew and understood and then write a readable, enjoyable book about it. That's what top science writer, Natalie Angier did and the results are fabulous.If you are a science phile or phobe, this one is for you! At times Angier's wit gets the best of her. It's almost like she feels she can't go two or three sentences without some wry humor. Really, this book might be 1/4 shorter if all of her 'jokiness' had been edited out. However, most are funny, and this shouldn't get in your way too much, but it's the only reason this book gets a four instead of five star rating."
35,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2450933-leslie,5,"Okay, so I sort of cheated--I listened to the audio version of this marvelous book because I just can't read everything. It literally took me all winter, during my morning commutes--and it took that long because I kept going back over topics in the chapter on physics--but I finished just as the season ended. The presentation of the material, as well as the way in which it was read, was spirited and wonderful so if I didn't grasp every bit of the book it was not the fault of the author or reader...and there were concepts that I only vaguely understand (particularly, yes, in physics). But well worth the time, and I plan to go back to it again sometime in the future. Maybe it'll all make sense some day!"
36,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10280795-julia,3,"I've always wished that I'd studied chemistry in high school, because I didn't know even the most basic concepts from the field. Thanks to the author's entertaining explanations, I now feel like I have a much better understanding of how atoms stick together to form molecules (using different bonds like covalent and hydrogen bonds!) and how molecules stick together to form elements (essentially, it's all about electromagnetic attraction, it seems). The book covers much more than just chemistry, however, providing an overview of basic concepts in physics, chemistry, biology, statistics, and geology (those are the ones I remember anyway). It's a great book and I'd recommend it to those people who would like to brush up on what they learned in high school and college science."
37,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,5,"Awesome book, I loved it!! The Canon is sort of an intro to science, or rather, several different scientific fields: Physics, Statistics, Chemistry, Evolutionary Biology, Molecular Biology, Geology, and Astronomy. Whilst much of it I already knew, I still learned quite a lot and that always makes for a great read! Also, Natalie Angier makes learning so much FUN! Even if I didn't like science, I think I would have certainly been drawn into this book. Her writing is clear and easy to understand, and extremely witty! I had many good chuckles reading this book. Very much looking forward to reading some of her others!"
38,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/940357-joanna,3,"I finally buckled down and finished this book. I certainly appreciated getting a review of all of all of these topics and concepts learned (or glossed over) throughout school. It was a great refresher course. However, in her effort to make is ""accessible"" to the masses, she ends up going over the top, being annoyingly condescending and talking down to the reader. It is not something to be read on consecutive nights of reading, but it is a great reminder of basic scientific principles that it is important to understand. "
39,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/127289-emily,4,"Natalie, voiced by the wonderful Nike Doukas, explains some of the ""beautiful basics of science"" in such a way that they are easy to understand but still interesting to somebody who didn't get a BS but did well at an engineering school. The writing is wry, clever, beautiful; the scientific ideas are sound and deliciously linked to their metaphors in smaller facets of their lives; and Angier pulls no punches when she talks about facts that might make some fundamentalist members of our population squeamish or angry. I will be reading more of her."
40,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7818202-chris,2,"I was after a book on basics science to help me get back into study (and general knowledge).Yes the book did have that type of general basic science in it the book was more a series of anecdotes based around science topics. ‘The Cannon’ did have some good moments like the Philadelphia joke had me laughing out loud (much to strange looks of the people in the coffee shop), but in the end it was a bit of an uphill battle for me and I have other book I NEED to be getting on with.Not a bad book just not what I’m after. "
41,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/289004-al,4,"Although the froth is voluminous, the beer beneath is definitely worth sampling. Recommended for those who would enjoy a refresher course on the basics of the ""hard sciences"" long forgotten from high school. The chapter on scientific thinking and the discussion of evolution v. creationism/intelligent design are my favorites. Although I am not a believer in the latter, I might convert so I can utter the term ""irreducible complexity"" with abandon! "
42,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31412-sarah,3,"This book is a great approach to talking about science in layman's terms without having any of the really cool, complex stuff dumbed down. However Angier's writing really started to get on my nerves, it's a little too 'clever' at times when she tries to force a casual, jokey tone to make the Science seem less imposing."
43,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1868279-tahleen,4,"I really liked this book, and Angier's writing is great. She puts major scientific concepts into quirky, fun, popular language for us nonsciencey types. The only thing is sometimes it feels like she is TOO quirky, it's almost exhausting. But I really enjoyed it nonetheless. Read it if you want to know more about science but aren't a science person!"
44,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/135798-julia,3,"Inspired idea; infuriating execution. I (re)learned a lot, and it really got me thinking, but the puns and confusing asides nearly did me in. If the wordplay were taken down by about 80%, this would be a fantastic book."
45,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21494273-peg,3,"A good many ""aha"" moments about how things work at a universal and molecular level. Yet I tired of her bouncy tone, and I could have used a diagram or at least a bulleted list to help lock in key concepts and break up the relentlessly dense prose. "
46,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3763514-john-mulholland,2,I could not get through this book. I am a science teacher and I realize we all like a pun now and then but nobody likes then continually. Angler uses punds so often that the reader gets tired of the attempts at amusement. The science content was also very basic. Don't waste your time!
47,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2064901-jessica-valenti,5,I wish I could write the way that Angier writes - she makes even the most complex ideas accessible. Love her.
48,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12788229-christopher,2," When I picked up this book I thought it was going to be mostly interviews with scientists talking about their specific fields. That is not what this is. In fact, there are very little quotes from scientists about their fields and a number of them were from Stephen J. Gould and last I checked was dead and has been for some time. (Though Zombie Gould would have been a welcome addition to this book.) The seeming purpose of this book is to convince people that they should have a basic understanding of science no matter who they are. This book gives very fast summaries of key scientific concepts while making the kinds of jokes that your high school science teacher might have made.  The introduction of this book annoyed me a bit. I have sympathy for the writer's viewpoint, but a lot of the problems with declining science education seem political to me. To be a scientist you have to have a PhD to really do meaningful work and how a lot of postdocs are treated now in academia is really discouraging. Angier could have written a probing book on that subject, but she seems to think the problem is just laypeople who don't appreciate science. Any specialized subject is more exciting to people who actually studies it to those who did not. There are jokes that will make philosophy majors laugh that will get cold stares from everybody else, so complaining that laypeople don't get your science jokes is kind of missing the point.  A good number of people complain about the writing style. I did not find it as annoying as some people did. It doesn't do the job its supposed to do however. It discourages people from appreciating the science, not helps them be entertained. "
49,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16734700-eddie,4,"This book is an introduction to science and perhaps more importantly scientific thinking. Anglier is a science journalist, and the book is based on interviews she has done with scientists from different disciplines including physics, chemistry, evolutionary biology, molecular biology, geology and astronomy. I found this book an extremely readable introduction and a reminder of some of the most important concepts in science.The first few chapters really focus on some fundamental issues around the scientific method and how theories are tested. She considers scale and how we struggle to be able to think about things on a very tiny scale like cells and things on a massive scale like galaxy's. With instruments such as microscopes and telescopes to help we have however been able to make sense of these things. Which gets to the heart of scientific thinking in the sense that some things may not make sense now but they will do at some point. Then she turns to the importance of statistics and probability theory that are fundamental to scientific thinking.Physics is the study of matter in its most fundamental state and the 'laws' that govern how matter interacts under different conditions. The idea of indivisible substances was first thought about in ancient Greece around 400BC by Democritus and was finally proved in the 20th century by the likes of Einstein and Niels Bohr. Angliers talks about the structure of an atom with the nucleus in the middle consisting of protons and neutrons that make up 99.9% of the atoms mass but only a trillionth of its volume. The charged protons and electrons are attracted to each other conforming to one of the fundamental “laws” of nature, Electromagnetism. The other laws are gravity, the strong force and the weak force. Charge is the ability to attract or repel other charged particles. Electromagnetic fields are the sphere of influence. They have 'fields' of influence that have action at a distance. Electrons have only a tiny amount of mass and can behave almost like photons, the massless particles that carry light. The transmission of electric current requires a circuit or pathway (a conductor) for the charged particles to propel waves of kinetic energy. Yet electromagnetic energy (electromagnetic radiation) can travel through a vacuum. We rely on electromagnetic radiation from the sun. Think of, for example, fossil fuels, 300 million years underground were fuelled first by sunlight.When we think about sunlight we are thinking about visible light – the small part of the electromagnetic spectrum that our human eyes can see – but most of the sun's light is outside of this spectrum. Yet radio waves, infra-red, optical, ultraviolet, x-rays and gamma rays are all 'light'.The law of conservation is also fundamental to physics. The conservation of charge means that for every positive charge generated there will be a negative charge generated somewhere else. The law of conservation of energy is also known as the first law of thermodynamics energy can only be converted from one source to another it can not be destroyed for example boiling water transfers the kinetic energy from the combustion of a natural gas to the water molecules causing them to bubble and eventually turn to gas.Chemistry is about molecules, bonds and elements. There are 115 elements from which you can build almost an infinite number of molecules. There are covalent bonds the strongest and simplest bond where two atoms share a pair or more electrons of either the same or different elements; ionic bonds which are bonds between ions of electrically charged atoms and; hydrogen bonds that are around one tenth of the strength of colavent bonds Finally there are Van der Waals forces. Evolutionary biology is one of the things that attracted me to reading popular science. I was curious about why evolution seemed to be controversial. Some groups have tried to give the impression that because the word theory is used to describe evolution that there is some doubt around its authenticity. There is no doubt only small subtle details that need to be ironed out.Molecular biology is about cells, the basic unit of life that can be considered 'alive'. A cell has three parts to it: a greasy waterproof outer membrane, the cytoplasm where most of the cells activity takes place and the place that houses a cache of DNA. Cells with a nucleus are called eukaryotic cells and other single-cell organisms lacking a nucleus are called prokaryotic. A virus is also a unit of matter and consists of a packet of genes wrapped in a packet of protein and sugar molecules but it relies on the host cell it infects. Humans have around 74 trillion cells.A protein is a string of amino acids, distinctive clusters made primarily of the elements most strongly associated with life – carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen – arranged in a style that lends each amino acid a little bit of positive charge and a little bit of negative charge which makes amino acids ideal for linking together a great diversity of structures. Most proteins are enzymes i.e. they help to activate or accelerate chemical reactions, there are also structural proteins like bone tissue.DNA is in every cell and is a complete personal copy of the DNA molecule. Humans are 99.9% genetically identical to each other.Geologists do lab work, chemistry, physics, ecology, microbiology, botany, palaeontology, complexity theory, mechanics and computer modelling. The earth's surface is broken into pieces or tectonic plates and the movement of these plates has a direct consequence on major shocks like earthquakes, volcanic eruptions etc. The Earth is a compacted ball of iron, nickel and some other elements. Their composition help to generate the Earth’s magnetic fields and these magnetic fields help to deflect much of the solar wind that if left unchecked would strip away our atmosphere.Astronomy depends on light. If for example one thinks of an image of say Jupiter, it is how the planet looked 30 mins ago. Again we struggle to think of these issues unless we have some idea of the huge scale.This book is well written and covers many disciplines. I think it is particularly effective at convening the idea the science is a way of thinking rather than just a set of facts."
50,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23379337-j,1,"Awful, just awful. The language is pretentious and as others have pointed out, full of unnecessary alliterations, and pop culture references that make no sense. The author complains about academic science training being overrun by Indian and Chinese students. Guess what, some of the concepts touted as high science in this book are taught to Indian students in grade 6. We are treated to some unsavory details such as the author's oral habits, the number of cavities in her mouth and the number of root canals that she has had, in the context of her explanation about oral bacteria and enamel. The science behind it beautiful enough without her having to push herself into the narrative.There may be factual errors too. The author says that Duck billed platypuses are from Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand?  The audio book even has wrong pronunciations. Example: Prion is pronounced ""pree-on"" by virologists, not ""pry-on"" as in the audiobook. Even listening to the book at 2x to get through the content was excruciatingly painful, and seemed never-ending."
51,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62730952-steve-vetter,5," This was such an enjoyable book to read. I truly love the way this erudite intellect uses her words to explain admittedly difficult (for the layman) concepts and ideas in a wonderfully entertaining manner. Her humor and at times almost silly comparisons keep this book a joy to sift through. I laughed out loud at her references and delightfully playful descriptions of some genuinely meaty scientific theories and facts. I have never enjoyed learning more!!  Natalie Angier is a talented wordsmith and her pleasant, upbeat personality radiates as brightly as the super nova's that she eloquently, and humorously guides us through.  If you are at all intrigued with the unfathomable, let Ms. Angier hold your hand and take you on a whimsical journey. You will love the experience and this esteemed author equally....... Bravo!!! "
52,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3290186-evelyn,4,"This is a great overview of science for liberal arts majors like me, who barely made it through math & science classes in school. Angier explains basic science & math concepts clearly and with a lot of humor. I actually understood the statistics/probability section which is a minor miracle! I have to admit the chemistry & biology chapters made my eyes glaze over, but I'll re-read those more slowly and in smaller sections. As an added bonus, she describes an exercise in logic that the physicist Enrico Fermi used to challenge fellow scientists with. Yeah, you could look up the answers to the questions on Google but it's a workout for your brain and will actually help you to reason & think logically."
53,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29265436-ella-catherall,1,"As is nicely summed up by the star rating I've given this book, it was OK. I really enjoyed the writing style - it was witty and engaging and the book has clearly been well researched. However, the science that she has chosen to include in the book is not interesting. The content in the chapter on geology could basically have been taken straight out of my GCSE chemistry textbook. The book does what it says on the tin but if this book is supposed to be re-introducing people who were put off science by school, repeating the same things again isn't going to help. However, this opinion has just come from my personal experience and if you found it really interesting I'm not going to say that you're wrong. "

From how to think scientifically through the different fields of science, the author writes with clarity and humor. Some of her cultural references, such as Peggy Lee and ""is that all there is,"" may mean more to readers of a certain age, and I hope do not turn other readers off. I think Ms. Angier does an excellent job in keeping this overview accessible to the non-scientist. Some chapters are more appealing than others, not because of the writing, but because of where the reader's interest lies. For me, the two chapters covering biology and the one on astronomy were the highlights of the book. This is good book to give to the budding scientist. "

I discovered Natalie Angier and my basic understanding of fysics, chemistry, cell biology, geology and astronomy has significanlty improved. There is a chapter on evolutionary biology that is probably targeted to a specific audience, but i think that her readers are already convinced, so skip that chapter. I think the power of the author is to decide what elements/laws/phenomenon out of the vast range of each topic are so elemental and basic that once you understand these, you have a license to walk into that science territory with just that little more confidence.

But, while I agree that the text is too weighed down by odd anecdotes and puns (which, as a wordy passionate nerd, myself, I was mostly okay with and could often forgive - even enjoying some), I think the larger problem is a lack of a coherent through-line within the chapters. There are an awful lot of tangents. There's not enough connective tissue from chapter to chapter and so, even within chapters, the main thought and useful expression of topic and theme gets lost (does get better as the book goes on). It's too bad; the ideas are grand. The evolutionary biology and astronomy chapters were decent and cool and fun to read."
57,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8687175-ray,4,"The author very artistically writes about the basic sciences including electricity, geology, astrology, biology, chemistry, and physics. She uses imagery to describe the sciences, making it a bit more entertaining and easier to understand. A minor turn off was how the author spoke down on creationism and stated evolution as a fact. I'm open to listening to both views, but there's no need to bash on one and uplift the other. This book would be interesting to anyone that wants to understand all the basic sciences in an entertaining form. Of course, it's just an overview and primer to the basic sciences. Great read and definitely recommended to those that want to know more."
58,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5871458-karen,2,"A struggle I picked up this book hoping that I would finally be able to understand the variety of scientific concepts that seem so simple to scientists. Unfortunately, what I got was a dense explanation that didn’t really explain. Analogies that required a special knowledge base in and of themselves, making them useless at actually explaining the concept they were trying to clarify. I found only the evolution and astronomy sections even remotely understandable; however, they were the two aspects of science I already felt the most comfortable with. I would not recommend this book unless you already have a strong grounding in science. "
59,0618242953,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5275261-patrick-dijusto,3,"A fine book on the basics of science. I often find myself envious of the existence of certain books. More than a few of my reviews begin ""I should have written this."" Well, I couldn't have written this book. That is, I could have written a book on this topic, but nowhere near as good as this one.One very minor nitpick. It's written in a forced comedic style that is not to my taste. One example: ""Electrons are constantly in motion. They cannot slow down, not even to catch their breath. First, they have no lungs...."" If you are the kind of person who likes that kind of humor, you'll love this book."
