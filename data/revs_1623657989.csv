0,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,3,"Thanks goes to Netgalley!This book tries to do a couple of things, and while I have no direct issue with any of its aims in any one particular, I kept asking myself a very important question, and asked it often, namely: ""Who is this author writing to?""At the opening, I got the impression that this was going to be a grateful pat-on-the-back for all evolutionists and those who believe in science and reason, and indeed, this is what happens, but instead of a few long focuses on a few of the pieces that make humans beautiful and just like the animals we come from, it gets bogged down ""hip bone connected to the thigh bone"" syndrome. Instead of a readable series of anecdotes (whether personal, which there are quite a few, or a history of science, which there are also quite a few,) we're also subject to what reads like a first or second year college biology textbook, or perhaps even worse, because it's meant to name drop and exact upon us the price of knowledge without having the depth or experience of being an anatomist, general biologist, or just being extremely well read.I'm no expert, but I followed most of this book pretty well and understood where the author was headed nicely and enjoyed a number of new info-pieces that I had never come across before. As a reader of lots of fiction and non-fiction, I know there's a fine line to be drawn between too much info-dump or too little, especially in popular non-fiction, but then there's the importance of my repeated question. ""Who is this writer writing to?"" If you're reading this book, you're probably already a convert to the alter of science. Aye. My opinion isn't going to change after being shown hundreds and hundreds of examples how and why we're similar to so many kinds of animals. I understood that a long time ago. If she ISN'T writing a book to convert us, then this gigantic overview of the grandeur of the human body might have been better served as a slightly MORE detailed book (or series of books) with a lot more time spent teaching with a lot more depth. Unfortunately, even that's out of the scope for a book of this length, so I'm back to my initial question.It dawned on me, late in the read, that the book might be best served as something to put on your coffee table. Anyone who's attempted to read it will know just how either *scary* trying to get through it is and will be doubly impressed that *you* got through it, or your scientist friend will see it on the table and proceed to write down all the other books that you should have started with. If you just want to impress your educated friends and don't want to actually read this book, just display it, then it's probably a fine choice. If they pick it up and thumb through it, they'll pick up on the author's enthusiasm, may recognize her from her science shows (which I have never watched,) and they'll open their mouths in wide ""O""s when the big words start tumbling across the page.I know, I know, I sound like some uneducated yokel when I say this, but I seriously wanted to DNF this book many times. It was either extremely remedial in long passages or I was completely out of my depth in others.I loved the portions on the brain and our sex organs, thought the one on the eye was rather cool, too, but for everything else, I either had a hard time keeping my eyes focused or I started questioning some fundamental aspect about the book, such as: Where are the symbiotes and all the biota that make up the human body in concert with our standard, not much different DNA from the Fruit Fly? Where is the expression of our DNA explored and how did we become what we are from all these many different starting points that follow from the fish and the primates and so many others? I'd have LOVED to see a lot more pondering along those lines, getting my blood pumping from some cutting-edge theories as well as the history of what we USED to think.I'm no expert. I never claimed to be.But... I also don't think I was the right reader for this book. It was either way too many details and being bogged down in the author's big brain or it was way too few, without the precise and logical steps to prove a thesis.I wanted to like it a lot more, but I don't think it was a complete waste of time. I did get some enjoyment out of it. Maybe it ought to be read in a piecemeal way, grabbing the pieces of the anatomy that interests you the most."
1,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,0,"""There's a deep history hidden in your anatomy"" (p.339)A nice easy going book that drags the reader on a double journey through the human body, firstly from conception on wards, secondly a more traditional tour round the limbs and functionality of the human body. Enroute Alice Roberts discusses human evolution, how the body came to be the way it is and some of the pitfalls and hazards associated with our current specifications.The style is chatty and easy going, more detailed than I remember from Biology classes at age 16 but I imagine all familiar enough if you have studied at a higher level than that. The cultural references are targetted towards a British- English audience and some like to Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood will I guess go stale quite rapidly. I imagine from some of the repetitions that she wrote it in chunks and assembled the text into a whole at a late point, like Frankenstein stitching together his monster.I learnt that one reason why much about human evolution will remain obscure is that we don't know much about the body and it's functionality, for instance in passing Roberts mentions a fairly recent study that showed that there was no appreciable difference in walking efficiency between men and women despite the variation in pelvis shape,Roberts points out several times that cartilage and soft tissues can be as important as bones in determining the range of potential motion that a person can do and that even that is an insufficient guide to actual usage, citing the example of a community who regularly climb trees barefoot in order to raid bee hives whose feet had a degree of flexibility and grip equivalent to that of an arboreal ape despite being typical anatomical modern humans - ie as with a gymnast how you use you body changes what it can do, any fossil human remains then give only a approximate guide to how that person might have actually lived and used their body.Entertaining."
2,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline,1,"***NO SPOILERS***(Full disclosure: book abandoned at page 106 [out of 354 pages].)I'm discontinuing this in favor of Your Inner Fish: A Journey into the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human Body, to be read at a later date. Roberts focused a great deal on the nitty-gritty details of biology, with--in one of the sections I read--a great deal of attention given to jawless fish, such as the lamprey. Some parts are fascinating, and science nerds will revel in all of it, but the lay reader will tire of it while waiting for her to hurry up and make the connection to modern humans. In the first chapter she also detailed every step of conception, something I can't imagine anyone reading this book doesn't already know everything about."
3,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,5,"A great book about the human anatomy, complimented with evolutionary explanations for the quirks or mistakes of the complex machines we are. Loved the writing, endlessly fascinated with the subject."
4,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6991670-bob,4,"Summary: An evolutionary account of human embryological development from even before conception through birth and of human anatomy and its evolutionary antecedents.This review should probably come with a “trigger warning”. The book I am reviewing here may offend some of the Christians I count friends whose beliefs about human origins exclude any form of evolutionary explanations. Alice Roberts unashamedly advocates a thoroughly evolutionary explanation for human origins, embryology, and anatomy. She takes swipes at “creationist” and “intelligent design” explanations at several points.I give this warning for two reasons. One is to let you know in advance that this review and blog is not a site for debates about evolution vs. creation (and comments that seek to do so will be taken down). You should write the author! The second is to suggest that if you are not interested in reading ideas that you might not agree with or be displeased with, you may not wish to go further.On the other hand, if you are interested in what a thorough-going evolutionary anatomist and physician would say about our development and the evidence she would invoke in our embryology and physical anatomy, then you are in for a fascinating read.She begins at the beginning of us, how human conception occurs and how the embryo begins to develop. She explores how human embryos in their earliest stages, successive stages reflect our evolutionary origins as sea creatures, and only in later development do our distinctive human features express themselves.She then considers our development from head to foot alternating between embryological development and how she thinks our particular anatomical distinctives evolved. She begins with our unusually large brains (in relation to our body size) and the distinctive shape of our skulls both to accommodate that brain, and our binocular vision as the foremost of our senses.As a singer, her account of the human voice box and the differences between male and female voices and even our differing abilities to form certain vowel sounds was intriguing. Our S-shaped spine reflects both the segmented bodies of our evolutionary forebears, and evolutionary adaptation to walking on two feet (and some design compromises in our lumbar vertebrae that result in chronic back pain in a good part of our population). She gives similar treatment of heart, lungs, and digestive tract, showing how similar we are to other species.Her discussion of the development of male and female genitalia, how sexual distinctions between male and female develop (and how at an early stage of embryological development we were the same) is illuminating for understanding both our commonality and distinctiveness as men and women.She then explores our arms, legs, pelvis, shoulders, feet and hands. Have you thought about what it takes to make a shoulder join capable of throwing and climbing? Or hold your arm out palm down and turn over your hand and note how your whole forearm rotates. And there is the design compromise between the circumferance of the neonate head, and the size of the birth canal, basically the same–10 centimeters. Yet a wider pelvis would have affected the efficiency of a woman’s walking gait.Roberts would say we are fearfully and (mostly) wonderfully evolved. What is striking to me is how well she captures that wonder in this book. I found myself marveling again and again how our bodies develop in all their complexity from a single fertilized egg. She would also say our human distinctiveness, apart from our cognitive abilities is only a matter of degree. And she concludes with acknowledging how lucky each of us are to be here, and even our species with its cognitive capacities.What I regret is the lack of acknowledgement of the possibility of any providential involvement in our emergence as a species. It is the mirror image of the unwillingness of others to consider with an open mind the evidence for evolutionary origins. Roberts captures the wonder of who we are and even advocates for our significant role in the sustenance of the planet. It almost sounds like echoes of a sense of purpose for our existence. Quite a stretch if all we are is lucky chances.________________________________Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher via Netgalley.

5,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68583290-jamie,4,"I would probably never have heard about this book had it not been for a Goodreads recommendation I came across, but I’m glad I got a chance to read it. The writing style is clear, the many drawings are helpful and informative, and even people who are decades away from their last biology class will be able to follow along.Evolutionary biology is a fascinating topic, as body forms shift over time and species come and go in response to environmental conditions and opportunities. Sometimes anatomical features move around and change function. For example, reptiles have several bones in their jaws that are not present in mammals, but only one in their ears, the stapes. Over time one bone from the upper, and one from the lower jaw migrated into the ear to form the mammalian malleus and incus, which connect with the stapes, and in combination the three work together to transmit sounds more efficiently to the brain.The book is structured so that it links a specific phase of embryonic development with evolutionary adaptations that are present at that time. It starts with the head and spine, moves down through the organs, and ends with the feet and hands. In most of the sections there is a discussion of fossils which illustrate how features emerged, changed, and adapted, including the last common ancestor with homo sapiens that had that trait. For instance, a discussion of how the human embryo starts to develop (it won’t be called a fetus until week eight) describes how certain cells roll up into a cylinder called the notochord, from which the brain and spinal cord will develop, and then takes the reader back to a half billion year old fossil called Haikouella, the earliest known progenitor of notochords, and one of the early species which would ultimately give rise to vast multitudes of vertebrate descendants.The author talks about some of the history of anatomical research, and the scientists who expanded our knowledge of the form, function, and antecedents of current features. Ernst Haeckel's famous phrase ""ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"" did not turn out to be correct, but it wasn’t a bad guess based on what was known at the time.The subject of humanity’s more recent ancestors comes up frequently, and is always interesting. It is amazing how much can be deduced from a piece of vertebra or a fragment of rib or ankle bone. The subject of bi-pedalism is mentioned several times. For all the nature documentaries I have watched, it never occurred to me to make the connection that monkeys move through the trees on all fours, using their hands as a second pair of feet, but apes walk upright and use their arms to steady themselves by grasping branches. If our distant ancestors moved through the trees in an ape-like fashion, as seems probable, then walking upright on the ground is not the great mystery it is sometimes made out to be. This idea gives rise to another interesting observation. We have all seen depictions of the march of evolutionary progress where mankind stands triumphantly upright after leaving his knuckle-walking progenitors behind, but in fact the last common ancestor of humans and apes, who lived between five and seven million years ago, may have been an upright walker even then, which means knuckle-walking is the later evolutionary adaptation, while habitually upright walking is the older, non-evolved method of getting around.This book is full of interesting bits of information, about anatomy ancient and modern, about fetal development, evolution, and how the environment can influence modifications to muscles, the skeleton, and perhaps even brain function. I definitely enjoyed this book and would recommend it for anyone with an interest in evolution."
6,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5861086-margaret-sankey,4,"From a British anatomist, this is excellent popular science writing, exploring the precarious collection of parts that is the human body and what, with very minor changes in normal development, can go wrong with it. Roberts climbs into MRI machines, uses 3-D printed versions of her own parts and offers lively examples from many years of teaching to illustrate how astounding it is we function at all (and the attractive life of the sea squirt). "
7,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3771879-brenda-fonseca,5,"I bought this book for my grandson, based on a review in the WSJ. I read it in a few days, and loved every minute of it. It explains, in layman's terms, the development of us, not only from the minute of conception (or just preceding it), but from the first life on the planet. How every living embryo resembles a human embryo. It is illustrated, so you can follow her explanations with an image. And it is fun to read. I am sure my grandson will love it."
8,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33203598-james,3,"Alice Roberts is the Professor of Public Communication of Science at Birmingham University and boy, does it show. This book is jaunty enthusiasm from start to finish. She has a very amiable and pleasant style. Ideal for TV, I thought to myself after a few pages and lo and behold it turns out she is a well-known science populariser on the BBC. A sort of British Degrasse-Tyson - biology version. That's not to diminish her, She knows her stuff. We are treated to an in-depth examination of the human body and how evolution helped shape it. Basically it unfolded in a piecemeal, haphazard and not necessarily the most efficient manner. I call the vagus nerve to the stand. We're basically a perpetual patch job. Each body part is examined in much more detail than I remember from my biology class in secondary school. Very detailed and thorough if not overly exciting. Some parts of the body are just more interesting than others, the ear for example. I feel that these sections would work well in a TV format but are not very compelling on the page. Where she’s strong is the development of the embryo. The similarities between the embryos of vastly different species are nothing short of amazing. She moves from embryo species comparison to our particular human journey. How so many of us make it from conception to birth is nothing short of miraculous considering just how precarious the first 9 months are.Many interesting odd tidbits are encountered in this book. E.g Neural pruning, lamprey habits, the well known but misunderstood clitoris. I would have preferred more tangents and less studiousness to be perfectly honest She's not combative in her presentations but she still manages to put the creationist and their intelligent designer firmly in their place. That is a soft target to be fair. She avoided the political hot potato of abortion which I thought a bit odd. I won't pretend to have understood everything but it kept my interest for the most part. That said I was a little disappointed to see her reference Gould and to a lesser extent Dawkins. Their work, especially Gould, is heavily skewed politically and weak as a result. All that said I’ll definitely read her again. Tamed: 10 species is a work of hers I plan to tackle in the new year. She herself also recommends Your Inner fish by Shulbon which has been recommended by Goodreads. I'll give that a shot too. "
9,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89613608-islomjon,4,"I can consider this book as an average popular science book about human evolution and human embryo development for a wide range of people. Narration is quite ubiquitous: the book begins with conception and further divided by chapters where particular part of the body develops such as brain, skull, etc. Although book is mainly about human, there are also correlations with other animals, frequent mentions of apes and primates, less – about mammals, in places very interesting and full of informative facts. The book also touches embryo development and giving birth in various animals in order to demonstrate how evolution tends to find different ways to do these things but with the same kernel."
10,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,4,"This book covers the fascinating story of how a human body develops, from gametes to fully formed baby. Each chapter covers a specific segment of the body, explaining how it forms (in terms of genes and structure) and gives an evolutionary background for why it developed like that and not some other way, and also sometimes how that particular body part works (especially in terms of feet and hands). Roberts has a lovely writing style and clearly explains what happens when; with minimal intrusions of personal anecdotes. The book contains a large number of diagrams to help explain some of the technical physiological terminology, and there is a great deal of it. Each piece of anatomy is usually referred to by its proper name, which might make the book too complicated for some readers? Personally I enjoyed the lesson in embryology, anthropology and evolution, and appreciated the scientific details and lack of vagueness. Your Inner Fish: A Journey Into the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human Body by Neil Shubin  is probably an easier book to read, but the  The Incredible Unlikeliness of Being by Alice Roberts provides more specific embryological details."

14,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4903719-sayra,2,"Very poor book. Badly written and chaotic, doesn't signpost well (mentions things sixty pages after they're first mentioned and expects the reader to remember without a prompt) and repeats words a lot within a couple of lines, for example ""natural selection doesn't seem to be quite as 'in charge' of the direction of evolution as we might have imagined. It has a limited selection to select from"" (pg345) and ""Natural selection can only select among possible varients, and variation is already limited, before natural selection gets a chance"" (pg 346). I also question her comma use, but then I query my own punctuation quite often. Between this and the clunky way she interjects her own life and the unclear line drawings/diagrams I was unimpressed and disappointed. I've watched documentaries she's presented before, that was one of the reasons I picked up her book, and enjoyed them. I may continue watching her documentaries. I think I shall avoid her books in future."
15,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6740116-brian,3,"A really interesting mixture of anatomy, embryology and discussions of evolution. The author explains it all reasonably well and the in-text illustrations really added to the explanations. The main point the author gets across is that humans are not in a category of their own separate from the rest of the animals and apes. We are not some special being with a purpose and destiny to fulfill. We are just animals with big brains. The author was probably pushing against an open door with this point as this would have been in line with my thinking. But it was nice to have someone make a coherent argument for this citing the evidence. An interesting read for those generally interested in physiology and evolution and one I would recommend."
16,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63421053-nico-van-straalen,4,"Alice Roberts writes with pace and style about the evolutionary background of the human body, mixing personal stories with scientific investigation not unlike a forensic pathologist. The content might be a bit too technical at intervals (even to me the arytenoid cartilages sitting on the larynx cricoid were new), but to the reader able to digest (or skip) such details, the reward is profound: you emerge with a deeper understanding of yourself (says Richard Dawkins). This is the book I should have written myself."
17,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24132543-andrew,3,"I learned quite a lot about where humans lie on the Tree of Life. Dr. Roberts is very anti-creationist (and rightly so) but she uses terms like 'tinkering' and 'invention' in relation to evolution and these don't seem to be words to be used if everything is 'natural' with no outside interference. I had hoped to read about how some parts of our anatomy like blood, proteins, muscle, etc have come about through evolution or how images and sounds came to be converted into electrical signals in the brain but that is probably for another day.But a good read all the same. "
18,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18885135-chris-thorley,5,this was a very interesting read and I learnt a lot I didn't know about human anatomy/development and human evolution. There were a lot of technical terms (names of different muscles and other things I have a hard time remembering) which almost made me keep it at a four star. Ultimately though the feeling of wonder at how lucky we all our to be here and the amazing process that has lead to that (both in evolutionary terms and in the womb) meant that I couldn't really give it anything other than a five star rating.
19,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64391406-herrholz-paul,4,"Very enjoyable, educational book. Highlights for me are the idea that we and many other species might not have begun to evolve at all if it were not for the infinitesimally small chance of an asteroid hitting the earth and causing the demise of the dinosaurs. This sums up the title of the book in a nutshell. It is also fascinating to read about the far from perfect, one might say hit and miss, process by which we and other species develop from conception up until birth and beyond. The fragility is all too apparent and should make us appreciate all life all the more. "

Biology, with all of its political hangups and global, interdependence implications, is more pertinent. This book answers for all of the wonder and awe we confront in witnessing the depth of biology as a whole as well as what makes us human, and in doing so, very subtly meets creationism on it's own ground."

And let's face it, if you're going to do science justice you have to make sure you include a lot of detail. So this wasn't exactly riveting but, you know, it is what it is. I felt it was less about how unlikely our ""being"" is, and more about evolution in general. That's fine, but the title made me think it was going to be more philosophical. Instead there was lots of stuff about uninteresting creatures, fossils and our various ancestors - as you'd expect. Nevertheless, there were some good examples and interesting demonstrations and a few things I'll probably remember and drop into conversation from time to time to make myself sound educated and erudite."
30,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12259279-andrew,4,"Full disclosure: I believe in God and Creation. That being said this isn't about my views but about Alice Roberts book, ""The Incredible Unlikeliness of Being: Evolution and the Making of Us"". I found this book intriguing. She doesn't write in a dry, pedantic way. There is humor, there is science, there is an heartfelt, visceral belief in her convictions. Even though I disagree I still admire the assurity of her style and passion. She breaks the book down into defined chapters on characteristics. Beginnings which starts with the sperm and egg. How fertilization takes place. Her descriptions bring to life the subject matter.. Head and Brains through The making of Us, Finding our twig in the tree of life round out the book. Each chapter moves the reader through different parts of the growth of this new life. Comparing our development to the development of other animal groups. How a starfish, a sea squirt down to chimpanzees have similar development. She ends with what makes humans unique. The illustrations had me a little perplexed because I couldn't always find the connection she was making. This is particularly true of some of the earliest illustrations. This is not to say that all are this way. And the failure to see could be my bias. The actual writing up to the acknowledgements isn't all that long. There is a long list of additional reading/resources and a complete illustration guidefull. A full 25% of the book is an index..I say that I wouldn't buy the book but I just read it. As far as recommending to a friend it would depend on their taste.I was provided a copy of this book through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."
31,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6536883-becca,3,"Updated my rating to three rather than four stars, not because the book is bad (it's not), but because I thought it was rather confused about who it was for. There would be sections that I imagine are accessible to the layperson, then rather technical parts with a lot of anatomy jargon. This mix meant that I'm not sure who I'd recommend it to. The idea behind the book is great, but I think I'd rather a proper textbook *or* a more accessible pop-science book rather than an uneasy hybrid.I will be returning to it though, and it's full of useful resources at the back. It definitely piqued my interest in comparative anatomy. I'll want to read Your Inner Fish: A Journey into the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human Body to complement this one I think.The sections on reproductive anatomy, the heart, and bipedalism were all fascinating to me. As someone who didn't specialise in humans, there's a lot to learn. The progression of ideas was logical, and I'm glad there was an explicit challenging of the ""ladder of evolution"" idea. There's the inevitable appearance of the recapitulation theory, and good explanations for why that isn't the best one. If you already have a background in life sciences this can introduce you to a whole area you may have neglected, and there's something to be said for evolutionary examples taken from the human body itself - they are very relatable. "
32,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38096343-luke-phillips,3,"I have always found Alice Roberts captivating on television. From Ice Age Giants to Wild Swimming, I have found her style and enthusiasm always more than enough to draw me in. I picked up The Incredible Unlikeliness of Being hoping for and expecting more of the same.The book explores our evolution by cleverly tying in our personal journey as we developed inside the womb to our development as a species over millions of years. As we journey through both timelines, we discover the links, similarities and possible origins of all the things that help us function as we do.The book does this especially well, and the concept is fascinating. There is a huge amount of information here, as well as solid science and up to date explanation. There are also many excellent and beautiful illustrations throughout the book.I have to say though that I found the book quite hard work. Although the science is there, the writing seemed a little soulless and even text book like in places. Given that her passion is one of Roberts' best attributes, there was very little flair or excitement evident in the writing, which for me made it drag. That wasn't to fault the content, just the delivery.At the same time, I also found the actual font size a little hard to read, as is unusually small and words are grouped quite close together.The book is a solid work on the constructs of both the human body and the history of evolution, but its hard to come away stirred or moved by the content."

Roberts tells two main stories here: the development of an embryo in the womb, from a single cell to something recognizably human at 8 weeks, and the story of the evolution of the human species. The stories are clearly linked because as our bodies develop, they look an awful lot like the development of animals we're related to, way back when.There were moments in this book when I thought something along the lines of ""okay, legs, not much to say about legs, is there? this will be short..."" and then ""well, this is a stretch, she's saying way too much about legs"" and then ""wow, this is incredible -- the development of bipedalism is really not as clear as I thought..."" The last part of the book on limbs is much more evolution-heavy (not much to say about the embryonic development here, it's true), but there's still a fascinating story to tell. And she's able to use her experience in the field to put the information into context. It makes for a really interesting, engaging read that is surprisingly hard to put down. Even though there's too much discussion of cramming a baby head down a birth canal for my taste. I got a free copy of this from Net Galley."

Knowing nothing whatever about embryology and evolutionary anatomy I jumped right in, and was captivated from the very first chapter which deals with human conception and the history that is tucked away in the scientific study of our bodies. Roberts's book then expands on this introduction by examining the evolutionary context of our various amazing body parts, explaining how they might have developed and how they reflect or diverge from those of species with which we share an ancestry. The book filled me with awe as to how our complex bodies develop from a single cell, and made me think about many aspects of our evolutionary emergence that I had just never considered before.Roberts manages to avoid using too many technical terms, making it easy for lay people to follow her narrative without difficulty, and her little diagrams and sketches really add to one's understanding.This is a book that every school kid should be given to read. I just wish it had been around when I was younger -- it would have enriched my life over the decades to have known much of what she writes about, providing context to the science we come across in our daily lives."

I've always found evolution interesting and this book combines the two perfectly. Having Alice Roberts speaking at my school, I knew I had to read her book. I'm no anatomist or bone expert, but that didn't make this book any harder to understand. Everything that needed to be explained to make the contents of the book accessible to an average audience was just that - explained. I could hardly put the book down; I spent lunchtimes and evenings reading when I should have been doing my biology homework (this counts... right?). For a scientific book, I wasn't expecting it to be such an easy read, but it really was. I'd recommend this book to anyone who is even remotely interested in embryology or evolution. Alice Roberts has done an incredible job and she deserves great praise and recognition."
36,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18268912-gary-jones,5,"This is a book on evolution and the support for evolution from fossilized skeletons, comparative anatomy and comparative embryology. It is written for the layman, but even with a substantial amount of anatomy in my background (admittedly, from 1967-69) I found the discussion of the anatomy of the brain a challenge. Once through that--about 45 pages out of 354--I was able to follow the author easily. I was especially interested in the section on the differences in the spinal column, hips, feet, and shoulders of the great apes. The author, a professor of anatomy, guides the reader through the differences and how those differences limited or expanded on the behavior of the species and how that fits into the current ideas on evolution. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in biology."
37,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45967131-houtvancharlot,3,"Alice Roberts is one of my favorite TV presenters (especially her documentaries on human evolution). My expectations for this book were high, but to be honest, I was a little disappointed. While reading, I kept missing a clear storyline - a central message or point. The chapters contain interesting information about our biology and our history, but it all feels quite random. I enjoyed the last chapter the most, where prof. Roberts is in her element focusing on her personal vision on evolution. Furthermore, this book could really use some more visual material, explaining the biological concepts and processes.I would only recommend this book to people who enjoy enjoy reading 'encyclopedic' information on biology and human development. To the rest, I would recommend watching one of prof. Roberts great documentaries instead."
38,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6123549-claire,4,"I've always liked Alice Roberts on tv and am interested in her fields of expertise. This book was rather fascinating with all the theories of how and why humans became the way they did, and the warring ideologies amongst earlier scientists. I most enjoyed the parts about us sharing much of our developmental physiology with other creatures and how we are all related, as well as the differences between our appendages, etc. The only thing I didn't enjoy/couldn't relate to was Alice's frequent trumpeting about being a mother. It was rather annoying, actually, and the book didn't need it, though I suspect Alice was trying to also make it more relatable to a usually emotional human audience."

The evidence is inside of us, in our embryos, bones and structure as well as fossilised evidence, painstaking research and yet some people have a thought in their head that overwhelms all this evidence and choose to believe something else. Dr Roberts has written an excellent book with some interesting drawings included."
41,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63912896-colby,1,"Couldn't get through it. Roberts tries to draw in the general audience with analogies that are clear to the general populous and trivial to those educated in biology. She alternates between being excessively watered-down and far too technical - she fails to explain some concepts which are the topic of entire college courses on their own, but spends full pages on a single explanation for random topics. I picked up this book hoping to get a new perspective on developmental biology, and Roberts left me even more disenchanted with the subject than I already was. "

Her areas of interest seem to map mine.Incredible journey through the life of an organism from the perspective of embryology, I had no idea so many echoes of our evolutionary past were present in the early forms of all living organisms. Extraordinary. And the discussion on how unlikely it is that any of us actually exist at all is literally mindblowing. Thanks Alice for bringing this to us ignorant layman."

At times Roberts literary teaches the reader to use some of the expert terminology by subtly avoiding definitions or explanations of latin and greek words, but context is all. She talks to the reader directly, telling stories of her own pregnancies and deliery and that outweighs the effort to continue reading some technical stuff. "

I think it could have been edited more tightly, as a casual reader rather than academic reader I didn't need forced repetition of some points, which I took as a reinforced learning technique. But lots of fascinating material here which made me think a lot about aspects of our evolution that had never occurred to me before."

48,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3121503-karen,3,While this was an interesting read it is only getting three stars due to a glaring factual error right at the beginning and quite a few grammatical errors. If this had been a fiction book the factual error would have been irritating but in a non-fiction science book it is seriously annoying.
