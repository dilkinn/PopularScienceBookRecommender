0,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/177596-oceana2602,1,"Let me begin this review by telling you that I'm an atheist. In fact, I'm with Douglas Adams in calling myself a ""radical atheist"", just to make sure that everyone gets the point. Yes, really. It's in my profile.So my opinion about this book really has nothing to do with my personal convictions. Well, not my personal religious convictions, of which there are none. It has everything to do with my personal convictions as an atheist. And as an atheist, I'm offended by this book.Hitchens is not, and I quote from the numerous book reviews so helpfully printed on the first few pages of my paperback copy,""witty, impressive, entertaining, funny, challenging"" or, GOD forbid (pardon the pun), ""excellent"".He is not even polemical, since that would require some factual discussion. He is simply inflammatory.Hitchens bashes religion in 341 pages, complete with references and an index. (I guess that way he can pretend that his ""work"" has some academic value). Now, the book is called ""God is not great - How Religion poisons everything"". What the hell did she expect this to be, you will probably ask.Let me tell you.I expected this to be a serious, well presented argument of why the world would be better off without religion. I expected there to be a theoretical discussion about how a world without religion can not only work, but work better than one with religion. And I expected there to be a dicussion and dissection of religious beliefs and their influence on human interaction and how these beliefs, in a modern society, are not necessary anymore, and/or are probably even hindering the development of our society.Instead I get 341 pages on the most stupidest things people do in the name of religion, like, fundamentalist muslims telling poor people not to get polio vaccinations, and arguments like 'jews and muslims hate pigs because pigs are dirty and eat their young if they are trapped in little stables, but the muslims completely stole that idea from the jew' (complete with a really touching page on why pigs are really cute animals and that human babies love little pigs. Cause you can never be wrong with the human baby argument.)Cause not eating pigs is really one of the worst problems caused by religions in modern times. Poor pigs, they feel all left out. Well, I don't eat pigs, and I certainly don't think that makes me a bad person. Just a mostly vegetarian one who can't stomach pig meat.But wait, the pig thing is leading somewhere. It is leading, piggies beware, to the oh so representative story of the muslims who, because of the ban on pigs, try to ban things like ""Winnie-the-Pooh"", or ""The Three little piglets"". Because yes, that's certainly a REAL problem, and, you know, EVERY muslim thinks that way. Plus, since America is SO GOOD with its non-censorship policies, it's always a really good idea for Americans to hold up the ""STOP CENSORSHIP"" banner to other nations. (this was sarcasm, in case you couldn't tell).I'm sorry, but almost everyone I know is religious. NO ONE I know is a radical muslim, christian, jew or whatever. Maybe that's why I have the nagging feeling that most religious people are really quite normal and do not propose bans on children's books or tell people not to get vaccinated in the name of god.And I really think pointing out the tiny minority of FREAKS in a religion, any religion, btw, in order to ban the whole thing, is kind of ineffective. What does Hitches want to say with that? That religion is okay, as long as they keep in check the radicals? As a radical atheist, I'm confused.Arguing with the most extreme examples is certain to get you heard, but in my experience, it isn't very effective. It's too easy to say, yes, Hitchens, you are right, but religion isn't really like that. The [insert religious work of your choice] doesn't really say that. And then the normal religious people will lean back and stay as happily religious as they are.That there is a reason why people are religious, that religions have shaped our societies and our behaviors as humans for as long as we can think?Hitchens doesn't mention it.And that there is no more need for religion in the present we live in, that religion has in fact become THE factor that is most likely to hinder the evolution of humans as a race? Not a word.Or wait, maybe he does mention that somewhere in the 241 pages I chose not to read, because I have better things to do with my time. But I doubt it.I bought this book because I was led to believe that Hitchens is one THE top intellectuals of the USA, and one of the important proponents of the so-called ""new atheism"". (whatever that is)If he is, I feel sorry for us ""old atheists"". And I'm calling myself that because I most certainly do not want to be connected to a movement that does itself exactly what it criticizes in religious radicals: attack and condemn, without reason or explanation. That's what Hitchens does in this book. Hitchens may think that he is an atheist, and he may argue on behalf of atheism. But in doing so, he turns his atheism into the one thing that I am strongly against: a new religion.And that does not only offend my as an atheist, it also harms atheism as such. Which is the fundamental difference between me and Hitches: we both are convinced that there is no god. But where I only want people to take responsibility for their own mistakes and to not blame a superior being, where I want them to be human because they are, and not because some religion dictates how and why they should be human, Hitchens does not seem to think that far. He just jumped onto the popular train (""new"" atheim? Really?) to point his finger at the most outrageous and stupid examples of radical religious people he could find.Newsflash, Mr. Hitchens: there are idiots everywhere, but you cannot judge the whole system upon them.Case in point.P.S.: Oh, and I should probably mention that the book isn't very well written either. The language, especially the first chapter, is pompous. The structure of the ""arguments"" is, at best, random. Also, the author seems to have chosen not to religiously follow the rules of logic. Or to, you know, be logical at all.*closes book and throws it on the sale pile*"
1,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,3,"There's a debate I keep getting into about the difference between atheism and religious belief: someone claims that atheism is just another faith, and I disagree. This seems like a good place to summarize my objections.I would first like to draw a clear distinction between dogmatic and sceptical atheism. If someone blindly believes that there is no God, and no evidence whatsoever would change their opinion, then I quite agree that, for such people, atheism is indeed another religion. (A mathematician might say that it's the null religion). But most atheists aren't like that. They don't believe in God because they don't see compelling evidence to do so, but, were such evidence produced, they would change their minds. If you still wish to argue that sceptical atheism is a faith, it seems to me that you are in general arguing that one should abolish the distinction between faith and reasoned judgement, a step most people would be reluctant to take. When I say that I don't believe snow is green, my statement is based on having seen a lot of snow. Most of it was white (some was a dirty gray), and none of it was green. If I did see green snow, I'd change my position to saying that snow was usually white, but occasionally green.Of course, evidence isn't always as direct as looking at snow. I don't believe that any mountain in the world is taller than Mount Everest. I have never even been in the Himalayas, and directly verifying the claim would also involve visiting and measuring every mountain in the world, a difficult undertaking. Nonetheless, I have met people whose job it is to verify claims of this kind, and I know that they are good at what they do. If a geographer published an erroneous claim about the identity of the world's tallest mountain, I am sure that another geographer would take great pleasure in showing him that he was wrong, and would try to set the record straight. It's easy to measure the height of a mountain to an accuracy of at worst a metre or two. Soon the debate would be over, and almost everyone would agree.Moving on to things more directly divine, I don't believe that thunder is the sound of the god Thor throwing his hammer. I believe it's the sound of a large-scale electrical discharge made when clouds become sufficiently charged. Again, my evidence is largely based on other people's testimony, but the account of thunder in terms of electrical discharges is solid, coherent and meshes well with things I have seen. For example, discharges created by van der Graaf generators look enough like lightning that it's hard to write that off as a coincidence. I also know that the statistics on the efficacy of lightning conductors are very one-sided. None the less, if I were to meet Thor in person, as Natalie Portman does in the recent movie, I would no doubt revise my opinions.Well: I don't believe in the existence of the monotheistic God who created the universe simply because I don't see enough evidence. My lack of belief in that God is pretty much the same as my lack of belief in green snow, my lack of belief in a mountain taller than Everest and my lack of belief in big blond guys in thunder clouds throwing hammers. If I did see evidence, I'd change my mind. (Carl Sagan's novel Contact makes this point very nicely). But, until then, I'm sceptical, and I don't see that my scepticism is an act of faith. It's only the normal exercise of reasoned judgement."
2,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83582-bill-kerwin,3,"A wicked, witty condemnation of all things religious. As a person of faith, I find that Hitchens often sounds like a blind man ridiculing the value of Rembrandt and Van Gogh. But he is particularly fine on the noxious ways in which religion intersects with the most murderous forms of politics. And of course--as is always the case with Hitchens--the book is witty and well written.As a reader of the Nation for over a quarter of a century, I enjoyed Christopher Hitchens political analysis and righteous invective for many years. I always thought he was at his best when he attacked specific individuals for their public positions and private failings, and his refusal--like the best 18th century satirists--to draw any line between the two. I relished his take-downs of Bob Hope, Mel Gibson, Michael Moore and the Dalai Lama, and thought some of his best work was contained in his book-length tirades against Bill Clinton, Henry Kissinger, and Mother Teresa (the latter book distinguished by its outrageous title, The Missionary Position).Hitchens was outraged whenever he observed public figures overly praised for their few good deeds, excused for their corrupt habitual practices, and lauded for their wrong-headed opinions. He summoned every fact and argument--fair or unfair--in the service of his eloquent and venomous pen, fashioned an image of himself as a champion of truth, and, in so doing, produced satire of a quality perhaps not seen since the days of Swift and Pope, a quarter of a millennium ago.Unfortunately, Hitchens chooses to apply the same old formula in this attack on the Great Jehovah, and for once he is out of his depth. It is not so much that he lacks knowledge--although his grasp of theological controversy is much weaker than his grip on practical politics--but that he chooses to take God to task in much the same way he formerly used to criticize Jerry Falwell and Jesse Helms. God may very well be a person--as the orthodox Christian theologians maintain--but, if so, he is not a person in the precisely same sense, for example, that George Galloway and Cindy Sheehan are persons.In attacking God himself in this way, Hitchens reveals his own pettiness, appearing less like a great moralist and more like a peevish gadfly. It is a pity too, for many of the great religious crimes he chronicles would constitute, in some other book, a devastating condemnation of organized religion itself.Now, if Hitch would have instead written a book about Bin Laden or Pat Robertson--or about John Paul II or Benedict XVI--what an excellent polemic it might have been!"
3,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32532774-lisa,5,"Witty, fact-based, amusing rant. I laughed out loud many times!I think part of the rage Hitchens encounters derives from the fact that he is funny. If he put on a scholarly, serious tone, and imitated the behaviour of priests in the way he poses his arguments, he would not be hated in the way he is. But the ridicule makes him a target. I happen to like entertaining arguments more than tedious, nonsensical discussions on evidence for made-up assertions, and cheer Hitchens on when he offers his own (beware literalists, ironical!) belief:“My own view is that this planet is used as a penal colony, lunatic asylum and dumping ground by a superior civilization, to get rid of the undesirable and unfit. I can't prove it, but you can't disprove it either.”If there is one thing I would like to add, it is my amusement at discussions between scientists and creationists. Besides the fact that scientists will happily accept new evidence and change their theories if knowledge in their field expands, as opposed to creationists, who stubbornly will change reality to fit their ancient ideas from an illiterate, patriarchal and tribal era, there is another flaw in the creationist vindictive search for loopholes in evolutionary science:Even if they happen to prove that evolutionists made a mistake or two in their research, that does not by any means make their own claims more valid! Why is the default setting a minority Christian fundamentalist belief in the literal truth of the Bible? ANY other explanation is equally valid without proof. The world on the turtle's back, the simulation of a brain in a vat, anything can be true if we do not accept evidence as a basis. As far as I am concerned, there is more proof in the world for Greek gods than for the so-called ""justice"" of the monotheistic gods in their various interpretations.And Hitchens makes a beautiful statement for the diversity of gods in the human world of notorious storytellers:“God did not create man in his own image. Evidently, it was quite the other way about, which is the painless explanation for the profusion of gods and religions, and the fratricide both between and among faiths, that we see all about us and that has so retarded the development of civilization.” So, I guess in 17th century Europe, I would now be burned as a witch. Can I please have a trial like the one in Monty Python's Holy Grail? I'll wear a false nose and wart if necessary:""- Crowd: A witch! A witch! A witch! We found a witch! We've got a witch! A witch! A witch! We have found a witch. May we burn her?- How do you know she is a witch- She looks like one.- Bring her forward.- I'm not a witch! I'm not a witch !- But you are dressed as one.- They dressed me like this. - No, we didn't.- And this isn't my nose. It's a false one.- Well? - We did do the nose.- The nose? - And the hat. But she is a witch !- Did you dress her up like this? - No, no!- Yes. A bit.- She has got a wart.- What makes you think she's a witch?- She turned me into a newt!- A newt?- I got better.- Burn her anyway!- Quiet! Quiet!- There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.- Are there? What are they? Tell us. - Do they hurt?- Tell me, what do you do with witches?- Burn them!- And what do you burn, apart from witches?- More witches! - Wood!- So why do witches burn?- 'Cause they're made of wood? - Good!- How do we tell if she is made of wood? - Build a bridge out of her.- But can you not also make bridges out of stone?- Oh, yeah.- Does wood sink in water?- No, it floats. - Throw her into the pond!- What also floats in water?- Bread. - Apples.- Very small rocks. - Cider!

4,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/372363-books-ring-mah-bell,3,"I read this months ago and never got around to the review...Simply stated, Hitchens puts into words all the reasons I shy away from organized religion. The prejudices, sexism, the overall foolishness... At the same time, he seems oblivious to the fact that there are religious people out there doing great things; feeding the hungry, clothing the poor, building for the homeless. Hey Hitchens! I get that you are atheist. That's fine, but knock that chip off your shoulder already! Belief that decent religious people exist does not mean you have to agree with them or believe in their God.Mr. Hitchens, may I suggest a few new titles for your book? Try ""God Can Be Great, But Freaks Poison Religion"" or ""How Jerks Screw Up Religion""."
5,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112150-melly,5,"As a fellow Atheist, Mr. Hitchens is preaching to choir, so to speak, in this informative, captivating work in which Hitchens judiciously provides historically documented and personal examples of what he sees as an ever-increasing war being waged by a variety of religious fundamental organizations. In our very own country we have troops of well-funded, born-again fanatics preaching hatred of anyone who doesn’t fall in line with their standards. Worse, these groups instill a deep-rooted fear in the most vulnerable, forced members of their congregation; young, helpless, defenseless children, sometimes as young as three. Hitchens provides chilling eye-witness accounts of these tactics which are slowly tearing away at the fabric of this great nation. Regardless of your religious beliefs, if you have an open mind and enjoy reading well written, fact-based, relevant nonfiction, then you will enjoy this book. Certainly, deeply religious people may find certain parts upsetting as fundamental beliefs are challenged with factual, cited information. Hitchens has a way of peeling away the absurdity of certain religious beliefs and how these beliefs, at their very core, are contrary to very ideals shouted to the masses during worship services. Something I learned at an early age, as a baptized Roman Catholic about to be confirmed, is that before anyone blindly accepts what they’ve been told over a period of time about a particular religion, it is your right, your responsibility and your duty to pick up a couple of books about Judaism, Hindu, Islam, Buddhism, Heavens Gate Kool-Aid Lovers or whatever they were all about, even Mormonism and Jehovah Witness, and read. Read about each of these religious. Get a book along the lines of Religion for Dummies (there is a joke in there somewhere) and get an overview of what these groups are all about. Then study philosophy and science and art and history. Read Ayn Rand and Aristotle and Plato and study and research and think for yourself. And then, one day, years later, you’ll realize what is true for you and that will be your own religion. There are too many great stories in Hitchens’ book but some of my personal favorites pertain to religious interference with women’s reproductive rights. Islamic authorities of the Council of Ulemas in Indonesia urged that condoms only be made available to married coupled (HUH?), and then only with a prescription. He also quotes an article from Foreign Policy magazine in which a n official of Pakistan’s AIDS Control Program stated that the [AIDS] problem was smaller in his country because of “better social and Islamic values,” This, in a state where the law allows a woman to be sentenced to be gang-raped in order to expiate the “shame” of a crime committed by her brother. Good ol’ repression and denial. The building blocks of religion. Pro or con. Christian or Agnostic. Cubs or White Sox. This book will, if nothing else, be educational and thought-provoking. I give this FIVE Pac Mans"
6,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,4,"Not long ago, I watched a couple of those ""How The Universe Works"" shows, and it kinda traumatized me. In however many billions of years, the sun is going to die, and slightly before that the Earth will be incinerated, and everything that we are, were, will be, and will have built will cease to exist. I can comprehend that. Earth's only one part of a solar system in a tiny part of one galaxy of hundreds of billions of galaxies that exist in the vastness of the universe. See? I know that someday (thankfully not very soon), Earth is a goner. But what's hard for me to comprehend is that eventually, the rest of the universe will end too. That's just mind-boggling to me. That something so vast, and so seemingly infinite, can just end... well, it makes me almost wish that there was something more, to almost want to have faith that there is some sort of creator who set all of this in place and then breathed life into it, and who has a plan and a purpose for what it will eventually become, rather than there being nothing but a ticking clock until the end of everything. Almost, because it's sometimes comforting in the face of the end of all existence. But I don't. Even if I DID have that faith, that would be all. I could never be religious, because I don't believe in religion. And that is the crux of this book for me. A little anecdote before I continue: A couple weeks ago, The Boy's family came to stay with us for a few days to visit. They are religiousy, grace-before-dinner (heh, almost typo'd 'sinner' there), ""God has a plan"" types, who give God credit for everything. They hit all green lights driving through town? God was with them, etc. I try not to get sucked into conversations about religion with The Boy's grandma, because she's a sweet lady who just can't see things being other than how she sees them, and she believes that she's only trying to help me ""find God"". I know she wouldn't understand my lack of desire to have anything to do with religion, so I just avoid the topic altogether whenever possible.The last day of their visit, the inevitable happened and she cornered me while I was making dinner:Her: ""So, have you found a church yet?""Me: ""Umm, no... OhIhavetocheckthefoodnow... *mumblemumble*""Her: ""Oh, well you'll find one... you just have to keep trying! You know, you'd really like my church. It's the biggest in the area. We have to drive 45 minutes to get there, but I really like it because it's got gold on the windowsills and they've got their own TV and radio stations and..."" (I zoned out around this point, just holding up my end of the conversation by muttering ""Oh?"" and ""That's nice..."" every time she stopped for air.)Then: ""So, why don't you go to church?""Me: (DAMMIT!!) ""Oh, well... I don't believe in organized religion.""Her: ""Oh, you mean like those Catholics? They are always standing and sitting and chanting at just the right times! They are really organized!""Me: O_o ""Yeahhhhh... that's not exactly the kind of 'organized' I meant...""Hitchens' point, as the sub-title indicates, is that RELIGION poisons everything. Simply put, it's a pissing contest, winner decided by headcount (or body count, as the case may be), between groups who are each claiming that THEIRS is the Right and One True Religion... and thus intolerance and hatred and fear is born. Religions tell people that they are going to spend eternity in suffering unless they Follow The Rules... when The Rules themselves can cause immense suffering in people, from fear of eternal damnation, to circumcision (both male and female), to homophobic violence, to genocide, just to name a few. Seems like a lose/lose to me.Organized religion seeks (and too often succeeds) to exert control over people's thoughts and behavior, imposing standards of purity that are nearly impossible to attain, even in the most pious believer. But more than that, they also insert themselves into politics, seeking to impose their particular brand of 'morality' on everyone, which inevitably leads to human rights violations and less freedom for people of all beliefs. Religion spawns creatures of such vile ugliness and pure evil that I can't even comprehend them... And that's just the Westboro Baptist Church. Ahh, such wholesome, joyful hatred. I agreed with much of what Hitchens said in this book on the subject of religion, because I do think that can be toxic, but we actually differ on the faith aspect. I felt uncomfortable with some of his attitudes toward people who believe in God/Allah/Buddha/Krishna/etc, resorting to dismissive name-calling several times. I realize that this is a fine line for me to walk, because religion and faith/belief are tied so closely together. But I feel like faith/belief in and of itself is not a bad thing, nor does it make the person who holds it stupid or naive or less worthy of respect. I have no problem with faith, or belief in any God, whatever they may be called. That is an individual's decision and it's personal to them. I make no claims of knowing there is NOT a God, so I cannot say anyone who believes in one is wrong. My issue is when faith is bound up in religion as an institution that uses it as a method of control and intolerance. That is when I feel that a line is crossed, and in my opinion, the result is far more harm than good, if viewed in large-scale terms. "
7,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,4,"I'm probably going to court some hateful comments by trying to write a review of this book, but I think Hitch would be proud that I am making the attempt.I have been reading Hitch's work for years, including his essays on mortality and atheism, so I knew the gist of his arguments against religion, but it was enlightening going through this entire book. He synthesizes a tremendous amount of research from history, philosophy, science and current events, and he argues that ""religion poisons everything."" No religion is spared his glare -- he gives time to all faiths and prophets. He makes his case using his great wit and flair for words, and the result is a compelling read.Here are a few favorite passages:""Many religions now come before us with ingratiating smirks and outspread hands, like an unctuous merchant in a bazaar. They offer consolation and solidarity and uplift, competing as they do in a marketplace. But we have a right to remember how barbarically they behaved when they were strong and were making an offer that people could not refuse. And if we chance to forget what that must have been like, we have only to look at those states and societies where the clergy still has the power to dictate its own terms. The pathetic vestiges of this can still be seen, in modern societies, in the efforts made by religion to secure control over education, or to exempt itself from tax, or to pass laws forbidding people to insult its omnipotent and omniscient deity, or even his prophet.""[On the Israeli-Palestinian dispute and referencing a speech by Abba Eban] ""Two peoples of roughly equivalent size had a claim to the same land. [Eban said] the solution was, obviously, to create two states side by side. Surely something so evident was within the wit of man to encompass? And so it would have been, decades ago, if the messianic rabbis and mullahs and priests could have been kept out of it. But the exclusive claims to god-given authority, made by hysterical clerics on both sides and further stoked by Armageddon-minded Christians who hope to bring on the Apocalypse (preceded by the death or conversion of all Jews), have made the situation insufferable, and put the whole of humanity in the position of hostage to a quarrel that now features the threat of nuclear war. Religion poisons everything. As well as a menace to civilization, it has become a threat to human survival.""[On atheism and his co-thinkers] ""Our belief is not a belief. Our principles are not a faith. We do not rely solely upon science and reason, because these are necessary rather than sufficient factors, but we distrust anything that contradicts science or outrages reason. We may differ on many things, but what we respect is free inquiry, openmindedness, and the pursuit of ideas for their own sake ... We are not immune to the lure of wonder and mystery and awe: we have music and art and literature, and find that the serious ethical dilemmas are better handled by Shakespeare and Tolstoy and Schiller and Dostoyevsky and George Eliot than in the mythical morality tales of the holy books. Literature, not scripture, sustains the mind and -- since there is no other metaphor -- also the soul.""Hitch died in December 2011, and damn how I miss that brilliant, cantankerous ol' rabble-rouser. If you have ever seen him interviewed or heard him give a speech, you know he has a fantastic voice, so I need to make a plug for his audiobooks, which are excellently narrated. And if you want to read some Hitchens but don't want to get all religion-y, I highly recommend his autobiography ""Hitch-22."""
8,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7407364-luffy,2,"Having read the book some time before the author died and having written a review but not on this site I'm at a loss to comprehend now what went wrong with this book. I had a more lenient rating system at the time I read this book. Now I'd have given this book a 2/5 - which I just have. There is too much focus on current terrorist acts and while in theory it's not a bad idea, I did found such parts muddling and boring. Respect to Hitchens though and RIP."
9,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14475342-abubakar-mehdi,5,"Since I can't say anything with out being labelled as a 'heretic' or a 'heathen', I will just say this;Not everything, but it does poison a lot of things. And its first victims are Reason and Common sense."
10,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/275649-jason,1,"So. I've read it, front to back. Hitchens laments that the faithful (of whatever persuasion) ""have believed what the priests and rabbis and imams tell them about what the unbelievers think"" (10), and (it follows) he rages that priests, rabbis and imams would presume to know or communicate what atheists think and why. And yet, what is Hitchens's book if not 300 pages of an unbeliever telling other unbelievers what believers think and why? The hypocrisy here, and elsewhere in the book, is bald as can be. Time and again, he holds religious institutions fiercely accountable for their contempt - e.g. organized religion is ""contemptuous of women"" (56) - even as he himself exhibits and condones contempt no less virulent for being on the page than one might see in a religious setting. Indeed, he writes that it is with ""contempt [one must:] regard"" (58) believers who reflect on and/or long to witness the end of the world. People ""must"" regard them with contempt, he writes, ""must"" allowing for no disagreement, no wiggle room. Hitchens here fashions himself the moral arbiter in his arguments against religions having fashioned themselves moral arbiters. Later still, he criticizes Evelyn Waugh's comments about remarriage constituting an addition of spittle in the face of Christ as a wickedness that outstrips Waugh's own infidelities. At this point, I'll make it known that I, too, am critical of Waugh's opinion on remarriage (and of his having expressed it to a friend on the cusp of remarriage), but who except Hitchens has made Hitchens qualified to rank Waugh's wickednesses? Again, his proclamation is arbitrary, and his authority specious at best. Or earlier in the book when he writes: ""The harder work of inquiry, proof, and demonstration is infinitely more rewarding [...:] than any theology"" (71)...according to whom? Hitchens. Later, writing of Spinoza: ""his meditations on the human condition have provided more real consolation to thoughtful people than has any religion"" (262)...again, according to whom? Hitchens. Although, what's even likelier here is a subtle dig at religious people on the whole in the suggestion that none of them is ""thoughtful."" He makes statement after statement that cannot be made, counting on his snide sense of humor to persuade people into believing their intellects are being used in siding with his arguments, when, in truth, their intellects are being appealed to less than their vanities. No one likes to side with the folks being humiliated (except Christ, anyway), and his wit insures his readers will at least want to side with him, even when their consciences and critical aptitudes discourage it. His incessant rollcall of insults, referring to various believers as ""orangutans"" (56), ""ignoramus"" (64), ""goons"" (275), ""barbarian"" (275), ""pathetic fraud"" (270), ""boobies"" (269), ""hypocrites"" (212) - all language that suggests Hitchens is every bit the ""bigot and [...:] persecutor"" (180) he rakes Martin Luther over the coals for having been. And when he condemns Mahayanna Buddhism's assertion that sometimes (it is perceived) one should be killed in order to preserve untold numbers of lives (203), one cannot but think of Hitchens's own vocal support for the war in Iraq, for the invasion of a sovereign nation on grounds debatable at best, dubious at worst, and resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians. (It also warrants mentioning here that Hitchens's intellectual compatriot Sam Harris has written that a nuclear first strike in which tens of millions might die might be permissible if it meant saving more lives in the long run. Chris Hedges, in his book I Don't Believe in Atheists, takes Harris to task for this.)And then there is his admiration of Socrates's concession that he might have been wrong, Socrates having said ""in effect: I do not know for certain about death and the gods - but I am as certain as I can be that you do not know, either"" (257). This is an attribution Hitchens gives to Socrates, and one he applauds, and likely believes he shares. But the book is evidence otherwise. His cherry-picking in the texts he uses, the spin he brings to bear in the historical epochs he unfolds, and the manipulation of context in which he situates certain literary and scientific appropriations (one would think Dostoevsky hadn't been a Christian! or that Stephen Jay Gould hadn't been conciliatory and respectful to religion!) are embarrassments. Hitchens is a bright man, and he should be bright enough to see that replacing centuries of religious hostilities with 300 pages of secular ridicule does nothing to set the bar higher than it has been. The book is a rant in which numerous good points are made - e.g. ""Human decency is not derived from religion. It precedes it."" (266) - and in which others are woefully ignored (e.g. that just as human decency precedes religion, so, too, does the impulse - to wreak havoc and cause harm - he attributes to religion itself). One final thing I'll mention is how unfortunate it is that Hitchens cannot seem to fathom the ways in which truth and facts are different entities, if often compliments. He's a literary critic and should know this better than anyone! Just as Northrop Frye has discussed at length, the Old Testament was never intended as a literal document - the culture that conceived of it understood this, so why can't Hitchens? The stories in the Old Testament are not facts and were not meant to be taken as such, so criticizing their being more akin to fables merely because a contingent of modern religious folk have misunderstood their meaning reveals Hitchens's response to be more a reaction than a response and reveals a misunderstanding in him as deep as the one in the literalist perspective of which he's so unforgiving. Ironically, one of the best explanations of the assertion that truth is as often found in an absence of fact as in fact can be seen in Enduring Love, a novel by Ian McEwan - the writer to whom God is not Great is dedicated. In it, Clarissa, a Keats scholar commenting on a disputed urban legend-like encounter between Keats and Wordsworth, says: ""It isn't true, but it tells the truth"" (183). Similarly, the Old Testament isn't true as we understand ""true"" to be ""factual,"" but it does tell the truth - about mankind, his nature, his shortcomings, his sense of longing, his sense of the sacred, etc. Enduring Love's exploration of this question with regard to religion - and not just Keats - plumbs much deeper, too, than I've mentioned here. Again, that Hitchens seems incapable of distinguishing between ""truth"" and ""facts"" or ""data"" is bizarre, given his standing as a literary critic. However learned he is, and whatever the book's nominal pluses, its tone is offensive, its conclusions misguided and its suppositions the product less of inquiry than of resentment. If there were a 1 1/2 star rating to give it, I would, but God is not Great warrants rounding down far more than rounding up. "
11,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/162116-joel,3,"Imagine if a basketball fan set out to discredit baseball and converts its adherents to his chosen sport. He would note the rather dubious creation myth still celebrated in the sports' Hall of Fame, the Black Sox scandal, the exclusion of African American players until the 1950s, frequent brawls between teams that literally clear the benches, and two most successful players of the last decade being almost undoubted cheats. He could go on to argue that the uniforms are childish, the habits of players disgusting (and their salaries even more so), and the rules hopelessly complex and inconsistent. Finally, he might say, subjecting children to such a game through organized little leagues is perhaps a form of child abuse. After all, it subjects them to needless stress to perform in an environment where even the most successful fail more than half the time and relies on shouting coaches for motivation. The basketball fan might then make a few comments on the beauty of a Larry Bird jumper, the deftness of a Magic Johnson behind-the-back pass, and the awe-inspiring grace of a Jordan dunk and thus safely conclude the argument convinced that his case was proved. Replace baseball with religions and basketball with enlightenment rationalism and you've essentially got God is Not Great. Hitchens' book is a catalog of the sins of religions and a well considered and highly pointed one at that. I found much I want to think over a bit more in my faith after watching it fall under Hitchens's inspection. Still, it seems like the same sort of catalog can be written up about any organized human endeavor and the fact that organized religions are not free of the human stain hardly surprises. What is surprising is the extent to which Hitchens' goes to leave no saint unblemished. Why he chooses to blame Indian partition on Gandhi, when Gandhi advocated contra Jinnah for a united India is beyond me. Similar is the portrayal of Mother Teresa as an opportunistic nun (I am sure the people she served wish there were more such opportunists). I suspect Mother Teresa is cast in such an unfavorable light more from the antipathy Hitchens feels for his fellow polemicist Malcolm Muggeridge, who first filmed her, than anything she's done. (In Hitchens estimation Muggeridge is an idiot as are most people he disagrees with). I suppose an atheist will find most of this comforting, though he may be pricked by a niggling doubt (a similar doubt to the doubt a theist such as myself has when reading some of C.S. Lewis' work) that the case for atheism is just a little too easily made here. "
12,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/240328-matthew-wesley,3,"This book is fundamentally flawed in argument, but can be enjoyable to read. Christopher Hitchens, however, is an exceptionally witty writer, who often finds clever ways to express himself. His writing is conversational, flowing, but sometimes elitist, arrogant, and pretentious. His humor is evident throughout the book, but it is consistently divisive and adversarial.As an atheist, I find the writing enjoyable, intelligent, and humorous. I do not need to be further convinced of the dangers of faith and religion, so I am willing to tolerate fallacies and offensive comments while I enjoy the witty writing. For the religious or the uncertain, however, this book may seem too irreverent and offensive to be of any intellectual value. Few faithful people would be willing to entertain the author's notions long enough to see where he has valid points and separate them from his snideness. This is a true shame, because there are some worthwhile messages.The main message is that religion can be a bad influence on things. Unfortunately, the author phrases this as the fallacious ""religion poisons everything."" Christopher Hitchens provides many poignant examples of wrongdoing founded in faith and religion, but this does not imply that everything done by religion is bad. It is unfortunate that the conclusion of the book is overstated, because a more cautious assessment of the dangers of religious rejection of reason would be valuable and accessible to more people.I would recommend that people interested in the subject matter instead review the extensive on-line collection of atheist writing. Much of it is more welcoming and less arrogant. www.infidels.org is a good source of such material, and it has an excellent introduction to atheism that is valuable both to atheists and to Christians (http://www.infidels.org/library/moder...). The library also includes written works oriented towards people of other faiths as well."
13,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/242699-marc-horton,5,"Obviously, anyone who can write a less-than-flattering book about Mother Teresa is not concerned with offending anyone. More or less, here's the rub: ""God"" explained a lot, back before we had Science and The Enlightenment, and now, humanity suffers at the hand of religious zealots whose battles spill over into the lives of the innocent. And one point that I'm sure would make my mother cry: it is possible to live a moral and good life without ""God."" Given the right subject, he's actually pretty funny, though he always dangerously treads the line between being obnoxiously and prodigiously smart. So, while I've disagreed with some his past books and ideas, this is one that fellow misanthropic humanists would do well to read. I'm reminded of a favorite Bill Hicks quote: ""Humans? We're a virus with shoes."" "
14,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8850418-edward-lorn,4,"A few days ago, a storm rolled through where I live and knocked out our power for a few hours and our internet for an entire day. (#firstworldproblems) Unfortunately, my Playstation 4 was in the middle of an update when all this occurred. The power outage shut down my PS4, and the update ended up becoming corrupted, along with my harddrive. I lost all my data. Hundred of hours of grinding in games like Fallout 4, Far Cry 4, Horizon Zero Dawn, Resident Evil VII, and loads more. The PS4 had to be returned to factory settings and the HDD wiped in safe mode before we could so much as load a game. Certain games would not work without first installing updates online, so I took my console to my mother's house (she has a different internet provider than us; one that came right back up after the storm. Fuck you, AT&T.) to do the updates so that we'd have something to do while the internet was out at our place. Now for a little backstory: My mother, who lives on my land in a separate trailer, sometimes piggybacks off our internet because her ISP (Xfinity) has a 10gb data cap. We have a 150gb cap. Any time she gets close she hops over to the extended network and uses ours. No biggie. Share and share alike. About a month ago, she mentioned wanting to cancel her internet, which she pays $70 a month for, and using solely our internet and chipping in on our bill. I said, ""Why not. Sounds good to me."" Fast forward to the day of the storm. I'm over her place, updating my PS4, and my mother says to me, ""I think this is a sign from God that I should keep my internet."" I gave her a look that I probably would've gotten slapped for had I still been a child and said, ""So what you're saying is that your god knocked out my power and internet and corrupted the data on my $400 video game system that had hundreds of hours of progress on its harddrive all because he wanted to send you a message that you should continue to pay $70 a month for a service you can't really afford because you tithe 10% of your already limited social security check every month to a church that worships him?""She sighed in disappointment and did not respond. My being an atheist has long upset her, and this book would likely give her a stroke because it logically argues against every religion and religious practice known to man. Best of all, Hitchens discusses the foundation of all religion: solipsism.And before you cry foul at how terrible I treat my mother and her fragile religious beliefs, you should know that I buy her groceries and cook her dinner every night because she can't afford to do so herself. Why can't she support herself? You guessed it, she blows her food money on tithing at a church whose members didn't so much as call her when she broke two ribs and fractured a third. They sure as shit sent her a tithe reminder in the mail, though, which she gladly returned with check enclosed. And yes, they had been informed of her fall and injuries. Classy buncha assholes, huh?My point is, I'm there for her when her god isn't, yet he still gets the credit. I think only an atheist can appreciate how annoying that is, to be the bad guy because I don't believe in her invisible man of choice even though I do everything in my power to make sure she has everything she needs. I feel like a parent supporting their child's drug addiction. Oh well. Thanks for listening to me vent.In summation: There's not much in God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything that I didn't already know, but it was still worth the read. To be clear, most atheists are atheists because they already know the information in this book. But if you're looking to further your education, or intend to attempt to dissuade a loved one from religion, or plan to attempt to erase the brainwashing of an indoctrinated child, I recommend reading this first. Hitchens cites all sources and argues intelligently against ignorant beliefs and silly superstitions. But I think my favorite part of the book is how accurately he displays the dangerous nature of all religions and not just extremist secs. All religions are poisonous, taken to the extreme or not. The only rational argument for them is how effective they are at controlling the uneducated masses.Final Judgment: Required reading."
15,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13716226-murtaza,2,"In his later years, Christopher Hitchens developed a habit of loudly declaiming about subjects that he had little specific knowledge about. Departing from his career as a journalist, during the mid-2000s Hitchens began an entirely new adventure as an amateur philosopher of sorts. The “New Atheism” movement of which he was one of the major figures made very bold pronouncements, announcing what seemed like nothing less than an imminent revolution in human values. The decrepit old garments of thought were - finally - about to be cast aside by a group of intrepid journalists and scientists. A new age of enlightenment was dawning.In retrospect the whole thing looks to have been a poorly-informed fad, as a few educated people had tried to point out at the time. Reading their books many years ago, I was completely appalled by the “war on terror” orientalism of Sam Harris and bemused by the scientism of Richard Dawkins. I generally viewed Hitchens as the most complex of the group, even though I disagreed with him, mainly because of his journalistic background. He knew a little something about the world, much more so than Harris to say the least. I figured he was at least entitled to have a shot at making his grand philosophical case about things. Picking up this book years later I’m reminded of the incredible weakness of his actual arguments, even when they were made in good faith.Hitchens does not understand religion and does not appear to be familiar with the philosophical underpinnings of the modern world, at all. He goes to great lengths to note all the terrible things done by people in the name of religion (all over the world, all history, all religions, in about 300 pages), which is easy enough and could be done with anyone having access to Wikipedia. He also explains away the unconscionably bad things done by people in the name of “not religion” as also somehow religion. As such it’s quite unclear what he defines religion as, since it actually seems to encompass any expression of tribal identity or ideology. As terrible as the Balkan Wars were, and as decent a journalist as Hitchens was during them, to distill it to religious atavism is so glaringly myopic that I can hardly believe that Hitchens himself believes this.The book ambles on very tediously with Hitchens believing himself to be “debunking” the historical consistency of every world religion along the way. He does not engage with the depth of any of the traditions he critiques. He raises questions as though he is the first person ever to think of them and does not even appear to be interested in the answers. I’m sure this is enjoyable reading (preaching?) for the already converted, but Hitchens doesn’t even try to make a serious argument to anyone else. I was really looking for this book to just be an enjoyable read and I have to say I was disappointed. I also have a brief comment about the aesthetic quality of Hitchens writing, which is praised in breathless terms every time his name comes up. Yes he is a capable writer and has written some eloquent things in his career. Despite a few nice turns of phrase this book however is very disjointed and not pleasing in a literary sense. An ostensibly serious book about a serious topic can also be undermined by too many flowery obfuscations. It’s nice to be able to fill one’s writing with elegant similes and literary references. This really needs to be an ornament to the argument rather than a substitute for it though. The slick charisma of a used-car salesman actually gets quite wearisome after the point when it becomes clear that he’s selling you a lemon. To redeploy a tired metaphor, on the topic of religion Hitchens was all sizzle and no steak, which is usually enough to impress people who don’t know better anyways. David Bentley Hart really had the last say on this subject and I highly recommend his essay instead of this book: https://www.firstthings.com/article/2..."
16,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14773738-julie,4,"Surprisingly, I wasn't beguiled by this book as much as I thought I would be. I like Hitchens's irreverent delivery on everything -- but this seemed to fall rather flat. (Or at least, ""flattish""). Couldn't quite put my finger on it, except to say that it seems that any kind of sustained rant has the immediate effect of getting me to tune out.A rant is a good thing -- get it off your chest, say what you have to say, with good points to back it all up, and then move on. Hitchens lingers on the page just a little too long and makes me feel that not only does religion poison everything, but so do clever intellectuals. Know thyself -- and know when to shut up -- are worthier conceits than verbal diarrhea.I felt much this way in viewing Bill Maher's Religulous. Clever, acerbic, funny, to-the-point: but then he just didn't know where to stop. Hammer to the head, over and over -- and over -- again ... that I took refuge in prayer that it would all end soon. The irony of that!I agree with everything Hitchens (and Maher) says, but for me, once is enough. (That is, tell me once, I learn my lesson and move on.) That being said, he does leave the believers with a lot of food for thought in this simple quote:Violent, irrational, intolerant, allied to racism and tribalism and bigotry, invested in ignorance and hostile to free inquiry, contemptuous of women and coercive toward children: organized religion ought to have a great deal on its conscience.I note, with some temerity, that those words are not applicable only to religion, however, but to the state of political figures making their rise in today's world. Change the title to Man is Not Great, and it would be more applicable. "
17,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4483727,4,"Up til a few hundred years ago, religion used to be our way of understanding all the shit we didn't have answers for - which was a lot... stars, rainbows, the causal relationship between fucking and dropping babies*(FN) - and a way to feel like we had emergency options when we were completely helpless: times of plague, famine and warfare. There were gods we could try to please or mollify by killing things, and then harass for military, climatic and antiviral favors. It usually didn't amount to much, but one lucky break in 50 is enough to keep faith alive for the desperate. The gods were like us, capricious and selfish. Then it was god, singular, for very specific and random reasons; archaeologists and anthropologists are still finding fun new evidence to confuse themselves with, which I'll get to in a moment. In the monotheistic beginning, god wasn't any better than the gods that came as a matching set. He had his own crew, and still acted like a mercurial, genocidal dick. It really wasn't until 2000 years ago that Christianity made excuses for his temper tantrums, and repainted Yahweh as a kind and loving god, despite a shitload of evidence to the contrary. The cruel games he played with Abraham & Job, the fact that he cursed the entire human race to disease, natural disasters, and death in general, all because he got his feelings hurt when two morons ate the wrong fruit... what the fuck? If god existed, why would anyone think this twat deserved 'faith'? Seen objectively, the god of the Old Testament is the best argument against 'faith' around. Any ideology that makes a virtue of willful ignorance, even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, needs to be killed with napalm.'Yahweh' or 'Jehovah' - extrapolated from the four consonant tetragrammaton (YHWH/JHVH) - was still the blood-and-thunder bad-ass that the Hebrews needed him to be, but he was slowly picking up the loving, motherly characteristics of the wife he left behind once they settled down, moving closer to the Christian concept of god. He wasn't capricious or cruel. He was fair and loving... although he did get drunk with Satan once and pick on Job; he just kind of laughed as the devil killed Job's family, gave him weeping, smelly skin ulcers, and treated him like a bitch... all on a bar-stool bet. He felt bad about it the morning after, though... and made it up to Job with a shiny new family. And an awesome goat.This new-and-improved, loving and caring, monotheistic 'Yahweh' supposedly wasn't governed by human faults and weaknesses, even if he let it slip to Moses we were created in his image. It may seem ridiculous from a modern POV, but it all seemed sensible to them. And Christians, Jews and Muslims are still in denial about this murderous piece of shit.Insecurity is definitely a part of the divine character, since he constantly needs reassurances that we love him, even after the douchebag kills our cats and grandmothers. It's always our fault; 'it's not you, God, it's me'. Those tens of thousands of babies that die every day obviously have it coming for their sins. If god's so dead-set against abortion, maybe he should prove it by not killing the children of parents who wanted to start a family. So contrary to whatever his biographers and publicity agents have been telling us for several millennia, god's just as flaky and mercurial as Jupiter and, well... Mercury. Looking back at all the genocidal and sadistic Old Testament tantrums - Sodom and Gomorrah, the Flood, cursing several billion people to pain and death because their great-great-great-great-etc. grandparents ate some fucking fruit - you'd have to conclude that if god did exist, he'd be a psychotic douchebag and all-around piece of shit. Every bit of suffering in the universe was his doing, yet we're still supposed to thank him for shoving this shit sandwich down our collective throat, to grovel and smile and beg for vague nothings via prayer. Yeah... fuck that. If you're... how should I phrase this... stupid enough to bother with a prayer, and -- shockingly -- it doesn't work out... the problem's on your end. Unplug it, plug it back in, and pray harder, ferfucksake. He apparently needs 7 billion people to pray at him daily, so he can look at himself in the quantum mirror and smile/frown/grow tentacles, but he can't be bothered to answer a single one. Are you certain you've done everything right? Yeah? There you go, you're too proud of your righteousness. That's not it? Well... file it under 'moves in mysterious ways'. For the desperate and the stupid, faith is invulnerable to reason. What would you think of a person who bought an ant farm, then tossed it into the furnace a day later because the ants wouldn't tap-dance when he asked politely? God's nuttiness is several orders of magnitude more severe. Thank god for not existing. Now that all those answers religion provided are no longer needed - and wrong about absolutely everything - it's only purpose is to whisper bullshit in the ear of the 'troubled soul', and provide reasons for humanity to kill itself over long outdated lies. We might as well murder each other over slight historical disagreements about Santa Claus. Elves or gnomes? Reindeer or caribou? Scarlet red or cherry red?*(They'd narrowed it down to wind and water as the most likely culprits for pregnancy, before agriculture became a thing and matriarchies became patriarchies; like flint knives and mastering fire, it's hard to know if an understanding of sex led to agriculture, or vice versa.)"

19,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/188406-kerissa-ward,5,"Ever since 'The Trial of Henry Kissinger' I have been a fan of Christopher Hitchens. I knew that he was an atheist, but because of my own spritual searching I was reluctant to read this book when it first came out. I finally picked up the book because I have been on a non-fiction binge lately and I knew that by reading his book I was guaranteed an intelligent treatise. By the time I finished the book, I was very glad that I had read it.Hitchens doesn't so much attack God as he attacks religion. He begins the book by describing himself as a boy, learning passages from the Bible, and the moment he felt that there must not be a God because of a comment his teacher makes. The tales of his boyhood experiences with religion and atheism are used for making his one of his thesis -- that organized religion ruins everything. He points out that it seems one goal of organized religion is to make humans relinquish independent and rational thought.One of the great things about the book is that the chapters are clearly and concisely laid out. In fact, I found the chapter sequence to be quite methodical. As is his usual trait when Hitchens is arguing against something, he builds his arguments gradually and strongly.Right after I bought the book I read online that many people who considered themselves evangelical have bought the book in a sort of know-thy-enemy way. I wonder if they felt like they any kind of rebuttal, because Hitchens -- through his extensive readings and reportage -- has built a historically sound case against the three organized religions.It is worthy to note, while Hitchens does deride some of the beliefs and practices of the big three, he does not sneer of the entirety of the faiths. He knows that there are good people in these faiths who only wish to do good. It the people who take their faiths to the extremes and misinterpret the written word that Hitchens takes most issue with.My only critique is that I do not think he addressed the evolution vs creationism as effectively as he could have. He makes mention of it several times, but does not explore it deeply.Otherwise anyone with any kind of brainpower should read this book."

He presents a great message!
21,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/743812-paul,2,"This book received two stars because of the writing. Hitchens writes well. I could have given it five stars for the value it holds for the Christian community - it serves as easy target practice. It is too bad that I only have 4000 characters at my disposal. Otherwise, I would love to go through this book in painstaking detail, pointing out the flabby and flaccid naked emperor while we all point and laugh at how confident the ignorant, intellectually naked emperor struts up and down the street.There has always been a power struggle between the clear, cogent, and well-reasoned arguments of the philosopher on the one hand, and the bottom-feeding sophist on the other. Hitchens proudly stands in the line of the latter. Hitchens doesn't bother to define ""god,"" ""religion,"" ""poison,"" and how it poisons ""everything."" Why bother? He and his ilk have already defeated the theist fair and square, no need to take care in how well you argue. Indeed, so sure is Hitchens of the truth of his conclusion that he barely deals with any thing a Christian thinker has had to say, besides Paley. But of course Collins or Dembski would be a better target if you’re going to attack design. (Oh, I think he mentions Agustine, Aquinas, Maimonides, and Newman, just for the purpose of pointing out that they have written ""evil and foolish things."") He never bothers to engage any serious Christian thinker or argument (no, I am not saying that Agustine, Aquinas, Lewis, &c. are not serious Christian thinkers. I'm saying that he didn't engage them.) No Plantinga, Swinburne, Collins, Alston, Craig, just to name a few. Not only that, but his approach is double minded. For example, he begins by saying that the religious adherent is ""the intended reader of this book."" But for almost every page after that he subjects his ""intended reader"" to scorn and ridicule. Is this any way to treat your “intended reader?” Indeed, he begins chapter two by asking his reader to imagine that they believe in an all powerful being. But if Christians like me are, as he says, his ""intended audience,"" then we don't have to ""imagine"", now do we? We might as well top this paragraph off by pointing out that Hitchens has a chapter called ""The Tawdriness of the Miraculous and the Decline of Hell."" But, after speaking about the miraculous, the chapter ends. ... He says nary a word about hell! These were just a couple of lowlights. I could multiply these types of criticisms all too easily.The book claims that Hitchens was named #5 on a list of top 100 intellectuals. Which theist does he unleash the artillery of his massive brain power on? His 4th grade teacher, Mrs. Watts! He spends more time critiquing her than any competent theological or theistic philosopher.He says that we do evil because we evolved that way. So, religion isn't to blame, Mammaw Nature is. He appeals to ""Ockham's razor, yet he doesn't use it, like other naturalists have, to whittle away mental states like beliefs and pain (he relies on these states for his arguments, though). He doesn't use it to whittle away moral claims. There’s much he can’t explain using his razor as he does. He critiques the designer because of poor design, yet he gives no indication that he knows what the design plan was aiming to achieve. You can't call the designer a bad designer without knowing his intentions. And, dysteleogy assumes teleology. He never bothers to address the arguments which seek to show that if our cognitive faculties evolved given a naturalistic understanding of the universe, we have no reason to belief our beliefs are aimed at truth. They'd just be aimed at survival. Hitchens drops the ball over and over again. Unfortunately I don't have the time, or key strokes, to really get into this. Overall, the book was a flop. If this is the best The New Atheism has to offer, theists can relax."

With a close and erudite reading of the major religious texts, he documents the ways in which religion is a man-made wish, a cause of dangerous sexual repression, and a distortion of our origins in the cosmos. Hitchens frames the argument for a more secular life based on science and reason, in which hell is replaced by the Hubble Telescope's awesome view of the universe and Moses and the burning bush give way to the beauty and symmetry of the double helix.So, to answer the question Why do human beings exist? it is simply because the Ottoia prolifica worm survived the Burgess decimation.5* God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything4* 	Mortality 4* The Portable Atheist: Essential Readings for the Nonbeliever4* Arguably: Selected Essays3* Letters to a Young Contrarian4* The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and PracticeTR The Monarchy: A Critique of Britain's Favourite Fetish"

Author further asks : ""If god was the creator of all things, why are we s'posed to praise him incessantly for doing what came to him naturally?""I could go on. But if ye are not a stiff-necked people, you will let Hitchens do it. "

I wasn't beguiled as i thought i would be when I picked up this book.I had few problems with the writing, the structure of the book was unappealing and It was dragged out many times which resulted in a severe boredom while reading this"
25,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,5,"I don’t know why I feel the nagging need to clarify something before we even get started.I am an atheist myself, however new to the group I might be. Indeed, until a very recent time, I spent a big period of my life believing I’m an agnostic. How do I put this mildly? Agnosticism is the safe route, it’s the one in between the dirty street filled with drug dealers and that very safe boulevard. It’s the one you’d take if your mom told you to take the shortest route home and you decided to be a bit of a rebel. But just a bit, mind you, not a lot. Because the basic concept of agnosticism, in relation to God, is that “we don’t know”. We don’t know, we can’t know, therefore we can’t make suppositions based on thin air. But, what agnosticism offers in return is the acceptance that there is actually something out there, luring in the divine space, waiting for us to recognize it to its true form and power. Basically, you get the “safety-belt” package that allows you to say, if you ever find yourself blamed in front of said divinity, that you couldn’t be sure. Which is, I used to believe, much more acceptable than… Than atheism, really. Than flat-out acknowledging and believing and living up to this belief that there is no God. If death is not final and you find yourself face to face with the supreme Judge… you’re fucked. I guess I didn’t want to be a little rebel anymore and blossomed into a full blown hooligan. I have never in my life been a believer. Not a single moment have I said: “I believe in God.” I have been raised with only one rule as guidance: “think for yourself”. As a kid, my family took me to a vast number of churches, not only of my religion, even if predominantly confined by it; big churches, small churches, some covered in gold, some built of wood, some carved in rock; some with a lot of fervent followers, others with just a lonely, old priest watching over the precincts… I have visited other countries and entered their churches, seen their shrines, watched their processions. I have had a fair amount of religious visiting done – but never in the name of God. Not once, in my entire life, have I gone to a church/religious space with the purpose of praying or bowing to the maker. If there was a reason, I guess it was to witness art, beauty in religious architecture, in believer’s paintings, in faith based sacred images. It was to see human-made wonders, ironically. I have shared meals with priests and slept with nuns in their rooms, in the mountains; I have experienced the simplicity that religion can instill into the lives of men and women, who devote their entire beings towards a better existence at the end of their current one. I have also seen the gold-adorned lives some religious people dwell in because of this foolish and completely idiotic belief that a creator would need to be worshipped with precious stones; How, did the creator not also create the poor?.. Or maybe he had an eye for sparkle. I guess my point is, the concept of God in itself was useless to my formation, to my life. I have not had any advantage from being baptized into the Orthodox Church, no real need fulfilled by my affiliation to a certain religious cult. Knowing the Ten Commandments hasn’t overthrown my innate sense of right and wrong. The Genesis hasn’t impaired my ability to understand and believe in the Darwinist model. I have a moral code and fairly tough ethics without having followed God’s rules a single day. My life has been much more impacted upon by the fact that I was born into a white, middle-class, fairly well-off European family and that I have been given the proper education during each stage of my life in order to propel me to my current position and allow me to pursue my (apparently) fucked-up dreams. But, at some point in my intellectual journey, I realized I had to know more about religion. I simply had to. There was no way around it, I had too many questions that hadn’t received answers. What also prompted me to analyze the matter more profoundly was the attitude of religious people in my vicinity when confronted with a non-believer. I have had confrontations (mainly in a scholarly environment, but just as meaningful ones outside of it) with people who had blamed me for my decisions and professed harsh consequences upon my doings, supported by their faith, when all I had done was ask questions. I do have opinions, mind you. I do think religion has become a political/economical tool and that humans have, in their majority, lost the true meaning of it (which is achieving spirituality). Also, on my bitter road filled with deception in becoming an atheist, I found myself more and more disgusted with religious people and faith preachers and church goers, all because of their sense of superiority over me, their smug characters, thinking they have the divinity watching over their backs, that a divinity cares for them, repudiating reason and thinking and skepticism and empirical evidence to the dungeons of hell and their inhabitants to even worse tortures… I’m sure you could say atheists become atheists because of people more than because of God. I am not one of those who will talk against the concept of God; however, against the fantasies that the Bible (or any other scripture) professes as historically true, I will; against stupidity and racism and extremist followers and the banishment of science, I will; against mindless, spineless and remorseless individuals who coerce their children into fear and revulsion, perpetuating this tradition of imbecility over generations, I will. Against all of that and many more, I will speak up.After all this ranting, I want you to take this away: I understand the need for religion. I understand why we turned to it in the first place and why we still cling to it now. I am not an “anti-theist”. I do not speak against God. I question him, his existence, his preaching, his absurd needs and his megalomaniac commands. I judge him, yes, and his followers, as they also judge me in return. You could call it mutual distrust, really. But, if it’s true, if God exists, then I’m content with my atheist position. I believe I have the right to burn in Hell, or in all versions of it that exist. If you are a religious person reading this, please pray to your God that I may suffer. Please, bring the flames on, an eternity of torture for this pitiful apostate that I am! I beg of you, prove me wrong. I’ll be the happiest for that – indeed, I, in a very sadomasochistic way, look forward to it. I fully intend to burn in Hell if that is the punishment for critical thinking and freedom of opinion. Make crackling strips out of my skin! Scrambled brains out of the contents of my skull! And never grant me forgiveness for wanting to understand the world by the power of my own mind. I don’t need to be excused for my own egocentric nature. Not by someone who is content in giving up his identity to a whimsical being of a far-away land. In any case, if death is not final, I’ll still be going to hell even without being an atheist. I’m a sinner by birth, supposedly. Being an atheist just makes me a conscious one. DONE! Now, let’s move on to an apologetic review that is supposed to be worth reading the whole rant that you just went through… Oh, well, I doubt it. What I promise I will not talk about: how awesome Christopher Hitchens is. What I will talk about: how awesome Christopher Hitchens’ work is. “God is not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything” is one in a long series of published papers that Hitchens has dawned upon us readers, that concern the matter of a divine being’s existence. Now, Hitchens is, as Woody Allen so humorously puts it, “the loyal opposition”. He is an atheist and a very articulate one indeed. When reading his work, you must be aware of the position he is taking: he is against blind faith and all for finding proof. As always, as in his speeches and his essays, he doesn’t cut off the path to discussion; rather he wants to open one. He questions everything, tries to shed light on the scriptures and the relationship between human and divine and all in all succeeds in making a very serious and solid case for his motion. I have read some commentaries that he just mindlessly gives examples about how different people do different bad things in the name of their religion, and the readers who said that were arguing that these are useless extracts. I believe not. Of course he is going to point out what individuals do in the name of religion, that is the exact purpose of it all, how far humans will go and to what extent they will cause suffering and ignite wars and deny the most basic needs to others because of what their God (read: whimsical being of a far-away land with a very serious ego problem) has said. Now, Hitchens doesn’t differentiate between Gods. If one is false, all are. The God’s importance doesn’t reside in the number of his followers, for this author. He talks the same about the three big monotheist religions, as well as about the remote cults of distant lands. The reason why so much of his work is concentrated around the Judaic, Muslim, and Christian preaching is that these three have had a massive effect on our society, as we experience it today. He speaks against them not with the purpose of defiling the “fantasy” itself, but in need to show how ridiculous and irrelevant they are for humanity today. They were very useful in the dawn of time, when volcanoes erupting at every corner and people found dead in the morning could not receive a proper explanation. After all, religion is a very early and very primitive attempt at science! Hitchens doesn’t deny that, and never once attacks the spiritual need of humans to unite and find solace – what he offers, instead, is solace through knowledge. For all it’s worth it, I need to address the writing. You can see that this man has loved reading since he was a kid. You can see he knows literature in a very intimate way; his choice of words, his rhythm, the subtle irony underlining the entire work, everything points out to a wonderfully complex and cultured mind behind those pages. And cultured he had to be, given the enormity of the subjects he chose to tackle in his entire career. This is, in my opinion, a very good piece of non-fiction writing. It shows through a very thorough research, even if it is centered on finding the right facts to support his claims. I can throw away my subjective, atheist self, look at this work with my objective, detail-obsessed reader’s eye and find only minor twerks in this study. I, for one, love the way Hitchens writes, because I feel he’s having a conversation with me. And, in the end, that is every writer’s dream – the extension of one’s thoughts into another’s mind without the two actually being in each other’s presence. Atheists … you know you liked it. Even if it was the sort of: ""oh wow he said it much better than I could have"" like, you enjoyed it. Believers … you know you can’t deny its truth. Even if you're backed up by all your faith, don't Hitchens' arguments pick at your reason?All the rest … pick a side. Does Hitchens ask for too much? Just pick a damn side. "
26,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"Significant that no argument of the author can be invalidated with rational arguments. Only with proof of God Please note that I put the original German text at the end of this review. Just if you might be interested.Hitchens provides a hard-to-disagree, non-philosophical polemic against faith. Throughout the history of religion, he paints a picture of contradictions, power struggles, manipulation, warmongering and the possible call for war, genocide, intolerance and oppression and mistreatment of women, people of other faiths, non-believers and children. If these topics were still in vogue and a source of frequency among primitive illiterates at the time of the founders of religion, one would have thought that reason and enlightenment would bring about knowledge. Unfortunately, far from it. Regarding the care, poor feeding and other social activities of religions as something noted. The sense of charitable action and donation is based on selflessness and the willingness to provide help without expectation of a return in the form of indoctrination readiness as thanks for salvation from precarious situations. On the other hand, if they recruit from the human zealots and fundamentalists, who are saved from starvation or permanent physical damage, they deflate any well-intentioned intention due to the desired and purposefully evoked negative echo. On the contrary, it is perverted, and the supposedly good deed causes more bad things than if it had never happened. The author also dares to be one of the first to criticize the sacrosanct figure of Mahatma Gandhi, the impact of Buddhism on Asian societies and the role of Buddhism in Japan at the time of the Second World War. To illustrate the proportional increase in intolerance per believer Hitchens refers to the different reaction patterns of believers and atheists. A disciple of all stripes will never tire of criticizing and attacking the religion or even the pure disbelief of others. Saw it on the foundation of his irrational construct. Attending a Mass, celebration, or just a non-inconspicuous event from another faith community can turn out to be more and more impossible with increasing radicalism. On the other hand, tolerant, secular believers, atheists, and agnostics do not have to struggle with rolled-up toenails and internal turmoil when attending cultic acts of various religions and sects. By the way, the state recognition makes the difference between secret rite and in the light of the legitimacy of sun-worshiping religion. Also, this recognition is based on pure numbers.The basic concept of ignorant narrow-mindedness, unfortunately, often metastasizes, often starting from religion, across all strata of the population and aspects of life. Be it politics, social systems, emancipation, education, economic models, knowledge formation or several other essential elements of life; the infiltrated poison has been active for millennia. Moreover, you can see that everywhere, based on the societies that were built on such structures and concepts and for much more substantial parts, as an enlightened person wants to acknowledge, still is found. An epigenetic analysis would be interesting.In the meantime, in the case of religion, fortunately, it has now become acceptable to produce criticism and one's own opinion. As far as the economic system, monetary and financial systems, the nature of democratic participation and the influence of view, the media and unwritten laws, doctrines and unassailable dogmas are concerned, mankind faces a similar challenge as at the beginning of religious foundations.It is no longer necessary to obey the commandments of apologists for the political and economic world order, carved in stone, but digitized, which bears frightening resemblances to religious delusions. When economic and sociopolitical infidels are considered subversive elements, which merely belong to the extreme left and right, without any empirical evidence. As an example, the attempt to conduct an objective conversation on controversial topics with an economist, banker, entrepreneur, politician or opinion leader. The same arrogance and narrow-mindedness as with a deluded believer will usually be delivered automatically. Instead of monasteries and churches, the false savior is honored in schools, universities, parliaments, committees and think tanks.Unfortunately, humanity is only at the beginning of the rule of industrial conglomerates, and like all authoritarian secular and spiritual regimes before it seeks omnipotence. Established only towards the mid to late second millennium, it had created a hitherto unknown alliance of Mammon and severe indoctrination that will change the world in a way that no autocratic regime before it did. So that after, in relation, such a short time. How such development continues is written in the history books.Bezeichnend, dass sich kein Argument des Autors mit rationalen Argumenten entkräften lässt. Nur mit GottesbeweisenHitchens liefert eine schwer in Abrede zu stellende, auf philosophische Aspekte verzichtende Streitschrift gegen den Glauben. Quer durch die Religionsgeschichte zeichnet er ein Bild von Widersprüchen, Machtstreben, Manipulation, Kriegstreiberei und dem latenten Ruf zu Krieg, Völkermord, Intoleranz und Unterdrückung und Misshandlung von Frauen, Andersgläubigen, Ungäubigen und Kindern. Waren diese Themen zu Zeiten der Religionsstifter bei primitiven Analphabeten noch en vogue und ein Frequenzbringer, so hätte man meinen sollen, mit der Vernunft und Aufklärung kehre die Erkenntnis ein. Doch leider weit gefehlt.Bezüglich der Pflege-, Armenspeisungs- und sonstiger sozialen Aktivitäten von Religionen seit etwas angemerkt. Der Sinn karitativen Handelns und Spendens fußt auf Selbstlosigkeit und der Bereitschaft, ohne Erwartung einer Gegenleistung in Form von Indoktrinationsbereitschaft als Dank für Errettung aus prekären Lagen, Hilfe zu leisten. Rekrutieren sich hingegen aus den, vor Hungertod oder bleibenden körperlichen Schäden bewahrten, Menschen Eiferer und Fundamentalisten, verpufft jegliche gutgemeinte Intention aufgrund des erwünschten und gezielt hervorgerufenen negativen Echos. Sie wird im Gegenteil pervertiert und aus der vermeintlich guten Tat erwächst mehr schlechtes, als wenn sie niemals stattgefunden hätte.Als einer der Ersten wagt sich der Autor auch an eine Kritik der sakrosankt erklärten Figur Mahatma Gandhis, der Auswirkungen des Buddhismus auf die asiatischen Gesellschaften und der Rolle des Buddhismus im Japan zur Zeit des Zweiten Weltkriegs.Zur Veranschaulichung der proportionalen Intoleranzsteigerung pro Gläubigen bezieht sich Hitchens auf die unterschiedlichen Reaktionsmuster von Gläubigen und Atheisten. Ein Jünger jeglicher Couleur wird nicht müde werden, die Religion oder sogar den schlichten Unglauben anderer Menschen zu kritisieren und anzugreifen. Sägt es doch am Fundament seines irrationalen Konstrukts. Eine Messe, Feier oder nur eine unverfängliche Veranstaltung einer anderen Glaubensgemeinschaft zu besuchen kann sich mit zunehmender Radikalität als immer unmöglicher herausstellen. Tolerante, säkulare Gläubige, Atheisten und Agnostiker haben hingegen nicht mit aufgerollten Fußnägeln und innerer Zerrissenheit zu kämpfen, wenn sie Kulthandlungen verschiedenster Religionen und Sekten beiwohnen. Nebenbei, die staatliche Anerkennung macht den Unterschied zwischen okkultem Ritus und sich im Licht der Legitimität sonnender Religion. Und diese Anerkennung fußt auf simplen Zahlen.Das Grundkonzept der ignoranten Borniertheit metastasiert leider, häufig ausgehend von der Religion, quer durch alle Bevölkerungsschichten und Lebensaspekte. Seien es Politik, Gesellschaftssysteme, Emanzipation, Erziehung, Wirtschaftsmodelle, Wissensbildung oder etliche andere essentielle Aspekte des Lebens, das eingesickerte Gift zeitigt seit Jahrtausenden Wirkung. Und die sieht man allerorts anhand der Gesellschaften, die auf solchen Strukturen und Konzepten errichtet wurden und zu wesentlich größeren Teilen, als ein aufgeklärter Mensch sich eingestehen möchte, noch immer fußen. Eine epigenetische Analyse wäre interessant.Wobei es im Fall der Religion mittlerweile glücklicherweise salonfähig geworden ist, Kritik und eine eigene Meinung hervorzubringen. Was die Wirtschaftsordnung, Währungs- und Finanzsysteme, die Art der demokratischen Mitbestimmung und den Einfluss von Meinungsmacht, Medien und ungeschriebenen Gesetzen, Lehrmeinungen und unanfechtbaren Dogmen anbelangt, steht die Menschheit vor einer ähnlichen Herausforderung wie zu Beginn der Religionsstiftungen.Nicht mehr den in Stein gemeißelten, sondern digitalisierten Geboten von Apologeten der politischen und wirtschaftlichen Weltordnung ist Folge zu leisten, was erschreckende Ähnlichkeiten mit religiösem Wahn impliziert. Wenn wirtschafts- und gesellschaftspolitisch Ungläubige als subversive, dem extremen linken Rand zuzuordnende, jegliche empirischen Beweise schuldig bleibende und immer mehr auch gefährliche Elemente gelten. Als Beispiel sei der Versuch angeraten, mit einem Ökonomen, Banker, Unternehmer, Politiker oder Meinungsbildner ein objektives Gespräch über brisante Themen zu führen. Dieselbe Überheblichkeit und Engstirnigkeit wie bei einem verblendeten Gläubigen wird meist automatisiert geliefert werden. Statt in Klöstern und Kirchen wird dem falschen Heiland in Schulen, Universitäten, Parlamenten, Gremien und Think Tanks gehuldigt.Ungünstigerweise steht die Menschheit erst am Beginn der Herrschaft von Wirtschaftkonglomeraten und wie alle autoritären weltlichen und geistlichen Regime vor ihr strebt sie nach Allmacht. Gerade erst gegen Mitte bis Ende des letzten Jahrtausends etabliert, hat sie eine bisher unbekannte Allianz aus Mammon und strenger Indoktrination erschaffen, die die Welt in einer Weise verändern wird, wie kein autokratisches Regime vor ihr. Und das nach so kurzer Zeit. Wie sich eine solche Entwicklung fortsetzt steht in den Geschichtsbüchern."
27,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1484029-mikey-b,5,"Hallelujah – the atheists strike back! This is a personal and direct assault on the whole “God” concept. Hitchens buys none of it; its just fables and hearsay (upon hearsay) past down from antiquity. Religions cause wars, they indoctrinate the young and they are immoral - the very opposite of what they claim to be.Since the 18th century science has started to trump religion. The microscope, the telescope, discovery of fossils, exploration – all have either imploded religion or opened alternative wide vistas.But why is religion so persistent – I don’t know if Hitchens successfully answers this troublesome question? Hitchens is more comfortable dealing and attacking the Judeo-Christian world than other religions. And sometimes he is too relentless. He misses the point with Gandhi. It is the way India achieved independence that is historically significant. Gandhi promoted innovative means of protest – marches, strikes – and more importantly, he never directly used violence or espoused violence and never accumulated wealth. Gandhi is not solely remembered as a religious leader. As for the Civil Rights movement in the U.S. – it was the local black clergy in the Deep South that organized, funded and precipitated the struggle for freedom. Later, clergy from across the U.S. actively participated (at the risk of their lives) in Freedom Rides, the Voting Rights march in Selma and many more. Credit must be given where it is due. Mr.Hitchens is also rather hard on the personality of Jesus. Many analysts find Jesus’ teaching to be “revolutionary” in the sense of being anti-materialistic. A few have argued that the entire hierarchy and wealth of the Church – Catholic and Protestant - is contrary to the teachings of Jesus.Nevertheless thank God for Christopher Hitchens! I am so sick of hearing Presidential candidates talking about their faith and how often they pray. As Mr. Hitchens points out it was people of faith who carried out the September 11th attacks. I also subscribe with Mr. Hitchens when he equates revolutionary dictatorships with theocracies. They espouse dogma and repression. Hitler was a Messiah to the German people.Religion condones the abuse and indoctrination of children. Its’ ancient (and sometimes ludicrous) texts prevent free inquiry and purport to have all answers. It is ridiculous to rely on texts of long ago to regulate your life."
28,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1022982-brad,4,"My newly teenage son was off for a weekend of acting workshops, and he found himself in a religious discussion with his mostly pious friends. He didn't give it much thought, and simply stated that he was atheist. More than a few of his religious friends didn't speak to him for the rest of the weekend, and now he awaits his return to acting class this week to see if they will still see him as a friend or will have cast him aside. He's been angry with himself ever since for telling the truth. He wishes he'd kept his mouth shut. I am sure most atheists have a similar story, or even multiple stories wherein we were ostracized for our position, lost people we cared about or found ourselves hiding in the irreligious closet so as to avoid the social stigma our position carries. Much of Christopher Hitchens God is Not Great is, I feel, a conversation about this. Oh sure, he is doing plenty to deconstruct religion and belief, to point out the damage religion has done and continues to do, to reveal all the ways it ""poisons everything,"" even to point out that those supposedly secular moments of horror that the religious try to pin on atheism are still bound up in religion and faith, but at its most simple and effective, God is Not Great is a conversation from one atheist to other atheists. Of all the books I've read by famous atheists, it strikes me that Hitchens is the least concerned with religious folks. He has no illusions whatsoever that his words might convert the faithful. Nowhere in these pages is that his goal. This book is not a sermon that attempts to reach a new congregation but only reaches the choir, it is a conversation between like minded individuals about why we are atheist, what it means to be atheist, about all of those things that led us to atheism, and about how we can navigate a world that despises and fears us. God is Not Great is one of the most reassuring of all the atheist texts of the last decade or two. It's nice to be reminded that, indeed, we are not alone in our unbelief."
29,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10049704-joey,5,"When my friends or the new people I'm acquainted with find out that I am an atheist ,they tend to raise their eyebrows or purse their lips. It is unusual for someone  like me in the Philippines to not believe in God/god. The same as what happened a long time ago, when my best friend based in Thailand confirmed that I belong now to the  members of the ""Four Horsemen of New Atheism"", she was worried that I would no longer be saved in the event that the Judgment Day came. She insisted that I believe in him.Inculcated in militant character,I explained my side in flagrant defiance. As a result, we had had heated debates many times; our friendship almost turned to ice in view of our irrepressibly acrimonious opinions. In the end, we still  make sure that her religion will never shake the foundation of our friendship.Christopher Hitchens is one of the major influences on my being an apostate. Actually, I've read his God is not Great once,  and I decided to read it for the second time because I wanted to understand its contents more. It was still unintelligible to me since I read its free PDF. That's why I was not even able to write my review of it. Besides, I was not scholarly ready yet to give my thoughts of it; it needs deeper assimilation.Hitchens  strongly emphasized that religion kills every thing. He believed that  it causes violence, irrationality, intolerance, alliance to racism, tribalism, and bigotry, investment in ignorance and hostility to free inquiry, scorn for women and coercion toward children and sectarian.To deduce  his arguments, he  wrote  various personal stories, documented historical anecdotes and critical analysis of religious texts. The result? Voila! A book that believers must find ridiculous beyond logical explanation, a big threat to their incessantly dominant indoctrination.After reading it, I felt like I had a rude awakening for Hitchens' views  that religion causes violence, religion is full of superstitions, religion in particular is hazardous to health, some religions are just copy-cats,  both the old and the  new testaments are inconsistent, religion has been the root of corruption, religious dominance can come to an end,religion  has been emphasizing   the meaning of sin, religion abuses children, and people can live without religion.In the end, what Hitchens wanted to point out, the way I see it overall, is that there has been a culture of ignorance in that people conform to the facts they find universal. Go figure!I've been an avowed atheist for four years, since I read some books dealing with atheism. (Well, if you are deeply religious cringing at what I'm blabbering about here  now, you might opine that I should not read such anti-religion books, for they  corrupt my mind. Duh! )So, comparatively speaking, I would say that my life is better than before. I am now comfortable to live the way I want. I don't need to conform to religious customs I find paradoxical. I don't need to shape my life according to what the bible dictates  to me. Rather, I lead my life based on what I know what is right for the sake of humanity. I might call it the "" universal conscience"". And don't even dare tell me that conscience is a godly gift. As a matter of fact, I have proven prominent atheists' belief  that a person can be good without the misleading guidance of religion. However, contrary to the militant attitude of Hitchens, I still believe that respect for one's religious views is the best way  to gain rapprochement among us ,only if we know our limitations without being affected by our deep-seated devotion and fanaticism. No wonder Hitchens strongly believes that religion kills everything.For those people who have the same struggle  with their religious conviction, I suggest that you firs read God Delusion by Richard Dawkins or  Atheism: The Case Against God  by George H. Smith. I believe that these books are the springboard for breaking all the spells that have been binding you for a long time. Good luck and let me know then about your thoughts of them. Happy reading!  :)"

Hitchens is hilarious and I would run up to anyone who'd listen and read sections of his book out loud to them!A friend once was on a panel with him and he was completely drunk. She said he was so lucid and his arguments so well thought out and pointed that he was so much better while fueled on alcohol than the rest of us could ever hope to be sober. That is how much of a genius this man is!"

32,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4193758-mike-puma,5,"Hitchens makes a compelling case against the major world religions and claims of religion being ‘essentially a force for good.’ His essays are presented with his characteristic wit, erudition and bravado (in the positive sense of defiance and courage). Unafraid to name names, point fingers, and challenge orthodoxy, Hitchens makes his case masterfully and in a most readable manner. As previous reviewers have mentioned, he’s mainly ‘preaching to the choir’ but he also provides an abundance of information to newly realized skeptics and atheists in search of additional ‘ground to stand on’ when faced with the inevitable challenges of the religious. Fans of Hitchens might appreciate the following sites:All things Hitchens: http://www.hitchensweb.com/ for video relevant to this book: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD0B-X..."
33,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/364984-cb-brim,1,"This book reads like campaign propaganda. It is not a balanced inquiry into religion as a phenomenon or social force, it is a position piece and a purposefully constructed argument. Just like any effective propagandist Hitchens selects the most outrageous examples possible and attributes them to even the most cursory adherent of the enemy camp. Hitchens paints a black and white portrait of any person who has any ounce of religious thought as a fanatical fundamentalist who implicitly accepts any story or claim in any religious text ever written.Because it is largely propoganda, every chapter in this book could be easily countered with an oppositely titled rebuttal. For example 'Religion Kills People' -> 'Religion Saves People'. Anyone with 20 minutes and Google could write that argument (whether it's true or not isnt' the point). This is because Hitchens is not excercising objective thought here, he is running an attack campaign on an opponent of his own dogmatic definition.At it's core this book is a rant deriding fundamentalists, but with it's strict and extreme definitions, at the end of it all you get the feeling like you are laughing at competitors in the special olympics. Yes, some people are bad at religion. A lot of fundamentalists are raging idiots. However, if someone wonders whether there is a God, or even spiritual forces, they do not automatically believe that God made frogs rain in Egypt and saved the Jews with magic sky-bread, a la Hitchens' tunnel vision viewpoint.Hitchens fails to realize that it's not the adherents that need discussing, but the impetus and origins, and as such fails to address any of the questions that deserve real inquiry. Why do we find religion in every human culture ever encountered? Why do these ideas resonate with us, not to mention, what about the questions or fears they try to assuage in the first place? Just because some ideas are poorly concieved doesn't mean the inspirations are illegitimate.At the end of it, this book is little more than the literary equivalent of internet flame bait.p.s. Hitchens' closing remark that religion is obsolete because the Internet provides wider access to literature and poetry is one of the most laughable things I've ever read. Besides barely making sense, it's a statement that makes me think, after writing an entire book on the subject, Hitchens still has no idea what draws people to religion in the first place."

The author’s writing is so incredibly wordy, my assumption is that this is to convey just how right his opinion is over anybody else’s. Seriously, this guy sounds like the most entitled white guy I’ve ever come across. He refers to himself as an intellectual un-ironically many times. I wanted to read about how religion sucks, I didn’t want to read about how an entitled man feels he’s infinitely better than anyone who’s religious, that his opinion is all encompassing and anyone who falls out of it is apparently dumber than he. I don’t want to read about how smart you are for realizing religion is a scam, I wanted to read about how religion negatively effects society. I guess maybe I should check the authors of books like these to avoid men who write an entire book about how entitled they are. "

Sure, I had read an illustrated version of both Old and the New Testaments when I was very young (See how they corrupt the minds of the young !!!) but I was lost when Mr Hitchens started propunding about these minute differences. But I do get the gist of the book, the fact that religion is man made, the fact that its a physical manifestation of our insecurities and fallibilities and that there is no escape from it. As a famous Senator once said, Americans have the freedom of religion, not freedom from religion. The way religion has made itself an unquestionable phenomena, the way every logical statement or inquiry is refuted by referring to blind faith, is frightening. With a generation being staple fed with Twitter feeds and which prides itself on having an attention span of less than 140 characters, its a horrific scenario to behold, humanity diminishing in logic, knowledge and reasoning so that when things go wrong, the talons of religious propaganda are there to catch them."

It was early morning, the start of a beautiful day. I saw a man walking down the beach wearing a dark blue tee shirt and white trousers rolled up to his mid-calf. As he got closer I thought that I recognized him. I shouted out, “Christopher Hitchens?” He walked over to me and said, “Yes.”“I thought that you had died.” “Yes, I had. I am now a ghost.”“A ghost? Does this mean that you now believe in God?”“No,” he flatly stated, “but I now believe in ghosts.” And then he disappeared."
37,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/211534-sunni,3,"If I could, I would have preferred to give this book 3.5 stars. It was not as good as I had hoped, but not as bad as I feared either. I think Hitchens could have done a better (more logical?) job of defending his premise; still, there's lots of good stuff in here.The chapter on Eastern religions, though, is troubling to me. Hitchens does hit something on the head in noting the monied, f**cked up set that sometimes accompanies Indian-style gurus, but it's interesting that his Buddhist examples of violence are the only two I ever hear referenced - Sri Lanka and the Japanese oppression of China. I think it should be noted that while there are hundreds of examples of Christian violence, the same two examples come up again and again for ""Buddhist violence"". One might think this says something about the ""damage"" done by Buddhism (as compared to the western faiths). Also, while I agree somewhat with his distaste for de-emphasis on the intellect that is sometimes found in zen practice, there are zen schools (namely some Korean) that focus heavily on knowledge. And it's interesting that Hitchens includes no notes/references for the entire Eastern chapter. So, I'm wondering if the Dalai Lama quote on prostitution is taken out of context or if it's very outdated. All this being said about this one chapter, though, I still liked most of the book. And the other citations included reference a great number of books I'd like to now read, namely what I can find about Spinoza and a number of books by Michael Shermer. And overall, though I bristle like Hitchens at the ""Brights"" moniker Richard Dawkins supports, I prefer Dawkins' recent The God Delusion. Namely because it approaches the issue of god from a scientific point of view. Hitchens succeeds at showing some strong examples of the audacity and violence of religious figures and groups (the recurring emphasis on the terrible things religion does to children is particularly salient), but it doesn't really get to the heart of the atheist/believer question."
38,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/263388-jules,3,"Well, it's all there in the title. And in case you missed Hitchens' point, he subtly reminds you of it by interjecting the book's subtitle every time he recounts an example of how Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism (yes -- Buddhism!) have brutalized the human race. (It's the textual equivalent of grabbing you by your collar and shaking you violently while shouting, ""See? I'm right! Admit I'm right!"") According to Hitchens, religion is really the source of 99% of this world's evils; things like racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, classism, poverty, and nationalism are merely offshoots of humankind's seriously stupid affinity for creating gods. Thankfully for us, Great Thinkers such as himself are here to disabuse us of our pathetic and mystical thinking. And while I'm sure he would call me stupid for saying so, I think that Hitchens has replaced one godhead (God, Jehovah, Allah -- whatever you want to call him) with another (secular -- or maybe scientific? -- humanism). And if there's anything I know, it is that you cannot argue with a secular humanist. Here's what made this somewhat shrill and monotone book amusing and even enjoyable for me: Hitchens' belief that no one is as fantastic as himself. What did someone once say about Orson Welles: ""There but for the grace of God goes God""? Let me give just one example of how Hitchens' stratospheric self-regard colors his view of the world and unintentionally caused me to erupt in laughter. Hitchens tells a story about how he was once on Sri Lanka -- I think -- and was able to get a group of natives out of a potentially dangerous situation, using his wits and his British press card. The men, according to Hitchens, then proceeded to treat him in an extremely respectful, bordering on adulatory, way. Instead of thinking, ""Well, maybe their behavior is their culture's way of expressing gratitude,"" he arrives at the conclusion that they think he is a god. This incident says volumes more about Hitchens' attitude toward himself (or should I say Himself) than it does about the Sri Lankan men.Don't get me wrong: I love reading polemical texts, and this is about as polemical as you can get. And Hitchens is a highly entertaining, erudite, and amusing author -- the kind of guy who drives you bananas but that you secretly want to hang out with, just b/c he *does* say the most outrageous things. But like all polemical texts (including sacred ones!), this one lacks any kind of depth; it refuses to grapple with the complications and strangeness that make up life. It is the kind of book that an intelligent and rebellious 13-year old would love. It is the kind of book that a grown woman might buy and then place prominently on her bookshelf in advance of a maternal visit, just to raise her mother's blood pressure a little. (""What?! Don't you want to go to HEAVEN?!"") It is not the kind of book that imparts any kind of wisdom or knowledge or understanding. "
39,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5752569-sean-pagaduan,2,"Boring as hell.Yikes. The book is just a point-by-point smackdown on religion, almost on the level of Family Guy. Which sounds like I'm complimenting the book, but I'm not.This kind of highly sensationalist format is not exactly conducive to any sort of intellectual debate. Hitchens makes many excellent points on how religion is possibly dangerous in today's society, and how it possibly inspires people to kill or hate others. However, his book is marred by two main flaws:1. that it's poorly organized and steamrolls over logical fallacies on every page; and2. that it doesn't have the kind of research or statistical evidence you really need if you're going to make a claim like this.Maybe religion poisons a lot of things. Maybe it does poison everything. But does religion also do a lot of good? We don't know. And we don't know, because Mr. Hitchens isn't interested in discussing these kinds of things on a strictly logical or evidence-based level, which is bizarre, because he always seems to be championing logic and evidence. We see him making all kinds of causation fallacies, either/or fallacies, formal logic fallacies. What reasons he give are not backed up rigorously by enough evidence.Evidently, this is a lazy book for lazy people who can't be arsed to find more intellectual responses to common religious objections.(Bear in mind that I am, myself, an atheist, and that I think religion draws up terrible guidelines on ethics/morality. My bias should be /with/ Mr. Hitchens.)"
40,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1333893-shane,5," This book was recommended to me by a friend several times before I finally gave it a shot. I was a little wary from the title...I enjoy books about religion (and people's escapes from them), but don't have a lot of time for openly, anti-religious folks' emotional whining and ranting. To my pleasant surprise, Christopher Hitchens' book was a joy. Hitchens gradually found himself appalled by the amount of religiously-fueled atrocity on our planet. Our various religious leaders are constantly pointing to the amount of ""evil"" on earth as a sign of man's sinfulness (and demonic tampering), but Hitchens shows, in example after example, that most of the atrocities are carried out by these very religious people themselves. Nobody is spared here: Catholics, Protestants, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, on and on.  This book takes an objective look at history and modern life, and points its finger at every instance of war, injustice, persecution, genocide, slavery, racism, ethnic-cleansing, intolerance, child-molestation, etc...and notices that - without exception - these are always propagated by religious ideals. His conclusion is in the title: ""Religion poisons everything."" The one chapter where he loses my attention is his expose on evolution, and subsequent conclusion that these ""facts"" should be enough to silence all the religiously inclined. There are many people, like myself, who have no problem with the concept of evolution. As much as I have examined the evidence though, I see it as simply another theory lacking any hard evidence. It's handled almost religiously by scientists who, I think, sometimes forget that they are supposed to be scientific. (though Hitchens is not a scientist) For those who are decidedly non-evolutionists, this side-track will weaken Hitchens' overall case for you. Vice versa for those of you who embrace it. Personally, I think this book could have stood just as well (or even better) without it. His other information is difficult to argue with, so this just gives his detractors something to nit-pick about. Hitchen's has an immensely enjoyable writing style, with an elegantly flowing prose resting upon a razor-sharp wit. I had to re-read countless passages many times simply because I was amazed his ability to construct such poignant and humorous sentences.  If you're heavily religious (I know some Christians are fond of saying they're not religious at all. If you are, and that is your stance, then I'm talking SPECIFICALLY to YOU), this book is not for you! You will be offended. This is a book for open-minded people who believe that - if humans are to continually progress - established institutions must be constantly re-examined, and ultimately discarded when they no longer serve their purpose. "
41,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/945136-william,4,"What a book. Its so hard to review a book who's author is both an enormous intellectual and an equally enormous ahole. I certainly would recommend it to every believer and think it will shake their foundations. But like every fanatic and believe me Hitchens is as fanatical in his atheism as any fundamentalist preacher, he overreaches. He spends chapters propositioning that communism is a new religion yet says nothing about the dominate economic worldwide system of capitalism?? He talks only briefly about MLK jr but doesn't see the unique position of the Black church in America? Hitchens was an unabashed supporter of the Iraqi invasion and America's illegal occupation and destruction of that cradle of civilization but...not a peep against the religion of oil money and its gas pumping temples on very American street corner?! But alas Hitchens picks easy targets and extrapolates, makes spurious connections and uses circular logic but damn if you won't leave this book saying that yes, religion poisons (and here is the qualifier) damn near everything! "
42,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13946677,2," There is a common thing in all of the anti-God-and-religion books, which is the misunderstanding of some of the major points and ideas in religions, especially Islam. For example, in this book Hitchens says that in Islam, and according to the Koran, apostasy is punishable by death.This is actually wrong! Koran never said that apostasy is punishable by death! In fact, apostasy has no consequences in the Koran. On the contrary, according to the Koran, people are free to believe whatever they want! There is no punishment whatsoever. The major problems with Hitchens and other atheist writers is that they write about Islam without really understanding it or even reading the Koran fully and thoroughly. They confuse many personal beliefs of some Islamic groups with the Koran.Generally speaking, this book has many good points. But the amount of bullshit is still much greater!  "

One is relieved to draw a breath free of a wheeze, or walk across the floor with an unstiffened knee and ride a bike without pain from a pinched nerve interfering. One is grateful that no calls have come that day from sons informing him of distress, or worse; and that no surprise bill or summons or audit has arrived in the post. One is glad to be free, to be working for himself, to be rid of the incessant demands of others. In short, it is a good thing to be free to live, to read, to think, to ply my trade, to travel unimpeded and to freely associate as I may, without any authority, or any otherwise affiliated agents emboldened by the narrow dictates of archaic holy writ telling me what I can and can't do.Increasingly, though, in other parts of the world, and, alarmingly, in this country where I live (the United States), regressive theocratic doctrine has spread like a stubborn virus, invading those not inoculated by reason. As a result, centuries-old oppression that it seemed we had finally gotten rid of has roared back to interfere with our lives, to dictate our politics and resources, to lower our standard of living, to threaten our health and well-being, and to work in tandem with corporations and corrupt governments to achieve very limited and limiting ends, piggybacking with the imperatives of oligarchy. Altruism and progressivism are under attack from an odd, religion-backed form of social Darwinism; the anti-Christian Christianity; the forces of anti-learning, and anti-thinking. It is an infuriating development, and its incremental encroachment seems to have left too many people unsure of what to do about it, and seemingly hamstrung to fight it.What I do know, and what Christopher Hitchens' book makes me realize even more, is how much more I feel the oppressive added weight thrust upon me by the unwanted and undeserved increasing influence of religion. Those influences and decisions are not just benign and individual to the faithful; they affect the entire social polity and threaten my freedoms, and they disrespect and undermine my own high capacity for tolerance; a tolerance I am more willing to afford to them than is afforded me back.So, now, separation of church and state -- designed to protect church, protect state, and to protect those who have the right to a secular government, guaranteed, and, indeed, to protect the rights of the faithful to practice -- is tossed on the fire. We have the right to freedom from religion as well as the right to practice same, but in our own spheres. But ""freedom of religion"" court rulings and laws say otherwise. Now, you can deny to serve people you don't like, and not just refuse them wedding cakes, but government documents, too, if the Jesus-shrouded government clerk who is supposed to serve every taxpaying citizen decides that she doesn't like your life choice. Now you can drive around and see brazenly writ on church signs slogans espousing political issues, candidates or parties -- a common sight especially in the South -- and what politician down there is enforcing what is a blatant violation of tax laws? Now, because of a stupid craft store, workers can be denied certain health benefits because of the CEO's religion, and on and on. Potential cures that might someday save one of my family members, or me, from a horrific disease are not being developed now because some half-breed jowly hick in Mississippi who doesn't know shit from shinola doesn't like certain tissues being used in medical research. Where does this shit end? When a politician boldly says he loves the poorly educated, does it not alarm you?Hitchens' main objective in this book is to argue against the validity of religion, and does so by showing with ample examples how it poisons everything in pursuit of its perpetuation. More to the point, he picks apart its baseless and contradictory assertions and its dubious foundations, and proves through logic their absurdities. It is a book of slow-burning intensity, loose, yet methodical; impertinent and provocative.Hitchens was an advocate and masterful practitioner of letters and the essay, and this book feels like an extended essay; even a blue-book exam he dashed off in a moment of inspiration. It is an idiosyncratic work, more than an ""as-the-crow-flies"" coherent argument; Hitchens nonetheless scores in the particulars, and this one of those passionate one-offs that wins on points rather than by being a truly definitive freethought manifesto. The interweaving of autobiographical tidbits lends personality and gives the thing the flavor of testimonial, but it also smacks of the anecdotal, and that can have the effect of distracting and watering down an argument. But Hitchens rightly understood that we are fascinated by him, and his ego ever obligeth. I listened to the audiobook, with Hitchens himself reading it, because one of the undoubted pleasures of considering any of his arguments is to actually hear him say them, in that sardonic rich and devilish English voice.Needless to say, as an agnostic, I come to this as someone wholly in agreement with Hitchens' assertions and conclusions. But, in the realm of books covering rational atheistic argument, this is just part of a complete breakfast -- certainly one of the livelier parts; perhaps the zesty orange slice pick-me-up. What's most important is that Hitchens is mind-massaging, rather than mind-numbing. It is religion that achieves the latter state.One of Hitchens' strengths -- one in which he was superior to most other activist and non-activist freethinkers and atheists -- was his knowledge of scripture and the belief systems of various religions, not to mention history and social currents. He knew the value in debate of knowing the enemy better than they knew themselves. I also appreciated Hitchen's pithy and clear explanations of several sectarian wars -- including the Bosnian War and Lebanese Civil War -- that are often hard for the neophyte to pin down. Hitchens lived the aphorism, ""travel broadens the mind,"" and in this, we hear the experience of a man who has been on the ground with people of all faiths, in civil engagement, unlike the polarized cliques and close-minded fellow travelers who shout into walls.Even so, I did wince at times while listening to this. Hitchens' arrogance was earned; the man was a master logician and an unbeatable debater. But, as sharp and pithy as he could be, he also had a penchant for twisting the knife once it had been thrust deeply inside. Capping his arguments with cheap shots after winning the point seems unsportsmanlike, perhaps even petty. And he couldn't resist a joke or ironic remark, as though his objective was not just to make a strong case, but to show every side of his prismatic sardonic intelligence. This was the Hitchens way. It was an entertaining way, but did it serve the cause as effectively as it should? I wonder.I'm torn about a rating. My heart says four but my head says three. Since this book is ostensibly about the head, this rating might be said to be in the ""spirit"" of things. Hitchens would no doubt rip into my logic. Were it possible to bring him back, his ripping into me would be music to my ears.Although Dawkins and Hitchens have gotten the attention in recent years as freethought gurus, I'm putting in a plug for the forgotten but irrepressible Robert Ingersoll; his works from a century ago on freethought (usually available in the form of compendiums of his speeches) still set the high-bar standard, and are worth anyone's investigation.A good introduction to Ingersoll is: What's God Got to Do with it? Robert Ingersoll on Free Thought, Honest Talk & the Separation of Church & State, at: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8...(KevinR@Ky 2016)"
44,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3803671-ivonne-rovira,4,"I believe that Christopher Hitchens' book god is not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything [capitalization in the original] merits four stars; however, with a book such as this, the rating is really beside the point. Those who will enjoy this provocative book know who they are; those who will not even be able to finish the first chapter know who they are.Like the McCarthyite Ann Coulter, Hitchens' steadfast purpose is to preach to the choir. From the deliberately confrontational use of the lower-case ""god"" for the deity to chapter titles like ""The Evil of the 'New' Testament,"" ""Religion as Original Sin,"" and ""Is Religion Child Abuse?"" it's pretty clear Hitchens has no intention of trying to convert (pardon the pun) anyone. True believers, whether Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist, needn't bother, as they'll simply feel insulted.That said, Hitchens' painstakingly researched tome gives plenty of food for thought for atheists or agnostics or simply those interested in well-crafted if contrarian argument. Admonitions that religion, at any rate, makes humans behave themselves fall somewhat flat in light of Catholic priests cooperating with genocide in Rwanda (and remaining shielded by the Vatican), the atrocities of the Taliban, and the Christian fundamentalist Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda.But the best part is that Hitchens, as ever, pens the most marvelous turns of phrase. Take this on page 67, for example: ""Many religions now come before us with ingratiating smirks and outspread hands, like an unctuous merchant in a bazaar. They offer consolation and solidarity and uplift, competing as they do in a marketplace. But we have a right to remember how barbarically they behaved when they were strong and were making an offer that people could not refuse. And if we chance to forget what that must have been like, we have only to look to those states and societies where the clergy still has the power to dictate its own terms."" Who can read such lines without an inward smile? "
45,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58564-joshua,2,"I suspected that the recently invigorated debate over secularism vs. religion was the most boring topic on earth, and I feel vindicated after reading this book. Christopher Hitchens is a pompous asshole. This actually makes him an appropriate author for the subject, though. When people debate religion in such stark terms they are pretty much always just trying to score cheap points. Hitchens does this one better by managing to write in a way that is offensive even when you agree with him. UPDATEWhile I found this book sort of infuriating to read, several events that happened on the day I finished it make me wonder whether I was too harsh. First, a Hasidic man pursued me on the street, trying to wrap me in tefillin because he thought that G-d wanted him to. Then my Muslim cab driver berated me for working for the company that I do, telling me that he didn't want to take my blood money and that I would have trouble in the afterlife. Of course, he waited to tell me this until he had already taken my blood money, and my blood tip. So, Hitchens might be an asshole, but so are the people he's ranting against. And at least he's right. "
46,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2846441-karla,5,"Relisten of Jan 2016. My opinion hasn't diminished one jot. Hitch is my happy place. *____*Original review: Since I'm already more or less squarely where Hitchens stands on the issue of religion, I read this purely to enjoy the author's way with the written word. And since I instead listened to the audiobook with Hitchens narrating, needless to say, it was a great experience."
47,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5717792-scott-rhee,5,"Depending on the type of day I'm having, I would agree with the sentiment behind the title of Christopher Hitchens's book ""God is not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything"". There is no irony in Hitchens's title, other than the fact that Hitchens does not actually believe in God. This book is his atheist manifesto, and it is quite good. As someone who believes in God (sometimes) and considers myself a Christian, I honestly did not want to agree with much of Hitchens's book, but I have to be honest: I actually did agree with much of Hitchens's book.I've never really hid my disdain for organized religion, even when I was a church-goer. Mostly, I kept my mouth shut, because most if not all of my friends are Christian, and I do not like to piss off my friends. My Christian friends are good people, and I love them all, but we have had disagreements in the past over doctrinal matters, biblical interpretation, issues of faith, etc. I'm sure many of them reading this now are not totally surprised by what I'm saying or what I'm about to say. They have seen or heard indications of all this before, just perhaps never this blatant or upfront.Hitchens's main argument (a fair one, in my opinion) is that faith itself---especially a blind, uncritical faith---is the root cause of nearly every atrocity committed in history. The countless pogroms, massacres, revolutions, and wars that have been initiated in the name of God, Allah, or whatever Deity happens to be in fashion at the time are all due to a strict, unbending belief system that refuses to accept the existence of a dissenting opinion and engenders hatred and intolerance toward anyone who challenges said belief system in any way. Anyone who has ever read a history book can see the accuracy in that argument. What about all the good things that churches do, though? What about all the good things that have come about by faith? One might ask, and Hitchens himself asks the questions. Hitchens seems to think that the good that churches and people of faith provide are done regardless of, or in spite of, their faith. Atheists, he argues, have done good things, too. Good deeds, charity, compassion---these are not strictly the domain of the religious and faithful. I can't argue with that. What about the violence and atrocity that has been committed by atheists and secularists? One might ask. Fair enough, according to Hitchens, who has a chapter in the book titled ""An Objection Anticipated: The Last-Ditch ""Case"" Against Secularism"" in which he examines the secularist totalitarian regimes of the 20th century, namely those of Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin. Totalitarian governments are, in essence, religions that have merely substituted God with a living human dictator. They have been in existence for centuries. ""For most of human history,"" Hitchens writes, ""the idea of the total or absolute state was intimately bound up with religion. A baron or king might compel you to pay taxes or serve in his army, and he would usually arrange to have priests on hand to remind you that this was your duty, but the truly frightening despotisms were those which also wanted the contents of your heart and your head. Whether we examine the oriental monarchies of China or India or Persia, or the empires of the Aztec or the Incas, or the medieval courts of Spain and Russia and France, it is almost unvaryingly that we find that these dictators were also gods, or the heads of churches. More than obedience was owed them: any criticism of them was profane by definition, and millions of people lived and died in pure fear of a ruler who could select you for a sacrifice, or condemn you to eternal punishment, on a whim."" Hitler and Stalin merely carried on the tradition. Hitchens's own argument against secularism, though, ends up supporting his own argument for how toxic religion can become.Despite the cogency of Hitchens's argument, I still believe in God, and his arguments can not take away a person's individual story on how he or she came to find God (Every believer---myself included---has one, and they are personal and powerful), but I don't believe Hitchens wants to do that. I believe that Hitchens's point is to convince himself and other atheists about the rightness and rationality of their belief in the non-existence of God. And it is rational, because God is irrational. It's crazy to believe in God. I wonder sometimes if my belief in God is real or simply a security blanket that I'm afraid to give up. Does God exist, or is He just a binky? Who knows? No one, and I believe that is part of Hitchens's point. No one can convince anyone that God exists.I'm still not sure what kind of God I believe in, and I doubt I ever will. I'm not sure if I believe in a God that still has any impact on the world today. I think my God may be the Nietzchean God that has either died or gone off to a far corner of the universe to play Xbox for eternity, and He has ceased to give a shit about us all. My childhood image of the warm, fuzzy God that intervenes occasionally to help us or create miracles or answer the occasional prayer is all but dwindled away to nothing. Still, the belief persists. Much like a security blanket."
48,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22409011-brendan-monroe,5,"What to say about the incomparable 'God is Not Great' other than that it is perhaps the paramount text on religion of the many recently written? How about that Hitchens is on fire here, directing the full weight of his righteous fury to an issue that has, in ways big and small, touched all of our lives. True to its title, 'God Is Not Great' is written primarily to appeal to the reader's moral impulses as to why God, in all of his various storied forms, ""Is Not Great"". In this way Hitchens' text differs from the anti-religious one offered by fellow New Atheist Richard Dawkins in his 'The God Delusion', which, also true to its title, is primarily interested in combating the very idea of God in the first place. Hitchens generally used the label ""Anti-Theist"" before that of ""Atheist"" when describing himself and his book reflects a similar order. Of course, Hitchens' was under no illusion that there was a God, but his main interest seems to have been combating believers on an even touchier issue than God's very existence, that is, why the God of the Bible, Koran, and various other ""sacred"" texts wouldn't be a ""good"" God anyway. This also explains why Hitchens debated believers as often as he did, whereas Richard Dawkins refuses the very idea, arguing that engaging such nonsense on the same stage potentially lends it a certain validity.While I loved 'The God Delusion' my style is more akin to Hitchens, that is to say, my preference for debate is focused similarly on why God would be such a tyrannical a-hole if he did exist (though I harbor no illusions on this point). As a result, 'God Is Not Great' is my preferred text of the two.The question that the book then centers on is the one posed by the illuminative Greek Philosopher Epicurus who, speaking of God, says;“Is he willing to prevent evil but not able? Then is he impotent. Is he able but not willing? Then is he malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Whence then is evil?”I've yet to hear any satisfying defense of this simple, yet perfectly posed question. Along the way Hitchens touches on the usual array of religious evil, from the Catholic Church's support of Fascism and Nazism long after the embers of Auschwitz had been ignited to the spread of herpes and deaths caused by rabbis performing male circumcision on babies, and the disgusting prevalence of female genital mutilation throughout much of the Muslim world. Perhaps the most horrific evil of all though, something that once and for all betrays religion for the foul thing it, is the indoctrination of children into its orders. Anyone who makes the claim that religion isn't evil has very likely performed this evil on their own children or otherwise closed their eyes to it. Hitchens calls this brainwashing what it is- child abuse. Systematic and cruel not because it damages their physical bodies (though it certainly has) but because it damages their emotional ones by shattering children's innocence and preying on their natural gullibility. Imagine (if you're lucky enough not to have experienced it) the guilt and anguish wrought by a fear of eternal torment in hell in the form of a small child (bad enough in a grown adult) and you'd have to have bought the lie not to see the harm done.A rousing call to arms delivered by one of morality's foremost champions, 'God Is Not Great' is one of the best, and most important, books ever written."

Having been indoctrinated as a child, it took me almost 4 decades to come to terms with reality because I was literally scared to death of burning in Hell for ever and ever and ever by a loving God who might get pissed if I failed to obey and love him. Fortunately, the poison has been cleansed from my mind in time that I have been able to prevent my children from falling prey to the horrible curse of religion. Works like this one, which would have been a death sentence to read or write in our not too distant past are helping mankind to move into the right direction. There were some moments throughout the book where Hitchens droned on with a lot of mundane, detailed info on particular examples involving different people and elements of religions. If not for that, this would have merited 5 stars. "

Because of its content and tone, this book is likely to resonate with the non-believer while alienating or angering the believer, though it should be noted that Hitchens was famous for winning the respect, if not changing the minds, of his most staunch adversaries.Would recommend to anyone who is interested in challenging the premise of the most established religions, including their supposed monopoly on morality. "
51,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28470777-mackey,5,"Having read other works by Hitchens I knew I would enjoy the book and I did. What I did not expect, after so many years of religious study, was to learn something new. I did. Unlike so many others in the science field, Hitchens bases his arguments against religion and deity worship from a philosophical and historical starting point. In my opinion, that is exactly where one should begin. He makes his case with a biting wit that I appreciate. It also allows his work to more easily readable for the masses who need it most. I highly recommend this book to all, especially for those who think it is blasphemy. "

However the robustness of Hitchins’s arguments and the points he hammers home, gave even a hardened religious cynic like myself a great deal to ponder on. Taking no hostages, he attacks the tenants of Judaism, Chtristianity, Islam and the Eastern faiths, and the terrible consequences of violence and the stifling of intellectual development he sees stemming from them. I’m also an English literature graduate and so his demolishing of the various texts and the flaws within them (the changing of narrator, the contradictions, the fact that they’re so historically inaccurate and clearly can’t have been written anytime near the era in which they apparently transpired) was something else which was always rings my bell.The problem though with this kind of book is that it can be overwhelmingly dogmatic. The central point is smashed into the ground again and again and again – and undoubtedly these points do need to be stated loud and often – but even for someone on the same wavelength it can be exhausting. Still Hitchins does write like a dream, and even if it probably won’t convert a true believer, there are a lot of arguments here that are hard to just dismiss."

But I can’t think many Christians would pick this up and have some revelation. The sensationalized title alone is enough to turn folks off. Hitchens quickly shows that he’s an angry atheist and that’s just not who I am. I’m glad I read it, but glad it’s over. "

One must state it plainly. Religion comes from a period of human prehistory where nobody had the smallest idea what was going on. It comes from the bawling and fearful infancy of our species, and is a babyish attempt to meet our inescapable demand for knowledge (as well as for comfort, reassurance, and other infantile needs).
I don't argue with the above quote -- I'm not an overly religious person -- but there was something in Christopher Hitchens' tone in God is Not Great that got my back up (maybe it was the frequent use of puerile insults like ""babyish"" to describe the faithful) and, instead of always listening carefully to this audiobook, I kept distractedly framing counterarguments and I may as well begin with one: It would be very easy for me to write a book called Love is not Great : How Marriage Poisons Everything. I could have chapters on Bluebeard-type serial wife killers and on Warren Jeffs marrying off young girls to lecherous old goats. I could write at length about abused spouses who feel trapped in their marriages. Dowries and polygamy and Henry VIII -- it would be fairly easy to paint marriage as a social custom whose time has passed, a left-over of pre-Enlightenment thinking. And while, yes, there are extreme and terrible things that can be done within and in the name of ""marriage"", I wouldn't throw the baby out with the bathwater -- religion and marriage are found in all cultures, they are among what the Anthropologist Donald Brown calls Human Universals, and I believe that they are both social goods, stabilising forces, and if they're seen by some to be as vestigial and useless as my floppy pink appendix, to me they still satisfy whatever they are meant to in my lizard brain. I believe that the fact that both religion and marriage are in decline in our western society can be seen in the various ways that our society itself appears to be in decline.Hitchens spends a lot of time pointing out the contradictions within and outright fallacies of the various religious texts, and this was nothing new to me -- with respect to Saint Gabriel and the Holy Spirit, these books were written by mere mortal men after all. He also spends a lot of time describing extreme practises that the average person would be revolted by (female genital mutilation and the Hassidic practise of having the Rabbi remove a circumcised foreskin with his mouth) and instances of systemic rot (the Catholic cover-up of child rape and North Korea's ""necrocracy""). He points out that various models of religious good works, like Gandhi or Mother Teresa or Martin Luther King Jr, were not actually such good people after all. And again, none of this was news to me -- these are all the actions of people and people are capable of doing terrible things; especially people with power; and in many cases, religion is power. But I don't think that Hitchens makes his case that all religion is bad. To use his own example: A Sudanese cabdriver went to great lengths to return a large sum of money to the author and was offended when he was offered a reward -- he explained that his Muslim faith prevented him from profiting from doing the right thing. And while Hitchens was amazed by this, I think that the vast majority of religious people -- those who humbly follow the Ten Commandments/the Golden Rule/the Five Pillars/whatever basic precepts have stood the test of time -- are well-meaning non-fanatics. Again, the problem with organised religion is the ways in which the people in power corrupt the message.
 Our belief is not a belief. Our principles are not a faith. We do not rely soley upon science and reason, because these are necessary rather than sufficient factors, but we distrust anything that contradicts science or outrages reason. We may differ on many things, but what we respect is free inquiry, openmindedness, and the pursuit of ideas for their own sake.
After making that statement, asserting that the New Atheism is in no way a religion itself, Hitchens calls on Charles Darwin a dozen times, using his theory of Natural Selection and the resulting theory of Evolution as absolute proof that there could not have been a creator God (in a manner that sounded to me like Darwin's was the only true gospel) . I wonder, then, what Hitch would have made of his fellow atheist Thomas Nagel's recent book Mind Cosmos that argues that the theory of Evolution can't explain human consciousness and should therefore be considered invalid or at least incomplete. Just this week, a group of scientists and intellectuals proposed that Evolution be one among many outdated beliefs that should be retired. Similar arguments could be made against the theories of Freud and Einstein, both of whom Hitchens also treats as canonical to his worldview. With the undeniably wicked deeds done in the name of organised religions, I certainly wouldn't try to make a case for their infallibility, but the onus here was on Hitchens to prove his thesis -- that God is not great and that religion poisons everything -- and I think he fell short. As I said, I'm not religious, but when I attend Midnight Mass and the choir is filling the vaulted ceiling with the soaring minor chords that I can feel in my bones, when the incense is burning and the candles are flickering, as I'm surrounded by hundreds of other people who have come together in a communal act of worship and praise -- the feeling of awe and belonging that I experience is unmatched by any secular experience that I know. Religion has endured because religion is necessary to the human psyche -- the rot is in the all too human actions of self-interested religious leaders.Two things that I found very interesting: Hitchens' apparently original conclusion that ancient sanctions against eating pork was a guard against cannibalism (I've heard of the ""long pork"" many times) and his reference to the Gospel of Judas.Christopher Hitchens was a noted intellectual and a fearsome debater -- I would no doubt have been a stammering jellyfish in his presence -- but on a topic like this that he was so passionate about, I expected more.And in a final aside for my own remembrance, at one point Hitchens sneers: It could be argued that (Moses) preferred to speak of himself in the third person, though this habit is now well associated with megalomania. And although Hitchens died before Joseph Anton was published, I wonder what he would have made of his great friend Salman Rushdie's use of the megalomaniac third person in his own memoir."

Religion has run out of justifications. Thanks to the telescope and the microscope, it no longer offers an explanation of anything important.
I had been wondering what to expect from this seminal atheist treatise by the late great Hitchens. What I found is that it is exactly what it claims to be: a treatise on how religion poisons everything. ""Everything"" is hyperbolic, of course. Religion doesn't poison the small sweet personal moments in life: snuggling with my warm dog, marveling at my amazing children, thrilling at the first spring flowers. But it sure poisons all the big social stuff. And he is even-handed - every major religion is excoriated (defunct religions such as Zoroastrianism and Aztec ceremonies are mentioned occasionally; smaller religions such as Wicca, Asatru, Druidism, and aboriginal beliefs are not mentioned at all).This isn't really against belief, per se. Hitchens basically says: believe what you want (and allow me to believe - or not believe - as I want), but don't fool yourself thinking that religion does no harm. Here I will list many of the ways in which organized religion does A LOT of harm.My first impressions:1. I don't love Hitchens' writing style, it's a bit overwrought and highfalutin. 2. I love what Hitchens has to say, and I love that he is saying things I've been thinking/feeling/experiencing.3. This is basically the same book as The God Delusion, just written by a different witty British blowhard.I did eventually become accustomed to Hitch's style, or - and I think this is more likely, now that I've read other reviews - his writing style improved after the first chapter (and really my issues may have had more to do with my expectation that Hitchens would be a supercilious asshole, rather than any actual deficiency in the writing; I mean, I think many can agree that he was an asshole).Chock full of fun and pithy quotes, such as:
The occasion [of Y2K] was nothing more than an odometer for idiots, who sought the cheap thrill of impending doom.
and
Augustine was a self-centered fantasist and an earth-centered ignoramus ...
and
One must state it plainly. ... [Religion] comes from the bawling and fearful infancy of our species, and is a babyish attempt to meet our inescapable demand for knowledge (as well as for comfort, reassurance, and other infantile needs.)
I loved this so much I'm considering buying a copy to keep at home (I have so many old books, I don't buy many these days, no more shelf space! I'm a library girl.) This is an important and useful book, for anyone interested in comparing the major religions, and for anyone who feels the need of help in defending against religion. On the other hand, if you are religious and don't want to see your religion criticized, don't get this book. But I suppose that already goes without saying."
56,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/361370-anna,2,"Christopher Hitchens is like the intellectual version of Michael Moore. I first heard of him by way of Charlie Rose: http://www.charlierose.com/shows/2002... I found him to be extreme and slightly outrageous, which was not disproven by my reading of this book.It's not that I disagree with what he says, because I don't. But I am not impressed with his attempt to attack and dismantle the value of ""faith"". Religion, maybe, but he is an atheist who finds faith itself to be wholly unreasonable, irrelevant, and infantile.Hitchens is obviously extremely well-read and I appreciate the scholarly research that went into this endeavor, as well as the natural talent that he obviously has for argument. However, my two main criticisms are these:One, I don't think it is useful to deprive people of faith. Faith, just like reason, is another human capacity that should be appreciated and admired, whether it leads to good or to bad (usually both, as most human qualities do). Second, I get the feeling that the whole book is Hitchens' opportunity to rant and rave and make all religious people feel foolish. Which is not nice or constructive. He presents only the negative, so his book does not come off in any way as balanced. And he cannot help himself with a few snide comments here and there in paretheses, which I find only adds bitterness to his arguments. His point can be found (finally) in the last chapter entitled: The Need for a New Enlightenment. After 280 pages of ranting, he finally says something constructive:""...in our hands and within our view is a whole universe of discovery and clarification, which is a pleasure to study in itself, gives the average person access to insights that not even Darwin or Einstein possessed, and offers the promise of near-miraculous advances in healing, in energy, and in peaceful exchange between different cultures. Yet millions of people in all societies still prefer the myths of cave and the tribe and the blood sacrifice.""And, despite my harsh criticism of this book, I think he is absolutely right."
57,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/182193-radhika,4,"In the recent past, I have read a couple of books which make the case for atheism as the only reasonable path for a thinking person. Of these, Hitchens' is the most well-written and engaging book which is divided into multiple short essays on various issues such as eastern religions, the pig taboo... This keeps the reader better engaged than for instance Dawkins' book which seems to lose steam midway.Hitchens' book does seem to contain some strange inaccuracies but perhaps these are forgivable in a work that purports to be in-progress. For instance, the flag of India doesn't sport Gandhi's spinning wheel. It does have a wheel but it derives from a different source unrelated to M.K. Gandhi. I do believe that pre-Independence (1947) India had a version of the flag which sported the spinning wheel of Gandhi. (Hitchens will also be glad to know that many Indians tend to agree with his opinion of Gandhi and he is not a universally loved figure inside India. That said, we need to separate his politics and from his religion.)A reviewer here on gr complains about his hubris in believing that the Sri Lankans who accompanied him saw in him god reincarnated after his presence saved their lives (an incident mentioned in the book). People in South Asia are quite prone to do this and I am quite certain his account of this event is not colored by his ego.Dawkins' in his book is quite accepting of pan-theism and eastern religions in general. In fact, he is quite clear that his beef is with the dominant mono-theistic trio. Hitchens' on the other hand doesn't really spare any religion. However, his grasp of eastern religions is definitely weaker than of ""western"" religions.Eastern religions have a lot that is wrong with them that can be laid bare incisively. Siddharta, who was born a Hindu, and became an atheist is one of the earliest figures we know by name, who rebelled against religion and ritual. Of course, we and our penchant for gods and religion, turned him into a god and now buddhism isn't any better than a religion."
58,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,Filled with interesting stories about religious excess. I admire the courage it took to write and publish this book. 
59,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,3,"Perhaps it suffered from my having first read Richard Dawkin's The God Delusion and Sam Harris' The End of Faith, but I found myself having to make an effort to finish this book. It's not like I disagreed with his contentions that the religious impulse has plagued mankind since the very beginning, engendering ignorance, fear, repression, intimidation, and endless religious disputes. It has also wasted the mental energies of generations of thinkers, and one can only speculate what great discoveries could have arisen in religion's absence. Hitchens takes a hatchet to all the absurd contentions of the world's three major monotheistic religions, Christianity, Islam and Judaism, but certainly doesn't spare the older pantheistic religions, along with the Eastern religions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Shinto, and some bizarre modern offshoots like Mormonism (a religion no more credible than L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology, which has somehow amassed great power despite being founded by an obvious crackpot).Hitchens hits all the right notes if you are an atheist, and I understand he is a fierce and convincing debater regarding religion and faith. Of course he is preaching to the choir (irony fully intended), and I doubt many religious believers could get through the book unless the plan on challenging each of his arguments. And the title should make it clear that he has an axe to grind; the tone of the book is sour and exasperated as one might expect from ""God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything."" And he draws upon a never-ending stream of examples of absurd, contradictory, and repressive ideas from the various religions that hold sway over a good portion of the planet's population. He knows his stuff, and I commend his efforts to delve into religious texts and use them to undermine their credibility.Perhaps I am simply saddened to think that despite both the common sense arguments he puts forward and more technical philosophical points, mankind continues to remain in thrall to religion. And since the book relentlessly catalogs all the failings and fallout from religious beliefs, it's all a bit depressing. So I can't blame Hitchens for that. But it still becomes a chore to read. Dawkin's approach is more closely linked to his scientific research into evolutionary biology, while Sam Harris just seems more focused and fierce.Nonetheless, I appreciate the efforts that Hitchens has made to counter the foolish arguments on behalf of religion's benefits to society and mankind. I certainly wouldn't want to slog through all those old religious texts, and am glad he's done it for us. Yes, it would be more convincing if everyone were to read the texts they believe to be wrong, but frankly I can't imagine wasting my precious time struggling through the Old and New Testaments, Koran, Talmud, Book of Mormon, etc.One thing I've learned in life is that debating politics and religion get you absolutely nowhere, and create a lot of bad feelings, so I have great respect for someone like Hitchens who has dedicated himself to doing that very thing, unpleasant and exhausting though it must be."
60,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5032308-rb,5,"Great atheist manifesto! My review will be added in the future after I have re-read it again. Edit Sept. 7th 2011:This book is a real eye-opener and puts religion in a different perspective, and it's not a rosy perspective that he comes with. One of the many things that I like about this book is that it's doesn't say ""X religion is better than Y religion"", I like that it's not tainted like that. He doesn't try to take side and find out which is religionis the lesser evil. Hitchens is an Atheist (just like I am) and he doesn't try to paint a neutral picture or be neutral/soft in his opinions. He really gets in your face with his real-life examples and prose. If you get offended (for lack of a better word) when people criticize your faith, then this book is probably not the best one to start with.Writing this makes me think of this piece of lyrics written by Marilyn Manson:I never really hated a one true godbut the god of the people I hated - which I interpret as that the problem is neither ""God"" or ""Religion"" per se, but rather what the people/followers choose to do with it. I find this rather spot on, and in a way this is also what I believe Hitchens is trying to say."
61,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,3,"This book has a very anti tone to it. Not just atheism but anti religion. Which is fine, I think he makes enough points to justify this in some ways, and I understand his need to make his stance clear when he is up against so much. I still don't know if I like the approach though, at least for me I take a more passive view towards religion. I understand many of its evils, and I agree that in many instances you have to draw a firm line, still we live in a world with the religious, and I have kind of a personality of generally liking to get along. In the instances where Religion imposses on me, I will make a stance to have them back off, but to be anti for the sake of it, is not particularly my style. I though the book the End of Faith, though similar had a slightly better foothold. "
62,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/222551-becca,1,"This book reads like a long, sometimes incoherent, rant. I mostly found myself hating Christopher Hitchens while reading it, especially during the times when he argues that it's biological destiny for men to want to masturbate all the time, kind of purports a pro-life stance, equates the physical & psychological trauma of female genital mutilation to male circumcision, and reduces the problems in Iraq to simply issues of religion. Frankly, if you are looking for a thoughtful book on atheism and/or religion, this is not it. If you are a 12 year old boy and really pissed off at religion, this is the book for you."
63,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1787149-eugene,1,"You can always tell the strength of an argument by its composition.Hitchens, a brilliant man by all respects, even if I tend to disagree with many of his stances has put together one of the WEAKEST arguments for atheism that is current available.1/5 of the book is an intellectual argument against religion, but then for the last 4/5, he relegates himself to mindless vitriol...allowing the conclusion to define his logic, rather than letting the logic define his conclusion.Because bad things have been done in religions name is NOT a proper argument against God, nor the existence of Religion itself."
64,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1419644-kathleen,1,"He is just too shrill in this book to be taken seriously. As an atheist, I found myself angry that he used such flimsy ""proof"" under the guise of ""as we all know"" and ""as anyone can see"" when it was far from evident that he was adequately supporting his case.I highly recommend Love, Poverty and War, a collection of essays. His excoriation of Mother Teresa is more interesting and convincing, in my opinion."

Feel free to skip around, each chapter stands independently. The psychological relief and social cohesion religion may provide is far outweighed by its brazen and profuse mendacity and coercion, which is now spared us only because of religious institutions’ weakening power. The danger of revival is real, and the tragedy of religious government in islamic states lingers.Religion is man-made, and I’m so grateful that Madison, Franklin, Paine and Jefferson (miraculously) created America as a secular nation, paving the way for global leadership. They could see the disaster religion was for old Europe and they wanted none of the baggage. Searing and tight chapters on religious violence and barbarism, and on the obvious fraudulence of the bible, koran and other “words of god” are both effective and entertaining. Hitchens’ call for a renewed Enlightenment (p283), by each and every one of us, is inspiring and empowering.“Religion comes from the period of human prehistory where nobody – not even the mighty Democritus who concluded that all matter was made from atoms – had the smallest idea what was going on. It comes from the bawling and fearful infancy of our species, and is a babyish attempt to meet our inescapable demand for knowledge (as well as for comfort, reassurance, and other infantile needs). Today the least educated of my children knows much more about the natural order than any of the founders of religion, and one would like to think [...] this is why they seem so uninterested in sending fellow humans to hell.” (p64)Love this shout-out to the value of seeking Truth: “The true value of a man is not determined by his possession, supposed or real, of Truth, but rather by his sincere exertion to get to the Truth. It is not the possession of the Truth, but rather the pursuit of Truth by which he extends his powers and in which his ever-growing perfectibility is to be found. Possession makes one passive, indolent and proud. If God were to hold all Truth concealed in his right hand, and in his left only the steady and diligent drive for Truth […] I would with all humility take the left hand. -Gotthold Lessing (1778)” (p277)This book effectively reaffirmed my commitment to atheism, as much as it reminded me that my wavering with “agnosticism” includes prodigious amounts of both appeasement to diversity and desperate wishful thinking. It is hard to accept that this precious consciousness I contain will disappear to nothing with my death, and that it has no lasting persistence or deeper mission/meaning. Yet, that is what we all are, and accepting transparent and ever shifting lies about it offers only the most minimal salve."
68,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4272284-kristina,4,"Christopher Hitchens’ god is not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything compliments the reader by assuming she is intelligent, open-minded, widely-read and interested in history. This is a good book to start with if you are questioning the need for religion or your own personal faith. Although I’d say it doesn’t discuss atheism as much as why religion is detrimental to humanity and should be abandoned along with the rest of our superstitious beliefs. For me, Hitchens is preaching to the choir. He doesn’t need to convince me that religious belief is entirely unnecessary to living a happy and fulfilling life and may actually stand in the way of that. I didn’t need all the historical evidence he has in the book but I was interesting to learn. Despite the subtitle being “how religion poisons everything,” I’d say the main thesis of the book is to prove that religion is man-made and because of this, imperfect, and has a tendency to “ruin everything.” Chapter by chapter, Hitchens examines the tradition of religious belief and explains why it is faulty and how we can do better. I think he actually works too hard for some of his examples by going into history when modern day abuses by religious authority figures and charlatans exist in such abundance. The idea that religions have been manufactured by humans to explain weather patterns, exert authority, maintain order, etc. and that we are now advanced enough (or should be!) to move on from such antiquated thinking should not be controversial. But it is. So you are either an open-minded person of faith and curious to read this book, or you’re someone who’s already moving away from religion and motivated to read the book for those reasons. But a prolonged review by me is not going convince someone to read this book who isn’t already interested so I’m going to let Hitchens speak for himself and quote some of the lines I liked:“God did not create man in his own image. Evidently, it was the other way about, which is the painless explanation for the profusion of gods and religions, and the fratricide both between and among faiths, that we see all about us and that has so retarded the development of civilization. Past and present religious atrocities have occurred not because we are evil, but because it is a fact of nature that the human species is, biologically, only partly rational” (8).“If you will devote a little time to studying the staggering photographs taken by the Hubble telescope, you will be scrutinizing things that are far more awesome and mysterious and beautiful—and more chaotic and overwhelming and forbidding—than any creation or “end of days” story. If you read Hawking on the “event horizon,” that theoretical lip of the “black hole” over which one could in theory plunge and see the past and the future (except that one would, regretfully and by definition, not have enough “time”), I shall be surprised if you can still go on gaping at Moses and his unimpressive “burning bush”…Now at last you can be properly humble in the face of your maker, which turns out not to be a “who,” but a process of mutation with rather more random elements than our vanity might wish. This is more than enough mystery and marvel for any mammal to be getting along with: the most educated person in the world now has to admit—I shall not say confess—that he or she knows less and less but at least knows less and less and more and more” (8-9).“It is absurd, even for a believer, to imagine that god should owe him an explanation. But a believer nonetheless takes on the impossible task of interpreting the will of a person unknown, and thus brings these essentially absurd questions upon himself” (268). “Religious faith is, precisely because we are still-evolving creatures, ineradicable. It will never die out, or at least not until we get over our fear of death, and of the dark, and of the unknown, and of each other. For this reason, I would not prohibit it even if I thought I could. Very generous of me, you may say. But will the religious grant me the same indulgence?” (11) (Definitely not.)god is not Great is a thought-provoking book. I think Christopher Hitchens was a pragmatic, sensible, incredibly intelligent man and my disagreements with this book have more to do with prose style and word choices (a whole lot of unnecessary “that”s) than his overall arguments. My path towards atheism evolved out of a rejection of my Christian upbringing. It always seemed to make no sense to me and the most faithful seemed to be the most hypocritical and cruel. Hitchens presents familiar arguments to me in new ways and presents me with new authors to read and for that, I thank him. "
69,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55881969-christopher-porzenheim,2,"Hitchens writes sexy sentences. But his flashy critique of religion only titillates. Hitchens over-ambitious title may not have been his choice. Perhaps it was a case of a publisher's priapism? His tirade may more honestly be re-titled: When Religion is a only a Matter of Faith: It Poisons Everything. He rarely if ever cites his many unsupported claims. Perhaps this doesn’t matter in a book that only seeks to attack unsupported claims? The contents of this book merit a single star. It’s witty words make it worth 2. I smiled more than once. If you can ignore what he says, there are more than a few zingers. But his arguments, unlike his vigorous prose, are rotten. The issue: religion is confused with faith or belief.For Hitchens, religions are “‘fossilized philosophies.’ or philosophy with the questions left out” (480) whose content is only about beliefs and theories. Religion simply wasn’t necessary. It is so much “junk dna” that happened by chance. Humanity could have proceeded to the present without religion, it was an unnecessary theory, an accident in the process of evolution. “A ‘theory’ is something evolved-if you forgive the expression-to fit the known facts. It is a successful theory if it survives the introduction of hitherto unknown facts. And it becomes an accepted theory if it can make accurate predictions about things or events that have not yet been discovered, or have not yet occurred. This can take time, and is also subject to a version of Ockham’s procedure: Pharaonic astronomers in Egypt could predict eclipses though they believed the earth to be flat: it just took them a great deal more unnecessary work. (144)“Voltaire was simply ludicrous when he said that if god did not exist it would be necessary to invent him. The human invention of god is the problem to begin with.” (164)“In regards to Gandhi’s involvement in India: “There was never any need for an obscurantist religious figure to impose his ego on the process and both retard and distort it. The whole case was complete without that assumption.” (318)“This lugubrious relationship was eventually to lead to Christianity (yet another Jewish heresy) and thus ineluctably to the birth of Islam. We could have been spared the whole thing. No doubt there would still have been much foolishness and solipsism. But the connection between Athens and history and humanity would not have been so sundered, and the Jewish people might have been the carriers of philosophy instead of arid monotheism, and the ancient schools and their wisdom would not have become prehistoric to us.” (477)Frederick Douglas, Abraham Lincoln, and Martin Luther King Jr are shown as men whose moral accomplishments were made in spite of their religious backgrounds.That's an amazing claim he never backs up. So far as I understood it, King's accomplishment was convincing the South that you couldn't be a 'Christian' and not support the Civil Rights Movement. If he weren't a Christian, I don't know how he could have outpreached his competitors!Well, in any case, we are left to imagine that without religions interference that Douglas, Lincoln and King would have made an even greater impact. Somehow....The fundamental flaw is that Hitchens doesn’t seem to realize that religion is not just about the beliefs in your head. Orthodoxy is not all religion. If this tongue lash of religions was limited to those that only care about orthodoxy he might have a point. It's probably for this reason that Hitchens instinctively focuses on the Abrahamic religions briefly dismissing the “Eastern Options.” But still, Hitchens is off base, purely orthodoxic religions hardly exist, except perhaps inside the heads of angry men like Hitchens who are too faithful that other believers are too credulous.I like a good lampoon of unsupported belief, but this tirade is little more than a joke."
70,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,3,"The themes in this book are transparently derivative of Daniel Dennett's  Breaking the Spell and Richard Dawkins's  The God Delusion, and the treatment lacks their qualifications as scientists and philosophers, although Hitchens is also smart and witty. He has collected a trove of anecdotes and strange-but-true facts, as flashy and entertaining as the title of his book. But whereas Dennett spent the first third of his book carefully setting up the scope of his question, and Dawkins took pains toward diplomacy, Hitchens does neither. He dives into his thesis with the assumption that the reader either already agrees with him or else needs to be hit on the head with a hammer.Hitchens's authority for this book, aside from being fairly well-read on the subject, comes from his encounters with violence:“A week before the events of September 11, 2001, I was on a panel with Dennis Prager, who is one of America’s better-known religious broadcasters. He challenged me in public to answer what he called a ‘straight yes/no question,’ and I happily agreed. Very well, he said. I was to imagine myself in a strange city as the evening was coming on. Toward me I was to imagine that I saw a large group of men approaching. Now--would I feel safer, or less safe, if I was to learn that they were just coming from a prayer meeting? ... ‘Just to stay within the letter ‘B,’ I have actually had that experience in Belfast, Beirut, Bombay, Belgrade, Bethlehem, and Baghdad. In each case I can say absolutely, and can give my reasons, why I would feel immediately threatened if I thought that the group of men approaching me in the dusk were coming from a religious observance.” (p. 18)He goes on to address the present occupation of Iraq. He says that Muslim issues led to the rise of Saddam's dictatorship, and that since the overthrow of Saddam, there has been more intra-Muslim violence. His point about the essential violence of religion would have been made even stronger if he acknowledged the Christian influence behind the US invasion of Iraq. But he seems to think that the invasion itself was a potentially positive force that the Iraqis could have used to free themselves, had they not been corrupted by religion.He claims that atheists are better equipped than religious people to politefully respect alien religious customs (and to refrain from attacking their houses of worship), although his personal displays of politeness are spotty. His lapses include “[God's] yokel creationist fans” (p. 85), “vapid and annoying holiday known as ‘Hannukah’,” (p. 273) “Islam when examined is not much more than a rather obvious and ill-arranged set of plagiarisms,"" (p. 129), and a reference to the Left Behind novels by LaHaye and Jenkins that were “apparently generated by the old expedient of letting two orangutans loose on a word processor.” (p. 56) (I share his general sentiment on the last point, but I was less harsh when I reviewed Left Behind.)In other places, he shows a concern for politeness: ""My own annoyance at Professor Dawkins and Daniel Dennett, for their cringe-making proposal that atheists should conceitedly nominate themselves to be called 'brights,' is part of a continuous argument."" (p. 5)God is not Great predominantly adresses Abrahamic religion, particularly in describing submission to a monarch-like god. A last-minute attempt to debunk “soft” Eastern religion barely scratches the subject, except to mention that India and Pakistan are preparing for nuclear war and to peek at a cult ashram in the United States. He ignores more innocuous components of religion, including new theories of so-called “neurotheology” which examine religious experiences merely as brain states, which would have brought the book more up-to-date as a philosophical work."
71,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11484156-hayls-x1f434,1,"This book is about politics, not atheism. It fails because it seems to argue that atheism is the solution to geopolitical tensions, wars, conservatism, bigotry, sexism and other human-induced evils of the world. Because as we all know secular societies are utopian.I like (and agree with) books which expose institutional corruption, brain-washing, bigotry, and organisations which encourage general conservatism, and it's pretty obvious that religion is full of that kind of thing. However, to argue (or rather, angrily rant) that the fundamental cause all this evil is the belief itself, and that people of faith are by definition stupid, bigots, prone to violence, and intellectually inferior is just the sort of superiority I would expect from a white, well-off Oxbridge educated man.One thing that constantly bugged me is the fact that all the focus on Evil Religion meant that other systems of oppression which exist in secular society were ignored. For example, in discussing the oppression of women in the name of religion (including FGM, sexual/physical abuse, sexual repression, banning women from places of worship during menstruation, exclusion of women from clergy, etc.) Hitchens doesn’t acknowledge that patriarchal systems of oppression like sexism, homophobia, transphobia, etc are deeply entrenched in secular society and do not necessarily need religion to flourish. Even if religion could be eliminated, the patriarchy would still be there. Hate to point out the obvious, but bigoted atheists exist. But maybe it’s too much to expect a straight, white man to realise this.Other than that, the cherry-picking Hitchens does to support his argument by only using examples of religious fundamentalists and terrorists to support his argument that All Religion is for Stupid and Violent People is just the kind of cherry-picking that religious fundamentalists do to support their literal interpretations of holy texts and oppressive ""traditions"" and exclusions. (Also, if you just isolate what he says about Islam, he kind of sounds like Donald Trump...). It also shows that he fundamentally misunderstands why some people turn to religion, and that there are other benefits of religious practice which are personal and intangible - in saying that, it would be interesting to know what Hitchens would've said about current health trends in secular society such as mindfulness, transcendental meditation, yoga, and other activities that have been cherry-picked from religious traditions because people find they actually benefit well-being.Finally, Hitchens' does not offer any kind of solution to the problems he outlines. He ends with a vague suggestion that the world would be better off without religion, but this is contrary to a statement he makes early on where he admits that religion probably won't just go away. In this sense, the book is sterile in it's effectiveness. It does not have anything to say further than the title and is therefore of less practical use than books which are perhaps written from a theist perspective but encourage interfaith cooperation, encourage reform within institutional religion, with the aim to weed out intolerance, bigotry, persecution and extremism from religious groups. Instead, Hitchens' angry ranting and use of offensive, bigoted language to refer to people of faith only has the potential to sow the seeds of division and enmity, and that's the very thing we should be trying to avoid. Especially considering the current political atmosphere.I could've also talked about the fact that as a queer religious person it was offensive to be equated with the likes of Westboro Baptist bigots (especially after Hitchens himself said at the beginning he resented religious people misrepresenting atheists) but this review has been long enough."
72,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/635936-jeremy,4,"few books in the past decade have elicited as much fervent criticism, charged rhetoric, and heated opposition as christopher hitchens' antitheist exposition, god is not great. the late author and journalist was obviously a compelling writer, and whatever controversies his works may have courted were often the inevitable result of his relentless pursuit of and devotion to veracity and intellectual inquest. hitchens was witty, wise, and clever, but it was his mordancy, incisiveness, and intransigence that won him both adherents and detractors aplenty.god is not great takes aim, of course, at the cruel, deleterious, and all too often hypocritical role organized religion (especially the three abrahamic faiths) has played since its inception. hitchens' criticisms are indeed sharp, but they are also well-reasoned and logically conveyed. a salient point that he reiterates throughout the book concerns religion's evident inability to let alone those whose faiths may differ (or be absent altogether): it can be stated as a truth that religion does not, and in the long run cannot, be content with its own marvelous claims and sublime assurances. it must seek to interfere with the lives of nonbelievers, or heretics, or adherents of other faiths. it may speak about the bliss of the next world, but it wants power in this one. this is only to be expected. it is, after all, wholly man-made. and it does not have the confidence in its own various preachings even to allow coexistence between different faiths.hitchens' disdain of religion is hardly subtle, and his unrestrained arguments against it cover a wide breadth. with a long history from which to draw his evidence, he directs attention to common traits shared by all the major religions, including, but not limited to, their long, bloody history of conquest and crusade, their deplorable and unforgivable treatment of women and children, their inherent intolerance of opposing viewpoints, their totalitarian tendencies, their proliferation of specious metaphysical claims, and their general opposition to reason, openmindedness, and freethinking. hitchens also examines the respective merits of the sacred texts, illuminating an abundance of inconsistencies, plagiarisms, immoralities, and questionable provenances.while hitchens spends much of the book in the effort of countering arguments asserted by theists of various faiths, he also attempts to offer clear reasons as to why it would be beneficial for our mammalian species to set aside organized religion. regardless of one's own spiritual inclinations, god is not great provides ample opportunity for one to consider (or, hopefully, reconsider) the aggregate effect of religion on the well-being and trajectory of all humankind. controversy for its own sake is generally an empty proposition, and while hitchens is apt to stray into the polemical, it in no way minimizes the evidence he advances or the delusions he dispels. god is not great is a contentious, sometimes combative book, however just such a style may well be called for to advance so impassioned an argument ever further into the forefront.
yet in our hands and within our view is a whole universe of discovery and clarification, which is a pleasure to study in itself, gives the average person access to insights that not even darwin or einstein possessed, and offers the promise of near-miraculous advances in healing, in energy, and in peaceful exchange between different cultures. yet millions of people in all societies still prefer the myths of the cave and the tribe and the blood sacrifice.

73,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12205385-jessi-collier-wakefield,3,"Full disclosure: I identify myself as a practicing Christian. That right there might deter some to from putting any weight into my words. But I have no problem whatsoever with Hitchens’ assessment of organized religions. My problems with this book, funnily enough, is not theological. My feelings did not get hurt. I was not offended. To be a practicing anything is to have opposition. First century Christians were fed to the lions, I can get through a book (one which I voluntarily chose to read) and not get my neck up. Yet, just because I am not offended, doesn’t mean as a reader I didn’t find fault. Here though is my first statement to Mr. Hitchens: if you are wanting to write a persuasive book you had best bring your A game. Treat us the way you think of yourself. As free thinkers. (But his argument would be that if I did have Faith, then I was not a free thinker. And we would go round and round). Present an actual argument that doesn’t rely on incessant insults. Instead of academic though, I received deliberate inflammatory. The vocabulary he used to describe various believers does him no favors. Calling believers as “frauds”, “boobies”, ""orangutans"", ""ignoramus"", ""goons"", and ""barbarian"". Why can’t he just create a logical dissertation on his views without sounding very much like a school yard bully? But then again, if he were to omit all the adjectives that he uses that diminish another human being – something that he himself would never say he does, because he is moral – then the book would only be 141 pages, instead of 341. He needed to pad his book. Again, I am fine that he is hurtling those insults at “me”, but I’ve always been of the mind that the more adjectives you need, the fluffier your argument. Just as I find there are “shock jocks” on either side of the aisle (Limbaugh, Hannity, Maher, Oberman) – authors can fall under the same umbrella. And he wanted to cause shock. I wanted to read reasoning. Also, you cannot state things like “I do not think I am being arrogant here” and then say the arrogant thing. Or say that it isn’t a “straw man” argument and then write an argument that would qualify as the very definition of “straw man”. You can’t say you aren’t these things and then do or say these things and get a pass. There were many times he took something out of context to fit his slant. I’m not even talking Biblical, but with literature and politics. He at times is also that kid that discovers a new word and has to use it in every sentence to prove he's smart (solipsism, vouchsafe). I actually do believe him that religion has caused more harm to the human race and the globe than any other thing in history. You are either actively choosing to be blind, or do not know history if you think otherwise. Many of his arguments are things that I have thought of years before and kept me up at night. I just wanted something that was actually thought provoking instead of hearing the same atheist arguments. Just like he states of the faith arguments that he hears again and again, the atheist arguments are also often recycled. I didn’t hate this book. Not at all. The historical portions that he added were great starting points for other things for me to research in the future. I love challenging myself – and I would actually recommend it to those who haven’t delved too deeply into uncomfortable waters. But I just wanted something weightier on this subject. I didn’t get that with Hitchens."
74,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4404773-mary-slowik,3,"My first Hitchens.What?! Sub-five stars?! Avowed atheist that I am, how could this be?!Well, agreement isn't the whole story. I knew going into this that it would be, pardon the phrase, preaching to the choir. I knew that I'd be getting a nice array of arguments against faith, critical of religion, a judgment on every god delusion out there. And to that extent the book serves its purpose. Here's the thing, though.Hitchens was:a) A superlative thinker,b) An excellent speaker, andc) A mediocre writerIs that heretical of me to say? Forgive me, but it's just my opinion. I believe he humbly says so himself at various points, in praising other writers. He often strives for (and achieves) brilliance in the logical force of his arguments, but what he really ought to be striving for is clarity. Too many times I had to go back and re-read a tangled sentence to parse what he was really trying to say. Oftentimes he'd pull a quote from something and leap to a conclusion that isn't exactly clear from, or warranted by, the quote itself. It detracted from the strength of his many admirably brazen statements.Having said that... I also can't help but feel that the whole faith vs. rationality, god or no god, religion or science debate is painfully passe, and largely irrelevant. Illusions, delusions, none of them strictly matter to me anymore. And on the more significant question of whether to perpetuate our doomed species, I'm sorry to say that Hitchens comes down on the wrong side. He refers to his (natural-born) children at several points, and makes certain claims regarding abortion that I take strong issue with.He spends so much time, and so many words, bemoaning the tendency of human beings to believe in nonsense, and to harm others (especially children) with that belief, never stopping to realize that this is the nature of the animal. If he'd perhaps read The Denial of Death or other works of a more anti-natalist bent, perhaps he would've jettisoned the unwarranted optimism and forgone the meaningless fight over religion. If there were a religion that actually confronted death, instead of proffering an imaginary circumvention thereof, I'd be all for it. More so if it actually sought to vanquish death by encouraging or requiring believers to stop feeding it, to cease reproducing and giving birth, quite literally, to all our pains and sorrows.But here again is my own, unwarranted optimism. Of course we will never do such a thing; it's maladaptive. The idiots will inherit the earth, and our species will blunder into extinction just like every other species, rather than being the first and only species to nobly, voluntarily, enact it. Pro-natalists represent a cult of death. Anti-natalists are the few whose philosophy, put into global action, would actually kill off human death and suffering at long last. You want to know what really poisons everything? Not religion. Life.That is not dead which can eternal lie,And with strange aeons even death may die."
75,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,3,"I intended to read this book back-to-back with Richard Dawkins’ God Delusion and Sam Harris’ End of Faith and Letter to a Christian Nation. But I had to wait about a year for the library audio version of ""God Is Not Great"" because of a long queue. Thus, my comparison of the books is not as fresh as I had hoped. In general I found Hitchens book full of pithy comments with hints of irony and sarcasm. Dawkins I remembered as being more scientific and restrained in his language. Harris I recall being more direct, strident and philosophic. I think Hitchens spent more time parsing the Hebrew and Christian scriptures than the other two. But Hitchens is obviously a good writer and his book easily keeps the reader's interest.This book, ""God Is Not Great,"" as with other similar books, attacks the more traditional forms of various religions and disregards the more liberal versions. The atrocious actions of the various religions that are pointed out by the book are products of either less enlightened times or are activities of the most fundamentalistic versions of the religion. More liberal and metaphoric interpretations of scriptures are written off as religionist who have morphed into humanism. That makes the task of attacking religion quiet easy for the book. A more nuanced discussion of the pros and cons of less conservative forms of religion would probably hurt book sales since it's a more complex subject.The following is a short review of this book from my PageADay Book Lover's Calendar:WHAT THE ATHEIST SAID“We believe with certainty that an ethical life can be lived without religion. And we know for a fact that the corollary holds true—that religion has caused innumerable people not just to conduct themselves no better than others, but to award themselves permission to behave in ways that would make a brothel-keeper or an ethnic cleanser raise an eyebrow.” So Christopher Hitchens writes in his trenchant indictment of religion. Even those on the other side of the debate may want to read this to have a full and clear idea of the points they need to rebut. A sharply and entertainingly written polemic.GOD IS NOT GREAT: HOW RELIGION POISONS EVERYTHING, by Christopher Hitchens (Twelve, 2007)"
76,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/502680-david,2,"Hitchens is a great writer so the book is an engaging read. Christians should listen to and be challenged by what people like Hitchens have to say, though most of what he said has been said before by others who seem to have a better grasp of things.For example, he writes that Bart Ehrman (his name is Bart, not Barton), found that the end of the Gospel of Mark was not actually in the original manuscripts. Hitchens calls this one of Ehrman's ""more astonishing findings"" (p. 142). But this so-called finding has been known to Christians for years. Most Bible translations, such as the NIV, note that the end of Mark is not in the originals. So Hitchens plays it like this is a huge mark against Christianity, when actually it is already known by most Christians and is not a huge deal.This mistake by Hitchens does not exonerate the religions he is attacking, his arguments are still forceful. But such a minor mistake demonstrates carelessness on his part and should cause skepticism by his larger claims (and Hitchens makes many other mistakes, the review by Mark Roberts points out - http://markdroberts.com/?cat=16).Throughout his argument Hitchens never engages people like Nietzsche, Sartre, Camus, Derrida or other giants of philosophy from the last century. This absence is revealing, for this men for the most part share Hitchens atheism but not his positive outlook on the world. They took the Enlightenment to its logical outcomes. Hitchens believes that science and reason give us all we need to live in the world, these philosophers blew that idea up. To argue as he does, Hitchens needs to respond to them.Of course, this does not mean that religions are true, but it might mean that the lack of a god has graver consequences than Hitchens admits. At any rate, this is a tough book with strong attacks that Christians must be prepared to respond to in the world today."
77,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6266860-james-dickson,1,"I recently finished reading ""Freedom in Exile"", the Dalai Lama's autobiography. It had an overall positive view of religion and its place in modern life, which is certainly understandable coming from the Dalai Lama. To balance my literary experience, I turned to this book, imagining that it would be a thoughtful but entertaining discourse on the harmful excesses of modern organized religion.I was wrong.Instead, what I got was a volley of, ""Look at all the terrible shit people have done in the name of religion! Look how dumb these people are for not accepting evolution! Religion of any sort belongs to the infancy of our species! Watch me pick apart the Bible and mock it relentlessly!""At no point does he mention the terrible shit people have done in the name of greed, money, power, or boobs. His argument against intelligent design boils down to, ""If God did this, He did a shitty-ass job."" His assertion that religion is a relic of a bygone era has only the weight of its constant repetition to back it up. And, of course, any document can be made to sound idiotic if picked apart. I could make JRR Tolkien sound like a drooling moron if I wanted. None of these arguments has any real merit.This book is the literary equivalent of the showboating news host who shouts his opinions so loud that the guests meant to offer opposing insight are forced into silence. And I think it misses the real point of things. Religion isn't the problem. It's people.Always has been, always will be.So, long story short, I gave up halfway through this book. I have so many other things in my to-read list that are more worthwhile than this bullshit."
78,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90096-chad,3,"I've followed Christopher Hitchens' divorce from the political Left with interest, because he is an extremely talented, provocative writer with an uncompromising intellect. His support for the Iraq occupation has drawn heated ire from his former colleagues, and I have read a fair amount of his work recently, as well as the criticism of his opponents, in an attempt to find his overall political philosophy.Strangely enough, this refutation of religion has provided quite a few clues.Hitchens' arguments are not new, though that they have been broached before does not mitigate their effectiveness. The genesis of my skepticism is echoed in these pages with Hitchens' investigation of the history of many religious texts. Though many believers assert the unassailable veracity of their Word, the process by which these words came together in their current, agreed upon form was scattershot. Highly varied source material, erroneous or disputed interpretations and unverifiable word-of-mouth narration is all part of the equation.Hitchens leaves the reader with a plea for a new enlightenment, and it is here where his philosophy reveals itself. A secular humanist, Hitchens seeks a world of fairness, equality and erudition, and views religion as not merely dangerous but inaccurate and bizarre. He sees religion as stifling humanity's best and most noble inclinations, and sees it as akin to a political totalitarianism. Be the impediment a dusty, unreasonable faith or a cruel dictatorial government, he wants it eradicated, and at once."

Though I am not an atheist I find his arguments and examples compelling, writing style fun but informative, and the flow of the book fantastic.I have often wondered what the world would be like if organized religion went the way of the dodo. Some people think the Earth would turn into some type of distopian nightmare. I on the other hand think we'd be better off. I love reading religious text for the sociological and historical context of the people that believe in them, I do not on the other hand find them enlightening or even sane. Though there are rare gems of knowledge hidden among the debris. Nobody is safe from Hitchens and his pen. Mother Theresa, Gandhi, the Old Testament version of God (who even as a child I had an issue with, Muhammad, Jesus, Buddha...you ge the picture. Even myself who I am sure he would call a fence sitter though I like to refer to myself as a Marcion/Deist with a hint of Catholic. In other wards a confused jumble of ideas that only really work for me and that is the way it should be. I am one of those that believe that religion should be something inward and not openly expressed but I am in the minority. The one thing I will say is that while I think organized religion has outlived its usefulness it is not going anywhere in the near future. I also don't believe that I or anyone else should tell people how to live their lives so what I believe should not be forced on someone and vise versa.It's a good book and I think anyone, religions or not would like it."

It is easy to be swept along with the case against the great god in the sky here, as the author slashes and burns his way through the monotheistic religions of the world. What is more difficult for me, is to challenge all of the charges that are made of these various theologies and philosophies, both ancient and modern.It is apparent that the writer had been exposed to some of these belief systems in his lifetime and this book exhibits a fairly broad knowledge of the so called divine texts as well as the thoughts of writers from history, often accompanied with some wit and humour.When asked what he considered to be the 'axis of evil', Hitchens replied, ""Christianity, Judaism, Islam – the three leading monotheisms."" Reading this book leaves no doubt of that conviction.A great polemicist was lost with his passing in 2011, but His truth goes marching on. The history of religion is the history of the StateIncestuous exploiters of a catalogue of hate.The man of peace was over-run by armies of the ""Lord""Who signed their names to any warAnd sang to praise the sword.The mission heads for outer spaceThe voices ring and swellWith aeons of self-righteousness The senseless echoes knellThe words get much more meaningless-even plainer to tellThat those who would pronounce this GodAre those who make this hell."

Hitchens is one of the most intellectual and witty writers about controversial human affairs and (recent) history I know. Religion-wise -for me- there is not much to be learned. To others, especially religious individuals who have just started to critically research their own beliefs and religious dogma's there are a few basic and profound arguments against the three major (monotheistic) religions like Christianity, Judaism and Islam to be extracted from his writings. His critique mostly is focussed at Christianity, as he calls himself a protestant atheist. To me, the anecdotes that Hitchens uses to make his points are both interesting and enlightening in a broad sense. He has great knowledge of science, philosophy and literature, which are put together amazingly. Once and again I was sincerely bothered by some of his onesided anti-theistic viewpoints, even though I essentially agreed with him. Personally I'm quite prudent to intertwine religion, religious dogma's and religious behaviour as a sociological phenomenon on the one side and the purely philosophical/scientific questions about the essence, workings and origin of the Universe and our reality on the other.This will be an interesting read for any of us, whether you are religious or not."

Coming from a more political background than Dawkins, Hitchens uses his extensive knowledge of history and politics to paint a grim picture of religions stranglehold on humanity. Hitchens’ is well read and informed and infuses his ideas with a great sense of sardonic humor, and unlike Dawkins who can come of as a bit too aggressive, I felt Hitchens is vulgar at times because the subject matter of which he writes is so vulgar.I wholeheartedly concur with Hitchens, Dawkins, Sagan, and Russell that man should be a free-thinking and critical animal, carefully analyzing available facts instead of hiding our fears and insecurities behind repression, wishful thinking, and fairy tales. I can’t help but think that it’s a shame that I enjoy this book so much, while the people who ought to read will never do so or turn a blind eye towards it and choose to decry Hitchens as a heretical instigator. Hitchens work is an enlightening look at the horror of organized religion and he promotes the work of humanists, freethinkers, and philosophers as a proof that there are brilliant decent humans who have done great things without religion.

Hitchens is a clever and eloquent writer (and even more so as a speaker) but his rambling sentences and dense paragraphs can be so intense to unpack. So many of the ideas presented in this book are incredible closely aligned to my own, so it frustrates me to realize that because of the writing style I would recommend this book to very few readers."
84,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31502-kate,4,"[Review below from 2010, but I finally read Russell's ""Why I Am Not a Christian"" this year, and so I now realize how explicitly Hitchens (for whom the Russell text was foundational) based his rhetorical structure on that essay, which I now wish I'd read first. Also, it's funny and charming, which this isn't. (And it's always satisfying, as a woman, to point at Christopher Hitchens not being funny.)]In my expectation for this book, I mistakenly conflated two related but distinct concepts: defense of atheism (as its own creed, as it were - secularism, if you like), and attack on theism (and religion). I expected the latter, and found it in spades, but was surprised that there wasn't much of the former, which was a shame, because I think that added dimension would have given Hitchens's argument a bit more of an open-door feel (something many believers appreciate about religion, incidentally).I can't blame Hitchens for that, though; he set out to make the case against religion, not to write Secularism for Dummies, and this should have been clear from the subtitle: the book is about all the ways in which religion is bad. Having defined his scope thus, he launches from the opening into a catalog of atrocities, large and small, that can be laid at the feet of religion: holy wars and religious killings; dietary restrictions; interference in sexual conduct and sexual health; the holding hostage of reason by faith; the spread of false information about our origins and the attendant obstruction of the pursuit of scientific knowledge. With this as context, he then presents brief, damning biographies of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, before moving on to argue religion's systemically poisonous nature, on a number of fronts.In a delightfully catty dispute over the nature of evolutionary psychology, Stephen Jay Gould once wrote, ""If we define poetic justice as defeat by one's own favored devices - Robespierre before the guillotine or Midas in golden starvation - then we might be intrigued to find Steven Pinker, a linguist by training, upended by his own use of words."" One could make a similar case against Hitchens (although I don't think he is upended completely, just limited): a disciple or even evangelist of reason, he set for himself a task that reason could not achieve - to show that religion poisons everything. (This claim isn't limited to the book's subtitle; it is repeated as a refrain throughout.) This is plainly impossible (not least because one can't make a list of everything), and so the endless cataloging of evil and hypocrisy comes off as grasping, instead of what it should rightly be, horrifying.At times, Hitchens's impulse to condemn faith and the faithful gets in the way of a perfectly obvious point of reason. In the chapter entitled ""Does Religion Make People Behave Better?"", he describes a debate in which an atheist says to a bishop that he sees no evidence for the existence of a god, to which the bishop replies, ""Then I cannot see why you do not lead a life of unbridled immorality."" Surely the best response to this is simply, ""And yet I do not, so evidently belief is not necessary for morality."" But Hitchens leaps over this (I think obvious) point to call out the bishop's statement as an insult and then to suggest that this means the bishop himself would lead an immoral life if he were ""freed from the restraints of doctrine."" This is a clever turn of logic, but not thoroughly convincing on the question of whether belief necessarily engenders morality, or whether morality exists in the absence of belief, both of which are worth addressing in earnest. The truth is that in some cases, people do extraordinarily good things not only in spite of but because of their belief in a higher being, and Hitchens isn't able to square this with the unsavory human tendencies that religion often exploits, so he simply skips over it. ""The first thing to be said,"" he states, ""is that virtuous behavior by a believer is no proof at all of - indeed is not even an argument for - the truth of his belief."" No indeed, but his thesis isn't that religion is untrue, it's that religion poisons everything (italics his). The point of all this being that Hitchens makes a very good case, but ultimately not the case he promised he would make.The concluding chapters are titled ""A Finer Tradition: The Resistance of the Rational"" and ""The Need for a New Enlightenment,"" and it is here that I would have hoped for a celebration of reason, inquiry, irreligious morality and of course secularism. And I guess that's what he was going for, too, but unfortunately for the reader, he must have felt like the inventory of religious iniquity hadn't been satisfactorily completed in the preceding chapters, because it bleeds into these sections as well. At the end of which, one has the impression that these noble, non-faith-based pursuits are more about the fight against belief than anything else, which is a discredit to them.However! It was easier to put my objections into words than my praises, and I do think this book deserves its four (well, three and a half, if I could) stars. Hitchens is an incredibly good writer, who makes the turn of phrase an art and is as clever with words as powerful. And imperfect though the book may be, it's pleasing to read something (even a polemic) that is so literate, that so clearly appreciates the genius of past writers, philosophers and scientists, and that so strongly rises to the debate (even if, as I believe, it overreaches to its own detriment). Incendiary as it is, Christopher Hitchens's voice can be a challenging and enjoyable one."
85,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/595788-alex-telander,5,"GOD IS NOT GREAT BY CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS: Christopher Hitchens has spent some time in journalism: a book reviewer for the Times, a staff writer for the New Statesman, chief foreign correspondent for the Daily Express, a regular columnist for the Nation, and is a regular writer for Vanity Fair, Harper’s, and Atlantic Monthly. As a foreign correspondent and travel writer, he has written from more than sixty different countries. He is also the author of such books as Letters to a Young Contrarian and Why Orwell Matters. Hitchens now takes on a subject of growing discussion and debate in a time when the number of atheists in the United States, as well as the rest of the world, is apparently growing either because they are abandoning all religion or they are simply “coming out” and admitting to their atheist beliefs. A short time ago “atheist” was a hated label for one to admit to having, but now with a slew of atheist and anti-religious books, including Richard Dawkins’ God Delusion, Sam Harris’ End of Faith and Letter to a Christian Nation, Daniel Dennett’s Breaking the Spell, to name a few, with no doubt many more to be published; Hitchens addresses a subject that is slowly creeping into mainstream media (Dawkins made Time’s Top 100 Most Influential People list this year) and becoming a commonplace conversation in many households across the country.What I find quite uncanny, having read most of the books mentioned above, is how each author avoids covering the same examples and details when discussing the same subject matter. The authors find new and different ways of exposing the futility of religion and pushing forth their atheist beliefs. Hitchens joins the ranks here in presenting a new side to a growing subject matter. What makes God is Not Great different is that while many of the other books calling for the end of the religion gloss over the different faiths of the world, they ultimately focus on Christianity, being the largest and most visible faith in this country; Hitchens doesn’t hold back and has chapters not just on Christianity and its various denominations, but also extensively attacks the Muslim religion and its denominations, Buddhism, Mormonism, as well as small religious sects around the world such as Shintoism and Jainism.Hitchens puts his journalistic background to good use here in citing many different examples of how each religion causes more pain and suffering than good. In most cases, these are examples that feature situations that Hitchens was either involved in or learned about it while in that specific country. He best illustrates this in the second chapter of the book when he talks about serving on a panel with Dennis Prager – one of America’s notorious religious broadcasters – who challenged him to responding yes or no to a simple question: Hitchens was to imagine himself in a strange city one evening whereupon he saw a group of men coming towards him; the question is would he feel safer or less safe if he was to learn that they were coming from a prayer meeting? Hitchens then spends the next five pages explaining specific situations from a list of places simply beginning with the letter “B”: Belfast, Beirut, Bombay, Belgrade, Bethlehem, and Baghdad. In each city, he gives examples of why he would not feel safe, and in so doing covers the world’s major religions.Read the rest of the review hereFor more book reviews, and author interviews, go to BookBanter."
86,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48009491-brianna-silva,4,"This was incredibly thought-provoking. You really have to approach it openly, though. If you have very strongly held beliefs while reading this book, you'll probably be offended by the blunt, irreverent way the author tears things apart. He doesn't try to be nice about it. But he's still fair and open-minded even in the way he presents things. He acknowledges some good aspects of religion where he sees them, and his straightforwardness isn't truly unkind, just brusque.Where this book seriously falls short, though, is in completely passing over the study of neurotheology, and how a healthier version of religion can and does overcome the pitfalls he describes. The author is convinced religion isn't going anywhere soon; and I agree with him. Where I disagree is that I don't believe religion needs to be abandoned; rather, it needs to be reformed.You can see these kind of reforms happening already in the major religions. The emergent stream of Christianity is one example that functions essentially like humanism + belief.This is where a look at neurotheology can provide some much-needed balance. Studies on the brains of religious people show that the problem is not religion itself, but its form.E.g., belief in an angry God has measurable effects on the brain, making people angrier and more hostile. Belief in a loving God also affects the brain, making people more loving, patient, and empathetic. The author also failed to mention where religion can positively affect communities and foster a sense of unity and identity. Again, another reason why religion itself isn't the problem, and is likely here to stay.In my opinion, religion CAN (and should) move past the horrific problems the author laid out here, and become a positive force in the world, IF it does the following:(1) Becomes self-aware of its tendencies towards power, control, and misguided ethics, and stays vigilant to work against them.(2) Recognizes that the supernatural is not necessary to explain our world, and treats belief as a choice, not an imperative.(3) Puts reason BEFORE faith, not faith before reason. (4) Sets up world views that value empirical evidence over so-called inspired texts, and appreciates any truth and goodness in those texts in light of empirical evidence. (E.g., reading Genesis in light of cosmological evidence, not vise versa.)(5) Approaches ethics not as a set of arbitrary rules, but as a way to honor the dignity, protection, and agency of every human being. (6) Removes its obsession with the afterlife, accepts that such a concept is unknowable, and instead focuses on improving our world here and now.These things are possible, and are already happening. We absolutely need modern societies to foster open-mindedness, critical thinking, and superior ethics. This may cause us to steer away from organized religion, perhaps for the better. But I'm not convinced it will turn us away from God.(For a more balanced take on atheism and belief, I recommend Finding God in the Waves.)"
87,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99666-audrey,3,"Christopher Hitchens makes many good points about why belief in God doesn't make sense anymore, and many excellent points about the evils of religion and how it's held us back. He writes with erudition and wit, and at times, is a pleasant person to visit with. I'm inclined to agree with much of what he writes here (although since I grew up without much formal religious instruction, I don't really need the hard sell on that one) but I was confused about his purpose in writing this book. If he just wants to write a polemic for people who already agree with him, his snide tone makes sense, but he seems to feel so strongly about actually dissuading people from their beliefs. Does he think he can mock people into not believing in God? I found the contemptuous tone that intermittently seeps into his writing offensive - and I'm not even religious. I think if you're going to attempt to prod people in the tender parts of their psyche and urge them to give up something that means a lot to them - even if you're convinced it's all bunk - a little care is called for, no? Also, he seems to think all atheists are enlightened aesthetes who spend their time pondering the fine arts, literature and science just because *he* happens to be an enlightened aesthete who does these things (and discusses Shakespeare with Salman Rushdie to boot). I think that's probably as grave a mistake as thinking that all people who believe in God are Bible-thumping maniacs who are bombing abortion clinics.I think, in the end, though, belief doesn't really capitulate to reason, ever. It's something felt with an organ other than the brain. I came away the same agnostic I've pretty much always been (although I think that might be a function of my personal tendency towards indecision rather than anything else). I don't fault him for trying, but I wonder if he's done atheists and non-believers a favor in writing this book.There's an interesting op ed from the nytimes today on morality without religion; click here to go to it.And apparently, Mark Twain agrees:There is one notable thing about our Christianity: bad, bloody, merciless, money-grabbing and predatory as it is — in our country, particularly, and in all other Christian countries in a somewhat modified degree — it is still a hundred times better than the Christianity of the Bible, with its prodigious crime — the invention of Hell. Measured by our Christianity of to-day, bad as it is, hypocritical as it is, empty and hollow as it is, neither the Deity nor his Son is a Christian, nor qualified for that moderately high place. Ours is a terrible religion. The fleets of the world could swim in spacious comfort in the innocent blood it has spilt.Read more here:http://beyond-school.org/2010/07/11/m..."
88,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2611049-a-j-howard,4," I love the way Christopher Htichens writes. Its like being lectured by an arrogant bastard that talks as if he is perfectly aware that he can literally mind rape you but you are left transfixed by because the fucker is probably right and he has a masterful command of the English language. The first I read of him was his writing in Slate leading up to the Iraq war. I disagreed with many of his thoughts, but not in a way that turned me off.  I held off on reading this book for awhile, mostly because I really didn't need persuasion of the author's thesis. However, I picked it up at the library (somebody had turned it around so the pages were facing outward) and couldn't put it down.  A big problem with discourse today, especially in the political realm, is that people don't think about what they are told. There are a good deal of people who hear something on Fox News, or MSNBC I guess, and accept it verbatim. Hitchens doesn't dwell on this, but I think that may be one of religion's greatest sins. From a very early age it encourages people not to think. You enter into consciousness believing in Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, and a bearded fellow in the sky. Except, eventually beliefs in the myths are abandoned, but, for some reason, the religious faith is maintained.  I'm not calling for people to abandon their beliefs. That's one critique I have of Hitchens. Although the title is effective in communicating the book's apparent thesis, it can be off putting to believers. Therefore, Hitchens may be preaching to the choir. However, I think Hitchens real intent is to challenge the reader to think about the world, and to question religions usefulness. If you are a believer or not, Hitchens writing is a great device for doing so."
89,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2074414-christopher-litsinger,1,"Well, I made it through this book, but I can't say I enjoyed it very much. Hitchens' unrelenting attack on religion goes on without any willingness to acknowledge any positive aspects of religion throughout the entire work, and at times made even me feel a bit squeamish- here's a good sample:Mother Teresa flew all the way from Calcutta to help campaign, along with the church and its hard-liners, for a “no” vote [against allowing divorce]. In other words, an Irish woman married to a wife-beating and incestuous drunk should never expect anything better, and might endanger her soul if she begged for a fresh start, while as for the Protestants, they could either choose the blessings of Rome or stay out altogether. There was not even the suggestion that Catholics could follow their own church’s commandments while not imposing them on all other citizens. And this in the British Isles, in the last decade of the twentieth century. The referendum eventually amended the constitution, though by the narrowest of majorities. (Mother Teresa in the same year gave an interview saying that she hoped her friend Princess Diana would be happier after she had escaped from what was an obviously miserable marriage, but it’s less of a surprise to find the church applying sterner laws to the poor, or offering indulgences to the rich.)Even after going to some trouble to admire Martin Luther King, Jr, Hitchens goes on to excoriate him and claim that any good he accomplished was in spite of, rather than because of, his faith.I'm sure the book raised some controversy, and got the author on lots of nice tv shows, which no doubt sold lots of books for him (not just this one). By the end of the book, I wondered if that was the point."
90,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237803-m,4,"Hitchens' case against organized religion and the God hypothesis, his version of Dawkins' ""The God Delusion"" with more disdain and contempt for religion; all but no one here was spared the jarring blade of criticism, even the likes of Newton and Gandhi. Like the case with Dawkins' book, even though my viewpoint towards religion didn't change much, I nonetheless felt much more enlightened by the time I had finished the book, with its countless historic and philosophic references and citations that need pursuing. Staying with the inevitable comparison between the two books, they almost followed the same line that some chapters even had similar titles, which of course can be expected since both are dealing with the same matter and debunking the same arguments, though for me ""The God Delusion"" was more distinct with its scientific eye-openers, while ""God is not Great"" focused more on history and politics.On a personal note, I found the use of language here quite interesting. At some point I could confidently say that no adjective was used twice anywhere in the book. The richness of vocabulary used, despite being frustrating for me at times, was fascinating and entertaining in itself. I'd be glad if I referred to the dictionary only once per chapter on a second reading. I also found myself lost sometimes amidst references from all over the history timeline and from all over the world to prove or disprove a point, I felt in few chapters that the point could have been made clearer towards the end. Most of the chapters though had perfect punchlines and the book generally is full of splendid quotes.A more detailed review and a number of quotes and excerpts should follow soon, hopefully, after a quick skim through the pages once again."
91,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36995800-ajit-singh,4,"Despite the fear of life-threatening repercussions penned in the constitution of several Islamic states, atheism is a growing in number in both secular and theocratic states alike but, for good or bad reasons, atheism is a very disorganised entity. There is no synagogue or temple or mosque or likes of such establishments for atheists. There is no papacy but, had there been one, Christopher Hitchens could have been an uncontested pope, outcompeting the likes of Thomas Paine and Richard Dawkins, the very people he admires and constantly refers to in his book and speeches. I am saying this because the man speaks as good as he writes as I was tempted, and I am sure you would be too, to watch his interviews during the course of reading. Speaking of ""God is not great"", this book is strictly not for beginners, like me, whose only exposure to literature has been the few editions of wildly popular penguin classics like Madame Bovary and Great Gatsby. So if you are like me, try pardoning yourself during the course of reading because most parts of the book require multiple readings coupled with an immense focus for total comprehension. Also, regardless of your faith orientation- atheist or theist, you need to have solid knowledge of your religious texts because this book ruthlessly dismantles, mocks and highlights the ironies and idiocracies abound in the holy books, particularly of three monotheistic religions- Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Be prepared getting your faith brutally questioned and perhaps debunked. "
92,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/122606-chelsea,5,"I really enjoyed Hitchens' point of view and arguments. He was intelligent and persuasive without being rude or combative, though between the title and a couple of the chapter headings (specifically Chapter 2: Religion Kills, and Chapter 16: Is Religion Child Abuse?) there's no doubt in my mind that he wanted to make his point loud and clear, and he wanted to be sure others heard it. It's kind of a shame that the book no doubt had a select group of readers - if only because of the aggressive title - made up of either people who already agreed with him or were leaning his way, or people who wanted to pick the book apart line by line or just feel some old fashioned righteous anger.The first three quarters of the book were fascinating, and I had trouble putting it down. He pulls from many (I don't feel comfortable saying all, though he covered a broad spectrum) religions, though he spend most of his time on Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, and their overlapping roots. His contentions were logical and without vitrol. The last three or so chapters lost me; it felt more like a history lesson than a presentation of an argument, and it seemed out of place when compared to the rest of the book.I'm the proverbial choir Hitchens was preaching to, and it was comforting to see solid logic and reasonable explanations for things I've believed for a while now."
93,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/142956-tom,2,"I've never read anything by Christopher Hitchens, so I have nothing to add to others' ranting or raving about the author's other works. I have, however, read Sam Harris's book The End of Faith, and I liked that, so I picked this one up after the NYT gave it a good review.What's good: It isn't as angry as Harris's book. Most of the arguments are well-reasoned, though there are a few cheap shots. It's very funny in places. For someone who has never read any ""atheist"" literature, it would be a good survey of the various arguments against theism and religion in general. What's bad: I just got tired of it. Maybe it was too... for lack of a better word... preachy. After a hundred pages or so, I said, ""Forget it, there are other books to read that might teach me something more interesting than a hundred new ways to dislike religion.""So I didn't finish it, and instead went on to start Douglas Hofstadter's new book I Am A Strange Loop, which is heaps of fun so far."
94,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/195324-terry,4,"Hitch has much to atone for after his ghastly performance as a neo-neocon in promoting the Iraq War, and perhaps this book is a big step in the right direction. He makes a sharp distinction between ""religion"" and the ""numinous"" or ""spiritual"" in this book which shows his beef is with organized religion, not the religious impulse itself. I never took Comparative Religion in college, so I learned a great deal from this book about religions about which I knew almost nothing before (Islam, Mormonism). Hitchens doesn't attempt to deconstruct every major religion (Buddhism and Hinduism mostly get a pass), but his dive-bombing of Islam and Catholicism are devastating. I particularly liked his denunciation of the ""blood sacrifice"" element in Judaism and Christianity; his argument on this point is passionate and withering. I never knew the extent to which the Holy See encouraged the Fascists in Italy and accomodated itself to the Nazis of Germany before I read this book. In fact, I learned a great deal from this book and admire the author's courage. "
95,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22056219-nente,3,"Yeah, this is more of a rant than a structured, reasoned critique. And yes, not all believers are radical. But in real life (as opposed to Internet discussions, where anything could happen) I get pro-religion rants not only much more often than atheistic ones, the ratio is infinity because the atheistic rants number zero. I know many people of my circle do not believe in any gods. But they don't embark on conversion of the believers. The believers, on the other hand, while being non-radical, pleasant, good people, quite often cannot contain themselves on hearing even a relative stranger admit to atheism; they start arguing and convincing. So for me this kind of book was rather refreshing.I could see it may be though overlong, but some of the length would be justified by the fact that Hitchens makes a real effort to include a diverse selection of religions - Dawkins, for example, heavily concentrated on Christianity."
96,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16423463-richard-thomas,5,"With Richard Dawkins' God Delusion this has become something of a target for those who see outspoken atheism as perhaps extremist and unfair. Their problem is that the book is an unashamed polemic, lacking in the technique of apologetics, which to this reader counteracts the insistent message that religion is good and beneficial. That it gives ammunition to the whining of former Archbishops of Canterbury about the persecution of Christianity is to the good not least because whenever Christians whine and whinge about persecution it is a sure sign that they are being prevented from persecuting. The relative strength of their outrage about gay marriage as opposed to their silence about adultery is a signal of their humbug.Setting aside the book's message it is very well written and enjoyable."
97,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"Christopher Hitchens is not that great either. I don’t think there’s anything in this book that I disagree with, but it failed to impress me. I don’t think this book can make any believer change his mind – I don’t think that was the intention of the book anyway – but it may make religion apologists, the nonreligious people who think of religion as harmless or even useful, reconsider.I have to say I’ve liked the recent assaults on religion in the English-speaking world by Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and now Hitchens. We should stop pussyfooting around this issue and openly ask why so many people believe in a dangerous set of nonsense and fairy tales. "
98,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6085278-jean,5,Christopher Hitchens will tell the truth about his opinions; no matter what the outcome.I found this book to be a scathing expose of the lack of goodness displayed by the God of the Bible. Hitchen's caustic wit shines throughout the pages of the book which will be hard for most believers to endure without rushing to God's defense. The logic is unarguable though and the defenders will find themselves in an impossible to win situation.I did not read this until after I realized that God was mere superstition.
99,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/319406-kerry,5,"Really enjoyed this book. Although he was preaching to the unconverted as it were, it really firmed up my feelings about the interference of religion in our lives and nasty effects of it. As a lifetime teacher of History I seem to spend everyday wading with my classes through the blood spilled in the name of god. Good arguments and well researched examples added to a very enjoyable writing style I actually read it twice since getting it at Christmas because I enjoyed it so much."

It's a very pleasant experience, and I quite enjoy the calm Hitchens voice coupled with the absolutely devastating and sharply worded content, but (at the risk of being in agreement with Augustine) I'm not sure I would call what I am doing ""reading"". UPDATE 14 Nov 2015: Despite its obvious problems, I am adding a star. Why? Because sometimes the choir really needs a pep talk. "
101,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,4,"Our world is riven with conflicts of various kinds. But if we look deeply into the root cause of the present and past conflicts what is blindingly obvious is that almost all of them are inspired by religion, or caused by dispute over the faiths of the two opposing parties. Modern terror is bred solely by religious fanaticism. Even with this blemish on their cheeks, religions assume the role of a protector or a refuge of the last resort on the authority of holy books which are assumed to be of divine writ. It requires a person of immense courage, borne out of conviction from truth that he had found in nature, to come up against this charade of religion and unveil the true face of the world's religions. Christopher Hitchens does this onerous task in this book. What we usually see is western authors going after Christianity alone or Islam up to a limit. This has created a sheen on eastern religions like Hinduism and Buddhism as something without error in their practice and theory. Hitchens scraps this notion to the dustbin. No religion is safe from his sharp and pointed barbs. What amaze readers is the minute knowledge Hitchens possesses in Christian Scriptures. With his witty investigation that drills deep into religious yore, he burrows out the truth into plain daylight. As part of its mission to undermine blind faith of all kinds, it criticizes human godheads like Mahatma Gandhi and Mother Teresa as well.Hitchens identifies an innate trait of religions that does not allow a believer to rest until the whole world bows the knee. This, in fact, poisons everything. When two such religions meet, crusades and jihad follow. The origin of religion itself is not sourced from any higher emotions of mankind, but upon tribal suspicions and hatred. It then multiplies the base instincts many fold with the result that members of each group talk of the other in precisely the terms of the bigot. Quite contrary to its claims of divine origins, it is too clear that religion is manufactured in tribal minds. Ethics and morality are independent of faith and cannot be derived from it. Religion is not just amoral but in fact immoral. The book lists out a long line of examples.Religion not only controls interpersonal interactions, it tries to mould the individual around a strict interpretation of its dogma. It regulates the diet of its followers – pork is taboo for Jews and Muslims, beef for Hindus. Hitchens identifies an interesting possible reason for the proscription of pork. He claims that pig meat is similar to human flesh and a dying pig’s squeal disturbingly resembles that of man. The simultaneous attraction and repulsion derived from an anthropomorphic root: the look of the pig, the dying yells of the pig, the taste of the pig and the evident intelligence of the pig were too uncomfortably reminiscent of the human. The logic here seems a bit too farfetched.The three great monotheisms teach people to think abjectly of them, as miserable and guilty sinners prostrate before an angry and jealous God. Individuality is given short shrift and complete surrender to a supreme being is demanded of the believers. This crude capitulation of one’s inner being is touted as a model for others to emulate in what can only be termed brainwashing. In spite of this, people wish to credit good things as miraculous and to charge bad things to another account. An example is the case of numerous species of plants and animals that have become extinct upon the sweet will of a benevolent God. Investigation of the fossil record and the record of molecular biology show that 98 per cent of all the species which have ever lived on earth have lapsed into extinction. This also flies in the face of claims of intelligent design.Hitchens makes a threadbare analysis of some concepts contained in the Old and New Testaments. Needless to say, this is most likely to offend many believing Christians while at the same time pleasing non-Christians. His critique on the Koran, Buddhist and Hindu holy texts enrages their adherents, but makes people of other religions happy. Strange are the ways of the faithful! His bold criticism of Islam is especially noteworthy as it came in the wake of the controversy following the publication of a few cartoons satirizing the Prophet in a Danish journal. The author affirms that there has never been an attempt in any age to challenge or even investigate the claims of Islam that has not been met with extremely harsh and swift repression. There has been no reformation in it.A common argument of the faithful is that people would go morally astray in the absence of religion. The sheer fallacy of this claim is amply demonstrated in this book. Does religion indeed make people behave? A high moral character is not a precondition for great moral accomplishments, which is established by citing the example of Martin Luther King Jr. Slavery was recognised and condoned by religion in its heyday. This huge and terrible industry was blessed by all churches and scholars of Islam. For a long time, this aroused no religious protest. A great deal of campaign by Christian groups was instrumental in banning slavery eventually, but this came at a time when slave trade was finally caught up in the vicious net of diminishing returns and slumped profits. After slavery was abolished once and for all in the US at the end of the civil war, racial prejudices gurgled up again in the form of segregation and discrimination against coloured people. It was not until after the Second World War and the spread of decolonization and human rights that the cry for emancipation was raised again.Mahatma Gandhi receives a dressing down from Hitchens on his alleged single-handed role in obtaining independence for India. The political situation was ripe for a change after two world wars and what Gandhi did was only pushing at an open door. His policies implied disaster for the country in the long-term. He wanted India to revert to a village-dominated and primitive spiritual society and was quite prepared to make hypocritical use of violence when he thought it might suit him (p.182). Millions of people would have mindlessly starved to death if his advice had been followed. When the imperial Japanese conquered Southeast Asia and the war reached the doorsteps of India, he chose the moment to issue his call for the British to quit India. Among the many bad consequences of the Gandhi/Congress decision to withdraw from negotiations was the opening it gave to Muslim league legislators to stay on in the state ministries which they controlled, and then to enhance their bargaining position when the moment of independence came shortly thereafter.The final point of contention is the child abuse perpetrated by religion. Apart from the physical violations, which are themselves quite shocking, the indoctrination at a young age is cause for concern. If religious instruction were not allowed until the child had attained the age of reason, we would be living in a very different word. Mutilation of child genitalia in boys and girls run counter to the religious arguments on intelligent design. We should expect an all-powerful God who designed the reproductive organs of creatures to be a little more careful. Now, man has to come forward to correct the mistake after the child was born.The book suggests that we are in need of a renewed enlightenment which will base itself on the proposition that the proper study of mankind is man and woman. The enlightenment is within the compass of the average person. Hitchens claims that he has been writing this book all his life and intends to keep on writing it. The book is a must have in the emergency kit of an atheist or rationalist. It is an easy read for the general readers too. Considering the wealth of useful data on offer, this book is worth its weight in gold.The book is highly recommended."

109,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18658468-hamidur,5,"I had been putting this book off for reading for quite a while now. It seemed to be intended for an audience of whom I was not one--aimed at those just beginning their journey of non-belief. Oh, how I was wrong!Hitchens is ferocious in his writing and sharp in his reasoning. I have found this to be far more sophisticated than the other books on atheism that came out in the past decade. There is just something about Hitch's breadth of knowledge and the use of his language that lead even his adversaries to admire him.Hitchens maintains that religion is not something that deserve our respect, even though that is the norm. This point is misunderstood by many so let me elaborate. He doesn't believe that we should deny people the right to believe in whatever they believe. He rather wants to take away this special privilege that religion gets in our society when it comes to criticism and scrutiny. Hitchens, like his atheists friends, despises the idea of faith being something to revere. They rather see it as dishonest.This book is not an in-depth criticisms of the arguments for God's existence. The God Delusion by Dawkins or Letter to a Christian Nation by Harris are better candidates for that category. This book goes one step farther to say that it is a good thing that God, in all likelihood, doesn't exist, because a God like that of the Old Testament or the Quran's would surely be a totalitarian God. He despises the idea that we must give up our thinking abilities, throw our hands in the air, and proclaim ""I have faith and I need no evidence."" While most of the arguments that come from his colleagues are based on science, Hitchens is unique in using socio-political issues and historical facts in his arguments. This is what makes him stand out among the New Atheists.I was quite surprised to see that he knew a lot more about Islam and the Quran than I would have imagined. Although I must say that I should have anticipated this knowing the type of intellectual he is. This is another point which makes Hitch stand out: while Dawkins and Harris do criticize Islam, I feel that Hitch is probably the one who has studied this religion the most out of them and came to the conclusion that it is absolutely and undoubtedly evil. He even knew some extremely mundane details about the life of Muhammad, demonstrating just how much he has studied this subject.One thing that is surprising about this book is the absence of the fine-tuning argument. Given, it does not prove the existence of God—it does, however, become an issue when entirely omitted without any mention whatsoever. Nonetheless, I have said before that he didn't refute every single arguments for god's existence but rather focused on the socio-political impacts of religions. Therefore, it is possible that he thought it was one of those arguments that weren't strong enough for a mention.Regardless, this was a joy to read. My only regret after finishing this book was that this bright man has left us so earlyEdit (06/13/15): I have somehow forgotten to describe the focal point of the book: religion poisons everything. It is this thesis of Hitchens and how he defends it make it different than the typical anti-religion books of the last decade. He argues points such as whether religion is detrimental to health and whether it is child abuse. Drawing from religious practices, injunctions, taboos, and historical facts, he very easily defends his positions. He is reluctant to accept the idea that religion is a force for good in the world and defends this proposition against many historical events that were supposedly inspired by religions. His point is clear: most, if not all, the good things done in the name of religions are not exclusive to religions themselves. They might be caused by religions but they could well be done by a humanist or secularist. Furthermore, the amount of horrible things done because of religion far outweighs the good things that are done because of it. Moreover, the horrible things ( such as genital mutilation, misogyny and the accompanied disgust for the female sexual organ, punishment for thought-crimes, and so on) seem to be directly caused by religions through scriptures. He is pretty insistent upon the point that you don't need religion to be a good person. It was his routine in many of his debates to ask of his opponents and the audience to tell him one ethical act done by religious people that could not have been done by a nonreligious person. This moral issue is also one of the main points of this book. The conclusion of the book is that religion is from the infancy of our species when we knew nothing and it doesn't deserve to rule our lives at this age when a twelve years old knows more about the world than the founders of the major religions ever did."

111,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4153215-rusty,4,"I’ve found it hard to sit down and write anything lately. This review being no exception. I can’t recall when I read this book exactly, but I know it was finished before I even marked it as currently reading in my Goodreads list. But it has occurred to me that I’ve never read a word of Christopher Hitchens before when I picked this little thing up. He’s such a huge name in the “new atheism” movement that it sort of surprised me that I hadn’t. I’d seen numerous debates with him via YouTube and felt I was pretty familiar with the tenor of his arguments to the point that I honestly felt like I’d read this before. But I had not. If I had to categorize the nature of Hitchens’ arguments here it would be along the lines of The-history-of-religion-shows-no-signs-of-a-deity-at-work. I think it’s a bit different that more philosophical take that Sam Harris used (although also heavily salted with historical anecdotes – if memory serves me here) and miles away from the more scientific approaches by Richard Dawkins, Sean Carroll, or Lawrence Krauss (I must confess, I’ve not read Krauss either, but like Hitchens, I’ve seen countless debates with him). In all, I find this particular method of argumentation quite compelling, as I think most people will when it supports their own conclusions, as Hitchens does mine. I think of it like this:•	If religion, any religion, is genuinely divine, then we should see evidence of this in the adherents of the faith•	Religious organizations show all the corruption (in many cases, moreso) than secular organizations of similar size•	In some cases religious dogma actively makes the world a worse place and increases suffering --	For example, the proliferation of Aids throughout the third world due to the condemnation of condom use by the Catholic Church --	Religious groups prohibiting vaccinations, or proscribing female circumcision, or refusal of basic medical care for preventable/curable diseases… vastly contributing to the suffering of people that would otherwise be able to live longer healthier lives•	The likelihood of a benign God being the root of these actions is paradoxical. It casts doubt that he/she/it has ever played any hand in the lives of humans at any time in history•	So if there is a creator god(s) then they are uninterested in the lives of individuals, organizations, or nations. •	It is our responsibility to make the world a better place. That sums me up, I suppose. And it’s with that lens that I read this book. I strongly believe Hitchens was exploring the first half of my bullet points in this work. Showing anecdotes galore that show people doing horrid things in the name of their God. I don’t think this is a persuasive argument meant to convert (or de-convert) for a true believer. I know when I believed I’d dismiss any piece of similar argumentation as irrelevant. They aren’t following the correct faith, or people have free will and sometimes choose evil, or they innocently misunderstand God’s intent, or there is a reason for this seemingly bad command that is beyond our understanding, etc. But I’m not a believer any longer. And instead, I see this is an exploration of my own thoughts, put down in a free flowing, cynical, meandering style. Some parts I couldn’t put down, and other parts (especially the first chapter, in my opinion) were tough to get through. I think this is worth a read. And I also think the larger point that Hitchens is making is valid. People doing bad things in the name of their faith is evidence that their faith is wrongly placed. Actually, it reminded me of a relatively well known quote from Steven Weinberg: ""…good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil – that takes religion.""I don't know the context of his quote, but I actually don’t think that is true, as good people can do all sorts of evil things whenever they blindly follow a creed or doctrine. it might be more accurate to say that when people outsource their moral framework to another party, then they are at the mercy of the values that party may hold at any given time. That can be true of a political party, a religion, or philosophy. That's not so sexy a quote, when I put it that way. But I also think it's true that today, in the West, we're more likely to see good people doing bad things it as a byproduct of their religious faith than they are because the state told them too."
112,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/267189-todd-n,4,"God Is Not Great isn't a comprehensive critique of religion any more than randomly firing a machine gun in the direction of the enemy is a comprehensive military strategy. But who cares? It's still pretty awesome.The main failing of this book is that it treats GOD AND RELIGION as one monolithic block that must be removed entirely from civilization as if it were a tumor. So everyone from radical terrorists to those annoying but harmless spiritual seekers are lined up against the wall and blasted by the rhetorical RPG that is Christopher Hitchens. Not that I mind, of course.Hitch's main point, to paraphrase St. Paul, is that it's time for civilization to put away childish things.After I finished this book I read some of its critiques because there is no way to be familiar with all of the references and arguments that Mr. Hitchens makes in this book. The criticisms I read all seem to boil down to complaining about Hitch misstating or oversimplifying some arcane point about religion. It's as if Mr. Hitchens wants to blow up a building, and his critics are arguing about some minor architectural point.For example, one particularly long and overwrought rebuttal by a Ph.D. in New Testament studies accuses the book of overstating the differences in the four Gospels and goes on to list all of the things that they have in common.I've read the Gospels and even parts of the Gnostic ones. It was in my teens and this was not exactly my primary interest at the time, but even I noticed that there are large discrepancies. The Jesuits who instructed me also pointed out that there are several discrepancies. So Hitch is right, and the Ph.D. sophist is so afraid to be either right or wrong that he would rather count the angels on the head of a pin.But anyway, back to the book. A chapter titled ""Is Religion Child Abuse?"" that starts with the story of Abraham and Isaac should give you a rough idea of what to expect. He's attacking the Abrahamic religions at their roots. The usual arguments are made, though with unusual vigor and fierceness. A solicitous letter from the Pope to Adolph Hitler is excerpted to great effect.His take on Buddhism is new to me. He describes the craven and bizarre Imperial Way Buddhism, ""exalting the true spirit of Mahayana Buddhism is a teaching which reverently supports the emperor's [Hirohito] work"" Once again in the book everyone in a faith gets described by the actions of the people on the extremes.But frankly, that's okay by me. While I have met only a few bad ones, I tend to think of most religious people I know as closeted Humanists rather than failed extremists. Like the bumper sticker that obnoxiously asks for ""just one more bubble,"" Hitch and I are praying [sic] for ""just one more Enlightenment.""P.S. As long as we are on the topic, I find myself getting really depressed about society from time to time. On the same week that a new solar system with seven planets was discovered -- seven frickin' planets around another frickin' star!! -- the top news stories were Glenn Beck's rally about ""the nation turning back to God"" and a deranged Christian preacher's plan to burn Korans. This is sad and sickening on so many levels."
113,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84660-swankivy,4,"I wasn't a huge fan of Christopher Hitchens's writing style, because to be completely truthful it was a little dry and a little thick, but he was after all carrying a rather heavy and nasty message. The point of this book is that people often make excuses for religion's having spawned terrorism, war, and child abuse while impeding scientific progress, the spread of knowledge, and free thinking . . . and the defenses they put forth in favor of religion are often either a) not actually assets or b) don't actually belong to religion. Hitchens goes around the whole buffet of theism, not just focusing on the big three (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) but also on smaller religions and even Eastern spiritualism. He gives tight, undeniable examples of how religion has influenced (for the worse) politics and held mankind back, claiming lives and riches and power in the name of . . . er, whatever god happened to be in power at that time and place. He did a very good job showing how human nature came through regardless of religion in the past and exactly how ""poisonous"" religion can be and has been, and while it is in-your-face enough that it will offend believers to the point that they won't read it, he does make some very good points.In an important chapter in the book, Hitchens points out that religions worldwide are guilty of impressing a false world view on people who can't know any better (most notably children), and that they frequently bring up blood sacrifice to teach followers that their sins can be paid off through something/someone else's suffering, and that they impress a very damaging impression of inherent guilt to make followers scramble for forgiveness, and that they will be eternally punished or rewarded for making their choice, and . . . of course . . . that what God wants of them is IMPOSSIBLE (without the religion's help, of course!). I've always thought it's awfully convenient that religion introduces the idea that you're poisoned with this sinfulness due to how you couldn't help being made, and that of course the only way to get inoculated is with the antidote the religion happens to have. Hence the verse in ""Amazing Grace"": ""'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved!"" It's like lying to a kid that there's a monster in the closet, then setting yourself up as a hero because you gave him a weapon to protect him from the monster.The aspect of Hitchens's book that I enjoyed most was how easily it showed the similarity between very different religions. If a believer should read it, it might give him pause to think about why he is nodding along with Hitchens when he debunks other religions, but fights against accepting his logic when it has to do with his own religion. I would basically have to quote most of the book in order to show the many places I am in agreement, but just suffice it to say that love him or hate him, this is an important book and it's worth reading if you want a no-nonsense, non-preachy, straight-up honest book about the many ways belief in God (and the ensuing religions) has affected humanity for the worse."
114,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59285925-sarah-waller,2,"While I agree with many of Hitchens initial arguments, I couldn’t get past the first 50 or so pages. The derision he holds for people of faith was too distracting and unappealing for me to continue reading."
115,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62172903-josiah-m,1," Hitchens’s Wit Far Exceeds His Arguments Had the purpose of “god is not Great” been to provide an extensive assortment of clever zingers and witty sayings, I would have given this book a four out of five stars. Unfortunately for Hitchens it appears as if he was attempting to provide a solid argument against theism. Sadly, this book is completely bereft of any solid arguments for atheism or arguments against theism. This is arguably the worst popular book in support of atheism in the 21st century. Even the works of Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris provides better arguments for atheism. The book consists almost entirely of ad hominem, straw man, genetic, and red herring fallacies. For example, chapter 2 (entitled “Religion Kills”) focuses on bad things done in the name of religion. This entire chapter is a red herring because even if ALL religions promote violence (which is very doubtful) this does not mean that atheism is true. Secondly, Hitchens seems to forget that one should not judge a religion by its abuse. For example, Hitchens’s routinely mention bad things that the Catholic Church has done but he fails to realize that the moral evil that the Catholic Church has done was not in accordance with their Holy Book but was in violation of the most basics tenants of Christianity. Chapter 13 (entitled “Does Religion Make People Behave Better?”) is yet another example of a red herring. The question should not be what makes people behave better but what religion (if any) is true! In additions to entire red herring sections of the book, Hitchens litters the remainder of the book with trivial and irrelevant topics such as, was Thomas Paine a Christian, was Einstein a Christian, was Thomas Jefferson a Christian, was Sir Isaac Newton a Christian, and was Martin Luther King Jr. motivated by his faith or his humanism. These topics are completely irrelevant to the truth or falsehood of religion. His tendency to desperately search for like-minded atheists reeks of the appeal to authority fallacy.  This book is full of wit but devoid of content. It will make you chuckle but it will not make you think. Atheists seeking reasons for atheism should search elsewhere (I can think of at least four superior 21st century atheists to read from) and theists looking to challenge their beliefs shouldn’t waste their time with this inferior book of ramblings. "
116,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4771058-eric,1,"I’ve only read two or three chapters in their entirety. For the remaining pages, I just skipped many pages, jumping from sections to sections or chapters to chapters. I can see Hitchens certainly is very knowledgeable about this topic, and he seems to have done so much research and thinking about this. But then I saw no point in reading this book. The only reason I read this book is because it was chosen for my nonfiction bookclub; I would never ever voluntarily choose to read this book because it's just pointless. It offers no practical or useful insight; rather, all of its chapters, sentences and sections seemed to be geared toward that one purpose of arguing how religion poisons everything, as the title says.I would rather read the kinds of books that actually enlighten, enhance me, serving practically useful and meaningful purposes. I see this book of Hitchens’s as offering none of those; it’s more like a gigantic argumentative essay (and much of it was also written as if it were the author’s journal, written in a very long-winded or overblown way). Also, I don’t know if it was just me, but I frequently felt an arrogant vibe from his writing. He seemed to be trying to show off his broad knowledge about this matter and how generally well-read he is.Aside from how I thought the book was pointless and meaningless with no practical value, I thought the book was over my head purely in the language's point of view (English is not my native language). Each chapter had many advanced vocabs and various background info/knowledge I was not yet aware of. Perhaps once I learn and master all the ideas and concepts of fields like classic philosophy, history and other similar disciplines as well as manage to stay on top of current affairs, then this book will feel less way out there (though, being a molecular biology major, I could at least relatively much easily follow his arguments having to do with evolution and other scientific disciplines). But then, I would not ever want to return to this book! If I ever did, then it would be only to compare my own viewpoint about this matter with his own. Before I read this book, I was agnostic; I still am agnostic after reading this book, though it feels not perfectly accurate to say that I've read this book because I just glossed over and skipped lots of chapters."
117,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17568571-ray-mabry,3,"To be completely honest from the start, I didn't finish the book. I took on this book about a year ago. Being agnostic, I thought that this book would be impossible to peel away from, but after getting a couple of chapters in, reading it felt like walking up a steep hill. I didn't care for the book's premise first off. I don't believe religion is a tangible thing capable of poisoning everything it touches. I think that it is something that has arisen from the human psyche and had man never invented religion, many of the social issues past and present that we struggle with would still exist today People just wouldn't be able to use their religion as an excuse. Humans have been and will always be incapable of coexisting in perfect harmony. Of course, I was willing to look past what appeared--to me--to be faulty logic from an otherwise intelligent man.But the book only held my interest on a chapter by chapter basis. I skipped around a lot, reading only the chapters that caught my eye. The arguments never quite hit home for me. The aha moments could be counted on one hand and at times the book felt stale. I had expected many novel arguments from a fresh perspective but I was left with nothing more than the same old, same old in a shiny new wrapper. I also didn't understand why he chose this book to show off his extensive vocabulary. While I enjoyed learning quite a few new words, I felt it not only slowed the pace of the book down but it came off as pretentious. It's one of the things I (as well as many writer's reference authors) feel writers should shy away from especially when putting forth a polemic for the masses to digest. He could have taken a more measured approach to his word choice that still would have let his intellect shine through. This book was a huge let down for me personally. It didn't meet my expectations at all. But it gets three stars for the effort as well as its ability to advance the argument against organized religion. Even if the advancement is just a nudge.The only people that will find his work impressive are those that haven't heard much of the atheist/agnostic argument, haven't questioned organized religion or are thrilled when they hear their own beliefs reiterated to them by someone with ""stature"". I'm Glad I didn't pay for it."
118,0446579807,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39797-rose,4,"Say what you will about Chris Hitchens (and I do, often), he can write one hell of a book.I really didn't expect to like this book as much as I did because I don't really care for Christopher Hitchens, and I find atheist authors like Sam Harris to be overbearing, over-alarmist, over-everything...And Hitchens is overbearing and prone to exaggeration to prove his point. But in his case, it works for him. There's no false modesty (or any other kind of modesty) in his tone. He lambastes the world's religions in a way that convinces me that they deserve it. This book was therapeutic for me to read, as an atheist. And it was even funnier when, after reading it for a few hours, I walked home with my radio headphones and tuned into some absurd fundamentalist Christian radio program devoted to debunking those dirty skeptics and atheists. It was a nice and surreal juxtaposition.I'm not done with the book yet, but I intend to be before the year's end in two days. Below are some the the quotes from this book which I absolutely loved.----""From a plurality of prime movers, the monotheists have bargained it down to a single one. They are getting ever nearer to the true, round figure.""""What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence."" (This is a recurring theme.)One the idiocy of the argument ""from design,"": ""Fish do not have fins because they need them for the water, any more than birds are equipped with wings so that they can meet the dictionary definition of an 'avian'.""Called to testify against the canonization of ""Mother Teresa,"" Hitchens wrote, ""Although the then pope had abolished the famous office of 'Devil's Advocate,' the better to confirm and canonize an enormous number of new 'saints,' the church was still obliged to seek testimony from critics, and thus I found myself representing the devil, as it were, pro bono.""""[Islam] makes immense claims for itself, invokes prostrate submission or 'surrender' as a maxim to its adherents, and demands deference and respect from nonbelievers into the bargain. There is nothing - absolutely nothing - in its teachings that can even being to justify such arrogance and presupposition."""

The Crusades were picnics?This must be written for the people of Middle Earth. The faithful will never get past the offensive fallacies (and they may not understand words longer than ‘transubstantiate’); to the Philistines this is preaching to the choir—they know it all already (and luxuriate in big words because it justifies their existence); that leaves the undecided in the middle—and I am not sure the arguments presented are clear enough to convert the pabulum addicted irrational double-wide half educated nit wits who consider a Chevy on cinder blocks a lawn ornament towards any particular argument.Bill Mahar made the psychosis of religion at least palatable with ‘Religulous,’ which unfortunately will, once again, not be seen or read by the people who should. At least it is clever and witty, unlike this book which is dull and fatuitous, with a few clever little snarky bits. (Not enough snark for the buck, unfortunately.)The author uses a scorched earth process which denigrates any arguments he tries to make. We get it. We know religion fucks things up. It’s important to bring examples to our attention, but why make us feel so dirty in the process? A little less arrogant perhaps? A few sentences in English instead of convoluted prosaic gobbledegoop? Ayn Rand reads better than this shit.Christopher Hitchens is not so great.But if he were . . . could he edit half the book to the bowels of hell and leave us with something worth reading?Did I mention I have an opinion?"
