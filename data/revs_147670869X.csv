0,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may,4,"I feel bad that I joked about this book in my review of Ninth House and made it seem like a boring read all about how transistors are made. It seemed funny at the time, but it was entirely misleading. This book was not boring at all. In fact, I would say some chapters were difficult to put down!The Innovators is NOT a comprehensive history of all computer and Internet-related technology; I feel the need to stress that now. It takes a very specific route - from Charles Babbage to Google, by way of Turing, Hopper and Berners-Lee - a route which is about showing the major players in America's journey to the Digital Age. It is very easy to read it and think ""Wait!! What about so-and-so and whatshername"" and ""Ohmygod, it's all about freaking America!"" It's limited, is what I'm trying to say, and Isaacson is pretty open about that from the beginning. He knows he'd need a good 10,000 pages to come close to adequately portraying this history in full, so he's stuck with a few big names.What he sacrifices in breadth, he makes up for in depth, which is personally how I like my books to be. This was a fascinating book about several fascinating people, some of them not fascinating in a good way. Though it also sent me down a number of Internet rabbit holes, it has to be said. I felt compelled to look something up and then would end up neck-deep within mathematical theory…I find the story of how we got from a Victorian polymath to the current ever-expanding technologies of today deeply fascinating. I love how the author shows how it was such a collaborative effort. It is actually impossible to truly pin down who invented the computer or the Internet because it all relied on so many different people's inventions and ideas. I loved reading about all the different influences-- rural tinkerers taking machines apart, America's nuclear program, anti-establishment hippies... and Ada Lovelace.Say what you will, but Ada Lovelace is a fascinating person. Whether you give her more or less of the credit for inventing computer programming, she was clearly a genius, and a kinda odd individual. But it's just a real good story, isn't it? That one of the two earliest computer visionaries and programmers was a woman called Lady Lovelace, the daughter of none other than Lord Byron. How delightful. I definitely think sometimes the amount of time allotted to certain people had more to do with whether Isaacson could get/read an interview with them, than to how important they actually were. It is odd to me that Atanasoff (who never got his machine to work) was given more than three times as much page time as Konrad Zuse, who built the world's first programmable computer. It also reads a little strange when Isaacson skims over the Manchester Baby, the world's first electronic stored-program computer.But I'm nitpicking. I really enjoyed reading The Innovators and learning more about all these incredible people. I was especially glad that Isaacson gave the female programmers the attention they deserved. Many people don't know this, but almost all of the first computer programmers were women (because men didn't realise the importance of ""software"") and, despite working hard on machines like the ENIAC, they were still excluded from men-only celebratory events. Glad to see them given names and voices in this book.I liked this so much I think I'll read Leonardo da Vinci soon. Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"
1,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/141355-john,3,"[Note added 23-Feb-2017: This seems to have a lot of likes, but I want to make sure that people understand that my perspective is a bit specialized. The book is lively and very interesting. If you want to read a provocative and detailed story of innovation, this is a great choice. I think the full story requires some extra reading, which I note in the review. The book has its limitations, but it's still a ""good read.""]Regrettably, I can't give this a great review.In part, it depends on what you want. If you want a history of innovation from the point of view of the winners -- the people who created the technology we use today -- then this book might be for you.But I would strongly recommend that you read some other books: Katie Hafner's When Wizards Stay Up Late; John Markoff's What the Dormouse Said; Steven Levy's Hackers.Isaacson hits all of the main highlights of the development of digital technology from Ada Lovelace to Google. In terms of new contributions, his treatment of Lovelace is much broader than what one normally gets, and he's very good on the women who worked as programmers for Eniac and the like. That's good. Additionally, there is new interview material that provides details that I haven't seen elsewhere: For instance, the book notes that both parents of Tim Berners-Lee (inventor of the web) were computer programmers, and that TBL was an electronics nerd as a kid. The quotes from people like the founders of Google are a bit looser than usual. I like that.Yet there are three big problems here:(1) First off, this is a history of the victors, and its extremely ""presentist"" in that it privileges things that are our technology today. Thus people like Jef Raskin and Ted Nelson are essentially buried. Yes, there are a few words on Nelson, but he deserves more like 10 pages, and Raskin gets one mention. Raskin was the true originator of the Mac; he deserves way more credit. Another example: Gopher. The Gopher protocol, which predates the web, was extremely important, and, arguably, would have been more useful for certain kinds of information browsing. Yet another thing that is scanted (as in so many histories that involve computer-mediated communication) is the depth of social sharing on time-sharing systems; it was a big deal and seems to be just outside the view of most historians. I think Isaacson's canvas is large and this would have complicated his story.(2) The discussion of bidirectional information transfer is very weak. It comes up on p. 300 with regard to Lee Felsenstein and the free speech movement. People like Felsenstein thought computer networks would change society because they might provide for ""broadcast"" from the citizen. Despite the advent of blogs, twitter, etc., the dominant model has been ""publication"" (as Isaacson rightly points out from his personal experience editing Time online - 420-422). But I think Isaacson makes a big mistake to not talk at significantly greater length about how bidirectionality was lost in the early history of the network. To be sure, he does get into the blogging phenomenon, but it is weak because so focused on a single individual (Justin Hall). Anyway, the concern isn't even so much about individuals contributing content, but the very structure of the Internet and the policing of ""uploads"" (for example, your broadband provider gives you a lot less data quota for upload than download). Obviously the missing figure here is Nicholas Negroponte, who long advocated for true bidirectionally for communication - his key case was always video out of the home, so grandparents could easily send movies to their kids. A similar gap to the lack of spadework to uncover the deeper interest in bidirectionally is the discussion of how Mosaic/Netscape never had a decent editor that might provide for easily composing web pages from the browser (see p. 418). This wasn't just an issue for the Berners-Lee: It was a howl coming from the early adopters of browsers. (The lack of such editors also points out limitations in the standards track and how RFCs cannot really turn the industry.)(3) Finally, the biggest argument in the book: That innovation comes from teams and groups, not from individuals (479-488 and elsewhere). The qualifiers for this claim are huge. The biggie is that he means: ""successful"" innovation, i.e., innovation that has gone mainstream. Clearly there were plenty of team innovations that weren't absorbed by the marketplace. Shouldn't we then acknowledge how teams can fail? Additionally, what is meant by ""teams"" and ""groups"" isn't solid. Isaacson admits as much when disrupting his own claim by outlining ""three ways that teams were put together in the digital age"" (482). Sorry, you can't have your lumping claim, and then at the end of the book break it down. You can make the claim about three modalities of team innovation at the beginning of the book and then show it: But pulling this canard out at the end of the book is just not fair.In sum, if this is the only book you're going to read, it's OK. But the real story is bigger and Isaacson's take on all this is slanted and focused way too much on the technology we have, rather than the technologies we might have. I don't think asking for that is asking for a different book, either, because Isaacson is interested enough in the losers to mention them. His book would have been immensely richer by giving them their due to the tune of perhaps 50 additional pages over the whole book."
2,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3675162-j-l-sutton,4,"<>“But the main lesson to draw from the birth of computers is that innovation is usually a group effort, involving collaboration between visionaries and engineers, and that creativity comes from drawing on many sources. Only in storybooks do inventions come like a thunderbolt, or a lightbulb popping out of the head of a lone individual in a basement or garret or garage.” Walter Isaacson's The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution is an enjoyable and worthy study of an oftentimes overlooked history. There were several things I appreciated about Isaacson's approach. Echoing the quote above, there is a consistent theme in this book about how nerdy talent was gathered to generate ideas and power innovation. Hearing about the eccentricities of this nerdy talent was sometimes as interesting as the innovations themselves. I also liked that Isaacson began with Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron, and didn't just drop her in the first chapter, but found ways to show how her contributions are still relevant. Finally, there was nearly a whole chapter on Pong. No way anybody could come up with a better game than that! 3.75 stars"
3,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21548113-lillybooks,2,"I loved Isaacson's Benjamin Franklin and Steve Jobs biographies. I really, really wanted to love this one. In a sense, this book is at least a four star book because Isaacson wants to prove a point and he succeeds: no one person invented the computer or the Internet, that the digital revolution is one person building on and with the backs of others. However, it is that success that made this book not as enjoyable for me because Isaacson is profiling so many people, several each chapter, that their stories get lost one behind the other and the details get confusing. He is never truly able to do what he excels at: the slow, deep biography, a discussion of how each life event shaped the person as a whole. Also, even though I agree it was necessary, I wasn't that interested in reading all the technical details of how each idea and machine was slightly different than the one before it. I found myself skipping those parts. Maybe someone with a strong computer programming or mathematical bent would enjoy it, but that's not why I read an Isaacson book. One chapter soars here: the first, on Ada, Countess of Lovelace. Isaacson allows her a chapter all to herself, and it's the version of his writing I know and love. I would have much rather read an entire Walter Isaacson biography of Ada Lovelace."
4,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,4,"A masterful tour of the creative people behind the development of computers and the digital revolution using a frame that probes the relative contributions of teamwork vs. individual genius. As I continually benefitted the ever increasing capabilities of computers from the 70s onward for my former science career and I enjoyed Isaacson’s biography of Ben Franklin, I figured I couldn’t lose. Plus friends praise his skills in the history of science as revealed in his books on Einstein and Steve Jobs. I wasn’t disappointed, given that he inevitably had to focus on highlights and distillations to cover his intended scope. His story of the “pioneers, hackers. Inventors, and entrepreneurs” who made the evolution possible makes for exciting reading even if you are not technically oriented. That’s because it’s a human story, mixing the personal history behind the ambition and dreams and the energy of both competitive and collaborative forces. The story begins with Ada Lovelace, who teamed up with Babbage in Victorian England to conceive of generalized programming routines that could control a calculating machine. They never built a working machine, but their theoretical concepts were seminal by the time the build-up toward World War 2 was driving scientists ever closer to a working computer to make calculations important for waging war. Turing’s innovations on code-breaking machines, mathematical advances by John von Neumann, and adaptation of punch card programming from the textile industry for calculation routines of room-sized electromechanical computers represented big breakthroughs. From there it was short jump to an all-electronic system based on vacuum tubes and then a big leap to faster and denser logic circuits made possible by the invention of transistors. Major milestones in the form of the first multipurpose memory units, the first central processing component, and first program stored in memory were paralleled by advances in software languages and operating systems to translate logical operations into machine code. The invention of integrated circuits made possible an exponential leap in computing power and opened the door to smaller, personal computers which in turn fed into the development of spreadsheets and graphical design programs for business and games for fun and soon thereafter networking and the Internet. It’s all quite a dizzying progression, one that changed the world. And Isaacson brings to life, albeit in a compressed presentation, the many individuals and teams who made it happen. There is no great insight in his use of a lens of collaborative vs. individual contributions, but it was surprising the way the combinations of skillsets played out in various accomplishments. Sometime it’s a mathematician and an engineer that make a successful team, other times it’s the addition of a people manager or business promoter that makes the difference. The synergy between Gordon Moore and Andy Groves at Intel, Bill Gates and Paul Allen at Microscoft, and Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak at Apple are just some of the obvious examples. Isaacson also explores the differences and similarities of the environment of various settings of great advances, including: Bell Labs, where the transistor was invented; IBM, where mainframes and business programming were developed (which denied sufficient glory to women programmers like Grace Hopper); Penn State, where the first general purpose electromechanical computer was creates; Xerox PARC, where the first graphical user interface was designed; and Apple Computer, which married hippie chic and Silicon Valley cultures. Another theme Isaacson pursues is the whole concept of artificial intelligence and “thinking machines” vs. Lovelace’s prediction that computers will forever serve to amplify human creative capabilities. The potential for computers to empower the individual drove many to pursue software development without the profit motive. The story of Steward Brand harnessing the Whole Earth Catalog and hippie culture to advance this cause was fascinating. The birth of shareware through the work of Stallman and Linux and the free contribution of the first web browser by Andreessen are great hallmarks of that tradition worth my learning more about. The story of the birth and success of Wikipedia was something I knew nothing about and fun to learn about. All in all, I found this a solid achievement in laying out such a vast river of innovation in a coherent and stimulating progression. It’s so easy to forget where all these wonders came from that it’s worth putting some names and personal stories to the history."
5,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,3,"The basic premise of this book, is that innovators and inventors do not create new concepts solo. They are almost always collaborators. But, there is not a surplus of collaboration described in this book. This was a fun, entertaining book to read. In the beginning of the book, the innovators were described in detail, in historical order. But, as the chronology approached the present day, less and less space was devoted to individual innovators, and more to the innovations. I really enjoyed an earlier book by Isaacson, Benjamin Franklin: An American Life. In that book, I really was able to understand the man and his accomplishments. However, this book covers too much ground, and ends up being less than satisfying. I ended up understanding the life of the first personality covered in the book, Ada Lovelace, but not much else. Perhaps if the author had not tried to cover every single person he considers to be an innovator, and to go into depth about the most interesting biographies, it might have been better."

I loved hearing the stories of collaboration, outright copying, business machinations and cool combinations of art and technology. I really like the whole Shockley, Noyce, transistor, microchip era. And then the section on the early homebrew groups contending ideologically with Gates and Jobs is good too. Isaacson's overt theses are that collaboration, not isolated geniuses account for progress and innovation. Secondly, he makes a case for why artificial intelligence/computing combined with human intelligence is much more powerful than just computers.1st read : 10.16.2014-10.26.2014What a pleasure. An absolute pleasure of a read.This book is all about the history of computing and the people behind it all. There was a time when kids grew up taking apart and putting together HAM radios and getting chemistry sets with cubes of germanium inside. This book made me a bit jealous of that basic understanding of technology and I have to admit that after the reading the portion on diodes, semiconductors and microchips I spent an entire Saturday online learning about the basic physics and chemistry involved in that process. Then I went back and reread the sections and I felt better about my understanding of the history and the science.Isaacson is great at bringing these hackers and geeks to life. Alan Turin, Grace Hopper, Vannevar Bush, John Mauchly, Ev Williams. A lot of new heroes were brought to life for me reading this book. I'd recommend this to anyone who has ever felt that gnawing feeling about not quite understanding the basics about the digital world that surrounds us. For me, this was a great tour that inspired me to dig deeper into some of the science and appreciate more of the history.Some ket takeaways:1. One theme present in most of the breakthroughs was a form of collaboration or batting around of ideas. ""Sparks come from ideas rubbing against each other rather than as bolts right out of the blue."" ""That is the way that good ideas often blossom: a bumblebee brings half an idea from one realm, and pollinates another fertile realm filled with half-formed innovations."" 2. As Vannevar Bush points out, there is strength in the triangle of military, industrial, and academic research. The government should fund and help enhance hybrid research centers that emulate Bell Labs, RAND, Stanford Research Institute and Xerox PARC. Basic research is a necessity for continued breakthrough innovation. On top of all this the crowd (open source) is a necessary competitor with private tech. This is a healthy rivalry and moves us forward.3. The best innovators are the ones that stand at the intersection of the arts and the sciences. 4. Electrons/protons + And/Or gates with diodes and resistors are the basic building blocs of all of our digital devices. ""To this very moment, that is the way every single digital device on the planet works at its most basic level."" - Steve Wozniak""Once you've made something with wire and nails, when someone says a chip or circuit has a relay you feel confident using it because you know you could make one... Now kids get a MacBook and regard it as an appliance. They treat it like a refrigerator and expect it to be filled with good things, but they don't know how it works. They don't fully understand what I knew, and my parents knew, which was what you could do with a computer was limited only by your imagination."" - Tim Berners-Lee5. Social and collaboration is the under-riding theme of the internet and personal computer. Starting with The Well through to Medium today.6. The internet could've been radically different if it would've been established with two way links. Look at pages 418-419.7. The most productive teams are those that brought together teams with a wide array of expertise, both theoretical and applied.8. Physical proximity is always best, people should have to bump into each other and rub off on each other.9. If you want to make money, it's all about execution. Pretty good ideas are a dime a dozen and even brilliant ideas are not worth much if you can't get your team to build it right.Things I'd like to remember:Man, Vannevar Bush is cool. Read his As We May Think article from 1945. It's kind of like the manual for everything that happened over the next sixty years and I bet there are still dozens of his predictions still waiting to be executed on. ""When I got a copy of Vannevar Bush's 'As We May Thing,' I said to myself, 'Yep, there it is! He figured it out!' Bush envisioned the Internet as fully as you could, given that you didn't have digital computers."" - Marc AndreessenThe science behind a diode and a semiconductor is super tricky. I spent six hours last Saturday reading and watching Youtube videos about silicon, germanium, boron, arsenic, pnp, npn, diodes, electricity, and a triode/semiconductor. I still would like to see a big one in action and get a walk through of a real life example of how it stores a charge and how that charge can be used for Boolean logic processing, because I don't fully understand it yet. My kids should learn about electronics by playing with radios and transistors.My kids should get to play with (safe) chemicals.My kids should learn to code with an Arduino (or whatever the equivalent is when they are old enough).My kids should be around other kids that are making things (robots, programs, etc.)Send kids to a Montessori school (both Sergey Brin and Larry Page attribute their early growth more to Montessori schooling than their parents style).Kids should learn physics. Kids should get exposure to the arts and should be encouraged to embrace the intersection, not one particular street. All of the above things that my kids should learn should be things I know about and can do with them."
7,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt,4,"In his latest book, Isaacson offers the reader an insightful look into the world of technology and the numerous people whose insights and innovative ideas have changed the world in which we live. While not the biography of any one person, Isaacson personifies technology and offers stories related to its branches, from the early speculative ideas of Ada Loveless around a mechanical calculating device through to the dawn of Wikipedia and mass-user self-editing. Isaacson travels through time, specifically since the pre-WWII era to the present, to offer tales of innovative ideas that built on one another. Things the reader would take for granted become major events and received excellent backstories. One thing Isaacson does throughout his tome is to dispel the myths that urban legends have spun into faux-realities, including Al Gore inventing the internet. He further lays the premise that the entire book should be taken as a set of technological building blocks, one device or idea connecting to the next, such that there are not true 'inventors' but strict innovators who seek to add a niche to a larger conversation that takes place in an evolutionary reality. Those who seek to claim inventor status are quashed in Isaacson's narrative and by the scores of men and women who have added to the technological quilt. Any reader with a curiosity surrounding technology should invest time in this book, though be somewhat leery of some technical jargon that can weigh down the narrative for the layperson.As Isaacson presents in his introduction, some of these ideas came during his research on the Steve Jobs biography, the first of his that I devoured. Isaacson's desire to downplay any one person wearing the crown of inventor, he passes out the praise to all those who played a role in their own way, and does so in an effective manner. The narrative flows nicely, even if it is weighed down with jargon in spots. This jargon is highly useful, however, as it depicts the degree to which many of the actors were ensconced in their fields. The reader can read (or listen) in awe to all that Isaacson has unearthed, proving how interconnected something as routine as internet access and application usage. Perhaps one of the best, and most varied of the biographical pieces I've read of his, Isaacson does a stellar job in presentation, content, and detail.Kudos Mr. Isaacson for this great piece. I cannot wait what, or who, you tackle next for the reader to absorb.Like/hate the review? An ever-growing collection of others appears at: http://pecheyponderings.wordpress.com/"
8,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6440906-kevin-parsons,5,"This book is going to be huge since it functions not only as a history of the computer and the internet but as a treatise on innovation and collaboration. I can imagine that it will be required reading for all kinds of people working in all varieties of business. Unlike his bio of Steve Jobs, which was important as immediate history but was also understandably rushed, Isaacson's new book reads like a labor of love and is much better written, more focused than ""Jobs"" and is thought provoking on a lot of different levels. I have already told a half dozen people I work with (at a Fortune 500 financial services company) that this book should be required reading when it comes out in October.Rarely have a I read an ARC and felt so frustrated because I have to wait for the book to come out so there are other readers with whom I can discuss it!"
9,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6354112-perry,4,"""Atlantean Shoulders, Fit to Bear,"" John MiltonThis is a grand and gratifying overview of the innovators who have played a major role in forging today's dynamic technology and our high-tech society, with its main focus on the last 80 or so years.Walter Isaacson, who has written bios of Jobs and Einstein, has the brilliant ability to research, comprehend and assimilate all this intriguing and highly complex information and transform it into an inquisitive and fascinating look at our technological Innovators, coherent and clear enough for the average reader to understand AND enjoy. I took away a much more informed perspective of how we got here and a distinct reverence for the innovators in the text and generally for the human capacity for incredible intellect and curiosity as well as our enduring and limitless creativity.The following quote gives the best overview, in my opinion, of the book to an average reader (such as I):""Most of the successful innovators and entrepreneurs in this book had one thing in common: they were product people. They cared about, and deeply understood, the engineering and design. They were not primarily marketers or salesmen or financial types; when such folks took over companies, it was often to the detriment of sustained innovation. When the sales guys run the company, the product guys don’t matter so much, and a lot of them just turn off, Jobs said. Larry Page felt the same: The best leaders are those with the deepest understanding of the engineering and product design.Another lesson of the digital age is as old as Aristotle: Man is a social animal. What else could explain CB and ham radios or their successors, such as WhatsApp and Twitter? Almost every digital tool, whether designed for it or not, was commandeered by humans for a social purpose: to create communities, facilitate communication, collaborate on projects, and enable social networking. Even the personal computer, which was originally embraced as a tool for individual creativity, inevitably led to the rise of modems, online services, and eventually Facebook, Flickr, and Foursquare. Machines, by contrast, are not social animals. They don’t join Facebook of their own volition nor seek companionship for its own sake.... Despite all of the proclamations of artificial intelligence engineers and Internet sociologists, digital tools have no personalities, intentions, or desires. They are what we make of them.” This book is due all exceptional acclaim."
10,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20955173-sean-gibson,4,"4.2 StarsReaders can infer a number of salient points from this excellent history of digital innovation, but the main takeaway for me was this: innovative ideas are like digestive systems—nothing comes from them unless they get a big push from an asshole.Okay, so, the author would probably suggest that his REAL overarching theme is that innovation is driven not by lone geniuses, but by collaborative teams that provide an ideal mix of vision, engineering, and execution, but hey—that doesn’t mean that the aforementioned point is NOT true (see, for example, Jobs, Steve). In tracing the path of key digital innovations—from bulky, room-size computers that could crunch differential equations at astonishing speeds to sleek personal computers, and from proprietary, government-funded interconnected academic networks to the all-you-can-eat porn buffet of today’s Internet—Isaacson persuasively hammers home that theme. More intriguingly, however, he suggests that these innovations were driven not by pure technologists, but by people who understood the need to balance technical proficiency with an appreciation—and application—of the arts. From Ada Lovelace (First Lady of Computing, offspring of that rapscallion Lord Byron, all-around saucy minx) to the aforementioned Steve Jobs (intuitive design genius, turtleneck aficionado, colossal a-hole), the people who have led us into the digital age have understood that both poetry and mathematical equations are equally, if differently, beautiful. Given that I’m the type of person Isaacson gently scolds in his conclusion (that is, a humanities person who takes pride in his lack of math aptitude), this idea is what resonated with me the most. Reading this book made me yearn to pick up a physics textbook and try to crack the code of the universe, to understand the beauty of algebraic expression, to see the art that goes into a perfect line of code. Isaacson is a tremendous chronicler of history (I strongly recommend his eloquent and insightful Benjamin Franklin: An American Life as well as his engaging Einstein: His Life and Universe), and while this hopscotch sort of narrative doesn’t afford him the same opportunity to dive deeply into his subjects as he does in his magnificent biographies, he does his themes justice even if he leaves you wanting a little bit more about certain individuals. It also makes you want Mountain Dew, candy bars, and pizza—you know, the staples of the coder diet. "
11,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22805607-asif,4,"Walter Isaacson is a brilliant writer, he after writing books on Einstein and Steve Jobs was attracted to science and tech world this time he came up with the book on the whole process of innovation. This is very interesting book and it serves two purposes simultaneously;One is it teaches us the history of innovation i.e chronological history of development of the computers from the embryonic concept of computing machine of Charles Babbage and Lady Ada to the sophisticated personal computers and supercomputers and technologies such as internet and Artificial intelligence of today, and on the way author discuss each revolutionary leap in the journey with distinctive chapters on each breakthrough.But the book is not merely a collection of historical anecdotes( although Isaacsonian anecdotal style is absolutely brilliant) this is merely icing on the cake, the real purpose comes to the second objective of the book throughout the length of the book(more than 450 pages tome) author try to establish the point that innovation does not occur in the isolated segments but in the realms where collaboration of different geniuses is directed towards one vision and how to achieve the end result of this collaboration and what are the ways to fail great ideas running out of collaborative teams or brilliant executors and what a manager or innovator can learn to enhance innovation process.For appreciating the importance and usefulness of the book for strategic managers of the modern companies, I would advise to give it an early read to benefit from the generations old and time tested formula of success in innovation and product making vision."
12,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6700518-lorna,4,"The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution by Walter Isaacson was a well-researched and delightfully told beautifully as only Mr. Isaacson can do. I am not a scientist, nor do I even pretend to understand the complex technological science that is encompassed in this meticulously researched book, but I get the thrust of the history of the digital age and all of the people that made most important contributions. I would be remiss if we didn't start with how Isaacson became interested in this book. Having been a fan of Walter Isaacson for some time, I was drawn to his fascination to those individuals that excel in creativity and innovation in many different disciplines. Isaacson has written marvelous biographies of Benjamin Franklin, Leonardo Da Vinci and Steve Jobs. It was in working on those books that he began to recognize that there was a commonality in how they approached their craft. Isaacson dramatically shows us how each person's innovations formed a basis for the next scientist to build upon. As Isaacson states, ""The collaboration that created the digital age was just not among peers but also between generations. Ideas were handed off from one cohort of innovators to the next."" What I found most interesting was the interface between science and the arts. As Walter Isaacson said in the Introduction, ""Finally, I was struck by how the truest creativity of the digital age came from those who were able to connect the arts and sciences. They believed that beauty mattered.""This book is a history of the digital age from its very beginnings beginning with Ada Byron, the daughter of Lord Byron. Her mother was determined that she study mathematics as it was an antidote to ""poetic tendencies"" and her ""Byronic tendencies."" However, Ada with Charles Babbage in the early 1800's were able to set forth many of the basics that were built upon over the subsequent digital age. The science that develops over the subsequent years culminating in the Silicone Valley is well done, right down to the issues of patents and lawsuits. It is a wonderful book that will make us all stop to look back in awe at where we have come in such a short period of time and ponder our future. ""The tale of their teamwork is important because we don't often focus on how central that skill is to innovation.""""The collaboration that created the digital age was not just among peers but also between generations. Ideas were handed off from one cohort of innovators to the next.""The people who were comfortable at this humanities-technology intersection helped to create the human-machine symbiosis that is the core of this story.""""Leonardo da Vinci was the exemplar of the creativity that flourishes when the humanities and sciences interact. When Einstein was stymied while working out General Relativity, he would pull out his violin and play Mozart until he could reconnect to what he called the harmony of the spheres.""""The reality is that Ada's contribution was both profound and inspirational. More than Babbage or any other person of her era, she was able to glimpse a future in which machines would become partners of the human imagination, together weaving tapestries as beautiful as those from Jacquard's loom."""

14,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36199787-jim,3,"2.5 StartsThis book was okay. It covers a lot of history and people and therefore makes it somewhat difficult to rate. It begins with Ada Lovelace, Lord Byron’s daughter, who helped pioneer computer programming in the 1840s. It ends in 2014. That is a lot of history. At times it becomes confusing. There are times when there were developments taking place in multiple locations and usually each involved a team of people. Some of the names were familiar such as Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, Bill Gates and Paul Allen. Others were unfamiliar to me such as John Atanasoff. One of the key points (IMHO) is collaboration. Innovation, development, success came about when people collaborated. Often times one person had the initial idea and someone else picked up on it and ran with it. Xerox PARC had some great innovations but they pretty much stayed in a lab until Steve Jobs saw what they had. John Atanasoff was building a computer in Iowa when World War II started. He was working pretty much alone with the exception of maybe a grad student. He enlisted and the computer wound up in a basement and then years later was salvaged for scrap and parts because nobody knew what it was. In the meantime at the University of Pennsylvania there was a dedicated team working on ENIAC. At the same time in Bletchley Park a team of code breakers were hard at work trying to break the German Enigma code. The point is that innovations and development happened when people collaborated and worked together. It was not the result of a lone person.Another often forgotten fact is the role of women in the history of computers. There is Grace Hopper who was a programmer and invented the first compiler. There was Kay McNulty, Betty Jennings, and Betty Snyder among others who were known as ""the ENIAC girls"". These were some of the first programmers and they were known as ""computers"". The book even discusses Ken Kesey, The Grateful Dead, and The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test. You will need to read the book to learn how this factors into the innovators. There are other interesting tidbits in this book about the early history of computers (e.g. The Homebrew Computer Club, The Tech Model Railroad Club, etc.). It was a bit nostalgic and brought back memories of Heathkits, chemistry sets, and model rockets. There was actually a time when hackers were just kids who were simply trying to learn how things worked. To get inside and under the hood. Overall this was an interesting history of the people who helped bring about computers, the internet, and the web. Tools just about everyone depends on today. "
15,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"Who invented the 'computer'? Many of the early calculating machines were quite specific in the type of calculations they could perform. It was a term once applied to a bunch of (mostly) women math majors using mechanical adding machines to figure out parts of equations during WWII. Mechanical 'computers' (The name wasn't applied to the devices until either late in or after WWII.) were a number of independent mechanical devices including the abacus & Babbage's device in the early 1800s. Babbage's 'computer' was called a 'difference engine' since it solved differential equations, but there were other, more specific types of calculating machines throughout history. Due to the mechanical parts, most were slow & many never really worked well. In the late 19th & early 20th centuries, telephone relay switches were used since they were cheap. Then vacuum tubes were used since they were faster, but expensive & hot. Much of the early 'programming' was done by physically plugging wires into different ports as well as using everything from punched cards (based on automated looms) to paper tape & even film reels. ENIAC was the first general computer (announced in 1946) but it took such a long time to change from one sort of calculation to another that its speed advantage in calculating was lost. It was considered 'all electrical', but many of the systems weren't. It originally had no memory, but later used a tube filled with mercury with a quartz nozzle that could store waves for a few seconds.Isaacson makes it quite clear that it is in large part the times that inspires inventions. The supporting materials & thoughts are all there & people put them together. Rarely, if ever, is there one individual who has a Eureka! moment. Generally it is teams with many disciplines who share ideas. He spends some time describing Bell Labs, the model for Apple & Google offices today. Well funded, relaxed discipline, with a mandate to invent. Theorists, engineers, chemists, mechanics & manufacturing facilities working together. He shows how war, politics, universities, & private industry all have an edge over the lone garage inventor. Coming up with an idea whose time has come is cool, but the idea isn't doodly-squat without the funding to patent, market, manufacture, & distribute. Babbage was the perfect example lone inventor who never got his work into public production. His work languished for a century before being rediscovered & used somewhat. IOW, he is the example of what not to do - work in a vacuum. His work was also too early, too much of the needed supporting technologies weren't up to speed yet.Babbage wasn't quite alone, but he built the hardware & was a man, so he gets the historical credit. Ada Lovelace worked with him & came up with some early programming principles that were finally used & revered a century later by the first programmers, again mostly women, including the iconic Grace Hopper - inventor of the 'bug' among other things such as COBOL. Women were amazingly overlooked in the history books, but they proved that software was as important as hardware. Luckily for them the men in charge didn't realize that, so they were given that unimportant scut work & they shined, even if they were forgotten for a time.Isaacson does a great job of showing how teams worked together & the problems that arose from separate, but similar discoveries. The patent process is a nightmare, often taking decades to wend through the courts before being decided, reversed, & possibly never really settled. Part of this was the new nature of the inventions. (In 2011(?) both Apple & Google spent more on defending patents than on research for the first time.) Few could understand the inventions, much less the ramifications of new tech such as the transistor or the IC. The fight between Texas Instruments (TI) & Fairchild over the latter is a great case in point. They came up with it independently, within a few months of each other, working on similar problems from different directions, & each managed to solve the others issue better than their own.Innovation happens in stages. In the case of the transistor, first there was the invention, led by Shockley, Bardeen, and Brattain. Next came the production, led by engineers such as Teal. Finally, and equally important, there were the entrepreneurs who figured out how to conjure up new markets. Teal’s plucky boss Pat Haggerty was a colorful case study of this third step in the innovation process....Haggerty was a cofounder of Texas Instruments in the 1950's who saw transistors & made a new product that consumers hadn't had before or even realized they needed. In 1954, he sold the Regency TR-1, the first portable radio. The radio came out in 4 colors & was marketed to the public in part to keep up on the news in case of atom bomb attacks by the Russians, but it really made a hit among the younger crowd who could listen to that new-fangled music (rock & roll) their parents wouldn't let them play on the big home tube sets made by RCA - who turned down an offer to take part in this new radio. 15 years later, he did it again with IC's when he told his guys to make a portable calculator. (Haggerty was probably Steve Jobs' inspiration.) While there weren't lone inventors, there were certainly giants in the field & Isaacson does a great job of bringing them to life. Many were outliers of society. Ada Lovelace wasn't as bad as her father, Lord Byron, but she certainly had her quirks. Shockley was brilliant, but he craved the lime light too much & became a racist paranoid which ultimately ruined him. Turing was gay, a crime in his society, & wound up committing suicide. What a waste!In the Video Game chapter, Isaacson finally gets around to mentioning the MIT railroad club & even references Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution which explores this aspect in even more depth. Highly recommended.The age &duration of the visions common in the computer industry are pretty amazing. In 1945 Vannevar Bush wrote an article in the Atlantic titled “As We May Think"".http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/a...“Consider a future device for individual use, which is a sort of mechanized private file and library… A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.""...Bush imagined that the device would have a “direct entry” mechanism, such as a keyboard, so you could put information and your records into its memory. He even predicted hypertext links, file sharing, and ways to collaborate on projects. “Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified,” he wrote, anticipating Wikipedia by a half century.Douglas Engelbart read & was thrilled by this 2 decades later & helped bring it fruition.I was really impressed by the way he handled the Altair, the first personal computer in the early 70s. I've read about it before & never understood why it was such a hit. Software finally is coming into its own as hardware is catching up. Which brings us to Bill Gates & Steve Jobs - the change from sharing ideas to monetizing them. Gates’ savvy in changing software from an afterthought into the driving force, the prime profit maker, is truly incredible. Jobs’ focus on usability & simplicity is, too. Isaacson really brings them to life with all their strengths & warts.On the downside, Isaacson didn't get into business networks & security at all, a gross oversight. Unix dominated networks at first & Novell had a huge presence in the late 80s, but a user had no rights on either network unless specifically granted by knowledgeable techs & businesses paid dearly for them & their support. Neither had a good desktop, if they had one at all. IBM's OS/2 was far better than Win 3.1, but IBM didn't push it nor scale their servers for small businesses. Apple ignored small business & never attracted application software due to their proprietary architecture. Microsoft (MS) sold an easy to use desktop interface that anyone could network & write apps for. Any PC could act as a server & it didn't take much knowledge to set up, so most consumers & small businesses went to Windows. Security was an afterthought until the late 90s, after the WWW connected them all. We've played hell trying to implement decent security ever since, but applications kept us locked in to this OS for all its faults. Still, Microsoft now has over 90% of the desktops compared to a mere 5% by Apple & Linux has even less.He gets into the distinction between AI & computer augmentation several times, but really concentrates on it in the last chapter. He has a point that it's been just around the corner for quite some time, but I'm not as sanguine as he is that it isn't now. Great overviews of the WWW, blogs, & Wikis. This is also a great summation of the book & really tied all his themes together. He shows the combinations of people, funding, & models that worked for innovation & what didn't. Excellent job, well read, & highly recommended. If you listen to the audio book, I highly recommend getting a text copy as well. There are some good pictures & plenty of areas that deserve some study.Table of Contents 	CHAPTER 1 Ada, Countess of Lovelace	CHAPTER 2 The Computer	CHAPTER 3 Programming	CHAPTER 4 The Transistor	CHAPTER 5 The Microchip	CHAPTER 6 Video Games	CHAPTER 7 The Internet	CHAPTER 8 The Personal Computer	CHAPTER 9 Software	CHAPTER 10 Online	CHAPTER 11 The Web	CHAPTER 12 Ada Forever"
16,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,3,"Almost everything we do these days has some link to the world wide web, or involves interacting with some sort of computer, but how did these things become so pervasive and essential? In this book Isaacson writes about the people that made the companies, that made the products that we all now use.Starting on the earliest computer, the Analytical Engine conceived by Charles Babbage, which he made with Byron’s daughter Ada Lovelace. It was a purely mechanical device, made at the very limits of engineering capability at the time. It took another century until the next computers surfaced. A man called Vannevar Bush was instrumental in developing a differential analyser for generating firing tables, followed in World War 2 by the Colossus at Bletchley used for attacking the Nazi Enigma codes. These new room sized contraptions used the old vacuum tube valves, and consumed vast amounts of energy and took large numbers of people to maintain and use the machines.For computers to reach the point where you could get more than one in a room, the technology would need to be miniaturised. The team in America that achieved this using the semi conducting properties of silicon would earn themselves a Nobel Prize. This moment was the point where the modern computer age started, especially when it was realised that there could have a variety of components, and therefore circuits on a single piece of silicon. These new microchips were initially all taken by the US military for weapons, but as the price of manufacture fall, numerous commercial applications could be realised.Some of the first products that used microchips that the general public saw were calculators, but as engineers started to use their imaginations almost anything was possible. The coming years saw the development of the first video games, personal computers that you could fit on a desk and the birth of the internet. Most of these innovations came out of one place in California that we now know as Silicon Valley. It formed a new way of working too, with unlikely collaborations, spin offs and the beginning of software and hardware companies that have now become household names.It didn’t take too long for people to start wanting to hook computers together. The original ARPNET was a military network, but it soon had links to academia and not long after that the geeks found it. It was still a niche way of communicating, until Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web with hypertext linking, and the world was never the same again.Isaacson has written a reasonable book on the history of computing and the internet, and the significant characters and people who discovered or made things, or who just happened to be in the right place at the right time. He covers all manner of noteworthy events right up to the present day. Mostly written from an American centric point of view, it feels like a book celebrating America’s major achievements in computing. Whilst they have had a major part to play, they have not had the stage entirely to themselves; there is a brief sojourn to Finland about Linux and CERN with Berners-Lee there is very little mention of other European. There are some flaws though. He doesn’t mention the dark net or any of the other less salubrious activities that happen online either; ignoring them doesn’t make them go away. There is very little mention of mobile technology either. It was a book worth reading though, as he shows that some of the best innovations have come from unlikely collaborations, those that don’t follow the herd and those whose quirky personalities and way of seeing the world bring forth products that we never knew we needed.

17,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7500226-john-blumenthal,4,"I must confess that I did not finish this book—the technical stuff did me in. This has happened several times before. (Note to self: do not try to read books involving motors, cathode tubes, quantum mechanics or how to screw in a lightbulb.) Science has never been my forte, although I am fascinated by it so I buy these books (Innovators, Tesla, Einstein) and always regret it. I did learn a thing or two though. For example, I discovered that a woman named Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, an English mathematician and writer, worked on an early analytical machine and foresaw the development of modern computers. And this was in the 1840s. Also, the book informed me that women were generally better than men at creating software.I often use these two tidbits of information to impress people at parties and dinners. Unfortunately, on one occasion, I recounted these fascinating facts to a gentleman who had read the entire book, and rather than being forced to admit my woeful ignorance, I excused myself and walked off to the bathroom.

What is unusual about that statement, is that I have been very critical of internet during different stages of my life, but Walter Isaacson is one of my favorite historians and so I decided to read the bookMr Isaacson's biography on ""Einstein"" allowed me, after nearly six decades on this planet, to understand Einstein's amazing theories with very little effort. His Biography on ""DA Vinci"" is one of the greatest biographies I have ever read about another human being. In fact, his revelations about DA Vinci go hand and hand with ""The Innovators"" and his name is brought up repeatedly and the final picture in this amazing book is a DA Vinci drawing of the Vitruvian Man.DA Vinci, unlike Michaelangelo, loved to collaborate with other artists, musicians, actors, and scientists and that is one of the reasons he is considered one of the greatest, complete, geniuses who has ever lived and Michaelangelo, a loner, is a mere shadow in the presence of DA Vinci.""The Innovators"" is a story that began over 150 years ago with Ada Lovelace, daughter of Lord Byron, whose interest in both science and the humanities, foresaw what would eventually lead to the digital age (computers, the internet, the web). Her interest in calculating machines, algorithms, poetry, and music and her collaboration with Charles Babbage, a mathematician and inventor would be the genesis of the digital age and the vision and foundation that would eventually morph into the world wide web.Over the next 150 years there would be notable names as the military (government) Academica (MIT, Yale, Stanford, Harvard) and entrepreneurs (Gates, Allen, Jobs, etc.) contributed to this amazing revolution in science but it was never one individual but a collaboration of thousands of gifted men and women. There was never a great leap, but a steady, at times painstaking, process from rudimentary computers to high speed computers to personal computers, and then to the software and operating systems, and finally to the world wide web and companies like Google.Computers were originally seen as machines that would create communities of people in which they would make it easy to exchange ideas. It was to be free, and in fact the creator of the world wide web never patented his creation. Of course, over time the free exchange of ideas and inventions were patented and individuals like Jobs and Gates became billionaires, creating empires.Mr. Isaacson's book is like an encyclopedia, mixed with the poetry and music, that Mrs Lovelace first envisioned. It is about the creative process, teamwork, and contributions and insights from many different fields of science and the humanities. It is like a giant collage that looks like Mr. DA Vinci's ""The Vitruvian Man."" It is an extraordinary book and a very important book."
19,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8676317-a-man-called-ove,3,"2.5/5 First things first - This is the book to recommend to your CA friends if they have recommended you a book filled with economics/accounting jargon that made it frustrating for u.This is a history of the computer industry - both hardware and software. Picked it up a year or so earlier, found it too dry and gave it up. This was my second attempt at reading the book. Loved Steve Jobs' biography by the author recently and so decided to read the book in reverse order, with the latest technological development first. The second half of the book is on software technologies and you will not get the book unless you are a computer (software) engineer. However this part was fun to read for me, especially the chapter on personal computer software featuring Gates,Jobs and Linux and would rate d 2nd half 3.5/5The first half of the book is on hardware with a lot of electrical & electronics engineering and mathematical concepts thrown in. This was the first and major problem. Really frustrating but speed-read it. Remember I dropped it earlier ! 2/5The core theme of the book is that the computer industry has progressed not because of individuals but because of teams/collaborations. So it features a no. of personalities and their birthdates and their mom/dads and their childhood geniuses with each of them learning calculus in kinder-garten. And only to have the personality discarded after a couple of pages sometimes. This was the second problem. Perhaps any1 trying to write such a book should consult A Short History of Nearly Everything on how it is done. "
20,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8251675-aman-mittal,5,"There is no doubt that the computer and the internet are one of the most important innovations of our era. Without them, I would not have written this, and you won't be reading this either. In spite of that, computers should be considered only the second most important innovation, as important as Gutenberg's wooden printing press. Accessible to most, easy to learn, part and parcel of everyone's life nowadays.Walter Isaacson's recently published THE INNOVATORS takes a reader back in the times of Romantic Era or Romanticism, during which much emphasis was given to the artistic and literary originators. One of the key figures of that era was Lord Gordon Byron whose daughter turned out to be one of the first to acknowledge of what we today call 'Technology'. Ada Lovelace, is chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognised as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine. Because of this she is often called the world's first computer programmer.The book tracks the stories in a linear perspective, from the 19th century-- Lovelace and Babbage to Alan Turing, ENIAC, John Von Neumann, to Ethernet and Xerox, to Gordon Moore, Robert Noyce, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Linus Trovalds, Tim Berners- Lee, Sergey Brin and Larry Page. He covers almost all of these people and how their creativity helped them harness not only their goals, but also the clear and visible difference brought in an entire culture of people as well as formulating the digital era. Many of their innovations are now important aspect of an individual's thinking, his actions and his overall growth. Imagine, the usual life without internet. This is a story of individuals with brilliant ideas. There is sometimes collaboration of people, sometimes when people work on their own and yet at the end of it all, the reader is left with more clarity on them and the various eras in which different ideas were shaped and formed. There have been countless books written on the digital era, the one that constitute us as segments but Walter Isaacson’s book is different in the sense that he takes a complete look at the innovators, the geniuses, the hackers, and the geeks and what they did and did not do to make their contributions in the digital era. The Innovators is a book which looks at everything, right from the start, to the middle and the future of entrepreneurs and creative geniuses.Along with her love for machines, Ada Lovelace is the first known specimen of ""Poetical Science"", a term used by Isaacson in the concluding pages of his book quite relevantly. ""We humans can remain relevant in an era of cognitive computing because we are able to think different, something that an algorithm, almost by definition cannot master [...]"" -Walter IsaacsonThis is well said, and there is no point of argument that instead of considering artificial intelligence the ""holy grail"" and concentrating all our efforts to make a machine better than us which is not a feasible aspect because of a reason that a machine and a human can never think on the same grounds. No matter how much more efficient a computer can become in storing numerous amount of data and calculating numbers that a human mind in normal terms cannot proceed, a computer will never be able to think creatively and sense enormous feelings using an imagination a human has. Computers are just ""brilliant idiots"" as they will do what you tell him to do. Even as a human, we need art as much as we need science. The art provides us the conscience that lead up to the creativity and science provides the intelligence that can add up to that creativity. These two different looking cultures do intersect and it is our job in this era to understand how they intersect since only then the next phase of Digital Revolution will bring more and new methods of merging technology and creativeness. Using machines intelligence supported by human's creativity is the only way to materialise our future. ""This innovation will come from people who are able to link beauty and engineering, humanity to technology, and poetry to processors. [...] it will come from people who can flourish where the arts intersect with the sciences and who have a rebellious sense of wonder that opens to the beauty of both."" -Walter Isaacson on the intersection of art and technology."
21,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6749260-abhishek,4,"The 'Digital Revolution' has been a long journey which continues moving forward even today, which has had innumerable number of heroes, some of them crossing paths and some of them working alone. There is an underlying interconnection amongst each of the great achievements in the digital age, which can only be seen when someone takes a step back and looks at the whole big picture. That is what Walter Isaacson has bravely attempted to do in his book The Innovators. To try to capture this complex and huge story in itself is a mammoth task, but to finally manage to put quite a lot of it in a book and make sense of it all is praise-worthy. The Innovators shines on account of Isaacson's hardwork in his research and his ability to make the story simplistic but interesting. The Innovators charts the journey of the Digital Revolution from the 19th century when Charles Babbage and Lady Lovelace attempted to write a program for a machine to perform a task upto the present day where millions are connected through personal computers and the power of the Web which is only growing bigger and faster. This journey has had many splendid moments, be it the creation of the transistor, the evolution of the microprocessor, the advent of personal computer, the ability to connect computers through packet-sharing networks, the rise of software when Microsoft came into dominance, the brilliance of Apple products, the growth of collaboration through Wikipedia and many more. Walter Isaacson takes us through the entire evolution of the Digital Age from infancy into becoming an essential part of our lives. In many places, he talks about the importance of collaboration, and how the Revolution has been brought about not by one man or a few, but by many teams who worked tirelessly to attain their visions. There are quite a few places though, where I felt Isaacson ended up repeating his points a bit too often, which makes the book a good 50-pages longer than was required. Nonetheless, if you have an interest in this topic, if you would love to know how that laptop on which you are googling things came to be, then there can be nothing better recommended than The Innovators. The whole story is way too big for one book to capture but The Innovators should do more than enough to get you interested and make you seek out more!"

Full Review
I added this book to my list after listening to Mr. Isaacson better know work: Steve Jobs. Jobs was fascinating and that book was well written, but I always feel like he gets way too much credit as an innovator.This book was a nice counter to that. While Jobs is mentioned as appropriate, he focuses mostly on the people whose technical knowledge led to the personal computer, the internet and eventually the smart phone.That said, he does spend time talking about the important of those like Jobs. People who are are to recognize, nurture and market a good idea so it has a chance to make an impact. In fact one of his main themes in this book was how much better innovation works in a team setting than it does with a lone genius.The book is pretty extensive in its coverage. It starts back with Eda Lovelace and ends with the rise of smart phones and social media. There were a lot of details and people I was already familiar with from other computer history books I've read, but there was a lot of material in this book that was new to me.I'm awful at names, so I can't rattle off all the key people, but the way Mr. Isaacson's went about telling the history worked really well for me. I love that he spent time on both the hardware and software and even did a brief chapter on video games. Overall I found this an excellent book both for people completely unaware of computer history or for people like me who are looking for a deeper dive than some other books on the subject."
23,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5979619-boudewijn,4,"In this book, Walter Isaacsson explores the lives and works of famous and less famous hackers and pioneers, that are responsible for our digital revolution.

24,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5765949-mark-jr,5,"Somehow some writers of biography end up sounding trite, both in their relating of their subjects' stories and in the lessons they draw from them.Isaacson is not one of these writers. The word that comes to my mind to describe him is ""complementarity."" His powers of anecdote selection complement his keen ability to distill insight from them. I thoroughly enjoyed his Steve Jobs biography and felt that this set of biographies—of people and of the technologies they created—complements the Jobs bio very well. It expands the vision of the power of humanity and technology working together, humanities and science, to include the many people beyond Jobs who show this power. Innovation comes from collaboration, from the complementarity of visionary and practical minds. And now that we have technology, innovation comes from the combination of human and machine strengths.Isaacson's narrative is fascinating, moves at just the right pace, and genuinely helped me understand the history and the current state of the technological world I live in. It was kind of funny to hear the back stories I never imagined behind technologies that just seemed to suddenly exist when I needed them: Blogger, Google, packet-switching. I will remember this book."
25,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10737996-sarju-shrestha-mehri,5,"Walter Isaacson is such a great writer and a researcher. Coming from none technical background, this book really gave me the bigger picture of technology world; its beginning and its future. How devices we use in our daily lives are the products of many creative genius, visionaries and restless ambitious minds. Also, many of these work are the contribution of collaboration, respect and stealing the best ideas from each other.I am very impressed how Isaacson credits and acknowledged the first woman computer programer, Ida Lovelace. He reveals each of the major Eureka! moments with mini biographies of the great minds during the cultural revolution in technology. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and took time to reread some of the paragraph to its fascination. However, I grapple with the fact that how many women contributors are not known to the world and in middle schools. It is about time that girls see themselves like Ida Love Lace, Grace Hopper ((first Cobol programmer) and Jean Jennings and Betty Snyder (who program Eniac) as role models.The whole book is a wonderful piece of well-researched history on how the ideas from one time moved to another influencing innovations when people worked collaboratively. It is a must read for everyone."
26,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7132141-lori,5,"Fantastic read. Although at times I think Isaacson is simplifying a bit too much for the sake of brevity, he provides a wonderful service here in handing us the sweeping narrative of the Digital Age. The story itself is riveting, and Isaacson basically just gets out of the way of it. Throughout he takes time to suggest lessons about innovation. To some, perhaps, that will seem annoying and intrusive. To me, it was the best part of the book. Innovation happens when collectives of humans with complementary gifts and passions unite to create something to solve a problem. A simple concept, really. Obviously not ""easy,"" or history would not be littered with the carcasses of failed companies and inventions. Isaacson's final chapter is a gem. He concludes with a beautiful invitation to follow Ada Lovelace's passion for ""poetic science,"" a meld of art and STEM. Or to quote his final paragraph:""This innovation will come from people who are able to link beauty to engineering, humanity to technology, and poetry to processors. In other words, it will come from the spiritual heirs of Ada Lovelace, creators who can flourish where the arts intersect with the sciences and who have a rebellious sense of wonder that opens them to the beauty of both."""

Isaacson covers the transistor, the microchip, microprocessor, the programmable computer and software. He also covers videogames, the internet and web, search engines, touch screens taken together it is called the digital revolution.The digital revolution has changed many things for all people. Some people call this the third industrial revolution. The first based on coal, steam and iron, the second on steel, electricity and mass production.The author tells the story of how the digital revolution happened, through the accomplishment of many individuals. Isaacson draws attention to organizations that, for a time hosted groups that were more than the sum of their individual parts. At the “idea factory” that was AT&T’s Bell Labs the physicists John Bardeen, Walter Brattain and William Shockley created the transistor, the fundamental building block for the microprocessor. It has been called the most important invention of the 20th century. The creative teams at Intel, the key company in development of the microprocessor industry and Xerox-PARC probably the single most fertile source of electronic innovation in the 1970s, they created the Ethernet, the graphic user interface, and the famous mouse. Texas Instruments created the personal calculator. The creation of demand for personal devices has blossomed.It was Robert Oppenheimer, who at wartime Los Alamos so effectively found ways of getting scientists with radically different fields, skills and personalities to work together in designing the atomic bomb. Bell Labs, Intel, Xerox-PARC continued this team approach with great success. Silicon Valley took team innovation, venture capital, Stanford and University of California Berkeley Universities put them together to create what is called the “Ecosystem”. The authors shows how Silicon Valley took this “Ecosystem” of innovation and turned it into a powerful pool of creative revolutionThe author tells of Gordon Moore’s “Law” predicting the doubling of a microprocessor’s power every year and half focused energies on a goal that was authoritatively said to be attainable. Bill Gates foresaw that hardware could be commoditized.  Isaacson tells of mathematician Ada Lovelace, daughter of poet Lord Byron, as she set out to create analytical engines. Isaacson weaves his enormous amount of research into deftly crafted anecdotes into gripping narrative about these imaginative scientists who transformed our lives. The book is a fun and informative read. I read this as an audio book downloaded from Audible. Dennis Boutsikaris did a good job narrating the book."
34,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,2,"I can't say I enjoyed this books as much as Isaacson's biographies of Einstein and Steve Jobs. I guess I would have liked to stay on each story/innovation for a longer period of time, but then the book would have been too long. Considering all of the information he crammed into a single book, I say, Well Done! I would read anything by Isaacson. He is a fantastic writer. Innovators provides a history of the many important figures in technological history. He covered those who helped us create the first fully electronic digital computer, ENIAC, at Upenn, through innovators who brought us the Mac. He provided a wonderful section on Turning (I would like to see him write an entire biography of Turning's life). He had an interesting take on Loveless. Some things he included were bits I had not heard before. Of course, once the computer was up and running, there were plenty of innovators who enabled us to use computers to connect with the entire world. From blogging to Twitter,Wikipedia, and Google, Isaacson covered many of these wonderful innovations. Absolutely worth reading.--------update------It's been a year since I read this book, and one thing that keeps nagging at me is Isaacson's portrayal of Ada Lovelace. So many brilliant men were also fairly vocal about their intellect. Take Isaac Newton. He had an extremely high regard for his unique intelligence. He often bragged that since he was born on Christmas Day, God had bestowed him with the special gift of superior intelligence. He really did think himself superior to every other scientist. And yet, we revere Isaac Newton. But, if Ada Lovelace publicly announced that she is superior in intelligence, many make sure to take her down a few pegs. Isaacson certainly did. Some brilliant men also had strange beliefs. For example, James Watson believed that DNA came here from aliens. Isaac Newton believed that he could turn urine into gold. Yet, we still revere these geniuses and gloss over anything that was unflattering, adding it as just a side story to their genius. The treatment of Ada Lovelace in this book is why women in science are written out of the history books. Isaacson made sure to highlight any of Ada Lovelace's flaws, which served to downplay her significant contribution to science. She indeed was the first programmer in the world. She saw something that no one else in her time could see, just like Isaac Newton, just like Einstein. And yet her contribution is devalued. "

39,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2098105-matt-hartzell,4,"I've come to greatly enjoy Walter Isaacson. I previously read his work on Steve Jobs, and The Innovators was a very nice follow-up. Isaacson writes in a pleasant, enjoyable and enticing manner, finely riding the line between big-picture themes and ideas, and the small, intimate stories that really make history interesting. The Innovators chronicles the history of computing and the rise of the digital age. As a software engineer, I found much in this book to be new and interesting, even though it's about the industry I've been immersed in for over a decade. Isaacson covers a broad range, from the prehistoric beginnings of computing in the 1800s, all the way through the rise of Intel, Apple, Wikipidia and Google. At almost 500 pages, Isaacson still could have gone into more detail in some areas, but his pace keeps the narrative moving right along. One of the biggest impressions left by the book is the sheer number of people that contributed to the digital revolution. Today we often only hear about a couple names: Jobs, Zuckerberg, Gore (kidding). Yet, the path that brought us to where we are now is rife with a vast multitude of incredibly smart, creative, insightful people. Issacson does a great job of calling out a whole bunch of them and diving into the details of what made them tick. Surprisingly, many of them came from the midwest, an area of the country that isn't getting much respect in the current political climate.I'll refrain from discussing more of the story, but there are some interesting takeways for me. For one, I continue to ruminate on the idea of chronological snobbery (as coined by C.S. Lewis), the idea that the thought, reasoning and science of decades past is inherently inferior to our current level of knowledge. Isaacson dispels such nonsense in the opening chapter on Ada Lovelace, who in the 1800s envisioned much of what the modern computer is today. We're not as smart as we think we are, and it's possible those who came before us were not as dumb as we assume them to be. Speaking of Lovelace, what The Innovators also pressed upon me was the incredibly significant role that women had in the rise of computing. This was a novel concept for me, considering that technology-related fields and industries are often overwhelmingly filled with men. In fact, my own field of computer programming was originally thought of as women's work during World War II! Men worked on hardware, and left the less important details, like telling a computer what to do, to be handled by women in the office. This is humorous to me. Software now reigns supreme, while hardware is secondary, and what was previously devalued is now valued more than anything else in the field. I feel proud to be a part of this stream, and it makes me more appreciative of women who continue to step into an industry mostly dominated by men. I also loved how much Isaacson wrote about artistry and creativity, something that seems at odds with transistors and digits. Yet, it's true that many of the most important figures in computing history were also artists, had a love of art, or were just brilliantly creative. The narrative is also filled with many duos and teams comprised of people who had skills from one side of the coin or the other, working together to create amazing things. For all the individual geniuses and ""A ha!"" moments, the digital revolution exists today largely because of collaboration, teamwork, creative thinking and problems solving, and the furthering of previous ideas in consistently incremental ways. We are better together than we are alone.Computing is almost synonymous with living, in our world today. You confirm that every time you pull out your phone to check Facebook, read a blog, buy something on Amazon, or stream a video. Underneath this thin veneer of functionality that is now so commonplace are a distinct set of complicated problems, both in hardware and software. If you want to know more about the people and the creative ideas that solved these problems and literally brought the entirety of human knowledge to a device that slips into your pocket, you should read The Innovators.Special thanks to one Brent Strandy, for gifting me this book!"
40,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6392144-herve,5,"The Innovators by Walter Isaacson is a great book because of its balanced description of the role of geniuses or disruptive innovators as much as of teamwork in incremental innovation. “The tale of their teamwork is important because we don’t often focus on how central their skill is to innovation. […] But we have far fewer tales of collaborative creativity, which is actually more important in understanding how today’s technology evolution was fashioned.” [Page 1] He also goes deeper: “I also explore the social and cultural forces that provide the atmosphere for innovation. For the birth of the digital age, this included a research ecosystem that was nurtured by the government spending and managed by a military-industrial collaboration. Intersecting with that was a loose alliance of community organizers, communal-minded hippies, do-it yourself hobbyists, and homebrew hackers, most of whom were suspicious of centralized authority.” [Page 2] ”Finally, I was struck by how the truest creativity of the digital age came from those who were able to connect the arts and sciences.” [Page 5]The computerI was a little more cautious with chapter 2 as I have the feeling that the story of Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage is well known. I may be wrong. But chapter 3 about the early days of the computer was mostly unknown to me. Who invented the computer? Probably many different people in different locations in the US, the UK and Germany, around WWII. “How did they develop this idea at the same time when war kept their two teams isolated? The answer is partly that advances in technology and theory made the moment ripe. Along with many innovators, Zuse and Stibitz were familiar with the use of relays in phone circuits, and it made sense to tie that to binary operations of math and logic. Likewise, Shannon, who was also very familiar with phone circuits, would be able to perform the logical tasks of Boolean algebra. The idea that digital circuits would be the key to computing was quickly becoming clear to researchers almost everywhere, even in isolated places like central Iowa.” [Page 54]There would be a patent fight I did not know about. Read pages 82-84. You can also read the following on Wikipedia: “On June 26, 1947, J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly were the first to file for patent on a digital computing device (ENIAC), much to the surprise of Atanasoff. The ABC [Atanasoff–Berry Computer] had been examined by John Mauchly in June 1941, and Isaac Auerbach, a former student of Mauchly’s, alleged that it influenced his later work on ENIAC, although Mauchly denied this. The ENIAC patent did not issue until 1964, and by 1967 Honeywell sued Sperry Rand in an attempt to break the ENIAC patents, arguing the ABC constituted prior art. The United States District Court for the District of Minnesota released its judgement on October 19, 1973, finding in Honeywell v. Sperry Rand that the ENIAC patent was a derivative of John Atanasoff’s invention.” [The trial had begun in June 1971 and the ENIAC patent was therefore made invalid]I also liked his short comment about complementary skills. “Eckert and Mauchly served as counterbalances for each other, which made them typical of so many digital-age leadership duos. Eckert drove people with a passion for precision; Mauchly tended to calm them and make them feel loved.” [Pages 74-75]Women in Technology and ScienceIt is in chapter 4 about Programming that Isaacson addresses the role of women. “[Grace Hopper] education wasn’t as unusual as you might think. She was the eleventh woman to get a math doctorate from Yale, the first being in 1895. It was not at all uncommon for a woman, especially from a successful family, to get a doctorate in math in the 1930s. In fact, it was more common than it would be a generation later. The number of American women who got doctorates in math during the 1930s was 133, which was 15 percent of the total number of American math doctorates. During the decade of the 1950s, only 106 American women got math doctorates, which was a mere 4 percent of the total. (By the first decade of the 2000 things had more than rebounded and there were 1,600 women who got math doctorates, 30 percent of the total.)” [Page 88]Not surprisingly, in the early days of computer development, men worked more in hardware whereas women would be in software. “All the engineers who built ENIAC’s hardware were men. Less heralded by history was a group of women, six in particular, who turned out to be almost as important in the development of modern computing.” [Page 95] “Shortly before she died in 2011, Jean Jennings Bartik reflected proudly on the fact that all the programmers who created the first general-purpose computer were women. « Despite our coming of age in an era when women’s career opportunities were generally quite confined, we helped initiate the era of the computer. » It happened because a lot of women back then had studied math and their skills were in demand. There was also an irony involved: the boys with their toys thought that assembling the hardware was the most important task, and thus a man’s job. « American science and engineering was even more sexist than it is today, » Jennings said. « If the ENIAC’s administration had known how crucial programming would be to the functioning of the electronic computer and how complex it would prove to be, they might have been more hesitant to give such an important role to women.” [Pages 99-100]The sources of innovation“Hopper’s historical sections focused on personalities. In doing so, her book emphasized the role of individuals. In contrast, shortly after Hopper’s book was completed, the executives at IBM commissioned their own history of the Mark I that gave primary credit to the IBM teams in Endicott, New York, who had constructed the machine. “IBM interests were best served by replacing individual history with organizational history,” the historian Kurt Beyer wrote in a study of Hopper. “The locus of technological innovation, according to IBM was the corporation. The myth of the lone radical inventor working in the laboratory or basement was replaced by the reality of teams of faceless organizational engineers contributing incremental advancements.” In the IBM version of history, the Mark I contained a long list of small innovations, such as the ratchet-type counter and the double-checked card feed, that IBM’s book attributed to a bevy of little-known engineers who worked collaboratively in Endicott.The difference between Hopper’s version of history and IBM’s ran deeper than a dispute over who should get the most credit. It showed fundamentally contrasting outlooks on the history of innovations. Some studies of technology and science emphasize, as Hopper did, the role of creative inventors who make innovative leaps. Other studies emphasize the role of teams and institutions, such as the collaborative work done at Bell Labs and IBM’s Endicott facility. This latter approach tries to show that what may seem like creative leaps – the Eureka moment – are actually the result of an evolutionary process that occurs when ideas, concepts, technologies, and engineering methods ripen together. Neither way of looking at technological advancement is, on its oqn, completely satisfying. Most of the great innovations of the digital age sprang from an interplay of creative individuals (Mauchly, Turing, von Neumann, Aiken) with teams that knew how to implement their ideas.” [Pages 91-92]Google about Disruptive and Incremental InnovationThis is very similar to what I read about Google: “To us, innovation entails both the production and implementation of novel and useful ideas. Since “novel” is often just a fancy synonym for “new”, we should also clarify that for something to be innovative, it needs to offer new functionality, but it also has to be surprising. If your customers are asking for it, you aren’t being innovative when you give them what they want; you are just being responsive. That’s a good thing, but it’s not innovative. Finally “useful” is a rather underwhelming adjective to describe that innovation hottie, so let’s add an adverb and make it radically useful, Voilà: For something to be innovative, it needs to be new, surprising, and radically useful.” […] “But Google also releases over five hundred improvements to its search every year. Is that innovative? Or incremental? They are new and surprising, for sure, but while each one of them, by itself is useful, it may be a stretch to call it radically useful. Put them all together, though, and they are. […] This more inclusive definition – innovation isn’t just about the really new, really big things – matters because it affords everyone the opportunity to innovate, rather than keeping it to the exclusive realm of these few people in that off-campus building [Google[x]] whose job is to innovate.” [How Google Works – Page 206]"
41,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,4,"I was unaware of the hype surrounding this book, but was made immediately so when my dad, newly literate in his retirement, was baffled that no one else in the family had heard of it. If other people like it then it can't be good, so I went in a skeptic, but came out pretty pleased. This is a solid, well-researched history of the personal computer and the Internet that does a reasonably good job of arguing that technical innovation is not about singular geniuses who pluck inventions from the aether and bestow them upon us, the knuckle-dragging plebeians, but about small teams of collaborators who manage to catch the wave of their cultural and technological moment. Historians call the former notion the Great Man theory and, to my knowledge, discredited it as absurdly simplistic long ago. Technologists, however, have been slow to catch up, and we still worship the idea of far-sighted founders gazing deeply into the Platonic flames they've lit in the deep, darkened depths of some suburban garage (will I stop mixing metaphors? Probably not.). Isaacson himself has written several such works of idolatry-I-mean-biography (I suppose they pay the bills, but... does he really still need to pay the bills?), and explicitly says in the intro that he's trying to get away from all that, so good on him for bringing an old idea to a field that needs it (even if it's not, itself, that innovative).Interestingly, I often found myself thinking of Daniel Dennett's Darwin's Dangerous Idea, and now that I've reminded myself what that was all about, it seems kind of obvious. Among other things, Dennett, argued that what we think of as engineering and design are not like evolution by natural selection, they are in fact essentially the same process. Just as one does not simply jump directly from bacteria to dolphins in a single step, Isaacson argues that you don't just get Macintoshes out of nowhere. They were built on a long history of experimentation, collaboration, failure, success, and selection (by the market as much as by simple functionality).I liked his repeated deemphasis of the importance of ideas. In his own words, ""conception is just the first step. What really matters is execution"" (p. 365). In this case he was citing Steve Jobs' admission that he'd ""always been shameless about stealing great ideas,"" specifically that Apple stole Xerox's GUI concept, as an example of a good idea poorly executed by the people who thought it up. I basically agree with this, even though it's taken me a while to get there, since I believe pretty strongly in giving credit where it's due. I really only have a few ""innovations"" to which I could lay some claim, but none of them are really very innovative. What sets them apart is that my collaborators and I actually implemented them. Ideas are cheap, and talented labor isn't, so I've lost a lot of sympathy for people who claim they thought of something first. Who cares. Acting on good ideas is what matters.Isaacson also took some occasional dips into describing different leadership styles among innovators, which seemed intriguing at first given that I've recently found myself in the rather bizarre situation of managing two people (sort of), but most of his commentary boiled down to platitudes like ""One useful leadership talent is knowing when to push ahead against doubters and when to heed them"" (p. 163). Indeed. Not quite ""actionable,"" in the parlance of such folk.I found his techno-utopianism and unwillingness to even mention some of the downsides of all this innovation to be somewhat off-putting, which is why The Word Exchange (a novel in which the purveyors of smartphone-like DNA computers infect humanity with a DNA virus that makes them unable to use language) made an excellent pairing for simultaneous reading. I would have appreciated more investigation into the failure of innovators to guard against the unprecedented control personal computers and the Internet allow centralized powers (corporations, governments) to have over us, especially given their origins in the dream of expanding personal powers of organization and computation, and survival of outside attack through decentralization. What about the innovations in culture, in practice, in beliefs that have been fostered by the Internet, and how are they faring in the privatized, undemocratic corporate fora of Facebook, Twitter, etc. that we've come to rely on for community, information dissemination, and political discussion? He touches on open source technologies and where Wikipedia came from, but why haven't those values of freedom, self-determination, and collaboration permeated the Internet more broadly?You could easily read this history as a tragedy of the counterculture, how the innovative work of anti-capitalist anarchists has been almost entirely co-opted and diluted by profiteers. Instead of The Well we have Facebook. Instead of a culture of empowered hackers we've become dead-eyed iPhone junkies ghost-lit and hunched, thumbing mindlessly for the next hit of content. A cynic might claim that the cultural innovations died, and the technological innovations that persist increasingly serve to re-enforce the old culture of central authority and control. We are not Vanevar Bush's connected intellectuals, or homebrew hackers who ""believe in rough consensus and running code"", so what happened?These are largely cavils from a bitter, bitter old man (me). On the whole this is interesting history, well worth learning for people who don't know it, and worth re-learning for those who think they do. There was a recent TTBOOK episode on similar themes for those interested.SOME NOTES""Certainly a computer is nothing but a huge concentration of trivial matters."" J. Presper Eckert, from http://purl.umn.edu/107275, p. 74One of Isaacson's more interesting side points was that property has served innovation well for hardware, but not for software (at least software related to the Internet). He thinks this is because large corporations were better able to combine the multiple requirements for innovations in hardware, from materials science to logistics to marketing to sales, whereas software had fewer costs and requirements. Does the advent of small-scale manufacturing technologies, community hackerspaces, and the maker movement change that at all?p. 341 Bill gates wrote this letter to hobbyists that were appropriating his proprietary software in 1976. I laughed, both because it seems perfectly reasonable, and because people have been stealing his software ever since.Isaacson writes that ""The rise of Apple marked a decline of hobbyist culture,"" (p. 353) which he finds lamentable, but I'm not sure he goes far enough. It's interesting that some of the most revolutionary hardware devices in personal computing also hinder further revolutions because the people who use them cannot understand how they work (have you ever tried to pry open an iPhone?). In some ways the maker movement is a reaction to that trend in hardware, but is it leading to new technological revolutions?""The WELL was a model of the type of intimate, thoughtful community that the Internet used to feature."" I know I basically made a similar argument above re: Facebook, but it's slightly different: I actually think intimate, thoughtful communities exist on Facebook and elsewhere on the Internet. I feel like by being somewhat choosy with my Facebook friends, I can have interesting and substantial discussions there (not often, I'll grant, but sometimes). What bothers me is that I have no control over the the venue for such discussion. If I don't like the fact that Facebook can sell ads based on what I say there, I can't change that, and I can't really just go to another social network, because those friends aren't all on other social networks. It's a centralized, undemocratic system. Which, I know, is ironic, since I run a similar system, but I try to be a benevolent despot with an open ear.""Before the Internet came along, most people barely wrote anything at all for pleasure"" Clive Thompson from http://archive.wired.com/techbiz/peop..., p. 427."
42,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111511883-rose,4,"This book validated FR and SMA requirements, and made me glad I took even just one CS class in college. I'm sure I would have gotten a lot more out of it if I understood more deeply the science behind the innovations described, but the bare minimum basic knowledge that I do have (thanks CS 105 and high school calculus) was sufficient for me to at least appreciate their ingenuity and importance. This book in general was a pleasure to read, and the author struck an impressive balance between detailed description and overarching themes, all the while weaving in vivid character portraits and keen insights into not only science and technology but also social dynamics and human nature. The main take-away of this book that I particularly appreciated was Isaacson's assertion (which he states outright at the beginning, but then lets the history he describes prove him right) that innovation is as much a function of context as it is of individual genius. This elevation of the importance of collaboration, disparate viewpoints, and basic social interaction amongst people of differing professional backgrounds/expertise debunks the overplayed trope of the ""lone inventor."" Isaacson repeatedly argues that a union of scientific and artistic expertise is needed. Every invention, this book proves, is dependent on far more than just the first person to write about (or, more often, monetize) the final product. Besides collaboration, Isaacson also emphasizes the role played by societal and cultural context in facilitating innovation, and the key facilitating power of the government and military in aiding the realization of various innovative leaps into realties. The most obvious example is the early discussion of the military's (especially the Navy's, woo, and wow live love Grace Hopper) role in World War II. This stands in contrast to the final phase of innovation discussed in the book, namely the rise of Silicon Valley and the age of personal mobile devices. His main point is that a combination of government support, private interests, and peer-to-peer sharing produces innovations better than a sole reliance any one.But here again Isaacson points to an overarching theme: he describes how the Internet naturally became by demand collaborative and open-sourced rather than centralized because humans' ""desire to socially network not only drives innovations, it co-opts them."" I found the rumination on human instinct (and need) for connection and community to be touching and somewhat optimistic (but at the same time deeply sad) given today's context of hyper-polarization, weaponization of the online information space, and the use of those tools—which Isaacson views as resulting from our most communal instincts—to achieve divisive and violence-inciting ends. Isaacson perhaps is grasping at straws to remind readers that community-building and connection were the original exigence of the Internet age's innovations. At one point he comments ""sometimes innovating involves recovering what's been lost."" I hope that the threads traced in this book aren't yet tied up, and that current/future innovators work to attain and regain those connective impulses. "
43,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12885473-darian-onaciu,3,"From Ada Lovelace's father, lord Byron, to Alan Turing, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and especially the many many others you might not have heard of, this book tells the story of the computer and internet revolution through the eyes of its numerous contributors.The way innovation is achieved has a central role here. It's barely the case of some lone scientist or inventor working in his attic or basement. Instead, credit goes to the throngs of unnamed people, some of them presented here, who, by working in teams with suitable leaders, manage to bring innovation forth.The prose flows easily and although I'd be curious of more details in certain areas I realize that its length would become troublesome.I loved the way Isaacson intertwined the love for arts with the passion for science & technology. It's people or combinations of people with bits of both who managed to bring forth real transformations.I'll insert a quote from the book which I think describes how the next 10 years will look like*:""The next phase of the Digital Revolution will bring even more new methods of marrying technology with the creative industries, such as media, fashion, music, entertainment, education, literature, and the arts. Much of the first round of innovation involved pouring old wine—books, newspapers, opinion pieces, journals, songs, television shows, movies—into new digital bottles. But new platforms, services, and social networks are increasingly enabling fresh opportunities for individual imagination and collaborative creativity. Role-playing games and interactive plays are merging with collaborative forms of storytelling and augmented realities. This interplay between technology and the arts will eventually result in completely new forms of expression and formats of media. This innovation will come from people who are able to link beauty to engineering, humanity to technology, and poetry to processors. In other words, it will come from the spiritual heirs of Ada Lovelace, creators who can flourish where the arts intersect with the sciences and who have a rebellious sense of wonder that opens them to the beauty of both.” This is worth reading if you're curios about the origins, the evolution and the people standing behind the two driving forces which shape our current world.Notes*I'm currently several years into watching a company which seems to meld together art and science & technology. They're called Magic Leap and they'll release the first product this year. Fingers crossed so that Mixed Reality technology will bring people together instead of having them blankly stare at a screen like that's the case now. "
44,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8906990-al,5,"Last year my bestie Lori asked if I had read this book. She mentioned Ada Lovelace and Babbage so I thought I had. But I hadn't. This year I resolved to not only read 75 books, but I would read a non-fiction a month. So when I realized I had not read the Innovators, it seemed like the perfect one to start with since I loved Isaacson's Steve Jobs book.Let me start by confessing that I am biased. I run an Information Technology organization for a hospital system, so I know about computers. But it goes deeper than that. In the 70's I built my own computers (an IMSAI and Altair and later a Heathkit). I learned BASIC on a TRS-80 then COBOL on an IBM/AMDAHL mainframe. I wrote Shareware, was a SYSOP, and developed network protocols. So I have been around computers for most of their major achievements.When I read about Babbage and Ada Lovelace (daughter of Lord Byron) I became obsessed. Soon I had other heroes like Grace Hopper (who I met in a Navy Computer Conference in Virginia Beach) and Alan Turing. I remember watching Blade Runner and commenting on the use of the Turing Test (which hadn't really been known by many at the time). Now that you know my background, maybe you might discount my clear love for this book as only bias. But you would be wrong!While the Innovators feels like a story of my life it is actually the story of our modern day life. You are reading this on a computer of some type (smart phones and tablets count) using a browser and social media. As I am fond of telling the Doctors and Nurses at our hospitals, very little in our lives does not involve a computer. This is OUR story, I have just been a part of it longer than most.Walter Isaacson weaves the story of computers with an amazingly deft hand. There are literally thousands of people that helped evolve the computer to what it is today. Dozens of these people have a larger role in the evolution. With the sheer number of people, you would think that it would be long and boring, but Isaacson gives you the interesting tidbits of the people and then discusses how they worked together or in some cases competed to bring about the digital Revolution. While I would have liked to seen more on a couple of my heroes (like Grace Hopper) and maybe more about some of the computers along the way (IMSAI and Amiga get just a whisper), I understand the need to edit this down. There are many other innovators that Isaacson could have included or had gone into more detail on those that opposed the way things went (like Ted Nelson). The reader is left to maybe explore these amazing people in more detail in other books with a much narrower focus.But what I think this book is really good at is explaining the world of computers without getting too bogged down in the technical details. This makes it approachable for readers that are not computer savvy and dare I say might spark some excitement for learning how to use today's technology to better their lives and possibly inspire others to make their own innovations."
45,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5672051-brahm,5,"Isaacson had put together a great mass biography of the key players (no: innovators!) who helped develop the technology of today - from early analytical machines to transistors to personal computers to the world wide web.His angle is that while lone geniuses have existed, much of the innovation we enjoy was delivered by great teams in great environments, incrementally expanding capabilities that others had built up in the same way.Informative, captivating, definitely appealed to my geeky side, but I think anyone would find it fascinating. Almost makes me wish I was a few years older to have experienced the early internet - bulletin boards, etc (I was online in a limited way in... 98? 99? But it was well into the browser era. Go Netscape!)I've loved several of Isaacson's other books and this one did not disappoint."
46,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33473038-heath-salzman,4,"I’ve come to really appreciate Isaacson’s writing. This book got off to a slower start, but picked up steam quickly. Or rather, I lacked interest initially but was soon enthralled by the story Isaacson was weaving. This book is a great volume to reference in order to understand how the personal computer and internet arose. I highly recommend. The only downside of Isaacson’s style is that he has a tendency to reference the other figures he has written about (typically Jobs, Da Vinci, and Einstein but never Kissinger for some reason) in ways that seem forced. I guess that’s just what happens when you spend a lot of time learning about specific individuals. "
47,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13641087-brian-kramp,5,"The most fascinating fact I learned in the book is that the transistor radio was invented at a time when music tended to be controlled by the parents in a home thanks to a single large radio in the house. Then when the pocket sized transistor radio was invented, and teens could choose their own music, guess who happened to come along to popularize Rock and Roll? Elvis Presley. Makes you wonder how much of his success can be owed to timing.I'm surprised at how fascinating this history of the computer and the internet is. From the visions of Turning, to the creating of the transistor, to the creation of computers, software, and the internet, this book is full of some amazing history that everyone should know. I highly recommend it to everyone. It's well written, and if you work in this industry like I do, it should be required reading. I was surprised at how much I did not know. I think that with a better title and cover, this book could have been much more successful."

Every chapter launches into extensive, unnecessary detail about too many individuals, making it difficult to track the important people, stories, and details; thus the book is really challenging to follow. Much of the content/history of innovation was fascinating, and I really wanted to like this book, but I wasn't able to given how densely packed the writing was."
49,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2405292-roberta,4,"I received this book free through GoodReads First Reads. In short, the book is a history of, and the people behind, personal computing and the internet. In the beginning there was Ada Byron, the Countess of Lovelace. A chapter that should have been entirely focused on her contained altogether too much information about her father, who was a confirmed Luddite. She never met her father and, for the purposes of this book, we didn't need to either. Richard Atanasoff is generally credited with inventing the first electronic digital computer as early as 1939 but only after a law suit to establish that fact ended in 1973 because he did not patent his invention. In this book, Iowa State University's patent attorney (Richard Trexler) is blamed for the oversight but not by name. This namelessness was apparently a concession to other sources that say Iowa State dropped the ball by not budgeting adequate funds to fill out and submit staff patent applications. Since I've been alive for a great deal of the time period covered by the book, it was interesting to read some of the behind-the-scenes stories but the author's point of view is somewhat more positive than mine. page 91 there is an interesting contrast between the book written by Grace Hopper about the Mark I computer which included information naming the individuals responsible for it and a book about the Mark I commissioned by IBM that gave credit to the faceless IBM teams who constructed the machines. The Mark I display at Harvard's science center made no mention of Grace Hopper or any other woman until 2014. page 363 the author jumps through hoops to explain graphical user interface, it's abbreviation (GUI) and it's pronunciation (Goo-ee.) but on page 364, he tosses Object Oriented Programming at us without a backward glance. page 388 ""So in the fall of 1984, just as modems were becoming easily available..."". I had my modem before that and had a problem getting permission from my teachers at SUNY Albany to do my homework at home by dialing in instead of standing in line at the computer lab waiting for a terminal. They had to have a meeting about it. I was the first student to make such a request. page 442 about Wikipedia: ""If a bad edit appeared, the community could simply get rid of it by clicking on a 'revert' link."" The author optimistically fails to mention that the same happened when a good edit appeared. To be continued... page 450page 460page 472page 476I predict that young people will take offense at some statements made in the book. The older generation were users of technology that could be taken apart, fixed, modified, and improved upon. But the technology they invented comes sealed in a plastic case now and is, when broken, thrown away. It is apparent that many of the innovators quoted in the book (and possibly the author) see the current young adults as users of technology that they could never have developed. The author states in several places that other women, besides Ada and Grace, participated in the development of personal computers and the internet but not to the same extent as men and were given little credit when they did. He makes other observations that explain this dearth of women without explicitly connecting them. A lot of the decisions about personal computing and the internet functionality and content were literally made by teenage boys. The circumstances favored them. I remember a 5:00 pm computer science course at SUNY New Paltz in 1982 that required students to do their homework in the computer lab at midnight because, I was told, ""That's when the lab is available."" The first class meeting was about 1/2 women (many young working women, teachers, etc. attending classes after work), the second class was mostly male and the third class was all younger male."
50,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,4,"This book is the definitive history of electronic computers and the internet (i.e. the digital revolution). Other histories will provide more details of limited segments of time, but this provides a good overall view from the 1800s to the present.This book reads much as a series of mini-biographies with connecting narrative. The one thing they all had in common was intelligence, i.e. lots of it. Some came across as interesting people with whom conversation would be a pleasant experience. Others had personalities that weren't so pleasant. It's interesting to note that the ones who weren't interested in making money and protecting their patents came across as being the ones I would most enjoy having as personal friends.Lessons of digital age innovations:Creativity is a collaborative process, innovations come from teams more often than the light bulb moments of lone geniuses. This was true of every era of creative ferment. The scientific revolution, the enlightenment, and the industrial revolution all had their institutions for collaborative work and their networks for sharing ideas. But to an even greater extent this has been true of the digital age. As brilliant as the many inventors of computers and the internet were, they achieved most of their advancements through team work. Like Robert Nois some of the best of them tended to resemble Congregational ministers rather than lonely prophets, madrigal singers rather than soloists. ... The digital age may seem revolutionary but it was based on expanding the ideas handed down from previous generations. The collaboration was just between contemporaries but also between generations. The best innovators were those who understood the trajectory of technological change and took the baton from innovators who preceded them. ... The most productive teams were those who brought together a wide array of specialities. ... Now as in the past, physical proximity is beneficial. There is something special ... about meetings in the flesh which cannot be replicated digitally. Throughout history the best leadership as come from teams that combined people with complimentary styles. ... Another key to fielding a great team is pairing visionaries who can generate ideas with operating managers who can execute them. Visions without execution are hallucinations. ...The internet facilitated collaboration not only on teams but among crowds who didn’t know each other. This is the advance that is closest to being revolutionary. There were three ways teams were put together in the digital age. The first was through government funding and coordination. That how the people who built the original computers ... and networks were organized. ... Private enterprise was another way that collaborative teams were formed. ... Throughout history there has been a third way ... that collaborative creativity has been organized, through peers freely sharing ideas and making contributions as a part of a voluntary common endeavor. ...  I considered keeping a list of all those named, but the numbers got out of hand. There were too many to keep track of. Instead I've included the following Table of Contents which provides a good description of the subjects covered:Chapter 1 – Ada, Countess of LovelaceChapter 2 – The ComputerChapter 3 – ProgrammingChapter 4 – The TransistorChapter 5 – The MicrochipChapter 6 – Video GamesChapter 7 – The InternetChapter 8 – The Personal ComputerChapter 9 – SoftwareChapter 10 – OnlineChapter 11 – The WebChapter 12 – Ada Forever"
51,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44613293-phurba-sherpa,5,A good read on how the technology of today was born and how collaboration of different minds in different era led to the innovation from computers to transistor to personal computer to internet to web world and forward. One of the interesting aspect was on the Innovation of Internet how different collaboration of military-academic-industry initially for military purpose led to different genius minds working together for the better future of connected world.
52,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4443481-sarah-beth,3,"I won a copy of this book as a giveaway on Goodreads. The Innovators is a serial biography of the many who contributed to the Digital Revolution beginning with Ada Lovelace in the 1800s and ending with Google in the late 1990s. Isaacson's whole premise is that innovation relies heavily on creative teams and collaboration, all building off of the work of others, rather than a single person working in isolation. ""Innovation is usually a group effort, involving collaboration between visionaries and engineers, and that creativity comes from drawing on many sources. Only in storybooks do inventions come like a thunderbolt, or a lightbulb out of the head of a lone individual in a basement or garret or garage"" (85).I'm probably not the ideal reader of this book. I have very little technical knowledge when it comes to technology, and I certainly don't know much about its history. So I can't comment at all on Isaacson's thoroughness in covering the subject matter (although his book is 500 pages so he's covered a lot). Furthermore, I don't have deep interest in the subject. Although I enjoyed the history of Ada Lovelace, and even enjoyed certain revelations (Did you know that they call working out the glitches ""debugging"" because one night in the 1940s, early programmers found a moth in one of the machines that had been the source of their problems? (94)), but for the most part, this was sort of, well, dull. I loved reading about the many individuals involved, such as the early programmers who were mostly women, but the details of the actual programming - not so much. After slogging through the middle, I can say that some of the late chapters returned to the level of interest I had with the opening chapter on Ada Lovelace. In particular, I enjoyed the chapters on Bill Gates and Steve Jobs' contributions to the field, and also enjoyed reading about the beginnings of the World Wide Web, Wikipedia, and Google. I think perhaps Isaacson took on too broad a topic. He attempts to justify this by continually ramming home his point that innovation involves many. For example, at one point he references how the ""process of technological development is like building a cathedral. Over the course of several hundred years new people come along and each lays down a block on top of the old foundations"" (260). Later, ""the digital age may seem revolutionary, but it was based on expanding the ideas handed down from previous generations. The collaboration was not merely among contemporaries, but also between generations"" (480). It seemed almost as if Isaacson worried that his scope was so broad that he worried his readers would lose sight of where he was going with all this, so he continually repeated the same message, over and over. Technology and the internet affect our daily life, and I'm glad I spent time getting an overview of how exactly this all came about. While this book has not inspired a deep love in the subject matter, I do think Isaacson did a decent job of providing a comprehensive overview of the digital revolution over the last two centuries. "
53,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43781060-anthony-degleris,4," The Innovators  was a great introduction to the people and ideas responsible for the digital revolution. Isaacson's prose is clear and elegant, but still rich in detail. In fact, there were far too many people and anecdotes for me to remember; I'll be lucky to retain 20% of the book. At first, this excess of information bothered me. However, I realized it only furthers one of Isaacson's key ideas: the digital revolution was brought on by countless people making small contributions, even if we only remember a few big names. A few other big takeaways, in no particular order, were- Innovation thrives off of collaboration, especially in groups with diverse backgrounds and personalities. New ideas are only useful if they're shared and used.- The personal computer and the internet can empower individuals and create community. The success of many internet projects---Wikipedia, open source software, social media---relies on decentralized power structures. Hopefully we'll see more of this in the future.- Artificial intelligence has been the next big thing since computers were invented, but augmented intelligence (i.e. computers supplementing people, like calculators, personal computers, etc.) has been the current big thing driving all the innovation. AI is probably not the new electricity.- Three sectors generally drove innovation: government-funded research (often collaboratively with academia and private industry), private entrepreneurs (Microsoft, Apple, etc.), and open source collaboration. Of course, the lines blur in practice, but it's useful to know the prominent approaches. There are obvious pros and cons to each approach.- Three types of personalities that drive successful companies. The visionary (Steve Jobs, Paul Allen), the technical leader (Steve Wozniak, Bill Gates), and the realistic team manager (? not sure who these were for Apple and Microsoft). These probably roughly correspond to the roles of CEO, CTO, and COO. All three are essential to innovative companies.- Succesful innovators are product people. They know engineering (backend technical details) or product design (frontend interacting with the customer), and often both. Backgrounds in management or marketing are useful, but can't be the primary driver of the company.- The intellectual property question. Isaacson notes the tension between private industry and open source culture (which included basement hackers like Linus Torvalds and prominent academics like John von Neumann). It's left as an open question when patenting drives innovation and when it gets in the way.Something else I enjoyed about Isaacson's writing:  The Innovators  was a book, not a drawn-out essay. The 500 pages are worth reading, and a one-page summary won't do it justice (unlike a lot of non-fiction books I've read...). Although he repeats key ideas, he develops them throughout the book, analyzes nuances, and raises questions. Overall, great book. Would recommend!"
54,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23111446-julia,3,"Was a bit dry and could get very technical. I found it difficult to appreciate until they started talking about more modern computer developments like Bill Gates / Steve Jobs. If you’re more familiar with the coding, hardware, software world, the more extensive background would probably be more interesting. Otherwise, The author does distill some key principals and take aways about the innovators and processes at the end of the book which is a great summary to take advantage of if you don’t want to dive into the entire book. "
55,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29018105-peter,4,"I received this book for free through Goodreads First Reads. The Innovators is a fascinating and entertaining non-technical history of computers and the internet. Isaacson approaches the emergence of the digital generally in a chronological narrative with mini-biographies of the key figures from Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, John von Neuman, Alan Turing, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and the founders of Google, Wikipedia, and Intel, among others.Isaacson writes very well with tremendous enthusiam for the subject, whcih becomes contagious so that the reader soon shares his appreciation for the development of the transistor, the micro-processor and the worldwide web. Isaacson also has a sense of humor which keeps the flow of information interesting and amusing. The portraits of the many figures involved in the development of the computer and the internet clearly conveyts the peronaliites of themen and women who contributed to our current digital age. The eccentricities and egos (or in some cases, the altruism and humility) of these figures help communicate the passion that drove the progress frommechanical calculators to the world of networks in whcih we now live. In addition to presenting the history of the digital age, Isaacson also presents his view that the creativity and inventiveness necessary for technological advancement in our age requires collaboration and teamwork and not soley individual geniuses. Visionaries need the support of those who can implement their ideas and produce market acceptance of products or processes. Isaacson argues that there is a symbiosis between the geniuses with the vision to push technoligy forward and those who can apply practical engineering, programming and business skills to modify and advance the vision and create usable products. Teams with complementary skills can promote creativity and spur progress that would otherwise not occur in a different environment. Although overstated a bit, this position is not controversial. Finally, Isaacson considers the internet and the almost universal access to it brought about by personal computeres and other devices as enhancing the environment for collaboration and creativity.Isaacson has given us insightful and well-written history of our digital age, infused with humor and entertaining profiles of the key characters. "
56,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8516018-ronit-ray,4,"Walter Isaacson is my favourite non-fiction writer. I tremendously enjoy his work, and went into The Innovators with high hopes. I wasn't disappointed; this book is pretty great. Isaacson writes with a relatable passion and an admirable intensity, covering every significant development of the digital age, from the first computers to the internet, and does a fairly good job. There's no doubting his credentials as a historian or his ability as a writer but I felt like he falls prey to the nature of the subject matter; each section of the book spans a significant amount of time and effort that would be difficult to express even if there was a separate book dedicated to the topic in its entirety. To condense all of that into what can only be termed a set of essays is a formidable task, and I dare say Isaacson has done it to the best of his ability. The Innovators covers events, viewpoints, and developments with factual accuracy and a charming neutrality that really shows you where the schools of thought originate from and how they fare against each other. That said, despite his best efforts to make the book an authoritative account, it still reads somewhat like a ""history written by the victors""; we learn all about the movers and shakers but very little (perhaps rightfully so) about efforts that didn't go to plan and fizzled out, the bumps along the way that technological advancement has faced which are arguably as important in defining character as achievements are. Each individual section was engaging and concise, but the last chapter felt like a conclusion someone would write to meet the word limit on an essay. It's understandable that summing up a book this diverse is a difficult job, but reiterating well-established patterns might not have been the best way to go about it; it felt like a drag. It still manages to end on a hopeful note, with lessons to take away about the intersection of arts and sciences, collaboration, human-computer interaction, and so on.I'd rate The Innovators a solid 4/5."
57,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21960395-milkiways,4,"Issacson's The Innovators is a very well written, credible book filled with information on each individual, germination of an idea, it's implementation and development behind today's magic machine, The Computer. The writer has done an excellent job in meticulously presenting the tiniest details and have certainly done justification to each and every small to big individual with personal details who were part of this extraordinary system. It is unfortunate to see how the innovation has changed over the time... in the past if innovators are deprived and limited by the funds, their pride and discrimination then, today innovation is purely driven by wealth and fame! Another important fact, which seemed to have intense influence is deserving credit for one's own ideas... engineering and technology is purely built on existing technology! It is the designer's intuition to connect the dots, blend his/her experience and knowledge and come up with something new. In this case, how can anyone else share the perks of his intuition? of course collaborators do deserve credit for the input which made the technology possible but, how about the executioner, who could able to see the potential/hidden application which others failed to see? This is not that simple to answer that's the reason there were so many lawsuits over fame and wealth, damaged pride.. inturn centuries of delay!All in all, I was highly intrigued by the brief life stories of these great minds! This made me understand who they were and how could they be able to do what they have done. I felt enlightened by all the aspects author has pursued. It's a must read of the year for the curious brains and I'm glad I did it!P.S. one of the great contributors, Alan Turing and his journey of designing and building the universal machine is made into a movie ""The Imitation Game"". It was a wonderful coincidence, that I could also be able to watch this film while reading the book! :)"
58,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20866102-bryan-doughty,1,"Audio book review:This book belongs in a special category of zero or negative stars. I say this because it is the first book I have ever given up on entirely before finishing. In reality, I was going to give up after 15 minutes, and did, but started over again a few days later figuring I was in a bad mood and the book deserved a second chance. It did not deserve a second chance at all. I made it through an hour and came to the conclusion it is simply beyond boring, poorly read, poorly written, confusing and makes not an ounce of sense.The book opens with a forward by the author where he attempts to be trying to justify why the book was written and looking back I almost feel it was written as an apology to the readers knowing they were about to be bored to death by what comes next. So what comes next? Who the heck really knows. It seems to be a random assortment of people, who many times the author does not describe, who appear to like to have threesomes on couches (I didn't get it either, but there was a lot of talk about sex) followed by an attempt to trace the beginning of the computer. I just didn't get where the book was going and decided after 60 minutes I was done. Maybe the rest of this book is better, but I will never know. Although I have liked Isaacson's books in the past, he does himself a huge disservice with this attempt to cash on his past successes. Please stick to biographies.Since this is an audio book review, I would be remiss not to mention that the the person reading is very boring which may have led to this negative review. The part I did listen to was read with about as much enthusiasm as someone who just exited a long surgery but was still coming back to reality. Sadly I can only give this book one star, but would much rather go with no stars. It is not worth the paper it is printed on or the space it took up on my phone."
59,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5285276-viet-nguyen,5,"This book describes ""how a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution."" It is a fascinating read about the stories behind many inventions. Several lessons can be learned from the book about how innovations come from ideas and what kind of thoughts and personalities are put into them. - Innovation is the result of collaboration. Ideas are built upon ideas. Innovation hardly comes from a sole genius.- The most productive team of innovators combines wide array of specialities: people with visionaries and people with strict management (Robert Noyce, Gordon Moore need to work with Andy Groove - Intel), people with excellent engineering skills (Steve Wozniak) and people with good product vision (Steve Jobs), theorists and experimentalist (Bell Labs), etc. - Although artificial intelligence is hot, there are still many years until a machine thinking on its own becomes a reality. Maybe a better alternative is augmented intelligence, where human and machine work together, each contributes its own strength (creativity, decision making from human and unlimited computing from machine) to produce much better innovation. This is the power of human-machine symbiosis. An example here is IBM Thomas Watson service. - As Steve Jobs said, ""technology alone is not enough---that it's technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the result that makes our heart sing.""There is one thing I noted: the story line of the book is quite smooth to support several points that the author made in the book. The book tries to describe a lot of people and ideas in a limited number of pages, thus many technical details must have been overseen. However, this is still a good biography of the Digital Age; readers can learn about how technology are progressing and affecting their lives and their future. "
60,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22390233-viju,5,"The Innovators is a well–researched, well-detailed, and well-written piece of literature on the Digital Revolution. While the book does have its slow moments, it is a compelling piece of read in the overall of scheme of things. If you are an engineer or a computer scientist, you’ll be amazed to see how much you do not know about the inventors and their inventions. If you are not an engineer or a computer scientist, you will see how products that you use in your day-to-day life came about to be and perhaps you’ll stop equating engineering with information technology alone, and equate it to inventions too. The book follows a mostly linear perspective to show how Digital Revolution evolved from the early half of the 19th century to the second decade of the 21st century. The title caption says ‘How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution’ and indeed without a doubt one can say every one of these innovators was a genius in his own right. In addition to being a genius, the innovators fell into various categories including generous, eccentric, selfish, workaholics (for sure), childish, loners, and more. Above all, as Isaacson mentions in his book, they were all (mostly) wonderful collaborators. There are a couple of statements in the last chapter of the book that read: ‘People don’t invent things on the internet. They simply expand on an idea that already exists.’ The whole book is a wonderful piece of well-researched history on how the ideas from one time moved to another influencing innovations when people worked collaboratively.

61,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1910833-jason,4,"There's nothing really wrong with this overview of the development of the digital revolution, but it didn't particularly grab me though. It's a perfectly serviceable introduction to the history of computers, feeling more like a textbook until maybe the final chapter where Issacs lends his own spin on the importance of collaboration over indivuals. Throughout, there's a long list of folks that are introduced and then dispensed with so frequently that I started to feel like even naming these people wasn't really all that important; that the important bits were that some person 'x' did this thing that person 'y' used to make something that person 'z' used to make the Internet or something important like that. I think these stories would have been more interesting if they were somehow less about the people than what was being contributed to the overall story. I'm not so interested that Sergey Brin had a speech problem and was quite but smart or that Steve Jobs was like... well.... Steve Jobs. I just want to know what the building blocks were for each piece of digital revolution.... what the steps were. Maybe that would have made for a colder book, but it would have probably met better with the author's stated goal than what we got.

It tells the stories of dozens of people behind those great innovation of our age and the social and cultural environment that cultivated them. It is impossible with the modern innovation to pin point one hero. All these ingenious ideas evolve over time, build on top of each other, and rub against often times other contentious ideas. There is seldom a light bulb moment. I lost track of the names of these innovators in the long span of history even though each of them played such important role in the history of Internet. There are so many of them. That is also the challenge for the book. To cover so many people and so many important events, each can only unfortunately gets a few pages. A reader cannot feel the deep connection of someone's achievement with his intimate personal stories and thoughts, which is what attracted me in the first place when reading Issacson's biography about Steve Jobs. Hence a four stars. One last thought was on reading the hypertext and how it shaped the Internet we have today. What if the links were two wayed ? Certainly google would not be as earth shattering innovation as in the world of outward link web as we have today."

While I can't say this book made me technically more proficient, it is a thorough history of the birth of computing and the Internet. Which makes it sound kind of boring. Not at all! Isaacson does an excellent job breathing life into the people and organisations which created the tech we use today, talking mostly about their public accomplishments, but leaving some space for private lives and personal vendettas. Plus, this book made me cry. ""Lily, you must be unhinged. What about the birth of personal computers would make a person cry?"" I probably am unhinged, but I also hadn't realised how involved women were in computing from the beginning, from Ada Lovelace authoring the first computer programme, through the legions of women programmers doing the dirty work back when coding was considered menial labour. Isaacson names and celebrates these women, alongside the famous Steves and Bills, which helped me with my imposter syndrome. But Lady Programmer Problems aside, I'm delighted I will be better able to navigate those famous software engineer cocktail parties with the knowledge I picked up here.tl;dr super interesting and informative book, go read it"

Most forcefully stated is that most of the breakthroughs and innovations were the result of not one person but the efforts and determination of many people. Although there are some names that we are most familiar with today, there were scores of people who through the thought process advocated and tested their knowledge and their wherewithal to get to the desired end. Also quite evident is that where one generation left off, another quickly picked up the thread and ran with it.Mr Isaacson did a very fine job with the many innovators background and that was my most favorite part of the book. It was easy to see why these men and women became innovators while oftentimes surprising to me, their backgrounds and family fostered learning, experimentation, and answering the inquisitiveness of their children. I must confess that oftentimes the technology part was over my head but it did give me a fine understanding of how what we have and use today came about. "

(That is not a typo. The original ideas for a computing machine came in the 1830s.)The author does a wonderful job of researching every little contribution to the computer's development. It is very much like a textbook. Some of the early history (until the 1970s) was not very exciting to me.However, when the author was talking about events that occurred in my lifetime and people who lived during my lifetime, the book became more enjoyable.It is amazing how many geniuses (gifted, talented, educated people) contributed to the development of the computer, software, the Internet, blogs, Wikipedia, etc.To me, the bottom line is, no matter how smart we make computers, all the work of quite a number of geniuses could not make a machine to do what the human brain can do. God has made billions of brains, which are much better than the computers that teams of men and women could make over the centuries. It is amazing what God has done!"

And I really agreed with the team dynamic vs individual narcissists who appear as their own heroes all through the book. I know one or two! When one is changing the world by leading a new thing, one needs to believe in one's mission. The Vision vs Operations person is well defined. The author gives good insight in to what drives different individuals; especially Lovelace/Babbage, Roberts/Taylor, Gates/Allen, Jobs/Woz.The author has a tendency to repeat which got somewhat tiring over time. He reminds me of a lecturer who has taught the same course too many times and likes the sound of their own voice.The book was well researched. The first half of the book dealt with a long span of years from Babbage, Lovelace and co. through to WW2 whereas the second half dealt with way more detail where a lot of those mentioned will be consigned to history's scrapheap in future.

67,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2336309-judy,4,"I thought I was going to hate this book. It starts with Byron's daughter and moves, predictably, to Turing, Grace Hopper and ENIAC. I could do that in my sleep. Suddenly a bright light went on and it became one of most fascinating books I've read in ages. We all know Jobs and Gates but can any of you tell me who invented the mouse and why? That's what this book does. It fills in all the little steps in developing our beloved computers--parts that most of us don't think about. We meet the people, know a bit about their backgrounds and watch as fate or whatever brings them together. For the most part, these are people motivated by love, not money. Let me just say the computer could only have been created by a huge cast of diverse people in a specific period of time and in one geographical place. Blown away==oh yes. Meanwhile, this book sheds new light on innovation and , perhaps, on our future. A great selection for book clubs. Oh--Isaacson is careful to give females their due. Thank you, sir."
68,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,3,"A nice history of some of the key players in the history of modern computing. On the plus side, the book correctly credits most major technological progress not to the action of a small number of heroes working alone, but to teams of people building off each others' ideas. It also does a good job of showing the role of women, government funding, theoretical research, open source development, and many other aspects of technological development, whereas other narratives usually omit one or more of these. On the negative side, to get through so much history, the book only gives you a neat, clean, saran-wrapped glimpse at most of the stories, and overlooks some important stories entirely. I prefer Isaacson's books that focus on a single person (e.g. Steve Jobs), as that lets you see just how messy, chaotic, and sometimes downright accidental innovation really is. In short, this book is a nice TLDR of computing history, but if you find a story that intrigues you, you'll have to dig deeper to really appreciate it."
69,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2799121-gary-anderson,4,"Ada Lovelace, Lord Byron’s daughter, was really the first person to envision a machine that could be programmed to do whatever tasks an individual could imagine. Beginning with her story, Walter Isaacson’s The Innovators introduces readers to the most important individual contributors to the digital age in which we live. But it’s not exactly accurate to put too much emphasis on the individuals. One of Isaacson’s key points is that the digital age happened because the epiphanies and imaginations of great thinkers were improved upon by collaborative pragmatism. Although some of the science in The Innovators was a little over my head, I admired Isaacson’s explanations of how digital innovation results “from people who are able to link beauty to engineering, humanity to technology, and poetry to processors, … who can flourish where the arts intersect with the sciences and who have a rebellious sense of wonder that opens them to the beauty of both.” I love that."

It talkes about each major development and sketches out the actors involved and there were many in each stage. It starts with Ada Lovelace (Byron's daughter) and takes the story to the first computers like and we meet figures Like Alan Turing and Claude Shannon and Mauchely and Eckhart. We move on to the wizards at Fairchild Semiconductor and Pioneers like Noyce, Brattain, and Gordon Moore. We meet the developers of the first computer game space war and video games like pong in the 70s. We meet of course the heroes of the PC revolution, Jobs, Wozniak, Gates. We also meet the developers of Arpanet AKA the internet. We also meet the guys behind google search engines and social media your Brins and Zuckerbergs. All early pioneers on the cutting edge of old.

His analysis demonstrates the value of collaboration between people with complementary skills as well as the need for the academic-public-private partnership to fund and support pure research. Along the way, he introduces us to the key players and their writings, many of which proved visionary and ahead of their time.There are just a few things I wish he covered but they were the next level down and not the first computer or browser or user group.

At times I feel that Isaacson gets over-burdened with details and names, which tend to race by - especially in telling the story of the early years of computing. I found that the book becomes much more readable as time goes on and we approach the modern era. I, for one, learned a few things - even about events that I was alive for and aware of."

I remember being taught classic waterfall project management in school and struggle with applying it to innovation, I could never get the time expectations right and the order never seemed to fit. I always needed to jump between tasks. This book proves that agile development has been around for centuries before we knew the term agile development. It is a great book, I fully recommend it."

The thing that author, got admiration of Elon Musk for Franklin and Einstein biographies and after he was approached by Steve Jobs to write his biography he would have got access to practically anyone. So I took an advantage and bought it in the airport of Copenhagen choosing it over other more academic books like Blue Ocean Strategy etc. Although there is possibility that you might think the book was written from the leftover notes that weren't used in the Jobs book it is a good starting place to understand the context of the information age.

86,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/782114-nathan-albright,4,"After writing a biography of Steve Jobs, the late and enigmatic leader of Apple's drive for aesthetic and technological superiority over competitors, it makes sense that the author would seek to write a collaborate and somewhat dishy book that sought to deal with the sprawling subject of technological innovation in the world of computing that starts in the early 19th century and continues to the contemporary period.  The approach has considerable merit, not least that the author is knowledgeable about the subject and has done a great deal of research into it, and also that the author has some serious points to make about the culture of innovation that is well worth understanding and appreciating.  Although I must admit I found some aspects of this picture of innovation to be unappealing, I did find it instructive the way that the author discussed the culture of innovation that led to the digital revolution and why it appears (with reason) that this culture acts in such a biased and leftist fashion in the enforcement of community standards.  For that alone this book is worth the hefty read, even if one has little interest in the people who have been responsible for the digital revolution throughout the decades.This book consists of twelve chapters over nearly 500 pages of text that seeks to convey the sweeping epic of technological innovation in the computing world.  The author begins with Ada Lovelace, daughter of Lord Byron, and explores her personal life and her contributions to computing along with those of her contemporaries like Babbage (1).  After that the author moves on to the development of the computer and the various controversies over prior invention (something that continues on through the course of the book) as well as the insights of people like Turing (2).  The author then looks at early programmers, pointing to the role of women in these efforts (3).  The author returns to hardware concerns with a chapter on transistors (4) and the microchip (5), examining the way that multiple parties were seeking the same solutions simultaneously and working collaboratively.  This leads to a short chapter on video games that looks at the early role of Atari (6), before the author discusses the public-private collaborations that led to the internet (7).  The author discusses various struggles to develop the personal computer (8) and the savvy recognition on the part of Bill Gates that software would be important in making it work (9).  The author then looks at the importance of AOL in helping people get online (10) and the early development of the worldwide web (11) that has led to a world where human beings and computers can work together profitably, perhaps for a long while to come (12).There are a few valuable insights that this book provides.  The author offers a defense of Al Gore's role in promoting the internet, discusses the vital importance of left-wing counterculture elements in fostering an environment that encouraged personal computing, and discusses fights over the question of community property or corporate profit that have surfaced time and time again.  The author makes a strong case for a role of government in creating public goods like the infrastructure of the internet that can serve for the well-being of people in the United States and around the world.  The author's discussion of the marked left-wing bias of many involved in the world of Silicon Valley and personal computing in general can help the reader understand the politically biased nature of the behavior of companies like Facebook, Google, and Twitter, which routinely attack conservative perspectives while turning a blind eye to leftist excesses.  By wrestling with the political nature of innovation, the author has done the reader a great service even if his definition of innovation is quite a bit more narrow than one would want."
87,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15180823-sage,4,"Fantastic. Some comments:•Opportunity is everything. All of these innovators were white, very well connected to the tech world from a young age, and received a college education (at least partially-it was always their choice to drop out). Most were men, wealthy, the children of scientists or engineers, and had little to overcome in pursuing their ideas once inspired. Three possible conclusions come to mind: 1) the author failed to include a large group of people who also pursued such ideas, but were either unsuccessful in gaining the public attention or simply ignored in favor of more elite candidates. 2) This group of people had exponentially more help and attention and opportunity, not necessarily because 3) they were more genius than any other group of people, superior in the ways of these complex thoughts than their non-white counterparts. —This has caused me to ponder on my own life: on the opportunity and allowances I have because of privilege. Even with the high intellect I consider myself to have, had I been born poorer, without parents who valued education and used their means to fuel the creativity and talents I had the freedom to display because of the safe, warm haven of our home; things beyond my control, I wouldn't be where I am now, and with the possibilities I have yet to take advantage of.•Which brings me to the parents of these innovators–many of them grew up tinkering alongside their dads, or constantly soaking up the knowledge with which their intelligent mothers answered their questions. Something this book did well, I think, was try to include not only the innovators themselves but also their mentors and the people who got them there, thoroughly exhibiting the interconnectedness of inspiration.•Long live Wikipedia!•Some things I think would be included in addition to the topics addressed, had this book been written six years later, in present day: facial recognition, self driving cars, returning women to the programming world, wireless sharing, VR/AR. Feel free to add!•I'm more convinced than ever that Apple's exclusivity and refusal to make their devices and software compatible with other platforms is creating an elitist but also ignorant class of people (programming joke and also societal reference). Children growing up on Apple devices won't become the innovators that the Steves were, as the innovators of the technical revolution grew up with machines that were designed to be taken apart and understood inside and out.•On that note, I disagree with the author in his praise of simplicity–perhaps it is more conducive to selling more product, but the less people understand their own machines, the less innovation will happen. Jobs was able to appeal to the Humanities community with simple and beautiful designs, but if professors of literature or history don't have devices and software they are able to understand, they will not become the innovators the author most praised. Having one foot in both worlds–in the arts and technology–was essential to the most creative innovators, including Jobs. (I might also point out the privilege necessary to have extensive knowledge in both areas, which would take a wealth of time and money that those not born into privilege have, besides whatever genius they are credited.•All in all, it was a fantastic read. I listened to it, but I would love to study a physical copy, with all the brilliant quotes included from the myriad of people who collaborated their way into a new age."
88,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"Long ago, it was possible for one man to singlehandedly create and innovate on their own. People in America learn about Thomas Edison and how he invented the light bulb and many other things. However, even in the case of Edison, he was not a monolithic character in a white tower churning out inventions. He had a team of nameless and faceless engineers to aid him and he had a bit of a cheat in that some people had already tried to make it. This book isn’t about Edison or the Light bulb, but it makes for a good comparison.The Innovators is the story of how the personal computer, the internet, and all of the other trappings of the digital age came to be. Walter Isaacson demonstrates his ability to explain ideas and story elements to make a wonderful narrative. Isaacson begins at the beginning of computing, with the Analytical and Difference Engines by Charles Babbage, and the first programmer in the part of Ada Lovelace. It talks about how both machines were far ahead of their time, and people didn’t know what it could be used for. The technology just wasn’t there.Throughout the history of computing and technology in general, there have been advancements that take things to a whole new level. Isaacson recounts all of it. While I do say that innovation is a collaborative effort, we do still remember the random geniuses for better or worse. Take William Shockley for example; the man was brilliant, there is no denying that. He came up with a method to make transistors that involved something entirely different in a herculean task of intense concentration and effort. However, nowadays he is also remembered as a person who believed that IQ determined everything and that Black people were inferior, so it balances out I suppose.The book is separated into chapters that give an account of large advancements. So the first chapters talk about Babbage and Lovelace. The second chapter goes on to the rush to make tabulating machines and machines to simplify tedious mathematical calculations. During World War II, it seems that each major power had some computing power, except the Germans. The high command of Nazi Germany could not see the benefits of a computer. Alongside the making of computers, we tend to find a number of firsts that always confused me. When talking about the first computer, we have to be very specific in what we mean. What sort of base did it use? Was it Electronic? Did it use Vacuum Tubes or Relays? Was it so secret that no one knew about it for 30 years? Was it general-purpose or only devoted to one task?In that previous vein, we eventually get to the internet, PCs, Apple stuff, and how those inventions grew organically or were controlled by corporate and personal interests. The book even has a chapter devoted to Video Games. It contains different views on things from different perspectives. For example, we have Bill Gates and the Homebrew Computer Club. They butted heads over file sharing and copyright. They both had a point as well. This was with the development of Microsoft BASIC.This book is fantastic. I really enjoy books that delve into the history of things and ideas. Since it digs into technology, this makes it even better."
89,147670869X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47193297-abdurrahman,5,"A great first dive into the history of computingI have a problem with finishing books. I have started way more books than I have ever finished, but ""The Innovators"" is one of the few that I read to the very end!As usual with Isaacson's books, this one is very well written. I think that, arguably, the author made a great decision about which persons, institutions and events to include. It is not easy to write one book about the history of computing, and every reader (including me) is going to come out feeling that Isaacson should have mentioned someone that he didn't, or should have slowed down where he went too fast. But overall, I think he did a great job. The book starts with Ada Lovelace (1850s) and ends with Google. It manages to highlight the most important events and discoveries that happened in between, and weaves it all into an enjoyable narration! To give you a small sample, the book covers the early ideas, the very first mechanical computers, the switch to electronics, the transistor, the microprocessor, the rise of personal computing, the rise of silicon valley, the dawn of the age of software, the birth of the internet, the web, blogging, AI, and many others. The book shows all this, with a focus on the stories of the people who envisioned, built and commercialized these inventions.Although I have studied computer science, I felt ashamed while reading this as to the number of things that I never knew how they came about! Not only is it fascinating to see how we arrived to where we are right now, it is also very inspiring to see all the futures that never happened! This is something that Isaacson at times (understandably) skims over quickly. If I could ask for a part 2 of this book, I would like it to be about all the technologies and ideas that never happened!Finally, I would say that I see this as my first long read into the history of computing. There are a few reasons for this: most important is that I am now inspired to read more about specific people or specific stories. I plan to start with reading Michael Hiltzik's ""Dealers of Lightning"" about Xerox PARC. The second reason is that I felt at times that Isaacson is presenting his own reading of history. This is not at all a bad thing. In fact, someone once said that a good biographer is like a good sculptor: he can see a pattern in a random shaped rock, and then help others see it. Isaacson is definitely a great biographer, but I also believe that there are many great insights, lessons and learning that were lost as he chiseled these stories. Finally, as I mentioned before, I think that I would like to focus more on the stories of things that never came to be, and how our world would have looked like if they had been!I would highly recommend this book to anyone with the slightest interest in the history of computing, or even to someone who just wants to read a pretty good story!"
