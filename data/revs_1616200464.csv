So, I know a thing or two about those things that grow in dirt. Consequently, I found discussions about the necessary starch levels in potatoes needed to make good vodka at least semi-interesting. And now I finally know what ""proof"" means, which is good (therein lies a delightfully entertaining story that I shan't spoil).Mostly, though, this book just made me want a cocktail. Or seven. Who's in? "
1,1616200464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte,5,"Horticulture in bottles. Booze and botany. The elixir of life—the aqua vitae—that the plant world has given us.""Every great drink starts with a plant"". So, depending on the mission, one person will be more interested in the content of the bottle, and another might be thrilled by the botanical magic leading up to it. I'm one of the latter. A teetotaler since forever, most boring nerd at a party. Coffee and water - the only substance abuses I am guilty of. Ah, it just happily float my boat. 
 “How can anyone with even a passing interest in botany not be fascinated by this stuff?” I said. “Look at the ingredients. Juniper! That’s a conifer. Coriander, which is, of course, the fruit of a cilantro plant. All gins have citrus peel in them. This one has lavender buds, too. Gin is nothing but an alcohol extraction of all these crazy plants from around the world—tree bark and leaves and seeds and flowers and fruit.” We had arrived at the liquor store by then, and I was gesturing wildly at the shelves around us. “This is horticulture! In all of these bottles!”
One hundred and sixty plant species are covered in the book. But there's thousands more, of course. And then there's proper tonic water:""proper tonic water, made with actual cinchona bark and real Saccharum officinarum, not that artificial junk......Scott browsed the selection of bottled Agave tequilana. He was in the habit of trekking into Mexico in search of rare agave and cactus, and he’d encountered many of his prized specimens coming out of the working end of a handmade Oaxacan still.""...There wasn’t a bottle in the store that we couldn’t assign a genus and species to. Bourbon? Zea mays, an overgrown grass(sweet corn). Absinthe? Artemisia absinthium, a much-misunderstood Mediterranean herb. Polish vodka? Solanum tuberosum—a nightshade, which is a weird family of plants if there ever was one. Beer? Humulus lupulus(common hop or hop), a sticky climbing vine that happens to be a close cousin to cannabis....In China, they make their wine from barley; in the northern parts thereof, from rice and apples. In Japan, also they prepare a strong wine from rice. We in England, likewise, have great variety of wines from cherries, apples, pears, &c. little inferior to those of foreign growth. In Brazil, and elsewhere, they make strong wine of water and sugarcane: and in Barbadoes they have many liquors unknown to us. Among the Turks, where wine of the grape is forbid by their law, the Jews and Christians keep, in their taverns, a liquor made of fermented raisins. The Sura in the East-Indies is made of the juice that flows from the cocoa-tree; and sailors have often been inebriated, in that country, with the liquors made of the fermented juices obtain’d by the incision of vegetables....Drunken botanists? Given the role they play in creating the world’s great drinks, it’s a wonder there are any sober botanists at all.""...A great gin or a fine French liqueur is flavored with innumerable herbs, seeds, and fruit, some of them added during distillation and some just before bottling. And once a bottle gets to the bar, a third round of plants are called into service: mixers like mint, lemon, and—if the party’s at my house—fresh jalapeño. I structured the book around this journey from mash tub and still, to bottle, to glass....Marc Wucher, an Alsatian eau-de-vie maker, once told a reporter, “We distill everything except our mothers-in-law,” and if you’ve ever been to Alsace, you know he wasn’t exaggerating.""You can proceed in orderly fashion through the book,""says the author. The plants are alphabetically indexed and include all the well-known beverages first, and then proceed to the uncommon ones. History, cultural uses, distillery, product names. It's all there.I just had an arresting moment when feces, two thousand years old, were discovered in the 1950s and analyzed. It did not go off well. ...Ahhh.... it's in the book!!MARULAS!Let's skip the skimpy info in the book here and rather share my own memories with you:Marulas(Sclerocarya birrea spp caffra), a delicious African fruit, is not only a highly sought after ingredient for various liqueurs, beers, moonshine (witblits in Afrikaans, also called Tôt-Tôt, one of the most potent moonshines on the planet). A very popular liqueur, called Marula Cream, is made from this fruit. The fruit is also popular with the animals, with hilarious consequences. Just watch this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50tlF...Do yourself a favor and watch it! Even the worms have a happy moment! Believe me, those hangovers are REAL!The author, from Oregon in the USA, rejects this kind of evidence. I don't.  I've grown up in the northern parts of South Africa and we witnessed these animals constantly. Not only eating the fruit, but stumbling away in a drunken stupor. In fact, when the word was out that elephants were at the trees, we all went en masse to witness it. When the elephants shook the trees, the monkeys within had to cling for dear life until the tree-quake was over. It lasted only a few minutes at a time. The fruit is safe for human consumption when it's dropped from the tree and picked up immediately (especially after the elephants shook the trees). Stored in fridges, and eaten within a day, it is one of the most delicious fruits on the planet. But left out on the ground in the hot African sun, it totally changes the ball game! Nobody in their right mind touches those sun-baked fruits! The Marula fruit contains a delicious nut which is used by African tribes for making bread. The tree forms part of the ANACARDIACEAE (cashew nut) family of plants. The nuts can be stored for months in clay pots before it is used. As children we helped the African mammas collect the fruit and harvest the nuts. Huge heaps. For our assistance we were awarded with the bread. The bread is not only delicious, but also extremely healthy. As children, we had our fill of both bread, nuts and non-fermented fruit. We knew which fruits to avoid and which were safe. I miss it every day! Humans and animals rejoice together in Marula season :-) Back to the book: It is so well researched, and really fascinating to read. Not a book to rush through within a day. I would rather add it to a coffee table collection to be scrolled through and absorbed slowly. The author has a wonderful, witty and casual way of sharing the information.

I'm more of a botanist than a boozer, so I was most interested in the history and folklore of the plants. It's quite a revelation, though, to see the variety of plants that are used in alcoholic beverages. If you like to make exotic cocktails from pricey liqueurs and liquors, you could throw one hell of a party with the recipes in this book. She even gives some gardening advice so you can grow the plants you'll use in your boozy concoctions. "
3,1616200464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67949588-mary-deacon,5,"I have been clean and sober for 8 years after going through A.A. This Thanksgiving I slipped and partook in a little drinking and.... oops! There went my sobriety. Since all that went down the toilet, I thought I'd pick up this book. I'm glad I did. It's wonderful!"
4,1616200464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,4,"This is a great book, very interesting. It all started when Stewart went to a liquor store with her friend.We had arrived at a liquor store by then, and I was gesturing wildly at the shelves around us. ""This is horticulture! In all of these bottles!""... Suddenly we weren't in a liquor store anymore. We were in a fantastical greenhouse, the world's most exotic botanical garden, the sort of strange and overgrown conservatory we only encounter in our dreams. ...Around the world, it seems, there is not a tree or shrub or delicate wildflower that has not been harvested, brewed, and bottled. Every advance in botanical exploration or horticultural science brought with it a corresponding uptick in the quality of our spirituous liquors. Drunken botanists? Give the role they play in creating the world's great drinks, it's a wonder there are any sober botanists at all.The only reason this didn't get five stars from me is that although I drink, I don't DRINK. This is heavy with various cocktail and drink recipes that I have no use for and will never make. It also frequently takes a page here and there to explain how to grow certain plants yourself. Again, I'm never going to do this, I have no interest in gardening.However, Stewart is fascinating; she tackles every variety of plant you can think of and then goes through them species by species, telling us how they became involved in becoming an alcoholic drink. She includes great, fascinating stories about history and historical figures that had me grinning from ear to ear. I especially loved the stories about Nixon going to China and drinking mao-tai - so hilarious!On February 21, 1972, President Nixon... attended a banquet in Peking to mark the beginning of Nixon's historic trip to China. The ceremonial drink that night was mao-tai, a sorghum spirit with an alcohol content over 50%. Alexander Haig had sampled the drink on an advance visit and cabled a warning that ""Under no repeat no circumstances should the President actually drink from his glass..."" Nixon ignored the advice and matched his host drink for drink, shuddering but saying nothing each time he took a sip. Dan Rather said it tasted like ""liquid razor blades.""A dozen or so pages later, Stewart expands this story:The mao-tai served to President Nixon was surely the best China had to offer. Prime Minister Chou En-lai held a match to his glass to show the president that the spirit could be lit on fire, a fact that Nixon filed away for future use. In 1974, National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger told another Chinese official that the president tried to repeat the trick for his daughter when he returned home. ""So he took out a bottle and poured it into a saucer and lit it,"" Kissinger said, ""but the glass bowl broke and the mao-tai ran over the table and the table began to burn! So you nearly burned down the White House!""LOL This is just a taste - Stewart has plenty of entertaining stories about alcohol and its successes and pitfalls throughout history.The book is colorful, fully illustrated, and has a fun, whimsical feel to it.Tl;dr - Tons of botany, and a great exploration of liquors, infusions, and cocktails that you will be longing to try after reading this book. I loved learning more about plants, and alcohol, and history. Although the book had a lot of ""extra"" material that didn't apply to my life or interest me, it was a strong and worthwhile read."
5,1616200464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2644090-erica,4,"PreambleJune, 2017:I'm buddy-reading this with the victim of my attention, Todd, although he doesn't know it, yet. He doesn't even know I bought this book, though he did know I was going to because when it came to our attention in the museum's gift shop and we both put it on our to-read lists right then and there, I promised I'd get us a copy. There was another book in the same display in which we were also interested, DIY Bitters: Reviving the Forgotten Flavor - A Guide to Making Your Own Bitters for Bartenders, Cocktail Enthusiasts, Herbalists, and More, and I've purchased that, as well. So my plan is to give that one to him while I read this one during my lunch breaks. Todd reads sporadically so it will take him years to get through that which is perfect because my lunch break reading only happens in summer and fall and I get distracted a lot and it often takes me more than a year to get a book read so we'll both have ample time to finish our fascinating tomes. When we're done, we'll swap! Together, we will learn all the things about making refreshing adult beverages out of plants. It's going to be a great time for us. It will not be a great time for Gabe because he thinks our projects are stupid but what does he know? He spends his time doing dumb nerd stuff, not science nerd stuff and science nerd stuff is the best stuff to do.One year later...This isn't a buddy read anymore. My victim and I broke up and we're just cordial acquaintances now (that's a pun because this book is about liquor)I have both books, I will read them by myself and wish I had someone with whom I could discuss the contents.C'est la vie.But!I finished this one and it is the perfect lunchtime reading book. It's arranged in quick essay format starting with major botanical-to-alchemical plants, such as wheat, barley, rice, etc. and moving on to lesser known plants that have been alcoholized, like angelica, chamomile, coffee, and pepper. Every plant gets between 1 and 6 pages of description, history, fermentation process, and anecdotes.There are recipes throughout.I enjoyed this a great deal both because it came in bite-sized pieces and because I am a plant enthusiast as well as a amateur mixologist (lies. I just like making drinks, I don't know anything about it, though) so everything in here was super fascinating to me."
6,1616200464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1545826-cissa,5,"Brilliant!I loved this book. While the format is something like an encyclopedia, I read it cover-to-cover, and was sad when i reached the end; the entries were that informative and well-written that it was more engaging than some novels I've read recently.I knew some of the background info, but a lot was new to me. And fascinating! As a species, we are clearly keen on fermenting anything that might be fermentable!The suggestions of ways to explore more- like with tequilas and liqueurs- were really interesting, and our bar storage is going to be increasing. The drink recipes included worked really well based on those I tried.Now- I got this as an ARC from LibraryThing, so the indices weren't functional, and the printing was gray-scale rather than the 2-color promised in the ""real"" version. Based on this, though, I've ordered the "":real"" version, because I think it'll be worth it; I've also ordered a couple of the author's other books.It really is that good.If you are interested in the history of booze, or in cocktails, or spirits in general- I HIGHLY recommend this book. It is not only really informative, it's a great read."
7,1616200464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman,4,"A good book to read a bit at a time, and a painless way to learn some botany. Stewart writes well, and her botanical vignettes are (mostly) entertaining. There are drink recipes and liquor lore, mostly lost on me -- though I did learn some interesting stuff about brewing beer. 3.5 stars, rounded up.This would make a fine gift book -- the hardcover is attractive, sturdy, and well-designed. I gave away a copy this past Christmas.The go-to review is Margitte's,https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."
8,1616200464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11781529-doris,4,"As the subtitle says, this is about the plants behind (alcoholic) beverages. Besides the obvious candidates, such as barley, grapes, rice, agave, etc. that form the backbone of drinks, the author also covers various flavoring agents, so that we hear about vanilla and cocoa and allspice and cinchona... The author is at pains to tell us that her coverage is by no means exhaustive, but it is comprehensive. She delves into the botany of the plants and how different species can contribute different flavors (or must be eschewed entirely due to toxicity or simply unpleasant tastes), the history of the plants and their mutations over the centuries, archeological findings supporting speculations about the origins of some favorite beverages, recipes for DIY, and growing tips for would-be gardeners.Through all this, her writing is approachable and entertaining. Another reviewer compared her to Mary Roach, and I agree that's a fair comparison. The book is also replete with fascinating trivia, e.g.:'When Coca-Cola made its ill-fated switch to New Coke, the Wall Street Journal reported that the economy of Madagascar nearly collapsed because of the sudden drop in demand for vanilla. The company refused, as always, to comment on its secret formula, but the inference was that the original Coke recipe called for vanilla and the new version did not.'It was perhaps more than I ever needed, or even wanted, to know, but I'm glad that I read it."
9,1616200464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345191-jennifer,5,"This book goes into meticulous detail in listing all the plants, trees, herbs, nuts, flowers, spices and pretty much anything else that has ever been fermented and distilled to make alcohol. Stewart tells how agaves are harvested, what that flavor in Amaretto di Saronno is (nope, not almonds), what kind of bugs find their way into what liquour and gives comparison charts for the multiples of say, violet liqueurs. This isn't just a gathering of dry facts though; when something is badly made Stewart tells you.Stewart is the other of several botany and gardening books, is the a founder of a gardening blog and has a bookstore. I'd read about this book here on LT, so when she appeared nearby a couple of weeks ago I went to grab this for the signing and listen to her talk about all the research (parties) that went into the two years she spent on this book. It's so complete that I know I'll be taking it with me to find things I never would have tried before. Who hasn't looked at a bottle of something and wondered what to do with it? You'll get the answer here. "
10,1616200464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14546476-bellagbear,4,"Despite my love-hate relationship with potted plants (they keep dying), the title of this book immediately caught my attention. Maybe that’s because I have a love-love relationship with liquors and most kinds of alcohol, who knows. While writing this review, I was sipping a good red port and musing over all the great anecdotes in this book. The book is best described as an encyclopaedia of the botanical origins of drinks, and how people came to make alcohol out of every plant they could find, such as the banana. Sometimes I really do admire the inventiveness of humans. So grab a nice drink of your choosing and let me tell you a bit more about this book.(...)This book is a combination of a serious botanical account, with growing tips that all seemed very sensible to me as a non-gardener. Also, there are funny stories and advice how to make the best cocktails and where to find the highest-quality ingredients. The book ends with a list of recommended readings for the reader who wants to know more. This combination of informative and entertaining works very well, especially because the topic of alcohol lends itself well for humorous accounts. It is a tricky balance though, because sometimes authors try to be too funny, losing credibility during the more serious parts of a book. Amy Stewart doesn’t do that: there is a clear division between the serious and funny parts. It might not be the kind of book you will read from cover to cover in one go: that will probably make you forget all the names of the plants and drinks, even when you’re reading it completely sober. It is the kind of book you pick up once in a while and read a few chapters from to have something new to tell next time you’re enjoying a drink in a bar or pub. This is part of the review. Read the full story, with lots of funny anecdotes and a great picture of alcohol and the socks my mother knitted me, at Bookworms United"

12,1616200464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"The Drunken Botanist: The Plants that Create the World's Great Drinks by Amy Stewart “The Drunken Botanist"" is a wonderful reference on plants associated with the world's favorite drinks. It's a well-balanced mixture of history, horticulture, and even some agricultural advice and some recipes to boot. It's an ambitious and well laid out book that like a great drink is better served in small measured amounts than as a whole. This instructive 400-page book is broken out into the following three parts: 1. We explore the twin alchemical processes of fermentation and distillation, from which wine, beer, and spirits issue forth, 2. We then suffuse our creations with a wondrous assortment of nature's bounty, and 3. At last we venture into the garden, where we encounter a seasonal array of botanical mixers and garnishes to be introduced to the cocktail in its final stage. Positives:1.	A well researched, and well-written book. 2.	An eye-catching title and an interesting topic for the masses.3.	Excellent format. Easy to follow. This is a book of essays that is best read in short time increments thus the well-laid format is conducive to jumping around to topics of interest.4.	A well-balanced book..some history, some horticulture, and recipes too. The book is structured around the journey from the desired plant to still, to bottle, to glass.5.	A very informative book from beginning to end. "" Serving size: A cocktail is not supposed to be an enormous drink. The modern martini glass is a monstrosity; filled to the rim, it holds eight ounces of liquid. That’s four to five drinks, more than anyone should choke down in a single sitting.""6.	The bottom line: ""the botanical world produces alcohol in abundance"". If there is one thing you are going to get out of this book is that fact.7.	I like how the book jumps into the classics; that is those plants most commonly associated with alcohol.8.	Stewart does a wonderful job of clarifying misunderstandings and debunking popular myths throughout the book. "" Mezcal is sometimes confused with mescaline, the psychoactive component of the peyote cactus Lophophora williamsii. In fact, the two are entirely unrelated, although peyote was sold in the nineteenth century as “muscale buttons,” leading to a linguistic misunderstanding that persists today.""9.	Plenty of fun anecdotes, ""Some historians have speculated that the Salem witch trials came about because girls poisoned by ergot had seizures that led townspeople to conclude that they’d been bewitched. Fortunately, it’s easy to treat rye for ergot infestation: a rinse in a salt solution kills the fungus."" Ok maybe not so much fun.10.	Some fun science facts, ""The DNA of apples is more complex than ours; a recent sequencing of the Golden Delicious genome uncovered fifty-seven thousand genes, more than twice as many as the twenty thousand to twenty-five thousand that humans possess."" 11.	The book provides some agricultural advice called ""Grow Your Own"". Value added.12.	Plenty of recipes too. Make your own cider.13.	Another bonus of the book is lists of terminology. As an example, Apple Spirits.14.	Interesting facts throughout the book, ""The oldest domesticated living organism is not a horse or a chicken, nor is it corn or wheat. It is a wild single-celled, asexual creature capable of preserving food, making bread rise, and fermenting drinks."" 15.	You will get a good handle on the process of fermentation. ""The science of fermentation is wonderfully simple. Yeast eat sugar. They leave behind two waste products, ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide. If we were being honest, we would admit that what a liquor store sells is, chemically speaking, little more than the litter boxes of millions of domesticated yeast organisms, wrapped up in pretty bottles with fancy price tags."" Bonus, ""But what about the other waste product, ethyl alcohol? That is what we call pure alcohol, or ethanol. After some tinkering, it makes for a great drink—but not for the yeast. As they excrete this alcohol, yeast make their own grave. They can’t survive in high concentrations of their own waste product, so as the alcohol content rises above about 15 percent, the yeast die off. That explains why, until distillation was invented, no human had ever enjoyed a stronger drink than beer or wine.""16.	Another fun section of the book is ""Bugs in Booze"". 17.	One of the best attributes about this book is that it covers all the main spirits and you can easily jump to your favorite sections.18.	Some great historical stories, ""At the state dinner, Prime Minister Chou En-lai held a match to his glass to show the president that the spirit could be lit on fire, a fact Nixon filed away for future use. In 1974, National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger told another Chinese official that the president tried to repeat the trick for his daughter when he returned home. “So he took out a bottle and poured it into a saucer and lit it,” Kissinger said, “but the glass bowl broke and the mao-tai ran over the table and the table began to burn! So you nearly burned down the White House!""19.	An excellent reference to have.20.	Includes a recommended reading list.Negatives:1.	My only gripe about this book is that it is best read in small increments. It reads like a collection of essays instead of one neat comprehensive narrative. It's an excellent reference and as such it is best read by topics of interest.2.	I really thought I was going to enjoy this book more than I did. It's well-researched, it has some funny anecdotes and it's a great book to have but it's not necessarily what I consider a must read. A must have, but not a must read. 3.	The parts are so much better than the whole. In summary, this is a great book to add to your book collection. It's not what I consider to be a must read but it will serve you well as a an excellent reference piece. The book is well researched and well arranged for easy access of topics. The one thing clear I got out of this book is never underestimate human's ingenuity in producing great drinks from practically every plant on this one globe we live on. If you are a biologist, gardener or a bartender, this is a must read, for everyone else this is a must have. I recommend it!

15,1616200464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1050800-laurie,5,"Nature seems to love making alcohol; take any plant with sugars present in it (any fruit and a lot of grains) and let it sit out where wild yeasts can land in it, give it a little time, and alcohol will appear. Humans have been taking advantage of this for thousands of years and show no signs of losing their enchantment with alcohol. It seems that no matter what area humans lived in, there was *something* that could be turned into alcohol. And if it couldn’t be turned into alcohol, it could be used to flavor alcohol. Stewart has written a book that, while small, is encyclopedic in style. First she takes us through the plants- grains, potatoes, cacti, grasses - that are fermented and distilled to make hard liquors; then she goes through categories like fruit, sap (sugar maple), and roots that are fermented and the herbs, seeds, nuts, and barks that are used to flavor the brews. For each plant she tells us how and where it was/is used, what it adds to the brew, which brands of the brew are best, and for many, how to grow the plant. This is where the book ties into gardening: while the average gardener won’t be growing grain and setting up a still, most gardeners are able to grow some mint for mojitos, jalapenos for some special margaritas, cherry tomatoes for a Blushing Mary, or a fruit tree. Face it; nearly everything in an alcoholic drink comes from plants except for bacon vodka and Irish cream. And a lot of those things are easy to grow. The author includes over 50 drink recipes for the home mixologist. The book accomplished two things for me: I have a lot better understanding of alcohols and the history of drinks, and I want to try a lot of things I can’t afford but really want to taste, like violet liqueur and fancy vodka. And I’m looking at my garden with a new eye: what can I grab out of it to make a drink? "
16,1616200464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6860169-serena-mcclain,4,"It's been forever since I've participated in any kind of book club. I'm generally not good with any kind of organized book reading. However, when my friend Sarah emailed to say that she'd won a charity auction that included copies of Drunken Botanist and the opportunity for the author to participate in a book club discussion, I jumped at the chance.Drunken Botanist: The Plants That Create the World's Greatest Drinks by Amy Stewart is a charming, intelligent compendium of the plants (herbs, flowers, trees, fruit, etc.) behind the alcohol and liquors enjoyed by many. Its combination of history, botany and chemistry is blended with keen storytelling and will appeal to more than your average garden nerd. It is the kind of book you leave on your nightstand and read a new entry from each evening before bed. It's the book that makes you feel better equipped to handle witty, cocktail party banter.I found Drunken Botanist to be thoroughly delightful, and it turns out that Amy, the author, is equally awesome. At one point in the evening, she managed to succinctly hit the nail on the head of why I'm not just inherently uncool because I often sit at a bar and struggle with what drink to order. I'm paraphrasing here, but ""you wouldn't expect to walk into a restaurant and find all of the ingredients on display before you, the waiter asking you to select what you'd like to eat for dinner.""The evening carried on in much that manner, the ebb and flow of conversation moving from cocktails and drinking stories to the ability to order liquor and wine over the internet to Loki's delight in creating chaos. Sarah made, as she put it, an apple cider ginger booze punch and later whipped up a batch of cucumber martinis, many of the ingredients coming from her own garden. You can nab the recipe for the cucumber martini pictured above on Sarah's blog.The book itself should come with the warning that you may suddenly find yourself with Evernote open, gleefully adding ""Clear Creek Distillery"", ""cassis"" and ""thick, rich, French liqueur, made from the fruit of the black currant bush, turns an ordinary glass of dry white wine, sparkling wine, or hard cider into something wonderful"" to a list of things to hunt for."
17,1616200464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5164471-geoffrey-benn,4,"As a graduate student who studies plant biology and also enjoys a good drink, Amy Stewart’s “The Drunken Botanist” is my kind of book. Stewart aims to educate readers about the botany and history of the many plants that find their way into human libations. The book is divided into 3 sections; first covering plants used as primary components of fermentation or distillation, then discussing the many, many plants that are used for flavoring in alcoholic drinks, and lastly giving some advice on how to grow some of aforementioned plants in home gardens. I found the first section to be the most satisfying – Stewart covers each plant and the corresponding beverage in detail, providing information on the different cultivars in use, the specifics of the particular fermentation/distillation process, and the distinguishing characteristics of the resulting beverages. In the subsequent section, the many dozens of plants used for flavoring are discussed, including quite a few that will be familiar to most drinkers (i.e. anise, hops, and juniper), some that are familiar, but not in the context of alcohol (i.e. clove, lemon balm, and chamomile), and some that are just plain unusual (i.e. bison grass, meadowsweet, and gentian). I found the book to be well-written and incredibly well-researched, though I think that it does become a bit encyclopedic starting with the second section. I would strongly recommend it to anyone with an interest in plants."

There's so much to learn, but with Stewart's gleeful exuberance and depth of knowledge, it's nothing but fun and fascination. And thirst, of course. There are lots and lots of cocktail recipes throughout the book. Trust me--you want this book. And buy one for your friends, because they will steal yours when you aren't looking. It's THAT kind of wonderful book."

It is always fun learning new things and this book definitely taught me a lot. I really don't consume alcoholic drinks mostly because I never really know what I would like to drink. What would taste good for me? This book goes into not only the making of each spirit but gives the reader recipes and ideas to create your own signature drink. I highly recommend it.

She's the sort of hipster who would actually go through the trouble of chasing down the authentic versions of these drinks, but it still looked interesting!However, I have a baby and I finally ""read"" it in audiobook format. Despite being effectively a herbal with recipes thrown in, it's very soothing to listen to and didn't feel ""list-y."" Histories and anecdotes flowed naturally, and the recipes were separated from the text with an audible clink of a glass. Effectively perfect for casual listening in the car where your attention can dip in and out.I would love to see a deluxe coffee table edition with a mix of full-colour photos and illustrations of both the plants and fancy cocktails in fanciful settings. A quick look online says there's a leather-bound edition, but the interior's still the same: everything in shades of green and gold.I would still keep the hardback out as a coffee table book if the baby weren't trying to eat it/tear out pages for his own purposes."

And when I say she loves plants, she's an arborist so, yeah, she'll talk your ear off about every tree in view. Luckily she's entertaining, engaging, interesting, and knows her stuff. Just like Amy Stewart, who puts similar talents to use in The Drunken Botanist.As we begin covering the botanicals distilled around the world to provide alcoholic refreshment (from A is for Agave to W is for Wheat), there are interesting side digressions. This format works perfectly for me to read a little every day when I'm getting ready for bed. Of course, it would also be a great general reference book for those who don't want to read it cover to cover.FINALThis was a wonderfully entertaining book, not only for those interested in cocktails but in showing how botany, seen through this focus, has influenced our history and behavior.

I'm not a big fan of cocktails and wasn't interested in recipes for them. I wanted more history of the plants. But each section was very short.She also came across weirdly racist? Just oblivious white person racist, the kind where I'm sure the author would be highly offended at anyone suggesting it. She's talking about all these plants from indigenous cultures around the world, but is sort of condescending and ""oh those silly natives"", explaining how sacred drinks are made as a curiosity. Talks about British colonizers and missionaries ""discovering"" plants in the places they went to (which the native people had already been making into alcohols for a long time.) Mentions that aid workers in an African country are ""reluctant to discourage"" the long standing production of an alcohol that has been traditionally made by women, provides some nutrition and income. (So... why would you discourage it... and why do you think you're making the decisions for these people?) Talks about mead, which is an incredibly widespread and ancient drink made in various ways by pretty much every culture that has access to any kind of bee, and says ""even Native Americans make it""!

But here’s the thing: this is an excellent book that I didn’t enjoy. It’s well researched and has what I’m sure are fascinating recipes and useful gardening tips and a lot of Latin words and some really fascinating stories. The problem is that I don’t particularly like recipes and gardening and plant names in Latin and in an audiobook format, there was no skipping over that. There were really great bits, like how horrifying American maraschino cherries are (you should never, ever eat one) and how sometimes you might end up drinking/eating bits of wasp corpses. Those bits were five star bits. But it turns out that a mild interest in delicious ways to get drunk wasn’t enough for me to love this book. "

Within its gorgeous green cover are sections on fermentation/distillation of various plants (from agave to wheat); information on the items that might infuse a spirit; and last, plants that can be used as fresh mixers and garnishes.   It’s part botany, binomial nomenclature and all; part chemistry, which goes a long way to explaining why plants and their distillates taste the way they do; part history, with carefully sifted facts of how this plant traveled from Asia/Africa to Europe to the Americas, or how that product gave rise to several lawsuits, or how the American people were swindled into believing that a chemically bleached and hardened excuse for a cherry was superior to fruit preserved in real maraschino liqueur (spoiler: it’s Prohibition’s fault. Of course it is).   Stewart includes recipes for about a dozen syrups and 4 dozen cocktails - all of them classics, or excellent riffs thereon. She also has sections with advice on how to grow your own plants, if you like, as well as recommended reading for gardeners and mixologists alike. I’d love to say that this book would clear up, say, the various apple beverages or grape-based spirits once and for all, but that will probably take at least one reread. Still, I commend this to the use of anyone who’s ever wondered why spirits are aged in oak barrels, or what potable bitters involve, or which liqueurs are worth getting.

I may not be a big drinker, but I am very curious about the stuff. The Drunken Botanist hits all the right notes for me. It's fascinating historical facts, brewing information, advice (and warnings) on growing the stuff yourself, and recommendations on brands and breweries. Essentially, I should be set for any alcohol-related Trivial Pursuit questions.The sense of humor is dry (or should I say secco?) and livens up the narrative. The book's listing on Amazon contains a short book trailer that sums up the humor quite well. A few times it made me giggle, but more than that it's the sort of book that balances information and amusement in a way that begs to be read out loud to others. Unless you're going to play these people at Trivial Pursuit. Then you may want to hoard the information for yourself.I received an advanced release ebook through NetGalley, though after reading only a short way, I concluded I need to buy a copy for myself and for a family member.

The hardcover edition is designed like a textbook: educational, but constantly interrupting itself with colorful asides. The e-book version suffers from the overall design because of its inherent linearity whereas physical books make flipping back and forth much easily.THE DRUNKEN BOTANIST covers anything and everything booze related. Stewart delves deep into the science behind the plants, process, and presentation of common alcoholic ingredients. From historical facts to cocktail recipes, the intrepid boozehound is bond to find something new to learn about their favorite drinks. It takes talent to combine humor and factual data without swinging too hard into either extreme, but Stewart manages the feat with gusto.Make no mistake: it's a reference book through and through. While beginner friendly, it's better suited on a bartender's bookshelf. Only buy if you plan on mixing drinks in the near future or want to buy the best brands of your particular poison. "

This book must have been written with me in mind. A co-worker who is a cocktail nut lent it to me, and I couldn’t put it down. From alcohols to liquors, mixers to garnishes, this book gives you the history of common ingredients to obscure herbs used in a single defunct liquor by monks in the Tyrols. With a particular eye to the botanical history and discovery of each ingredient, along with the subsequent alcoholic uses, readers are even provided with recipes for drinks and ingredients. The ending seems a little rushed, and there are occasional repetitions, but overall this is a fresh, well written reference.In short—great for anyone with an interest in gardening, drinking, or both."

WHAT ABOUT the LEMON WEDGE? Wheat beers are often served with a lemon wedge to highlight their natural citrus flavors, but some beer aficionados consider this a sacrilege. They argue that good beer should never require additional flavorings. In certain company, what one does with a lemon wedge and a glass of wheat beer could make or break a friendship. It’s your drink, so do what you want—but proceed with caution.
LOL I am one of those people who is horrified by beer served with lemon or lime or orange wedges, I don't even like to see beer served in a frosty mug, because ice-cold temperature kills the flavor. Yes, I will judge you.Ms Stewart is always a fun and enthusiastic author, and this is a fun book with a lot of fascinating information.Much like a fine whiskey (because no I could not resist that obvious metaphor), this is a book best savored slowly, not gulped. I tried to read just one section each day, but the first day I was so delighted, I read from agave straight through to potato.There is A LOT of information here, broken into three parts (the classics that are fermented, the add-ins that go in during fermentation, and mixers), each part organized alphabetically, with plenty of sidebar notes, and an on-going fascination with critters (bugs-in-booze) that pops up throughout.SOME of the fascinating things that I learned from reading this book:* Agave was originally grown as a food source, not for making a fermented beverage.* The oldest domesticated living organism is a yeast.* Corn was (most likely) grown not as a grain but as a source of sugar from the cornstalk, and was supplanted by sugar cane when that plant was brought to the Americas.* a red Italian liqueur was originally made using red dye from alkermes scale. (As a houseplant enthusiast, I'm familiar with the scale insect! I never knew about the red one.)* During Prohibition, California vineyards sold bricks of dried compressed grapes, along with yeast, and a warning not to soak the mixturein warm water - ""fermentation will occur!""* Vodka was originally made from rye and other plants; potato-based vodka was seen as cheap and inferior.* A drink made from fermented sweet potatoes (mobbie) was very popular in the Caribbean, only replaced by sugar cane rum after a beetle infestation wiped out sweet potatoes in Barbados in the late 1700s.* There are over 110,000 varieties of rice.* Cashew shells contain urushiol.* Some people think jasmine flowers smell like urine.A complete list of every plant discussed: Part 1: Agave | Apple | Barley | Corn | Grapes | Potato | Rice | Rye | Sorghum | Sugarcane | WheatBanana | Cashew Apple | Cassava | Date Palm | Jackfruit | Marula | Monkey Puzzle | Parsnip | Prickly Pear Cactus | Savanna Bamboo | Strawberry Tree | TamarindPart 2: Allspice | Aloe | Angelica | Artichoke | Bay Laurel | Betel Leaf | Bison Grass | Calamus (Sweet Flag) | Caraway | Cardamom | Clove | Coca | Coriander | Cubeb | Damiana | Dittany of Crete | Elecampane | European Centaury | Fenugreek | Galangal | Gentian | Germander | Ginger | Grains of Paradise | Juniper | Lemon Balm | Lemon Verbena | Licorice-Flavored Herbs | Maidenhair Fern | Meadowsweet | Nutmeg and Mace | Orris | Pink Peppercorn | Sarsaparilla | Sassafras | Sundew | Sweet Woodruff | Tobacco | Tonka Bean | Vanilla | WormwoodChamomile | Elderflower | Hops | Jasmine | Opium Poppy | Rose | Saffron | VioletAngostura | Birch | Cascarilla | Chinchona | Cinnamon | Douglas Fir | Eucalyptus | Mastic | Mauby | Myrrh | Pine | Senegal Gum Tree | Spruce | Sugar MapleApricot | Black Currant | Cacao | Fig | Marasca Cherry | Plum | Quandong | Rowan Berry | Sloe Berry | Citrus Almond | Coffee | Hazelnut | Kola Nut | WalnutPart 3: spearmint, lavender, pomegranate, strawberry, & pepperI found Part 1 to be the most interesting. I'm not sure if that's because I'd never heard of a lot of the flavorings mentioned in Part 2, or if it's because there are just SO many different plants listed, with little in depth information.Each chapter is full of details on the specific species domesticated, how it is grown, the plant's history, details on harvesting the goodness within, different fermentation methods, cultural significance, environmental issues, and recipes.For example (and it was difficult for me to choose just one example!), from the first chapter, agave: 
Any number of popular books on tequila and mezcal claim that when the Spanish arrived in Mexico, they needed a stronger drink to fortify themselves against the long and bloody struggle to come and introduced distillation as a way to turn pulque into a higher-proof spirit. In fact, tequila and mezcal are made from entirely different species of agave than pulque. The method for harvesting the plant and making the spirit is completely different, too. It turns out to be very difficult to put pulque in a still and get strong liquor from it. The complex sugar molecules in agave nectar don’t break down readily during fermentation, and heat from distillation causes unpleasant chemical reactions that create nasty flavors like sulfur and burning rubber. Extracting agave sugars for distillation requires a different technique—one that had already been perfected before the Spanish arrived. Archeological evidence—including the aforementioned coprolite analysis carried out by Eric Callen and others—proves that people living in Mexico prior to the Spanish invasion enjoyed a long tradition of roasting the heart of the agave for food. Pottery fragments, early tools, paintings, and actual remnants of digested agave all confirm this beyond a doubt. Roasted agave is a gourmet experience; imagine a richer, meatier version of grilled artichoke hearts. It would have made a fine meal by itself.
If you're wondering if she mentions Dogfish Head brewery, the answer is: yes, of course she does! (in five different sections)I can't emphasize enough how completely fascinating this book is!!!!"

I also appreciated the fact that Stewart wrote the book to be understood by the non-botanist layperson (e.g., me), and will look into reading more of her work.Edited to add: Stewart's love of the plants and the drinks comes through in the writing, which is also a definite plus."

The book combines some history of a specific drink and plant with information on how the plants are used in drinks. As a listener, and not a reader, I found the history more intrequing then the mixing instructions. The book did open a whole new appreciation for the variety of plant life we have, and wonder at how humans have discovered some of the steps needed to prepare these plants for use by us.Beacuse there is so much information that one can not remember or access in the audio format, I bought a hardcover edition. I expect it will take me years to go through the interesting recipes. I expect there will be many ingredients I will not be able to find.The one omission that might be worth adding is the anatomy of the coctail in a general level. Maybe it is obvious, but it seems that some explaination of why it 'works' might be in order. These drinks generally contain the base alcohol, then sweeteners and flavorings. It is the balance that makes the drink, and one could muse on how the human body interprets the base flavors.Usually I opt for unabridged books, but in this case it would be a better 'listen' without as much detail. A companion file with the drinks and the names of all the plants would be another useful addition."

My Mom likes Gin and Tonics (which my Dad makes for her!), and the information about tonic was fascinating!! Some of the recipes looked very inviting! And some I was glad to learn about the non-vegan-ness... some are obvious, some not so. (Be careful about Black Russians!) ;)Just all the info about plants and the process is so interesting. For instance, potatoes are associated with vodka, but they actually make the worse kind! Russian vodka makers say the best is made from rye or wheat. Potatoes only became a common ingredient because they were cheap and abundant! ha! And hops are in the cannabis family... closely related to marijuana! And, like left-handedness in humans, they have a genetic predisposition to vine themselves in a clockwise direction around their trellis. But 90% of all climbing plants twine themselves the other way - counter clockwise!Love these little tidbits!! Highly recommended to gardeners and naturalists and curious people!"

It covers the HISTORIES of alcohols and how all they all can be made, the SCIENCE behind different plants and spices and when they taste best, the WHY they work well in certain cocktails and with certain alcohols over others, and includes FUN stories and trivia.Even with all the recommendations, though, the author still encourages you to explore and create your own cocktails, by giving you all the information needed on how to safely do that and to correctly identify ingredients that we think we know (and sometimes don't).

I had to go out and locate a physical copy halfway through the audio version, since I feel that I'm going to be referencing this book for years to come. Not only does Stewart explain how various plants are used in alcohol, but along the way she provides recipes, interesting historical vignettes about specific plants, information on the overall mechanics of brewing, distilling, infusing, and garnishing, and provides what is very nearly a taxonomy of alcohol, told to the story of the plants that make them up.No real criticism.

58,1616200464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13153051-anna-lancaster,5,So much fun! All I've been able to talk about for the past week are cool plant and booze facts. I absolutely devoured this book and I've tried some beverages I would have never thought to try. 
59,1616200464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8995319-jc,5,"An unhealthy proportion of my podcast consumption is about food. I recently became extremely obsessed with tonic water after listening to a Gastropod episode on it. I was fascinated by this ingredient in classic tonic waters known as quinine, traditionally derived from cinchona bark. Even Canada Dry’s tonic water still contains quinine as advertised on its cans and bottles. Over the past month, I’ve been sipping through overpriced bottles of Fever-Tree (other than bulk in Costco, I’ve discovered that it seems to be cheapest at my neighbourhood Metro), as well as various bottles of chinotto (like Lurisia’s, which has become my absolute favourite) and Italian red bitter tonic waters (like Portofino). I’m now a tonic water socialist. Bad jokes aside though, quinine held a not insignificant role in the unfolding of globalization and its attendant wars. Amy Stewart introduces the cinchona tree like this:“No tree has had a more important role in the history of cocktails than this South American species. The quinine extracted from cinchona bark doesn’t just flavor tonics, bitters, aromatized wines, and other spirits. It also saved the world from malaria and put botanists and plant hunters at the center of several global wars.”For more insight into one of these wars, an excerpt on WW2 cinchona plantations from Daniel Immerwahr’s “How to Hide and Empire” might be helpful:“Malaria was especially nettlesome because the customary remedies were no longer available. More than 95 percent of the supply of quinine, the most effective antimalarial, had come from the cinchona plantations of the Dutch East Indies—now in Japanese hands. And the insecticide used to fumigate the Panama Canal Zone, pyrethrum, had come principally from Japan. Dozens of university laboratories screened more than fourteen thousand compounds in search of a synthetic antimalarial. Prisoners and conscientious objectors were brought in as guinea pigs. Two compounds worked well: atabrine and chloroquine. Atabrine turned the skin an alarming shade of yellow and disturbed the gastrointestinal tract, but it brought down malaria rates considerably. Chloroquine, which debuted at the end of the war, worked even better. Together, the synthetic drugs not only replaced quinine, they surpassed it.”I thought it was interesting that chloroquine was part of this quest to find a synthetic alternative to quinine — chloroquine being the chemical that has recently been floating about media talkingheads due to Trump’s dangerous remarks about chloroquine related to COVID-19. I also find it fascinating that among the guinea pigs that chemicals like chloroquine were tested on were conscientious objectors. War is and has always been deeply entangled with disease. Many victims of imperialist wars were not killed by direct acts of violence but by way of microbial pathogens (if not experimental drugs in the case of conscientious objectors). I think it’s important to note how the mass movement of humans across large distances is central to the spread of fatal diseases, and how wars are so often the engine behind such movement. Immerwahr on Spanish and American colonial interventions in the Philippines:“Doubtless, the guns and torches did kill tens of thousands. But the full story of Philippine mortality is considerably more complicated. As was often the case in the nineteenth century, most victims of the war died from disease… the diseases started under Spanish rule. The late nineteenth century had brought tumult to the Philippines, moving people around the archipelago and disrupting long-standing economic arrangements. Both motion and instability carried lethal epidemiological consequences, most notably during the cholera epidemic in 1882–83, which killed hundreds of thousands, and the rinderpest outbreak in 1887, wiping out nine in ten cattle and carabao… When the war with the United States came, those horsemen charged forth, now all at once and galloping: cholera, malaria, dysentery, beriberi, rinderpest, tuberculosis, smallpox, and bubonic plague.”The military of course knew that disease was a significant threat not only to people already living within their lands of conquest (which they cared little for) but also to their own soldiers deployed in these various far flung regions. This is the story of the American-provoked annexation of Panama (Immerwahr again):“Captain Mahan had suggested opening a canal through the Central American isthmus, which divided the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and Roosevelt agreed. He tried to buy territory from Colombia, without luck. He tried threatening and got no further. Finally, concluding that bargaining with Colombia’s leaders was liking trying to “nail currant jelly to a wall,” Roosevelt threw his support behind rebels, who declared Panama’s independence from Colombia. The newly established republic then leased to the United States a ten-mile-wide strip of land slicing through the middle of the country: the Panama Canal Zone.Still, more territory, more problems—problems of precisely the moving-things-and-people variety. The hot and rainy neck of land throbbed with disease-bearing mosquitoes. Panamanians who had lived with those mosquitoes their whole lives had acquired immunity to yellow fever and resistance to malaria. Outsiders, however, were fresh bait. Of the first batch of U.S. mainlanders to arrive in the Panama Canal Zone, nearly all were immediately laid low by malaria. Later officials came bringing their caskets with them.They weren’t being paranoid. Yellow fever, malaria, chronic diarrhea, dysentery, pneumonia, and bubonic plague tore through the zone. “I shall never forget the train loads of dead men being carted away daily as if they were just so much lumber,” remembered a carpenter… The point here is that, to open a canal, the United States had to exert colonial control. In fact, it transformed the Panama Canal Zone into one of the most intensively governed spots on the planet. Brigades marched forth to cut brush, drain swamps, and put up screens. They fumigated buildings with pyrethrum, an insecticide made from the petals of chrysanthemums—at peak they imported more than 120 tons a month. To combat mosquitoes, which laid eggs in still water, the authorities made war on puddles. They filled or covered any indentation where water might accumulate. They even ordered the holy water in the font of the cathedral changed daily after finding mosquito larvae in it.Altogether, opening the canal took ten years and cost nearly a third of a billion dollars—more if you count the cost of the landslides that perpetually closed the canal in its first years. As usual, records kept on the deaths of nonwhites were shoddy, but we think some fifteen thousand workers, mainly West Indian, died from accident or disease while on the job. And all to tame a strip of land ten miles wide and not even fifty miles long.”Diseases like malaria were of central concern to militaries, and so even by WW2, quinine and the cinchona plantations of Southeast Asia were vital for ensuring the health of soldiers, and that was certainly the case for various colonial militaries preceding WW2 also.This brings me to my next wildly irrelevant tangent. Not too long after wading about the world of tonic water and quinine, I eventually found myself muddling about the world of bitters. And of course there’s no place better to start than Angostura. (Hot tip: No Frills sells Angostura for way cheaper than Loblaws, Metro, or the LCBO). What got me really into Angostura was reading about its history. For one, its produced in Trinidad, home to Bhaskar Sunkara and some guy named C.L.R. James? Fun fact: according to Louise Cripps, the original publication of C.LR. James’ “Modern Politics” had an advertisement for Angostura bitters in it. More fascinating is Angostura’s history before it moved production to Trinidad. Angostura’s recipe was first developed in Venezuela by a German doctor named Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert, who was surgeon general in the revolutionary army of Simon Bolivar. Bolivar is known as the Liberator, whose namesakes include the country of Bolivia and Venezuela’s Bolivarian Revolution at the turn of the 21st century, which brought Chavez to power among the sweeping pink tide of Latin America. Bolivar was actually a rather complicated figure though. In the influential book “Imagined Communities”, Benedict Anderson situates Bolivar in this way (even mentioning the namesake of rapper Tupac Shakur, whose mom as a black revolutionary, was very well versed in world history):“In Peru, memories of the great jacquerie led by Tupac Amarú (1740–1781) were still fresh. In 1791, Toussaint L’Ouverture led an insurrection of black slaves that produced in 1804 the second independent republic in the Western hemisphere – and terrified the great slave-owning planters of Venezuela. When, in 1789, Madrid issued a new, more humane, slave law specifying in detail the rights and duties of masters and slaves, ‘the creoles rejected state intervention on the grounds that slaves were prone to vice and independence [!], and were essential to the economy. In Venezuela – indeed all over the Spanish Caribbean – planters resisted the law and procured its suspension in 1794.’ The Liberator Bolívar himself once opined that a Negro revolt was ‘a thousand times worse than a Spanish invasion… Bolívar came to change his mind about slaves, and his fellow-liberator San Martín decreed in 1821 that ‘in the future the aborigines shall not be called Indians or natives; they are children and citizens of Peru and they shall be known as Peruvians.”That was a slight tangent. Anyway, as for the German Dr. Siegert (Bolivar’s surgeon general), Brad Thomas Parsons, in his book “Bitters” describes the Siegert’s path to Angostura bitters:“Using his medical knowledge, Siegert harvested many of the local herbs, roots, botanicals, and barks (but not, despite the name, the bark of the angostura tree) to create tonics to stimulate the appetite of the troops, aid with digestive distress, and keep the army on its feet. By 1824 he had perfected a proprietary blend of Siegert’s Amargo Aromatico (aromatic bitters). Because it was a trading post on the Orinoco River, the town of Angostura (meaning “the narrows”) saw a brisk maritime activity as ships set sail for locations throughout the Caribbean. Soon Siegert’s bitters were being used by sailors to quell seasickness, and word of his product spread. By 1830 his bitters were available not only in nearby Trinidad but as far away as England. ”The English aspect is important because a cocktail known as Gin Pahit was a simple mix of gin with Angostura bitters, often referred to as pink gin these days. Pahit was the Malay word for ‘bitter’, and this drink was a favourite of Royal Navy officers in colonial Malaya, and mentioned by literary figures such as W. Somerset Maugham and P.G. Wodehouse. It was a common drink in Malayan cocktail bars frequented by colonial administrators, and was served at the Raffles Long Bar up until the 1980s. It has since gone out of fashion. Yet the pink hue of gin pahit is unmistakably the colour of the British Empire plastered onto colonial era maps of the time. And Angostura’s claims to relieve the unsettled stomachs of anti-imperial forces in Venezuela to the the sea-sickness of the British Empire’s Royal Navy marks a curious turn of events. As quinine and its synthetic counterparts were entangled in imperialist wars, so too were those of Angostura bitters, even if the bitters did have their roots in a revolution against empire. The gentian root of Angostura bitters is in fact in the same botanical family as quinine. So too is coffee, one of the beverages that got me into this bougie mess in the first place. Trying to train my palette, so as to better identify tasting notes in coffee, I’ve been working through alcohol and botanically fortified spirits to hone in my palette. Very bougie preoccupation.Anyway, most of this stuff I just wrote about Angostura was not mentioned in the book (the gentian root-quinine-coffee connection being one of a few exceptions). I had actually encountered most of this information before reading the book, but the fascinating story behind Angostura was what compelled me to seek this book out. In fact, there are far more fascinating stories and botanical revelations to be had in Amy Stewart’s book. It is a very fun read. I’ve been acquiring a taste for vermouth because of it, and certainly have been consuming more gin than I should be. Either way, I convinced myself that I eventually just want to move to dry drinks both for the benefit of my brain, liver, and wallet. But I hoped to get a rough outline of spirits and the tastes involved, before being able to experiment more confidently with making soft cocktails for myself. After working a 9-5 for three years, I understand why people become alcoholics. Hopefully I will improve my backyard herb garden this summer (since I’m confined to the house anyway), and get a small bitters collection going, and hopefully save enough to afford myself some nice tonic water, which I can water down with club soda if I really need to. They do tend to be fairly sugary substances. I'm embarrassed this the sort of fluff that I preoccupy myself with these days, lol. Ok, wow, this was a terrible book review. But a fantastic book. Also there’s a Walker Percy cocktail recipe in this book which will totally get you hammered. I feel like I will end up forgetting most of the really cool facts I encountered in this book, considering all the alcohol involved. It will be a challenge to remember star anise and cacao come from evergreen trees, that agave bloom as infrequently as every thirty years, or that vanilla are orchids that need roots exposed to air (not soil) and require the presence of a special fungus and often live on the limbs of trees a hundred feet off the ground, or that whisky is often dyed with soda or spirit caramel the colour chosen often dictated by the length of aging, or how bourbon must contain at least 51% corn spirit and be aged in new charred oak barrels, or how Nixon almost burnt down the White House by trying to show his daughter how Zhou Enlai lit his mao-tai on fire (at least according to Kissinger, if you can trust a war criminal). I will try to remember that cloves are tiny flower buds, and that hops (belonging to the cannabis family) are native to China, and the earliest records of citrus fruits are from China, and that mint is a weedy plant that can basically grow in sidewalk cracks (I will test this claim in my herb garden this summer). Anyway, this is definitely a book I’ll be keeping around for reference."

Within its gorgeous green cover are sections on fermentation/distillation of various plants (from agave to wheat); information on the items that might infuse a spirit; and last, plants that can be used as fresh mixers and garnishes.   It’s part botany, binomial nomenclature and all; part chemistry, which goes a long way to explaining why plants and their distillates taste the way they do; part history, with carefully sifted facts of how this plant traveled from Asia/Africa to Europe to the Americas, or how that product gave rise to several lawsuits, or how the American people were swindled into believing that a chemically bleached and hardened excuse for a cherry was superior to fruit preserved in real maraschino liqueur (spoiler: it’s Prohibition’s fault. Of course it is).   Stewart includes recipes for about a dozen syrups and 4 dozen cocktails - all of them classics, or excellent riffs thereon. She also has sections with advice on how to grow your own plants, if you like, as well as recommended reading for gardeners and mixologists alike. I’d love to say that this book would clear up, say, the various apple beverages or grape-based spirits once and for all, but that will probably take at least one reread. Still, I commend this to the use of anyone who’s ever wondered why spirits are aged in oak barrels, or what potable bitters involve, or which liqueurs are worth getting. For my own part, I long for a bottle of Clear Creek Distillery’s Douglas fir eau-de-vie."

I may not be a big drinker, but I am very curious about the stuff. The Drunken Botanist hits all the right notes for me. It's fascinating historical facts, brewing information, advice (and warnings) on growing the stuff yourself, and recommendations on brands and breweries. Essentially, I should be set for any alcohol-related Trivial Pursuit questions.The sense of humor is dry (or should I say secco?) and livens up the narrative. The book's listing on Amazon contains a short book trailer that sums up the humor quite well. A few times it made me giggle, but more than that it's the sort of book that balances information and amusement in a way that begs to be read out loud to others. Unless you're going to play these people at Trivial Pursuit. Then you may want to hoard the information for yourself.I received an advanced release ebook through NetGalley, though after reading only a short way, I concluded I need to buy a copy for myself and for a family member. I have also been eyeing Stewart's other books for a while, and now I definitely want to seek them out for my reference shelf."

The hardcover edition is designed like a textbook: educational, but constantly interrupting itself with colorful asides. The e-book version suffers from the overall design because of its inherent linearity whereas physical books make flipping back and forth much easily.THE DRUNKEN BOTANIST covers anything and everything booze related. Stewart delves deep into the science behind the plants, process, and presentation of common alcoholic ingredients. From historical facts to cocktail recipes, the intrepid boozehound is bond to find something new to learn about their favorite drinks. It takes talent to combine humor and factual data without swinging too hard into either extreme, but Stewart manages the feat with gusto.Make no mistake: it's a reference book through and through. While beginner friendly, it's better suited on a bartender's bookshelf. Only buy if you plan on mixing drinks in the near future or want to buy the best brands of your particular poison. "

This book must have been written with me in mind. A co-worker who is a cocktail nut lent it to me, and I couldn’t put it down. From alcohols to liquors, mixers to garnishes, this book gives you the history of common ingredients to obscure herbs used in a single defunct liquor by monks in the Tyrols. With a particular eye to the botanical history and discovery of each ingredient, along with the subsequent alcoholic uses, readers are even provided with recipes for drinks and ingredients. The ending seems a little rushed, and there are occasional repetitions, but overall this is a fresh, well written reference.In short—great for anyone with an interest in gardening, drinking, or both."

WHAT ABOUT the LEMON WEDGE? Wheat beers are often served with a lemon wedge to highlight their natural citrus flavors, but some beer aficionados consider this a sacrilege. They argue that good beer should never require additional flavorings. In certain company, what one does with a lemon wedge and a glass of wheat beer could make or break a friendship. It’s your drink, so do what you want—but proceed with caution.
LOL I am one of those people who is horrified by beer served with lemon or lime or orange wedges, I don't even like to see beer served in a frosty mug, because ice-cold temperature kills the flavor. Yes, I will judge you.Ms Stewart is always a fun and enthusiastic author, and this is a fun book with a lot of fascinating information.Much like a fine whiskey (because no I could not resist that obvious metaphor), this is a book best savored slowly, not gulped. I tried to read just one section each day, but the first day I was so delighted, I read from agave straight through to potato.There is A LOT of information here, broken into three parts (the classics that are fermented, the add-ins that go in during fermentation, and mixers), each part organized alphabetically, with plenty of sidebar notes, and an on-going fascination with critters (bugs-in-booze) that pops up throughout.SOME of the fascinating things that I learned from reading this book:* Agave was originally grown as a food source, not for making a fermented beverage.* The oldest domesticated living organism is a yeast.* Corn was (most likely) grown not as a grain but as a source of sugar from the cornstalk, and was supplanted by sugar cane when that plant was brought to the Americas.* a red Italian liqueur was originally made using red dye from alkermes scale. (As a houseplant enthusiast, I'm familiar with the scale insect! I never knew about the red one.)* During Prohibition, California vineyards sold bricks of dried compressed grapes, along with yeast, and a warning not to soak the mixturein warm water - ""fermentation will occur!""* Vodka was originally made from rye and other plants; potato-based vodka was seen as cheap and inferior.* A drink made from fermented sweet potatoes (mobbie) was very popular in the Caribbean, only replaced by sugar cane rum after a beetle infestation wiped out sweet potatoes in Barbados in the late 1700s.* There are over 110,000 varieties of rice.* Cashew shells contain urushiol.* Some people think jasmine flowers smell like urine.A complete list of every plant discussed: Part 1: Agave | Apple | Barley | Corn | Grapes | Potato | Rice | Rye | Sorghum | Sugarcane | WheatBanana | Cashew Apple | Cassava | Date Palm | Jackfruit | Marula | Monkey Puzzle | Parsnip | Prickly Pear Cactus | Savanna Bamboo | Strawberry Tree | TamarindPart 2: Allspice | Aloe | Angelica | Artichoke | Bay Laurel | Betel Leaf | Bison Grass | Calamus (Sweet Flag) | Caraway | Cardamom | Clove | Coca | Coriander | Cubeb | Damiana | Dittany of Crete | Elecampane | European Centaury | Fenugreek | Galangal | Gentian | Germander | Ginger | Grains of Paradise | Juniper | Lemon Balm | Lemon Verbena | Licorice-Flavored Herbs | Maidenhair Fern | Meadowsweet | Nutmeg and Mace | Orris | Pink Peppercorn | Sarsaparilla | Sassafras | Sundew | Sweet Woodruff | Tobacco | Tonka Bean | Vanilla | WormwoodChamomile | Elderflower | Hops | Jasmine | Opium Poppy | Rose | Saffron | VioletAngostura | Birch | Cascarilla | Chinchona | Cinnamon | Douglas Fir | Eucalyptus | Mastic | Mauby | Myrrh | Pine | Senegal Gum Tree | Spruce | Sugar MapleApricot | Black Currant | Cacao | Fig | Marasca Cherry | Plum | Quandong | Rowan Berry | Sloe Berry | Citrus Almond | Coffee | Hazelnut | Kola Nut | WalnutPart 3: spearmint, lavender, pomegranate, strawberry, & pepperI found Part 1 to be the most interesting. I'm not sure if that's because I'd never heard of a lot of the flavorings mentioned in Part 2, or if it's because there are just SO many different plants listed, with little in depth information.Each chapter is full of details on the specific species domesticated, how it is grown, the plant's history, details on harvesting the goodness within, different fermentation methods, cultural significance, environmental issues, and recipes.For example (and it was difficult for me to choose just one example!), from the first chapter, agave: 
Any number of popular books on tequila and mezcal claim that when the Spanish arrived in Mexico, they needed a stronger drink to fortify themselves against the long and bloody struggle to come and introduced distillation as a way to turn pulque into a higher-proof spirit. In fact, tequila and mezcal are made from entirely different species of agave than pulque. The method for harvesting the plant and making the spirit is completely different, too. It turns out to be very difficult to put pulque in a still and get strong liquor from it. The complex sugar molecules in agave nectar don’t break down readily during fermentation, and heat from distillation causes unpleasant chemical reactions that create nasty flavors like sulfur and burning rubber. Extracting agave sugars for distillation requires a different technique—one that had already been perfected before the Spanish arrived. Archeological evidence—including the aforementioned coprolite analysis carried out by Eric Callen and others—proves that people living in Mexico prior to the Spanish invasion enjoyed a long tradition of roasting the heart of the agave for food. Pottery fragments, early tools, paintings, and actual remnants of digested agave all confirm this beyond a doubt. Roasted agave is a gourmet experience; imagine a richer, meatier version of grilled artichoke hearts. It would have made a fine meal by itself.
If you're wondering if she mentions Dogfish Head brewery, the answer is: yes, of course she does! (in five different sections)I can't emphasize enough how completely fascinating this book is!!!!"

The book combines some history of a specific drink and plant with information on how the plants are used in drinks. As a listener, and not a reader, I found the history more intrequing then the mixing instructions. The book did open a whole new appreciation for the variety of plant life we have, and wonder at how humans have discovered some of the steps needed to prepare these plants for use by us.Beacuse there is so much information that one can not remember or access in the audio format, I bought a hardcover edition. I expect it will take me years to go through the interesting recipes. I expect there will be many ingredients I will not be able to find.The one omission that might be worth adding is the anatomy of the coctail in a general level. Maybe it is obvious, but it seems that some explaination of why it 'works' might be in order. These drinks generally contain the base alcohol, then sweeteners and flavorings. It is the balance that makes the drink, and one could muse on how the human body interprets the base flavors.Usually I opt for unabridged books, but in this case it would be a better 'listen' without as much detail. A companion file with the drinks and the names of all the plants would be another useful addition."

For instance, potatoes are associated with vodka, but they actually make the worse kind! Russian vodka makers say the best is made from rye or wheat. Potatoes only became a common ingredient because they were cheap and abundant! ha! And hops are in the cannabis family... closely related to marijuana! And, like left-handedness in humans, they have a genetic predisposition to vine themselves in a clockwise direction around their trellis.

Not only does Stewart explain how various plants are used in alcohol, but along the way she provides recipes, interesting historical vignettes about specific plants, information on the overall mechanics of brewing, distilling, infusing, and garnishing, and provides what is very nearly a taxonomy of alcohol, told to the story of the plants that make them up.No real criticism.

Recommended to ""foodies"" who like booze (boozies??) and gardeners. And folks who want to be either of those two things. "

If it hadn't been for book club, I definitely wouldn't have read it cover-to-cover (if at all, seeing as how I'm not really a plant person), and I wouldn't recommend that to many others. I would, however, recommend it if you're really into the relationship between your produce and your food, which I know many people are. It gave me many fun facts to think about, and honestly, a lot of different kinds of liquors and cocktail recipes that I'd like to try. Also, it's a really neat looking book, so it's worth having on your shelf if you like pretty books with recipes and fun facts."

At least, I don't think it is. But that is how I read it anyway, and while I found many parts of it interesting, as a whole, this book is rather dry.This is one of two books that made me wish I appreciated alcohol, the other being Love by the Glass by Dorothy Gaiter and John Brecher. While I do think I've found a drink I actually enjoy, it will take a while for me to come around to the hard stuff which seems to be the focus of this book.The parts I found most interesting were the growing tips of various plants that can be used in cocktails. I don't live in a place where any of them are really viable, but a girl can dream."

89,1616200464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8995319-jc,5,"An unhealthy proportion of my podcast consumption is about food. I recently became extremely obsessed with tonic water after listening to a Gastropod episode on it. I was fascinated by this ingredient in classic tonic waters known as quinine, traditionally derived from cinchona bark. Even Canada Dry’s tonic water still contains quinine as advertised on its cans and bottles. Over the past month, I’ve been sipping through overpriced bottles of Fever-Tree (other than bulk in Costco, I’ve discovered that it seems to be cheapest at my neighbourhood Metro), as well as various bottles of chinotto (like Lurisia’s, which has become my absolute favourite) and Italian red bitter tonic waters (like Portofino). I’m now a tonic water socialist. Bad jokes aside though, quinine held a not insignificant role in the unfolding of globalization and its attendant wars. Amy Stewart introduces the cinchona tree like this:“No tree has had a more important role in the history of cocktails than this South American species. The quinine extracted from cinchona bark doesn’t just flavor tonics, bitters, aromatized wines, and other spirits. It also saved the world from malaria and put botanists and plant hunters at the center of several global wars.”For more insight into one of these wars, an excerpt on WW2 cinchona plantations from Daniel Immerwahr’s “How to Hide and Empire” might be helpful:“Malaria was especially nettlesome because the customary remedies were no longer available. More than 95 percent of the supply of quinine, the most effective antimalarial, had come from the cinchona plantations of the Dutch East Indies—now in Japanese hands. And the insecticide used to fumigate the Panama Canal Zone, pyrethrum, had come principally from Japan. Dozens of university laboratories screened more than fourteen thousand compounds in search of a synthetic antimalarial. Prisoners and conscientious objectors were brought in as guinea pigs. Two compounds worked well: atabrine and chloroquine. Atabrine turned the skin an alarming shade of yellow and disturbed the gastrointestinal tract, but it brought down malaria rates considerably. Chloroquine, which debuted at the end of the war, worked even better. Together, the synthetic drugs not only replaced quinine, they surpassed it.”I thought it was interesting that chloroquine was part of this quest to find a synthetic alternative to quinine — chloroquine being the chemical that has recently been floating about media talkingheads due to Trump’s dangerous remarks about chloroquine related to COVID-19. I also find it fascinating that among the guinea pigs that chemicals like chloroquine were tested on were conscientious objectors. War is and has always been deeply entangled with disease. Many victims of imperialist wars were not killed by direct acts of violence but by way of microbial pathogens (if not experimental drugs in the case of conscientious objectors). I think it’s important to note how the mass movement of humans across large distances is central to the spread of fatal diseases, and how wars are so often the engine behind such movement. Immerwahr on Spanish and American colonial interventions in the Philippines:“Doubtless, the guns and torches did kill tens of thousands. But the full story of Philippine mortality is considerably more complicated. As was often the case in the nineteenth century, most victims of the war died from disease… the diseases started under Spanish rule. The late nineteenth century had brought tumult to the Philippines, moving people around the archipelago and disrupting long-standing economic arrangements. Both motion and instability carried lethal epidemiological consequences, most notably during the cholera epidemic in 1882–83, which killed hundreds of thousands, and the rinderpest outbreak in 1887, wiping out nine in ten cattle and carabao… When the war with the United States came, those horsemen charged forth, now all at once and galloping: cholera, malaria, dysentery, beriberi, rinderpest, tuberculosis, smallpox, and bubonic plague.”The military of course knew that disease was a significant threat not only to people already living within their lands of conquest (which they cared little for) but also to their own soldiers deployed in these various far flung regions. This is the story of the American-provoked annexation of Panama (Immerwahr again):“Captain Mahan had suggested opening a canal through the Central American isthmus, which divided the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and Roosevelt agreed. He tried to buy territory from Colombia, without luck. He tried threatening and got no further. Finally, concluding that bargaining with Colombia’s leaders was liking trying to “nail currant jelly to a wall,” Roosevelt threw his support behind rebels, who declared Panama’s independence from Colombia. The newly established republic then leased to the United States a ten-mile-wide strip of land slicing through the middle of the country: the Panama Canal Zone.Still, more territory, more problems—problems of precisely the moving-things-and-people variety. The hot and rainy neck of land throbbed with disease-bearing mosquitoes. Panamanians who had lived with those mosquitoes their whole lives had acquired immunity to yellow fever and resistance to malaria. Outsiders, however, were fresh bait. Of the first batch of U.S. mainlanders to arrive in the Panama Canal Zone, nearly all were immediately laid low by malaria. Later officials came bringing their caskets with them.They weren’t being paranoid. Yellow fever, malaria, chronic diarrhea, dysentery, pneumonia, and bubonic plague tore through the zone. “I shall never forget the train loads of dead men being carted away daily as if they were just so much lumber,” remembered a carpenter… The point here is that, to open a canal, the United States had to exert colonial control. In fact, it transformed the Panama Canal Zone into one of the most intensively governed spots on the planet. Brigades marched forth to cut brush, drain swamps, and put up screens. They fumigated buildings with pyrethrum, an insecticide made from the petals of chrysanthemums—at peak they imported more than 120 tons a month. To combat mosquitoes, which laid eggs in still water, the authorities made war on puddles. They filled or covered any indentation where water might accumulate. They even ordered the holy water in the font of the cathedral changed daily after finding mosquito larvae in it.Altogether, opening the canal took ten years and cost nearly a third of a billion dollars—more if you count the cost of the landslides that perpetually closed the canal in its first years. As usual, records kept on the deaths of nonwhites were shoddy, but we think some fifteen thousand workers, mainly West Indian, died from accident or disease while on the job. And all to tame a strip of land ten miles wide and not even fifty miles long.”Diseases like malaria were of central concern to militaries, and so even by WW2, quinine and the cinchona plantations of Southeast Asia were vital for ensuring the health of soldiers, and that was certainly the case for various colonial militaries preceding WW2 also.This brings me to my next wildly irrelevant tangent. Not too long after wading about the world of tonic water and quinine, I eventually found myself muddling about the world of bitters. And of course there’s no place better to start than Angostura. (Hot tip: No Frills sells Angostura for way cheaper than Loblaws, Metro, or the LCBO). What got me really into Angostura was reading about its history. For one, its produced in Trinidad, home to Bhaskar Sunkara and some guy named C.L.R. James? Fun fact: according to Louise Cripps, the original publication of C.LR. James’ “Modern Politics” had an advertisement for Angostura bitters in it. More fascinating is Angostura’s history before it moved production to Trinidad. Angostura’s recipe was first developed in Venezuela by a German doctor named Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert, who was surgeon general in the revolutionary army of Simon Bolivar. Bolivar is known as the Liberator, whose namesakes include the country of Bolivia and Venezuela’s Bolivarian Revolution at the turn of the 21st century, which brought Chavez to power among the sweeping pink tide of Latin America. Bolivar was actually a rather complicated figure though. In the influential book “Imagined Communities”, Benedict Anderson situates Bolivar in this way (even mentioning the namesake of rapper Tupac Shakur, whose mom as a black revolutionary, was very well versed in world history):“In Peru, memories of the great jacquerie led by Tupac Amarú (1740–1781) were still fresh. In 1791, Toussaint L’Ouverture led an insurrection of black slaves that produced in 1804 the second independent republic in the Western hemisphere – and terrified the great slave-owning planters of Venezuela. When, in 1789, Madrid issued a new, more humane, slave law specifying in detail the rights and duties of masters and slaves, ‘the creoles rejected state intervention on the grounds that slaves were prone to vice and independence [!], and were essential to the economy. In Venezuela – indeed all over the Spanish Caribbean – planters resisted the law and procured its suspension in 1794.’ The Liberator Bolívar himself once opined that a Negro revolt was ‘a thousand times worse than a Spanish invasion… Bolívar came to change his mind about slaves, and his fellow-liberator San Martín decreed in 1821 that ‘in the future the aborigines shall not be called Indians or natives; they are children and citizens of Peru and they shall be known as Peruvians.”That was a slight tangent. Anyway, as for the German Dr. Siegert (Bolivar’s surgeon general), Brad Thomas Parsons, in his book “Bitters” describes the Siegert’s path to Angostura bitters:“Using his medical knowledge, Siegert harvested many of the local herbs, roots, botanicals, and barks (but not, despite the name, the bark of the angostura tree) to create tonics to stimulate the appetite of the troops, aid with digestive distress, and keep the army on its feet. By 1824 he had perfected a proprietary blend of Siegert’s Amargo Aromatico (aromatic bitters). Because it was a trading post on the Orinoco River, the town of Angostura (meaning “the narrows”) saw a brisk maritime activity as ships set sail for locations throughout the Caribbean. Soon Siegert’s bitters were being used by sailors to quell seasickness, and word of his product spread. By 1830 his bitters were available not only in nearby Trinidad but as far away as England. ”The English aspect is important because a cocktail known as Gin Pahit was a simple mix of gin with Angostura bitters, often referred to as pink gin these days. Pahit was the Malay word for ‘bitter’, and this drink was a favourite of Royal Navy officers in colonial Malaya, and mentioned by literary figures such as W. Somerset Maugham and P.G. Wodehouse. It was a common drink in Malayan cocktail bars frequented by colonial administrators, and was served at the Raffles Long Bar up until the 1980s. It has since gone out of fashion. Yet the pink hue of gin pahit is unmistakably the colour of the British Empire plastered onto colonial era maps of the time. And Angostura’s claims to relieve the unsettled stomachs of anti-imperial forces in Venezuela to the the sea-sickness of the British Empire’s Royal Navy marks a curious turn of events. As quinine and its synthetic counterparts were entangled in imperialist wars, so too were those of Angostura bitters, even if the bitters did have their roots in a revolution against empire. The gentian root of Angostura bitters is in fact in the same botanical family as quinine. So too is coffee, one of the beverages that got me into this bougie mess in the first place. Trying to train my palette, so as to better identify tasting notes in coffee, I’ve been working through alcohol and botanically fortified spirits to hone in my palette. Very bougie preoccupation.Anyway, most of this stuff I just wrote about Angostura was not mentioned in the book (the gentian root-quinine-coffee connection being one of a few exceptions). I had actually encountered most of this information before reading the book, but the fascinating story behind Angostura was what compelled me to seek this book out. In fact, there are far more fascinating stories and botanical revelations to be had in Amy Stewart’s book. It is a very fun read. I’ve been acquiring a taste for vermouth because of it, and certainly have been consuming more gin than I should be. Either way, I convinced myself that I eventually just want to move to dry drinks both for the benefit of my brain, liver, and wallet. But I hoped to get a rough outline of spirits and the tastes involved, before being able to experiment more confidently with making soft cocktails for myself. After working a 9-5 for three years, I understand why people become alcoholics. Hopefully I will improve my backyard herb garden this summer (since I’m confined to the house anyway), and get a small bitters collection going, and hopefully save enough to afford myself some nice tonic water, which I can water down with club soda if I really need to. They do tend to be fairly sugary substances. I'm embarrassed this the sort of fluff that I preoccupy myself with these days, lol. Ok, wow, this was a terrible book review. But a fantastic book. Also there’s a Walker Percy cocktail recipe in this book which will totally get you hammered. I feel like I will end up forgetting most of the really cool facts I encountered in this book, considering all the alcohol involved. It will be a challenge to remember star anise and cacao come from evergreen trees, that agave bloom as infrequently as every thirty years, or that vanilla are orchids that need roots exposed to air (not soil) and require the presence of a special fungus and often live on the limbs of trees a hundred feet off the ground, or that whisky is often dyed with soda or spirit caramel the colour chosen often dictated by the length of aging, or how bourbon must contain at least 51% corn spirit and be aged in new charred oak barrels, or how Nixon almost burnt down the White House by trying to show his daughter how Zhou Enlai lit his mao-tai on fire (at least according to Kissinger, if you can trust a war criminal). I will try to remember that cloves are tiny flower buds, and that hops (belonging to the cannabis family) are native to China, and the earliest records of citrus fruits are from China, and that mint is a weedy plant that can basically grow in sidewalk cracks (I will test this claim in my herb garden this summer). Anyway, this is definitely a book I’ll be keeping around for reference."

Within its gorgeous green cover are sections on fermentation/distillation of various plants (from agave to wheat); information on the items that might infuse a spirit; and last, plants that can be used as fresh mixers and garnishes.   It’s part botany, binomial nomenclature and all; part chemistry, which goes a long way to explaining why plants and their distillates taste the way they do; part history, with carefully sifted facts of how this plant traveled from Asia/Africa to Europe to the Americas, or how that product gave rise to several lawsuits, or how the American people were swindled into believing that a chemically bleached and hardened excuse for a cherry was superior to fruit preserved in real maraschino liqueur (spoiler: it’s Prohibition’s fault. Of course it is).   Stewart includes recipes for about a dozen syrups and 4 dozen cocktails - all of them classics, or excellent riffs thereon. She also has sections with advice on how to grow your own plants, if you like, as well as recommended reading for gardeners and mixologists alike. I’d love to say that this book would clear up, say, the various apple beverages or grape-based spirits once and for all, but that will probably take at least one reread. Still, I commend this to the use of anyone who’s ever wondered why spirits are aged in oak barrels, or what potable bitters involve, or which liqueurs are worth getting. For my own part, I long for a bottle of Clear Creek Distillery’s Douglas fir eau-de-vie."

I may not be a big drinker, but I am very curious about the stuff. The Drunken Botanist hits all the right notes for me. It's fascinating historical facts, brewing information, advice (and warnings) on growing the stuff yourself, and recommendations on brands and breweries. Essentially, I should be set for any alcohol-related Trivial Pursuit questions.The sense of humor is dry (or should I say secco?) and livens up the narrative. The book's listing on Amazon contains a short book trailer that sums up the humor quite well. A few times it made me giggle, but more than that it's the sort of book that balances information and amusement in a way that begs to be read out loud to others. Unless you're going to play these people at Trivial Pursuit. Then you may want to hoard the information for yourself.I received an advanced release ebook through NetGalley, though after reading only a short way, I concluded I need to buy a copy for myself and for a family member.

The hardcover edition is designed like a textbook: educational, but constantly interrupting itself with colorful asides. The e-book version suffers from the overall design because of its inherent linearity whereas physical books make flipping back and forth much easily.THE DRUNKEN BOTANIST covers anything and everything booze related. Stewart delves deep into the science behind the plants, process, and presentation of common alcoholic ingredients. From historical facts to cocktail recipes, the intrepid boozehound is bond to find something new to learn about their favorite drinks. It takes talent to combine humor and factual data without swinging too hard into either extreme, but Stewart manages the feat with gusto.Make no mistake: it's a reference book through and through. While beginner friendly, it's better suited on a bartender's bookshelf. Only buy if you plan on mixing drinks in the near future or want to buy the best brands of your particular poison. "

This book must have been written with me in mind. A co-worker who is a cocktail nut lent it to me, and I couldn’t put it down. From alcohols to liquors, mixers to garnishes, this book gives you the history of common ingredients to obscure herbs used in a single defunct liquor by monks in the Tyrols. With a particular eye to the botanical history and discovery of each ingredient, along with the subsequent alcoholic uses, readers are even provided with recipes for drinks and ingredients. The ending seems a little rushed, and there are occasional repetitions, but overall this is a fresh, well written reference.In short—great for anyone with an interest in gardening, drinking, or both."

WHAT ABOUT the LEMON WEDGE? Wheat beers are often served with a lemon wedge to highlight their natural citrus flavors, but some beer aficionados consider this a sacrilege. They argue that good beer should never require additional flavorings. In certain company, what one does with a lemon wedge and a glass of wheat beer could make or break a friendship. It’s your drink, so do what you want—but proceed with caution.
LOL I am one of those people who is horrified by beer served with lemon or lime or orange wedges, I don't even like to see beer served in a frosty mug, because ice-cold temperature kills the flavor. Yes, I will judge you.Ms Stewart is always a fun and enthusiastic author, and this is a fun book with a lot of fascinating information.Much like a fine whiskey (because no I could not resist that obvious metaphor), this is a book best savored slowly, not gulped. I tried to read just one section each day, but the first day I was so delighted, I read from agave straight through to potato.There is A LOT of information here, broken into three parts (the classics that are fermented, the add-ins that go in during fermentation, and mixers), each part organized alphabetically, with plenty of sidebar notes, and an on-going fascination with critters (bugs-in-booze) that pops up throughout.SOME of the fascinating things that I learned from reading this book:* Agave was originally grown as a food source, not for making a fermented beverage.* The oldest domesticated living organism is a yeast.* Corn was (most likely) grown not as a grain but as a source of sugar from the cornstalk, and was supplanted by sugar cane when that plant was brought to the Americas.* a red Italian liqueur was originally made using red dye from alkermes scale. (As a houseplant enthusiast, I'm familiar with the scale insect! I never knew about the red one.)* During Prohibition, California vineyards sold bricks of dried compressed grapes, along with yeast, and a warning not to soak the mixturein warm water - ""fermentation will occur!""* Vodka was originally made from rye and other plants; potato-based vodka was seen as cheap and inferior.* A drink made from fermented sweet potatoes (mobbie) was very popular in the Caribbean, only replaced by sugar cane rum after a beetle infestation wiped out sweet potatoes in Barbados in the late 1700s.* There are over 110,000 varieties of rice.* Cashew shells contain urushiol.* Some people think jasmine flowers smell like urine.A complete list of every plant discussed: Part 1: Agave | Apple | Barley | Corn | Grapes | Potato | Rice | Rye | Sorghum | Sugarcane | WheatBanana | Cashew Apple | Cassava | Date Palm | Jackfruit | Marula | Monkey Puzzle | Parsnip | Prickly Pear Cactus | Savanna Bamboo | Strawberry Tree | TamarindPart 2: Allspice | Aloe | Angelica | Artichoke | Bay Laurel | Betel Leaf | Bison Grass | Calamus (Sweet Flag) | Caraway | Cardamom | Clove | Coca | Coriander | Cubeb | Damiana | Dittany of Crete | Elecampane | European Centaury | Fenugreek | Galangal | Gentian | Germander | Ginger | Grains of Paradise | Juniper | Lemon Balm | Lemon Verbena | Licorice-Flavored Herbs | Maidenhair Fern | Meadowsweet | Nutmeg and Mace | Orris | Pink Peppercorn | Sarsaparilla | Sassafras | Sundew | Sweet Woodruff | Tobacco | Tonka Bean | Vanilla | WormwoodChamomile | Elderflower | Hops | Jasmine | Opium Poppy | Rose | Saffron | VioletAngostura | Birch | Cascarilla | Chinchona | Cinnamon | Douglas Fir | Eucalyptus | Mastic | Mauby | Myrrh | Pine | Senegal Gum Tree | Spruce | Sugar MapleApricot | Black Currant | Cacao | Fig | Marasca Cherry | Plum | Quandong | Rowan Berry | Sloe Berry | Citrus Almond | Coffee | Hazelnut | Kola Nut | WalnutPart 3: spearmint, lavender, pomegranate, strawberry, & pepperI found Part 1 to be the most interesting. I'm not sure if that's because I'd never heard of a lot of the flavorings mentioned in Part 2, or if it's because there are just SO many different plants listed, with little in depth information.Each chapter is full of details on the specific species domesticated, how it is grown, the plant's history, details on harvesting the goodness within, different fermentation methods, cultural significance, environmental issues, and recipes.For example (and it was difficult for me to choose just one example!), from the first chapter, agave: 
Any number of popular books on tequila and mezcal claim that when the Spanish arrived in Mexico, they needed a stronger drink to fortify themselves against the long and bloody struggle to come and introduced distillation as a way to turn pulque into a higher-proof spirit. In fact, tequila and mezcal are made from entirely different species of agave than pulque. The method for harvesting the plant and making the spirit is completely different, too. It turns out to be very difficult to put pulque in a still and get strong liquor from it. The complex sugar molecules in agave nectar don’t break down readily during fermentation, and heat from distillation causes unpleasant chemical reactions that create nasty flavors like sulfur and burning rubber. Extracting agave sugars for distillation requires a different technique—one that had already been perfected before the Spanish arrived. Archeological evidence—including the aforementioned coprolite analysis carried out by Eric Callen and others—proves that people living in Mexico prior to the Spanish invasion enjoyed a long tradition of roasting the heart of the agave for food. Pottery fragments, early tools, paintings, and actual remnants of digested agave all confirm this beyond a doubt. Roasted agave is a gourmet experience; imagine a richer, meatier version of grilled artichoke hearts. It would have made a fine meal by itself.
If you're wondering if she mentions Dogfish Head brewery, the answer is: yes, of course she does! (in five different sections)I can't emphasize enough how completely fascinating this book is!!!!"

The book combines some history of a specific drink and plant with information on how the plants are used in drinks. As a listener, and not a reader, I found the history more intrequing then the mixing instructions. The book did open a whole new appreciation for the variety of plant life we have, and wonder at how humans have discovered some of the steps needed to prepare these plants for use by us.Beacuse there is so much information that one can not remember or access in the audio format, I bought a hardcover edition. I expect it will take me years to go through the interesting recipes. I expect there will be many ingredients I will not be able to find.The one omission that might be worth adding is the anatomy of the coctail in a general level. Maybe it is obvious, but it seems that some explaination of why it 'works' might be in order. These drinks generally contain the base alcohol, then sweeteners and flavorings. It is the balance that makes the drink, and one could muse on how the human body interprets the base flavors.Usually I opt for unabridged books, but in this case it would be a better 'listen' without as much detail. A companion file with the drinks and the names of all the plants would be another useful addition."

My Mom likes Gin and Tonics (which my Dad makes for her!), and the information about tonic was fascinating!! Some of the recipes looked very inviting! And some I was glad to learn about the non-vegan-ness... some are obvious, some not so. (Be careful about Black Russians!) ;)Just all the info about plants and the process is so interesting. For instance, potatoes are associated with vodka, but they actually make the worse kind! Russian vodka makers say the best is made from rye or wheat. Potatoes only became a common ingredient because they were cheap and abundant! ha! And hops are in the cannabis family... closely related to marijuana! And, like left-handedness in humans, they have a genetic predisposition to vine themselves in a clockwise direction around their trellis. But 90% of all climbing plants twine themselves the other way - counter clockwise!Love these little tidbits!! Highly recommended to gardeners and naturalists and curious people!"

It covers the HISTORIES of alcohols and how all they all can be made, the SCIENCE behind different plants and spices and when they taste best, the WHY they work well in certain cocktails and with certain alcohols over others, and includes FUN stories and trivia.Even with all the recommendations, though, the author still encourages you to explore and create your own cocktails, by giving you all the information needed on how to safely do that and to correctly identify ingredients that we think we know (and sometimes don't). I really enjoyed listening to this book and will now go get a physical copy to have on hand (because I definitely could not retain all that amazeball-ness)!"

For drunks!Stewart's extensive opus on the use of botanical matter in the creation, infusion, and dressing up of alcohol is well organized, informative, engaging, and a beautiful book, to boot. I had to go out and locate a physical copy halfway through the audio version, since I feel that I'm going to be referencing this book for years to come. Not only does Stewart explain how various plants are used in alcohol, but along the way she provides recipes, interesting historical vignettes about specific plants, information on the overall mechanics of brewing, distilling, infusing, and garnishing, and provides what is very nearly a taxonomy of alcohol, told to the story of the plants that make them up.No real criticism. This work was interesting, easy to read, useful, and fun. I could not recommend it more highly to anybody with an interest in alcohol that transcends simply getting drunk."

It certainly can be read all the way through (that's how I did it, albeit slowly) but it might work better as a reference or a book where you skip around a bit."

119,1616200464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8995319-jc,5,"An unhealthy proportion of my podcast consumption is about food. I recently became extremely obsessed with tonic water after listening to a Gastropod episode on it. I was fascinated by this ingredient in classic tonic waters known as quinine, traditionally derived from cinchona bark. Even Canada Dry’s tonic water still contains quinine as advertised on its cans and bottles. Over the past month, I’ve been sipping through overpriced bottles of Fever-Tree (other than bulk in Costco, I’ve discovered that it seems to be cheapest at my neighbourhood Metro), as well as various bottles of chinotto (like Lurisia’s, which has become my absolute favourite) and Italian red bitter tonic waters (like Portofino). I’m now a tonic water socialist. Bad jokes aside though, quinine held a not insignificant role in the unfolding of globalization and its attendant wars. Amy Stewart introduces the cinchona tree like this:“No tree has had a more important role in the history of cocktails than this South American species. The quinine extracted from cinchona bark doesn’t just flavor tonics, bitters, aromatized wines, and other spirits. It also saved the world from malaria and put botanists and plant hunters at the center of several global wars.”For more insight into one of these wars, an excerpt on WW2 cinchona plantations from Daniel Immerwahr’s “How to Hide and Empire” might be helpful:“Malaria was especially nettlesome because the customary remedies were no longer available. More than 95 percent of the supply of quinine, the most effective antimalarial, had come from the cinchona plantations of the Dutch East Indies—now in Japanese hands. And the insecticide used to fumigate the Panama Canal Zone, pyrethrum, had come principally from Japan. Dozens of university laboratories screened more than fourteen thousand compounds in search of a synthetic antimalarial. Prisoners and conscientious objectors were brought in as guinea pigs. Two compounds worked well: atabrine and chloroquine. Atabrine turned the skin an alarming shade of yellow and disturbed the gastrointestinal tract, but it brought down malaria rates considerably. Chloroquine, which debuted at the end of the war, worked even better. Together, the synthetic drugs not only replaced quinine, they surpassed it.”I thought it was interesting that chloroquine was part of this quest to find a synthetic alternative to quinine — chloroquine being the chemical that has recently been floating about media talkingheads due to Trump’s dangerous remarks about chloroquine related to COVID-19. I also find it fascinating that among the guinea pigs that chemicals like chloroquine were tested on were conscientious objectors. War is and has always been deeply entangled with disease. Many victims of imperialist wars were not killed by direct acts of violence but by way of microbial pathogens (if not experimental drugs in the case of conscientious objectors). I think it’s important to note how the mass movement of humans across large distances is central to the spread of fatal diseases, and how wars are so often the engine behind such movement. Immerwahr on Spanish and American colonial interventions in the Philippines:“Doubtless, the guns and torches did kill tens of thousands. But the full story of Philippine mortality is considerably more complicated. As was often the case in the nineteenth century, most victims of the war died from disease… the diseases started under Spanish rule. The late nineteenth century had brought tumult to the Philippines, moving people around the archipelago and disrupting long-standing economic arrangements. Both motion and instability carried lethal epidemiological consequences, most notably during the cholera epidemic in 1882–83, which killed hundreds of thousands, and the rinderpest outbreak in 1887, wiping out nine in ten cattle and carabao… When the war with the United States came, those horsemen charged forth, now all at once and galloping: cholera, malaria, dysentery, beriberi, rinderpest, tuberculosis, smallpox, and bubonic plague.”The military of course knew that disease was a significant threat not only to people already living within their lands of conquest (which they cared little for) but also to their own soldiers deployed in these various far flung regions. This is the story of the American-provoked annexation of Panama (Immerwahr again):“Captain Mahan had suggested opening a canal through the Central American isthmus, which divided the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and Roosevelt agreed. He tried to buy territory from Colombia, without luck. He tried threatening and got no further. Finally, concluding that bargaining with Colombia’s leaders was liking trying to “nail currant jelly to a wall,” Roosevelt threw his support behind rebels, who declared Panama’s independence from Colombia. The newly established republic then leased to the United States a ten-mile-wide strip of land slicing through the middle of the country: the Panama Canal Zone.Still, more territory, more problems—problems of precisely the moving-things-and-people variety. The hot and rainy neck of land throbbed with disease-bearing mosquitoes. Panamanians who had lived with those mosquitoes their whole lives had acquired immunity to yellow fever and resistance to malaria. Outsiders, however, were fresh bait. Of the first batch of U.S. mainlanders to arrive in the Panama Canal Zone, nearly all were immediately laid low by malaria. Later officials came bringing their caskets with them.They weren’t being paranoid. Yellow fever, malaria, chronic diarrhea, dysentery, pneumonia, and bubonic plague tore through the zone. “I shall never forget the train loads of dead men being carted away daily as if they were just so much lumber,” remembered a carpenter… The point here is that, to open a canal, the United States had to exert colonial control. In fact, it transformed the Panama Canal Zone into one of the most intensively governed spots on the planet. Brigades marched forth to cut brush, drain swamps, and put up screens. They fumigated buildings with pyrethrum, an insecticide made from the petals of chrysanthemums—at peak they imported more than 120 tons a month. To combat mosquitoes, which laid eggs in still water, the authorities made war on puddles. They filled or covered any indentation where water might accumulate. They even ordered the holy water in the font of the cathedral changed daily after finding mosquito larvae in it.Altogether, opening the canal took ten years and cost nearly a third of a billion dollars—more if you count the cost of the landslides that perpetually closed the canal in its first years. As usual, records kept on the deaths of nonwhites were shoddy, but we think some fifteen thousand workers, mainly West Indian, died from accident or disease while on the job. And all to tame a strip of land ten miles wide and not even fifty miles long.”Diseases like malaria were of central concern to militaries, and so even by WW2, quinine and the cinchona plantations of Southeast Asia were vital for ensuring the health of soldiers, and that was certainly the case for various colonial militaries preceding WW2 also.This brings me to my next wildly irrelevant tangent. Not too long after wading about the world of tonic water and quinine, I eventually found myself muddling about the world of bitters. And of course there’s no place better to start than Angostura. (Hot tip: No Frills sells Angostura for way cheaper than Loblaws, Metro, or the LCBO). What got me really into Angostura was reading about its history. For one, its produced in Trinidad, home to Bhaskar Sunkara and some guy named C.L.R. James? Fun fact: according to Louise Cripps, the original publication of C.LR. James’ “Modern Politics” had an advertisement for Angostura bitters in it. More fascinating is Angostura’s history before it moved production to Trinidad. Angostura’s recipe was first developed in Venezuela by a German doctor named Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert, who was surgeon general in the revolutionary army of Simon Bolivar. Bolivar is known as the Liberator, whose namesakes include the country of Bolivia and Venezuela’s Bolivarian Revolution at the turn of the 21st century, which brought Chavez to power among the sweeping pink tide of Latin America. Bolivar was actually a rather complicated figure though. In the influential book “Imagined Communities”, Benedict Anderson situates Bolivar in this way (even mentioning the namesake of rapper Tupac Shakur, whose mom as a black revolutionary, was very well versed in world history):“In Peru, memories of the great jacquerie led by Tupac Amarú (1740–1781) were still fresh. In 1791, Toussaint L’Ouverture led an insurrection of black slaves that produced in 1804 the second independent republic in the Western hemisphere – and terrified the great slave-owning planters of Venezuela. When, in 1789, Madrid issued a new, more humane, slave law specifying in detail the rights and duties of masters and slaves, ‘the creoles rejected state intervention on the grounds that slaves were prone to vice and independence [!], and were essential to the economy. In Venezuela – indeed all over the Spanish Caribbean – planters resisted the law and procured its suspension in 1794.’ The Liberator Bolívar himself once opined that a Negro revolt was ‘a thousand times worse than a Spanish invasion… Bolívar came to change his mind about slaves, and his fellow-liberator San Martín decreed in 1821 that ‘in the future the aborigines shall not be called Indians or natives; they are children and citizens of Peru and they shall be known as Peruvians.”That was a slight tangent. Anyway, as for the German Dr. Siegert (Bolivar’s surgeon general), Brad Thomas Parsons, in his book “Bitters” describes the Siegert’s path to Angostura bitters:“Using his medical knowledge, Siegert harvested many of the local herbs, roots, botanicals, and barks (but not, despite the name, the bark of the angostura tree) to create tonics to stimulate the appetite of the troops, aid with digestive distress, and keep the army on its feet. By 1824 he had perfected a proprietary blend of Siegert’s Amargo Aromatico (aromatic bitters). Because it was a trading post on the Orinoco River, the town of Angostura (meaning “the narrows”) saw a brisk maritime activity as ships set sail for locations throughout the Caribbean. Soon Siegert’s bitters were being used by sailors to quell seasickness, and word of his product spread. By 1830 his bitters were available not only in nearby Trinidad but as far away as England. ”The English aspect is important because a cocktail known as Gin Pahit was a simple mix of gin with Angostura bitters, often referred to as pink gin these days. Pahit was the Malay word for ‘bitter’, and this drink was a favourite of Royal Navy officers in colonial Malaya, and mentioned by literary figures such as W. Somerset Maugham and P.G. Wodehouse. It was a common drink in Malayan cocktail bars frequented by colonial administrators, and was served at the Raffles Long Bar up until the 1980s. It has since gone out of fashion. Yet the pink hue of gin pahit is unmistakably the colour of the British Empire plastered onto colonial era maps of the time. And Angostura’s claims to relieve the unsettled stomachs of anti-imperial forces in Venezuela to the the sea-sickness of the British Empire’s Royal Navy marks a curious turn of events. As quinine and its synthetic counterparts were entangled in imperialist wars, so too were those of Angostura bitters, even if the bitters did have their roots in a revolution against empire. The gentian root of Angostura bitters is in fact in the same botanical family as quinine. So too is coffee, one of the beverages that got me into this bougie mess in the first place. Trying to train my palette, so as to better identify tasting notes in coffee, I’ve been working through alcohol and botanically fortified spirits to hone in my palette. Very bougie preoccupation.Anyway, most of this stuff I just wrote about Angostura was not mentioned in the book (the gentian root-quinine-coffee connection being one of a few exceptions). I had actually encountered most of this information before reading the book, but the fascinating story behind Angostura was what compelled me to seek this book out. In fact, there are far more fascinating stories and botanical revelations to be had in Amy Stewart’s book. It is a very fun read. I’ve been acquiring a taste for vermouth because of it, and certainly have been consuming more gin than I should be. Either way, I convinced myself that I eventually just want to move to dry drinks both for the benefit of my brain, liver, and wallet. But I hoped to get a rough outline of spirits and the tastes involved, before being able to experiment more confidently with making soft cocktails for myself. After working a 9-5 for three years, I understand why people become alcoholics. Hopefully I will improve my backyard herb garden this summer (since I’m confined to the house anyway), and get a small bitters collection going, and hopefully save enough to afford myself some nice tonic water, which I can water down with club soda if I really need to. They do tend to be fairly sugary substances. I'm embarrassed this the sort of fluff that I preoccupy myself with these days, lol. Ok, wow, this was a terrible book review. But a fantastic book. Also there’s a Walker Percy cocktail recipe in this book which will totally get you hammered. I feel like I will end up forgetting most of the really cool facts I encountered in this book, considering all the alcohol involved. It will be a challenge to remember star anise and cacao come from evergreen trees, that agave bloom as infrequently as every thirty years, or that vanilla are orchids that need roots exposed to air (not soil) and require the presence of a special fungus and often live on the limbs of trees a hundred feet off the ground, or that whisky is often dyed with soda or spirit caramel the colour chosen often dictated by the length of aging, or how bourbon must contain at least 51% corn spirit and be aged in new charred oak barrels, or how Nixon almost burnt down the White House by trying to show his daughter how Zhou Enlai lit his mao-tai on fire (at least according to Kissinger, if you can trust a war criminal). I will try to remember that cloves are tiny flower buds, and that hops (belonging to the cannabis family) are native to China, and the earliest records of citrus fruits are from China, and that mint is a weedy plant that can basically grow in sidewalk cracks (I will test this claim in my herb garden this summer). Anyway, this is definitely a book I’ll be keeping around for reference."

Within its gorgeous green cover are sections on fermentation/distillation of various plants (from agave to wheat); information on the items that might infuse a spirit; and last, plants that can be used as fresh mixers and garnishes.   It’s part botany, binomial nomenclature and all; part chemistry, which goes a long way to explaining why plants and their distillates taste the way they do; part history, with carefully sifted facts of how this plant traveled from Asia/Africa to Europe to the Americas, or how that product gave rise to several lawsuits, or how the American people were swindled into believing that a chemically bleached and hardened excuse for a cherry was superior to fruit preserved in real maraschino liqueur (spoiler: it’s Prohibition’s fault. Of course it is).   Stewart includes recipes for about a dozen syrups and 4 dozen cocktails - all of them classics, or excellent riffs thereon. She also has sections with advice on how to grow your own plants, if you like, as well as recommended reading for gardeners and mixologists alike. I’d love to say that this book would clear up, say, the various apple beverages or grape-based spirits once and for all, but that will probably take at least one reread. Still, I commend this to the use of anyone who’s ever wondered why spirits are aged in oak barrels, or what potable bitters involve, or which liqueurs are worth getting.

I may not be a big drinker, but I am very curious about the stuff. The Drunken Botanist hits all the right notes for me. It's fascinating historical facts, brewing information, advice (and warnings) on growing the stuff yourself, and recommendations on brands and breweries. Essentially, I should be set for any alcohol-related Trivial Pursuit questions.The sense of humor is dry (or should I say secco?) and livens up the narrative. The book's listing on Amazon contains a short book trailer that sums up the humor quite well. A few times it made me giggle, but more than that it's the sort of book that balances information and amusement in a way that begs to be read out loud to others. Unless you're going to play these people at Trivial Pursuit. Then you may want to hoard the information for yourself.I received an advanced release ebook through NetGalley, though after reading only a short way, I concluded I need to buy a copy for myself and for a family member.

The hardcover edition is designed like a textbook: educational, but constantly interrupting itself with colorful asides. The e-book version suffers from the overall design because of its inherent linearity whereas physical books make flipping back and forth much easily.THE DRUNKEN BOTANIST covers anything and everything booze related. Stewart delves deep into the science behind the plants, process, and presentation of common alcoholic ingredients. From historical facts to cocktail recipes, the intrepid boozehound is bond to find something new to learn about their favorite drinks. It takes talent to combine humor and factual data without swinging too hard into either extreme, but Stewart manages the feat with gusto.Make no mistake: it's a reference book through and through. While beginner friendly, it's better suited on a bartender's bookshelf. Only buy if you plan on mixing drinks in the near future or want to buy the best brands of your particular poison. "

From alcohols to liquors, mixers to garnishes, this book gives you the history of common ingredients to obscure herbs used in a single defunct liquor by monks in the Tyrols. With a particular eye to the botanical history and discovery of each ingredient, along with the subsequent alcoholic uses, readers are even provided with recipes for drinks and ingredients. The ending seems a little rushed, and there are occasional repetitions, but overall this is a fresh, well written reference.In short—great for anyone with an interest in gardening, drinking, or both."

WHAT ABOUT the LEMON WEDGE? Wheat beers are often served with a lemon wedge to highlight their natural citrus flavors, but some beer aficionados consider this a sacrilege. They argue that good beer should never require additional flavorings. In certain company, what one does with a lemon wedge and a glass of wheat beer could make or break a friendship. It’s your drink, so do what you want—but proceed with caution.
LOL I am one of those people who is horrified by beer served with lemon or lime or orange wedges, I don't even like to see beer served in a frosty mug, because ice-cold temperature kills the flavor. Yes, I will judge you.Ms Stewart is always a fun and enthusiastic author, and this is a fun book with a lot of fascinating information.Much like a fine whiskey (because no I could not resist that obvious metaphor), this is a book best savored slowly, not gulped. I tried to read just one section each day, but the first day I was so delighted, I read from agave straight through to potato.There is A LOT of information here, broken into three parts (the classics that are fermented, the add-ins that go in during fermentation, and mixers), each part organized alphabetically, with plenty of sidebar notes, and an on-going fascination with critters (bugs-in-booze) that pops up throughout.SOME of the fascinating things that I learned from reading this book:* Agave was originally grown as a food source, not for making a fermented beverage.* The oldest domesticated living organism is a yeast.* Corn was (most likely) grown not as a grain but as a source of sugar from the cornstalk, and was supplanted by sugar cane when that plant was brought to the Americas.* a red Italian liqueur was originally made using red dye from alkermes scale. (As a houseplant enthusiast, I'm familiar with the scale insect! I never knew about the red one.)* During Prohibition, California vineyards sold bricks of dried compressed grapes, along with yeast, and a warning not to soak the mixturein warm water - ""fermentation will occur!""* Vodka was originally made from rye and other plants; potato-based vodka was seen as cheap and inferior.* A drink made from fermented sweet potatoes (mobbie) was very popular in the Caribbean, only replaced by sugar cane rum after a beetle infestation wiped out sweet potatoes in Barbados in the late 1700s.* There are over 110,000 varieties of rice.* Cashew shells contain urushiol.* Some people think jasmine flowers smell like urine.A complete list of every plant discussed: Part 1: Agave | Apple | Barley | Corn | Grapes | Potato | Rice | Rye | Sorghum | Sugarcane | WheatBanana | Cashew Apple | Cassava | Date Palm | Jackfruit | Marula | Monkey Puzzle | Parsnip | Prickly Pear Cactus | Savanna Bamboo | Strawberry Tree | TamarindPart 2: Allspice | Aloe | Angelica | Artichoke | Bay Laurel | Betel Leaf | Bison Grass | Calamus (Sweet Flag) | Caraway | Cardamom | Clove | Coca | Coriander | Cubeb | Damiana | Dittany of Crete | Elecampane | European Centaury | Fenugreek | Galangal | Gentian | Germander | Ginger | Grains of Paradise | Juniper | Lemon Balm | Lemon Verbena | Licorice-Flavored Herbs | Maidenhair Fern | Meadowsweet | Nutmeg and Mace | Orris | Pink Peppercorn | Sarsaparilla | Sassafras | Sundew | Sweet Woodruff | Tobacco | Tonka Bean | Vanilla | WormwoodChamomile | Elderflower | Hops | Jasmine | Opium Poppy | Rose | Saffron | VioletAngostura | Birch | Cascarilla | Chinchona | Cinnamon | Douglas Fir | Eucalyptus | Mastic | Mauby | Myrrh | Pine | Senegal Gum Tree | Spruce | Sugar MapleApricot | Black Currant | Cacao | Fig | Marasca Cherry | Plum | Quandong | Rowan Berry | Sloe Berry | Citrus Almond | Coffee | Hazelnut | Kola Nut | WalnutPart 3: spearmint, lavender, pomegranate, strawberry, & pepperI found Part 1 to be the most interesting. I'm not sure if that's because I'd never heard of a lot of the flavorings mentioned in Part 2, or if it's because there are just SO many different plants listed, with little in depth information.Each chapter is full of details on the specific species domesticated, how it is grown, the plant's history, details on harvesting the goodness within, different fermentation methods, cultural significance, environmental issues, and recipes.For example (and it was difficult for me to choose just one example!), from the first chapter, agave: 
Any number of popular books on tequila and mezcal claim that when the Spanish arrived in Mexico, they needed a stronger drink to fortify themselves against the long and bloody struggle to come and introduced distillation as a way to turn pulque into a higher-proof spirit. In fact, tequila and mezcal are made from entirely different species of agave than pulque. The method for harvesting the plant and making the spirit is completely different, too. It turns out to be very difficult to put pulque in a still and get strong liquor from it. The complex sugar molecules in agave nectar don’t break down readily during fermentation, and heat from distillation causes unpleasant chemical reactions that create nasty flavors like sulfur and burning rubber. Extracting agave sugars for distillation requires a different technique—one that had already been perfected before the Spanish arrived. Archeological evidence—including the aforementioned coprolite analysis carried out by Eric Callen and others—proves that people living in Mexico prior to the Spanish invasion enjoyed a long tradition of roasting the heart of the agave for food. Pottery fragments, early tools, paintings, and actual remnants of digested agave all confirm this beyond a doubt. Roasted agave is a gourmet experience; imagine a richer, meatier version of grilled artichoke hearts. It would have made a fine meal by itself.

The book combines some history of a specific drink and plant with information on how the plants are used in drinks. As a listener, and not a reader, I found the history more intrequing then the mixing instructions. The book did open a whole new appreciation for the variety of plant life we have, and wonder at how humans have discovered some of the steps needed to prepare these plants for use by us.Beacuse there is so much information that one can not remember or access in the audio format, I bought a hardcover edition. I expect it will take me years to go through the interesting recipes. I expect there will be many ingredients I will not be able to find.The one omission that might be worth adding is the anatomy of the coctail in a general level. Maybe it is obvious, but it seems that some explaination of why it 'works' might be in order. These drinks generally contain the base alcohol, then sweeteners and flavorings. It is the balance that makes the drink, and one could muse on how the human body interprets the base flavors.Usually I opt for unabridged books, but in this case it would be a better 'listen' without as much detail. A companion file with the drinks and the names of all the plants would be another useful addition."

My Mom likes Gin and Tonics (which my Dad makes for her!), and the information about tonic was fascinating!! Some of the recipes looked very inviting! And some I was glad to learn about the non-vegan-ness... some are obvious, some not so. (Be careful about Black Russians!) ;)Just all the info about plants and the process is so interesting. For instance, potatoes are associated with vodka, but they actually make the worse kind! Russian vodka makers say the best is made from rye or wheat. Potatoes only became a common ingredient because they were cheap and abundant! ha! And hops are in the cannabis family... closely related to marijuana! And, like left-handedness in humans, they have a genetic predisposition to vine themselves in a clockwise direction around their trellis.

149,1616200464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8995319-jc,5,"An unhealthy proportion of my podcast consumption is about food. I recently became extremely obsessed with tonic water after listening to a Gastropod episode on it. I was fascinated by this ingredient in classic tonic waters known as quinine, traditionally derived from cinchona bark. Even Canada Dry’s tonic water still contains quinine as advertised on its cans and bottles. Over the past month, I’ve been sipping through overpriced bottles of Fever-Tree (other than bulk in Costco, I’ve discovered that it seems to be cheapest at my neighbourhood Metro), as well as various bottles of chinotto (like Lurisia’s, which has become my absolute favourite) and Italian red bitter tonic waters (like Portofino). I’m now a tonic water socialist. Bad jokes aside though, quinine held a not insignificant role in the unfolding of globalization and its attendant wars. Amy Stewart introduces the cinchona tree like this:“No tree has had a more important role in the history of cocktails than this South American species. The quinine extracted from cinchona bark doesn’t just flavor tonics, bitters, aromatized wines, and other spirits. It also saved the world from malaria and put botanists and plant hunters at the center of several global wars.”For more insight into one of these wars, an excerpt on WW2 cinchona plantations from Daniel Immerwahr’s “How to Hide and Empire” might be helpful:“Malaria was especially nettlesome because the customary remedies were no longer available. More than 95 percent of the supply of quinine, the most effective antimalarial, had come from the cinchona plantations of the Dutch East Indies—now in Japanese hands. And the insecticide used to fumigate the Panama Canal Zone, pyrethrum, had come principally from Japan. Dozens of university laboratories screened more than fourteen thousand compounds in search of a synthetic antimalarial. Prisoners and conscientious objectors were brought in as guinea pigs. Two compounds worked well: atabrine and chloroquine. Atabrine turned the skin an alarming shade of yellow and disturbed the gastrointestinal tract, but it brought down malaria rates considerably. Chloroquine, which debuted at the end of the war, worked even better. Together, the synthetic drugs not only replaced quinine, they surpassed it.”I thought it was interesting that chloroquine was part of this quest to find a synthetic alternative to quinine — chloroquine being the chemical that has recently been floating about media talkingheads due to Trump’s dangerous remarks about chloroquine related to COVID-19. I also find it fascinating that among the guinea pigs that chemicals like chloroquine were tested on were conscientious objectors. War is and has always been deeply entangled with disease. Many victims of imperialist wars were not killed by direct acts of violence but by way of microbial pathogens (if not experimental drugs in the case of conscientious objectors). I think it’s important to note how the mass movement of humans across large distances is central to the spread of fatal diseases, and how wars are so often the engine behind such movement. Immerwahr on Spanish and American colonial interventions in the Philippines:“Doubtless, the guns and torches did kill tens of thousands. But the full story of Philippine mortality is considerably more complicated. As was often the case in the nineteenth century, most victims of the war died from disease… the diseases started under Spanish rule. The late nineteenth century had brought tumult to the Philippines, moving people around the archipelago and disrupting long-standing economic arrangements. Both motion and instability carried lethal epidemiological consequences, most notably during the cholera epidemic in 1882–83, which killed hundreds of thousands, and the rinderpest outbreak in 1887, wiping out nine in ten cattle and carabao… When the war with the United States came, those horsemen charged forth, now all at once and galloping: cholera, malaria, dysentery, beriberi, rinderpest, tuberculosis, smallpox, and bubonic plague.”The military of course knew that disease was a significant threat not only to people already living within their lands of conquest (which they cared little for) but also to their own soldiers deployed in these various far flung regions. This is the story of the American-provoked annexation of Panama (Immerwahr again):“Captain Mahan had suggested opening a canal through the Central American isthmus, which divided the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and Roosevelt agreed. He tried to buy territory from Colombia, without luck. He tried threatening and got no further. Finally, concluding that bargaining with Colombia’s leaders was liking trying to “nail currant jelly to a wall,” Roosevelt threw his support behind rebels, who declared Panama’s independence from Colombia. The newly established republic then leased to the United States a ten-mile-wide strip of land slicing through the middle of the country: the Panama Canal Zone.Still, more territory, more problems—problems of precisely the moving-things-and-people variety. The hot and rainy neck of land throbbed with disease-bearing mosquitoes. Panamanians who had lived with those mosquitoes their whole lives had acquired immunity to yellow fever and resistance to malaria. Outsiders, however, were fresh bait. Of the first batch of U.S. mainlanders to arrive in the Panama Canal Zone, nearly all were immediately laid low by malaria. Later officials came bringing their caskets with them.They weren’t being paranoid. Yellow fever, malaria, chronic diarrhea, dysentery, pneumonia, and bubonic plague tore through the zone. “I shall never forget the train loads of dead men being carted away daily as if they were just so much lumber,” remembered a carpenter… The point here is that, to open a canal, the United States had to exert colonial control. In fact, it transformed the Panama Canal Zone into one of the most intensively governed spots on the planet. Brigades marched forth to cut brush, drain swamps, and put up screens. They fumigated buildings with pyrethrum, an insecticide made from the petals of chrysanthemums—at peak they imported more than 120 tons a month. To combat mosquitoes, which laid eggs in still water, the authorities made war on puddles. They filled or covered any indentation where water might accumulate. They even ordered the holy water in the font of the cathedral changed daily after finding mosquito larvae in it.Altogether, opening the canal took ten years and cost nearly a third of a billion dollars—more if you count the cost of the landslides that perpetually closed the canal in its first years. As usual, records kept on the deaths of nonwhites were shoddy, but we think some fifteen thousand workers, mainly West Indian, died from accident or disease while on the job. And all to tame a strip of land ten miles wide and not even fifty miles long.”Diseases like malaria were of central concern to militaries, and so even by WW2, quinine and the cinchona plantations of Southeast Asia were vital for ensuring the health of soldiers, and that was certainly the case for various colonial militaries preceding WW2 also.This brings me to my next wildly irrelevant tangent. Not too long after wading about the world of tonic water and quinine, I eventually found myself muddling about the world of bitters. And of course there’s no place better to start than Angostura. (Hot tip: No Frills sells Angostura for way cheaper than Loblaws, Metro, or the LCBO). What got me really into Angostura was reading about its history. For one, its produced in Trinidad, home to Bhaskar Sunkara and some guy named C.L.R. James? Fun fact: according to Louise Cripps, the original publication of C.LR. James’ “Modern Politics” had an advertisement for Angostura bitters in it. More fascinating is Angostura’s history before it moved production to Trinidad. Angostura’s recipe was first developed in Venezuela by a German doctor named Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert, who was surgeon general in the revolutionary army of Simon Bolivar. Bolivar is known as the Liberator, whose namesakes include the country of Bolivia and Venezuela’s Bolivarian Revolution at the turn of the 21st century, which brought Chavez to power among the sweeping pink tide of Latin America. Bolivar was actually a rather complicated figure though. In the influential book “Imagined Communities”, Benedict Anderson situates Bolivar in this way (even mentioning the namesake of rapper Tupac Shakur, whose mom as a black revolutionary, was very well versed in world history):“In Peru, memories of the great jacquerie led by Tupac Amarú (1740–1781) were still fresh. In 1791, Toussaint L’Ouverture led an insurrection of black slaves that produced in 1804 the second independent republic in the Western hemisphere – and terrified the great slave-owning planters of Venezuela. When, in 1789, Madrid issued a new, more humane, slave law specifying in detail the rights and duties of masters and slaves, ‘the creoles rejected state intervention on the grounds that slaves were prone to vice and independence [!], and were essential to the economy. In Venezuela – indeed all over the Spanish Caribbean – planters resisted the law and procured its suspension in 1794.’ The Liberator Bolívar himself once opined that a Negro revolt was ‘a thousand times worse than a Spanish invasion… Bolívar came to change his mind about slaves, and his fellow-liberator San Martín decreed in 1821 that ‘in the future the aborigines shall not be called Indians or natives; they are children and citizens of Peru and they shall be known as Peruvians.”That was a slight tangent. Anyway, as for the German Dr. Siegert (Bolivar’s surgeon general), Brad Thomas Parsons, in his book “Bitters” describes the Siegert’s path to Angostura bitters:“Using his medical knowledge, Siegert harvested many of the local herbs, roots, botanicals, and barks (but not, despite the name, the bark of the angostura tree) to create tonics to stimulate the appetite of the troops, aid with digestive distress, and keep the army on its feet. By 1824 he had perfected a proprietary blend of Siegert’s Amargo Aromatico (aromatic bitters). Because it was a trading post on the Orinoco River, the town of Angostura (meaning “the narrows”) saw a brisk maritime activity as ships set sail for locations throughout the Caribbean. Soon Siegert’s bitters were being used by sailors to quell seasickness, and word of his product spread. By 1830 his bitters were available not only in nearby Trinidad but as far away as England. ”The English aspect is important because a cocktail known as Gin Pahit was a simple mix of gin with Angostura bitters, often referred to as pink gin these days. Pahit was the Malay word for ‘bitter’, and this drink was a favourite of Royal Navy officers in colonial Malaya, and mentioned by literary figures such as W. Somerset Maugham and P.G. Wodehouse. It was a common drink in Malayan cocktail bars frequented by colonial administrators, and was served at the Raffles Long Bar up until the 1980s. It has since gone out of fashion. Yet the pink hue of gin pahit is unmistakably the colour of the British Empire plastered onto colonial era maps of the time. And Angostura’s claims to relieve the unsettled stomachs of anti-imperial forces in Venezuela to the the sea-sickness of the British Empire’s Royal Navy marks a curious turn of events. As quinine and its synthetic counterparts were entangled in imperialist wars, so too were those of Angostura bitters, even if the bitters did have their roots in a revolution against empire. The gentian root of Angostura bitters is in fact in the same botanical family as quinine. So too is coffee, one of the beverages that got me into this bougie mess in the first place. Trying to train my palette, so as to better identify tasting notes in coffee, I’ve been working through alcohol and botanically fortified spirits to hone in my palette. Very bougie preoccupation.Anyway, most of this stuff I just wrote about Angostura was not mentioned in the book (the gentian root-quinine-coffee connection being one of a few exceptions). I had actually encountered most of this information before reading the book, but the fascinating story behind Angostura was what compelled me to seek this book out. In fact, there are far more fascinating stories and botanical revelations to be had in Amy Stewart’s book. It is a very fun read. I’ve been acquiring a taste for vermouth because of it, and certainly have been consuming more gin than I should be. Either way, I convinced myself that I eventually just want to move to dry drinks both for the benefit of my brain, liver, and wallet. But I hoped to get a rough outline of spirits and the tastes involved, before being able to experiment more confidently with making soft cocktails for myself. After working a 9-5 for three years, I understand why people become alcoholics. Hopefully I will improve my backyard herb garden this summer (since I’m confined to the house anyway), and get a small bitters collection going, and hopefully save enough to afford myself some nice tonic water, which I can water down with club soda if I really need to. They do tend to be fairly sugary substances. I'm embarrassed this the sort of fluff that I preoccupy myself with these days, lol. Ok, wow, this was a terrible book review. But a fantastic book. Also there’s a Walker Percy cocktail recipe in this book which will totally get you hammered. I feel like I will end up forgetting most of the really cool facts I encountered in this book, considering all the alcohol involved. It will be a challenge to remember star anise and cacao come from evergreen trees, that agave bloom as infrequently as every thirty years, or that vanilla are orchids that need roots exposed to air (not soil) and require the presence of a special fungus and often live on the limbs of trees a hundred feet off the ground, or that whisky is often dyed with soda or spirit caramel the colour chosen often dictated by the length of aging, or how bourbon must contain at least 51% corn spirit and be aged in new charred oak barrels, or how Nixon almost burnt down the White House by trying to show his daughter how Zhou Enlai lit his mao-tai on fire (at least according to Kissinger, if you can trust a war criminal). I will try to remember that cloves are tiny flower buds, and that hops (belonging to the cannabis family) are native to China, and the earliest records of citrus fruits are from China, and that mint is a weedy plant that can basically grow in sidewalk cracks (I will test this claim in my herb garden this summer). Anyway, this is definitely a book I’ll be keeping around for reference."

Within its gorgeous green cover are sections on fermentation/distillation of various plants (from agave to wheat); information on the items that might infuse a spirit; and last, plants that can be used as fresh mixers and garnishes.   It’s part botany, binomial nomenclature and all; part chemistry, which goes a long way to explaining why plants and their distillates taste the way they do; part history, with carefully sifted facts of how this plant traveled from Asia/Africa to Europe to the Americas, or how that product gave rise to several lawsuits, or how the American people were swindled into believing that a chemically bleached and hardened excuse for a cherry was superior to fruit preserved in real maraschino liqueur (spoiler: it’s Prohibition’s fault. Of course it is).   Stewart includes recipes for about a dozen syrups and 4 dozen cocktails - all of them classics, or excellent riffs thereon. She also has sections with advice on how to grow your own plants, if you like, as well as recommended reading for gardeners and mixologists alike. I’d love to say that this book would clear up, say, the various apple beverages or grape-based spirits once and for all, but that will probably take at least one reread. Still, I commend this to the use of anyone who’s ever wondered why spirits are aged in oak barrels, or what potable bitters involve, or which liqueurs are worth getting.

I may not be a big drinker, but I am very curious about the stuff. The Drunken Botanist hits all the right notes for me. It's fascinating historical facts, brewing information, advice (and warnings) on growing the stuff yourself, and recommendations on brands and breweries. Essentially, I should be set for any alcohol-related Trivial Pursuit questions.The sense of humor is dry (or should I say secco?) and livens up the narrative. The book's listing on Amazon contains a short book trailer that sums up the humor quite well. A few times it made me giggle, but more than that it's the sort of book that balances information and amusement in a way that begs to be read out loud to others. Unless you're going to play these people at Trivial Pursuit. Then you may want to hoard the information for yourself.I received an advanced release ebook through NetGalley, though after reading only a short way, I concluded I need to buy a copy for myself and for a family member.

From alcohols to liquors, mixers to garnishes, this book gives you the history of common ingredients to obscure herbs used in a single defunct liquor by monks in the Tyrols. With a particular eye to the botanical history and discovery of each ingredient, along with the subsequent alcoholic uses, readers are even provided with recipes for drinks and ingredients.

WHAT ABOUT the LEMON WEDGE? Wheat beers are often served with a lemon wedge to highlight their natural citrus flavors, but some beer aficionados consider this a sacrilege. They argue that good beer should never require additional flavorings. In certain company, what one does with a lemon wedge and a glass of wheat beer could make or break a friendship. It’s your drink, so do what you want—but proceed with caution.
LOL I am one of those people who is horrified by beer served with lemon or lime or orange wedges, I don't even like to see beer served in a frosty mug, because ice-cold temperature kills the flavor. Yes, I will judge you.Ms Stewart is always a fun and enthusiastic author, and this is a fun book with a lot of fascinating information.Much like a fine whiskey (because no I could not resist that obvious metaphor), this is a book best savored slowly, not gulped. I tried to read just one section each day, but the first day I was so delighted, I read from agave straight through to potato.There is A LOT of information here, broken into three parts (the classics that are fermented, the add-ins that go in during fermentation, and mixers), each part organized alphabetically, with plenty of sidebar notes, and an on-going fascination with critters (bugs-in-booze) that pops up throughout.SOME of the fascinating things that I learned from reading this book:* Agave was originally grown as a food source, not for making a fermented beverage.* The oldest domesticated living organism is a yeast.* Corn was (most likely) grown not as a grain but as a source of sugar from the cornstalk, and was supplanted by sugar cane when that plant was brought to the Americas.* a red Italian liqueur was originally made using red dye from alkermes scale. (As a houseplant enthusiast, I'm familiar with the scale insect! I never knew about the red one.)* During Prohibition, California vineyards sold bricks of dried compressed grapes, along with yeast, and a warning not to soak the mixturein warm water - ""fermentation will occur!""* Vodka was originally made from rye and other plants; potato-based vodka was seen as cheap and inferior.* A drink made from fermented sweet potatoes (mobbie) was very popular in the Caribbean, only replaced by sugar cane rum after a beetle infestation wiped out sweet potatoes in Barbados in the late 1700s.* There are over 110,000 varieties of rice.* Cashew shells contain urushiol.* Some people think jasmine flowers smell like urine.A complete list of every plant discussed: Part 1: Agave | Apple | Barley | Corn | Grapes | Potato | Rice | Rye | Sorghum | Sugarcane | WheatBanana | Cashew Apple | Cassava | Date Palm | Jackfruit | Marula | Monkey Puzzle | Parsnip | Prickly Pear Cactus | Savanna Bamboo | Strawberry Tree | TamarindPart 2: Allspice | Aloe | Angelica | Artichoke | Bay Laurel | Betel Leaf | Bison Grass | Calamus (Sweet Flag) | Caraway | Cardamom | Clove | Coca | Coriander | Cubeb | Damiana | Dittany of Crete | Elecampane | European Centaury | Fenugreek | Galangal | Gentian | Germander | Ginger | Grains of Paradise | Juniper | Lemon Balm | Lemon Verbena | Licorice-Flavored Herbs | Maidenhair Fern | Meadowsweet | Nutmeg and Mace | Orris | Pink Peppercorn | Sarsaparilla | Sassafras | Sundew | Sweet Woodruff | Tobacco | Tonka Bean | Vanilla | WormwoodChamomile | Elderflower | Hops | Jasmine | Opium Poppy | Rose | Saffron | VioletAngostura | Birch | Cascarilla | Chinchona | Cinnamon | Douglas Fir | Eucalyptus | Mastic | Mauby | Myrrh | Pine | Senegal Gum Tree | Spruce | Sugar MapleApricot | Black Currant | Cacao | Fig | Marasca Cherry | Plum | Quandong | Rowan Berry | Sloe Berry | Citrus Almond | Coffee | Hazelnut | Kola Nut | WalnutPart 3: spearmint, lavender, pomegranate, strawberry, & pepperI found Part 1 to be the most interesting. I'm not sure if that's because I'd never heard of a lot of the flavorings mentioned in Part 2, or if it's because there are just SO many different plants listed, with little in depth information.Each chapter is full of details on the specific species domesticated, how it is grown, the plant's history, details on harvesting the goodness within, different fermentation methods, cultural significance, environmental issues, and recipes.For example (and it was difficult for me to choose just one example!), from the first chapter, agave: 
Any number of popular books on tequila and mezcal claim that when the Spanish arrived in Mexico, they needed a stronger drink to fortify themselves against the long and bloody struggle to come and introduced distillation as a way to turn pulque into a higher-proof spirit. In fact, tequila and mezcal are made from entirely different species of agave than pulque. The method for harvesting the plant and making the spirit is completely different, too. It turns out to be very difficult to put pulque in a still and get strong liquor from it. The complex sugar molecules in agave nectar don’t break down readily during fermentation, and heat from distillation causes unpleasant chemical reactions that create nasty flavors like sulfur and burning rubber. Extracting agave sugars for distillation requires a different technique—one that had already been perfected before the Spanish arrived. Archeological evidence—including the aforementioned coprolite analysis carried out by Eric Callen and others—proves that people living in Mexico prior to the Spanish invasion enjoyed a long tradition of roasting the heart of the agave for food. Pottery fragments, early tools, paintings, and actual remnants of digested agave all confirm this beyond a doubt. Roasted agave is a gourmet experience; imagine a richer, meatier version of grilled artichoke hearts. It would have made a fine meal by itself.
If you're wondering if she mentions Dogfish Head brewery, the answer is: yes, of course she does! (in five different sections)I can't emphasize enough how completely fascinating this book is!!!!"

163,1616200464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16402887-charles-shapiro,4,"I have no basis to judget the accuracy of the information. The book combines some history of a specific drink and plant with information on how the plants are used in drinks. As a listener, and not a reader, I found the history more intrequing then the mixing instructions. The book did open a whole new appreciation for the variety of plant life we have, and wonder at how humans have discovered some of the steps needed to prepare these plants for use by us.Beacuse there is so much information that one can not remember or access in the audio format, I bought a hardcover edition. I expect it will take me years to go through the interesting recipes. I expect there will be many ingredients I will not be able to find.The one omission that might be worth adding is the anatomy of the coctail in a general level. Maybe it is obvious, but it seems that some explaination of why it 'works' might be in order. These drinks generally contain the base alcohol, then sweeteners and flavorings. It is the balance that makes the drink, and one could muse on how the human body interprets the base flavors.Usually I opt for unabridged books, but in this case it would be a better 'listen' without as much detail. A companion file with the drinks and the names of all the plants would be another useful addition."

My Mom likes Gin and Tonics (which my Dad makes for her!), and the information about tonic was fascinating!! Some of the recipes looked very inviting! And some I was glad to learn about the non-vegan-ness... some are obvious, some not so. (Be careful about Black Russians!) ;)Just all the info about plants and the process is so interesting. For instance, potatoes are associated with vodka, but they actually make the worse kind! Russian vodka makers say the best is made from rye or wheat. Potatoes only became a common ingredient because they were cheap and abundant! ha! And hops are in the cannabis family... closely related to marijuana! And, like left-handedness in humans, they have a genetic predisposition to vine themselves in a clockwise direction around their trellis. But 90% of all climbing plants twine themselves the other way - counter clockwise!Love these little tidbits!! Highly recommended to gardeners and naturalists and curious people!"

It covers the HISTORIES of alcohols and how all they all can be made, the SCIENCE behind different plants and spices and when they taste best, the WHY they work well in certain cocktails and with certain alcohols over others, and includes FUN stories and trivia.Even with all the recommendations, though, the author still encourages you to explore and create your own cocktails, by giving you all the information needed on how to safely do that and to correctly identify ingredients that we think we know (and sometimes don't). I really enjoyed listening to this book and will now go get a physical copy to have on hand (because I definitely could not retain all that amazeball-ness)!"

I had to go out and locate a physical copy halfway through the audio version, since I feel that I'm going to be referencing this book for years to come. Not only does Stewart explain how various plants are used in alcohol, but along the way she provides recipes, interesting historical vignettes about specific plants, information on the overall mechanics of brewing, distilling, infusing, and garnishing, and provides what is very nearly a taxonomy of alcohol, told to the story of the plants that make them up.No real criticism. This work was interesting, easy to read, useful, and fun. I could not recommend it more highly to anybody with an interest in alcohol that transcends simply getting drunk."

179,1616200464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8995319-jc,5,"An unhealthy proportion of my podcast consumption is about food. I recently became extremely obsessed with tonic water after listening to a Gastropod episode on it. I was fascinated by this ingredient in classic tonic waters known as quinine, traditionally derived from cinchona bark. Even Canada Dry’s tonic water still contains quinine as advertised on its cans and bottles. Over the past month, I’ve been sipping through overpriced bottles of Fever-Tree (other than bulk in Costco, I’ve discovered that it seems to be cheapest at my neighbourhood Metro), as well as various bottles of chinotto (like Lurisia’s, which has become my absolute favourite) and Italian red bitter tonic waters (like Portofino). I’m now a tonic water socialist. Bad jokes aside though, quinine held a not insignificant role in the unfolding of globalization and its attendant wars. Amy Stewart introduces the cinchona tree like this:“No tree has had a more important role in the history of cocktails than this South American species. The quinine extracted from cinchona bark doesn’t just flavor tonics, bitters, aromatized wines, and other spirits. It also saved the world from malaria and put botanists and plant hunters at the center of several global wars.”For more insight into one of these wars, an excerpt on WW2 cinchona plantations from Daniel Immerwahr’s “How to Hide and Empire” might be helpful:“Malaria was especially nettlesome because the customary remedies were no longer available. More than 95 percent of the supply of quinine, the most effective antimalarial, had come from the cinchona plantations of the Dutch East Indies—now in Japanese hands. And the insecticide used to fumigate the Panama Canal Zone, pyrethrum, had come principally from Japan. Dozens of university laboratories screened more than fourteen thousand compounds in search of a synthetic antimalarial. Prisoners and conscientious objectors were brought in as guinea pigs. Two compounds worked well: atabrine and chloroquine. Atabrine turned the skin an alarming shade of yellow and disturbed the gastrointestinal tract, but it brought down malaria rates considerably. Chloroquine, which debuted at the end of the war, worked even better. Together, the synthetic drugs not only replaced quinine, they surpassed it.”I thought it was interesting that chloroquine was part of this quest to find a synthetic alternative to quinine — chloroquine being the chemical that has recently been floating about media talkingheads due to Trump’s dangerous remarks about chloroquine related to COVID-19. I also find it fascinating that among the guinea pigs that chemicals like chloroquine were tested on were conscientious objectors. War is and has always been deeply entangled with disease. Many victims of imperialist wars were not killed by direct acts of violence but by way of microbial pathogens (if not experimental drugs in the case of conscientious objectors). I think it’s important to note how the mass movement of humans across large distances is central to the spread of fatal diseases, and how wars are so often the engine behind such movement. Immerwahr on Spanish and American colonial interventions in the Philippines:“Doubtless, the guns and torches did kill tens of thousands. But the full story of Philippine mortality is considerably more complicated. As was often the case in the nineteenth century, most victims of the war died from disease… the diseases started under Spanish rule. The late nineteenth century had brought tumult to the Philippines, moving people around the archipelago and disrupting long-standing economic arrangements. Both motion and instability carried lethal epidemiological consequences, most notably during the cholera epidemic in 1882–83, which killed hundreds of thousands, and the rinderpest outbreak in 1887, wiping out nine in ten cattle and carabao… When the war with the United States came, those horsemen charged forth, now all at once and galloping: cholera, malaria, dysentery, beriberi, rinderpest, tuberculosis, smallpox, and bubonic plague.”The military of course knew that disease was a significant threat not only to people already living within their lands of conquest (which they cared little for) but also to their own soldiers deployed in these various far flung regions. This is the story of the American-provoked annexation of Panama (Immerwahr again):“Captain Mahan had suggested opening a canal through the Central American isthmus, which divided the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and Roosevelt agreed. He tried to buy territory from Colombia, without luck. He tried threatening and got no further. Finally, concluding that bargaining with Colombia’s leaders was liking trying to “nail currant jelly to a wall,” Roosevelt threw his support behind rebels, who declared Panama’s independence from Colombia. The newly established republic then leased to the United States a ten-mile-wide strip of land slicing through the middle of the country: the Panama Canal Zone.Still, more territory, more problems—problems of precisely the moving-things-and-people variety. The hot and rainy neck of land throbbed with disease-bearing mosquitoes. Panamanians who had lived with those mosquitoes their whole lives had acquired immunity to yellow fever and resistance to malaria. Outsiders, however, were fresh bait. Of the first batch of U.S. mainlanders to arrive in the Panama Canal Zone, nearly all were immediately laid low by malaria. Later officials came bringing their caskets with them.They weren’t being paranoid. Yellow fever, malaria, chronic diarrhea, dysentery, pneumonia, and bubonic plague tore through the zone. “I shall never forget the train loads of dead men being carted away daily as if they were just so much lumber,” remembered a carpenter… The point here is that, to open a canal, the United States had to exert colonial control. In fact, it transformed the Panama Canal Zone into one of the most intensively governed spots on the planet. Brigades marched forth to cut brush, drain swamps, and put up screens. They fumigated buildings with pyrethrum, an insecticide made from the petals of chrysanthemums—at peak they imported more than 120 tons a month. To combat mosquitoes, which laid eggs in still water, the authorities made war on puddles. They filled or covered any indentation where water might accumulate. They even ordered the holy water in the font of the cathedral changed daily after finding mosquito larvae in it.Altogether, opening the canal took ten years and cost nearly a third of a billion dollars—more if you count the cost of the landslides that perpetually closed the canal in its first years. As usual, records kept on the deaths of nonwhites were shoddy, but we think some fifteen thousand workers, mainly West Indian, died from accident or disease while on the job. And all to tame a strip of land ten miles wide and not even fifty miles long.”Diseases like malaria were of central concern to militaries, and so even by WW2, quinine and the cinchona plantations of Southeast Asia were vital for ensuring the health of soldiers, and that was certainly the case for various colonial militaries preceding WW2 also.This brings me to my next wildly irrelevant tangent. Not too long after wading about the world of tonic water and quinine, I eventually found myself muddling about the world of bitters. And of course there’s no place better to start than Angostura. (Hot tip: No Frills sells Angostura for way cheaper than Loblaws, Metro, or the LCBO). What got me really into Angostura was reading about its history. For one, its produced in Trinidad, home to Bhaskar Sunkara and some guy named C.L.R. James? Fun fact: according to Louise Cripps, the original publication of C.LR. James’ “Modern Politics” had an advertisement for Angostura bitters in it. More fascinating is Angostura’s history before it moved production to Trinidad. Angostura’s recipe was first developed in Venezuela by a German doctor named Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert, who was surgeon general in the revolutionary army of Simon Bolivar. Bolivar is known as the Liberator, whose namesakes include the country of Bolivia and Venezuela’s Bolivarian Revolution at the turn of the 21st century, which brought Chavez to power among the sweeping pink tide of Latin America. Bolivar was actually a rather complicated figure though. In the influential book “Imagined Communities”, Benedict Anderson situates Bolivar in this way (even mentioning the namesake of rapper Tupac Shakur, whose mom as a black revolutionary, was very well versed in world history):“In Peru, memories of the great jacquerie led by Tupac Amarú (1740–1781) were still fresh. In 1791, Toussaint L’Ouverture led an insurrection of black slaves that produced in 1804 the second independent republic in the Western hemisphere – and terrified the great slave-owning planters of Venezuela. When, in 1789, Madrid issued a new, more humane, slave law specifying in detail the rights and duties of masters and slaves, ‘the creoles rejected state intervention on the grounds that slaves were prone to vice and independence [!], and were essential to the economy. In Venezuela – indeed all over the Spanish Caribbean – planters resisted the law and procured its suspension in 1794.’ The Liberator Bolívar himself once opined that a Negro revolt was ‘a thousand times worse than a Spanish invasion… Bolívar came to change his mind about slaves, and his fellow-liberator San Martín decreed in 1821 that ‘in the future the aborigines shall not be called Indians or natives; they are children and citizens of Peru and they shall be known as Peruvians.”That was a slight tangent. Anyway, as for the German Dr. Siegert (Bolivar’s surgeon general), Brad Thomas Parsons, in his book “Bitters” describes the Siegert’s path to Angostura bitters:“Using his medical knowledge, Siegert harvested many of the local herbs, roots, botanicals, and barks (but not, despite the name, the bark of the angostura tree) to create tonics to stimulate the appetite of the troops, aid with digestive distress, and keep the army on its feet. By 1824 he had perfected a proprietary blend of Siegert’s Amargo Aromatico (aromatic bitters). Because it was a trading post on the Orinoco River, the town of Angostura (meaning “the narrows”) saw a brisk maritime activity as ships set sail for locations throughout the Caribbean. Soon Siegert’s bitters were being used by sailors to quell seasickness, and word of his product spread. By 1830 his bitters were available not only in nearby Trinidad but as far away as England. ”The English aspect is important because a cocktail known as Gin Pahit was a simple mix of gin with Angostura bitters, often referred to as pink gin these days. Pahit was the Malay word for ‘bitter’, and this drink was a favourite of Royal Navy officers in colonial Malaya, and mentioned by literary figures such as W. Somerset Maugham and P.G. Wodehouse. It was a common drink in Malayan cocktail bars frequented by colonial administrators, and was served at the Raffles Long Bar up until the 1980s. It has since gone out of fashion. Yet the pink hue of gin pahit is unmistakably the colour of the British Empire plastered onto colonial era maps of the time. And Angostura’s claims to relieve the unsettled stomachs of anti-imperial forces in Venezuela to the the sea-sickness of the British Empire’s Royal Navy marks a curious turn of events. As quinine and its synthetic counterparts were entangled in imperialist wars, so too were those of Angostura bitters, even if the bitters did have their roots in a revolution against empire. The gentian root of Angostura bitters is in fact in the same botanical family as quinine. So too is coffee, one of the beverages that got me into this bougie mess in the first place. Trying to train my palette, so as to better identify tasting notes in coffee, I’ve been working through alcohol and botanically fortified spirits to hone in my palette. Very bougie preoccupation.Anyway, most of this stuff I just wrote about Angostura was not mentioned in the book (the gentian root-quinine-coffee connection being one of a few exceptions). I had actually encountered most of this information before reading the book, but the fascinating story behind Angostura was what compelled me to seek this book out. In fact, there are far more fascinating stories and botanical revelations to be had in Amy Stewart’s book. It is a very fun read. I’ve been acquiring a taste for vermouth because of it, and certainly have been consuming more gin than I should be. Either way, I convinced myself that I eventually just want to move to dry drinks both for the benefit of my brain, liver, and wallet. But I hoped to get a rough outline of spirits and the tastes involved, before being able to experiment more confidently with making soft cocktails for myself. After working a 9-5 for three years, I understand why people become alcoholics. Hopefully I will improve my backyard herb garden this summer (since I’m confined to the house anyway), and get a small bitters collection going, and hopefully save enough to afford myself some nice tonic water, which I can water down with club soda if I really need to. They do tend to be fairly sugary substances. I'm embarrassed this the sort of fluff that I preoccupy myself with these days, lol. Ok, wow, this was a terrible book review. But a fantastic book. Also there’s a Walker Percy cocktail recipe in this book which will totally get you hammered. I feel like I will end up forgetting most of the really cool facts I encountered in this book, considering all the alcohol involved. It will be a challenge to remember star anise and cacao come from evergreen trees, that agave bloom as infrequently as every thirty years, or that vanilla are orchids that need roots exposed to air (not soil) and require the presence of a special fungus and often live on the limbs of trees a hundred feet off the ground, or that whisky is often dyed with soda or spirit caramel the colour chosen often dictated by the length of aging, or how bourbon must contain at least 51% corn spirit and be aged in new charred oak barrels, or how Nixon almost burnt down the White House by trying to show his daughter how Zhou Enlai lit his mao-tai on fire (at least according to Kissinger, if you can trust a war criminal). I will try to remember that cloves are tiny flower buds, and that hops (belonging to the cannabis family) are native to China, and the earliest records of citrus fruits are from China, and that mint is a weedy plant that can basically grow in sidewalk cracks (I will test this claim in my herb garden this summer). Anyway, this is definitely a book I’ll be keeping around for reference."

Within its gorgeous green cover are sections on fermentation/distillation of various plants (from agave to wheat); information on the items that might infuse a spirit; and last, plants that can be used as fresh mixers and garnishes.   It’s part botany, binomial nomenclature and all; part chemistry, which goes a long way to explaining why plants and their distillates taste the way they do; part history, with carefully sifted facts of how this plant traveled from Asia/Africa to Europe to the Americas, or how that product gave rise to several lawsuits, or how the American people were swindled into believing that a chemically bleached and hardened excuse for a cherry was superior to fruit preserved in real maraschino liqueur (spoiler: it’s Prohibition’s fault. Of course it is).   Stewart includes recipes for about a dozen syrups and 4 dozen cocktails - all of them classics, or excellent riffs thereon. She also has sections with advice on how to grow your own plants, if you like, as well as recommended reading for gardeners and mixologists alike. I’d love to say that this book would clear up, say, the various apple beverages or grape-based spirits once and for all, but that will probably take at least one reread. Still, I commend this to the use of anyone who’s ever wondered why spirits are aged in oak barrels, or what potable bitters involve, or which liqueurs are worth getting. For my own part, I long for a bottle of Clear Creek Distillery’s Douglas fir eau-de-vie."

I may not be a big drinker, but I am very curious about the stuff. The Drunken Botanist hits all the right notes for me. It's fascinating historical facts, brewing information, advice (and warnings) on growing the stuff yourself, and recommendations on brands and breweries. Essentially, I should be set for any alcohol-related Trivial Pursuit questions.The sense of humor is dry (or should I say secco?) and livens up the narrative. The book's listing on Amazon contains a short book trailer that sums up the humor quite well. A few times it made me giggle, but more than that it's the sort of book that balances information and amusement in a way that begs to be read out loud to others. Unless you're going to play these people at Trivial Pursuit. Then you may want to hoard the information for yourself.I received an advanced release ebook through NetGalley, though after reading only a short way, I concluded I need to buy a copy for myself and for a family member. I have also been eyeing Stewart's other books for a while, and now I definitely want to seek them out for my reference shelf."

The hardcover edition is designed like a textbook: educational, but constantly interrupting itself with colorful asides. The e-book version suffers from the overall design because of its inherent linearity whereas physical books make flipping back and forth much easily.THE DRUNKEN BOTANIST covers anything and everything booze related. Stewart delves deep into the science behind the plants, process, and presentation of common alcoholic ingredients. From historical facts to cocktail recipes, the intrepid boozehound is bond to find something new to learn about their favorite drinks. It takes talent to combine humor and factual data without swinging too hard into either extreme, but Stewart manages the feat with gusto.Make no mistake: it's a reference book through and through. While beginner friendly, it's better suited on a bartender's bookshelf. Only buy if you plan on mixing drinks in the near future or want to buy the best brands of your particular poison. "

This book must have been written with me in mind. A co-worker who is a cocktail nut lent it to me, and I couldn’t put it down. From alcohols to liquors, mixers to garnishes, this book gives you the history of common ingredients to obscure herbs used in a single defunct liquor by monks in the Tyrols. With a particular eye to the botanical history and discovery of each ingredient, along with the subsequent alcoholic uses, readers are even provided with recipes for drinks and ingredients. The ending seems a little rushed, and there are occasional repetitions, but overall this is a fresh, well written reference.In short—great for anyone with an interest in gardening, drinking, or both."

WHAT ABOUT the LEMON WEDGE? Wheat beers are often served with a lemon wedge to highlight their natural citrus flavors, but some beer aficionados consider this a sacrilege. They argue that good beer should never require additional flavorings. In certain company, what one does with a lemon wedge and a glass of wheat beer could make or break a friendship. It’s your drink, so do what you want—but proceed with caution.
LOL I am one of those people who is horrified by beer served with lemon or lime or orange wedges, I don't even like to see beer served in a frosty mug, because ice-cold temperature kills the flavor. Yes, I will judge you.Ms Stewart is always a fun and enthusiastic author, and this is a fun book with a lot of fascinating information.Much like a fine whiskey (because no I could not resist that obvious metaphor), this is a book best savored slowly, not gulped. I tried to read just one section each day, but the first day I was so delighted, I read from agave straight through to potato.There is A LOT of information here, broken into three parts (the classics that are fermented, the add-ins that go in during fermentation, and mixers), each part organized alphabetically, with plenty of sidebar notes, and an on-going fascination with critters (bugs-in-booze) that pops up throughout.SOME of the fascinating things that I learned from reading this book:* Agave was originally grown as a food source, not for making a fermented beverage.* The oldest domesticated living organism is a yeast.* Corn was (most likely) grown not as a grain but as a source of sugar from the cornstalk, and was supplanted by sugar cane when that plant was brought to the Americas.* a red Italian liqueur was originally made using red dye from alkermes scale. (As a houseplant enthusiast, I'm familiar with the scale insect! I never knew about the red one.)* During Prohibition, California vineyards sold bricks of dried compressed grapes, along with yeast, and a warning not to soak the mixturein warm water - ""fermentation will occur!""* Vodka was originally made from rye and other plants; potato-based vodka was seen as cheap and inferior.* A drink made from fermented sweet potatoes (mobbie) was very popular in the Caribbean, only replaced by sugar cane rum after a beetle infestation wiped out sweet potatoes in Barbados in the late 1700s.* There are over 110,000 varieties of rice.* Cashew shells contain urushiol.* Some people think jasmine flowers smell like urine.A complete list of every plant discussed: Part 1: Agave | Apple | Barley | Corn | Grapes | Potato | Rice | Rye | Sorghum | Sugarcane | WheatBanana | Cashew Apple | Cassava | Date Palm | Jackfruit | Marula | Monkey Puzzle | Parsnip | Prickly Pear Cactus | Savanna Bamboo | Strawberry Tree | TamarindPart 2: Allspice | Aloe | Angelica | Artichoke | Bay Laurel | Betel Leaf | Bison Grass | Calamus (Sweet Flag) | Caraway | Cardamom | Clove | Coca | Coriander | Cubeb | Damiana | Dittany of Crete | Elecampane | European Centaury | Fenugreek | Galangal | Gentian | Germander | Ginger | Grains of Paradise | Juniper | Lemon Balm | Lemon Verbena | Licorice-Flavored Herbs | Maidenhair Fern | Meadowsweet | Nutmeg and Mace | Orris | Pink Peppercorn | Sarsaparilla | Sassafras | Sundew | Sweet Woodruff | Tobacco | Tonka Bean | Vanilla | WormwoodChamomile | Elderflower | Hops | Jasmine | Opium Poppy | Rose | Saffron | VioletAngostura | Birch | Cascarilla | Chinchona | Cinnamon | Douglas Fir | Eucalyptus | Mastic | Mauby | Myrrh | Pine | Senegal Gum Tree | Spruce | Sugar MapleApricot | Black Currant | Cacao | Fig | Marasca Cherry | Plum | Quandong | Rowan Berry | Sloe Berry | Citrus Almond | Coffee | Hazelnut | Kola Nut | WalnutPart 3: spearmint, lavender, pomegranate, strawberry, & pepperI found Part 1 to be the most interesting. I'm not sure if that's because I'd never heard of a lot of the flavorings mentioned in Part 2, or if it's because there are just SO many different plants listed, with little in depth information.Each chapter is full of details on the specific species domesticated, how it is grown, the plant's history, details on harvesting the goodness within, different fermentation methods, cultural significance, environmental issues, and recipes.For example (and it was difficult for me to choose just one example!), from the first chapter, agave: 
Any number of popular books on tequila and mezcal claim that when the Spanish arrived in Mexico, they needed a stronger drink to fortify themselves against the long and bloody struggle to come and introduced distillation as a way to turn pulque into a higher-proof spirit. In fact, tequila and mezcal are made from entirely different species of agave than pulque. The method for harvesting the plant and making the spirit is completely different, too. It turns out to be very difficult to put pulque in a still and get strong liquor from it. The complex sugar molecules in agave nectar don’t break down readily during fermentation, and heat from distillation causes unpleasant chemical reactions that create nasty flavors like sulfur and burning rubber. Extracting agave sugars for distillation requires a different technique—one that had already been perfected before the Spanish arrived. Archeological evidence—including the aforementioned coprolite analysis carried out by Eric Callen and others—proves that people living in Mexico prior to the Spanish invasion enjoyed a long tradition of roasting the heart of the agave for food. Pottery fragments, early tools, paintings, and actual remnants of digested agave all confirm this beyond a doubt. Roasted agave is a gourmet experience; imagine a richer, meatier version of grilled artichoke hearts. It would have made a fine meal by itself.
If you're wondering if she mentions Dogfish Head brewery, the answer is: yes, of course she does! (in five different sections)I can't emphasize enough how completely fascinating this book is!!!!"

I also appreciated the fact that Stewart wrote the book to be understood by the non-botanist layperson (e.g., me), and will look into reading more of her work.Edited to add: Stewart's love of the plants and the drinks comes through in the writing, which is also a definite plus."

193,1616200464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16402887-charles-shapiro,4,"I have no basis to judget the accuracy of the information. The book combines some history of a specific drink and plant with information on how the plants are used in drinks. As a listener, and not a reader, I found the history more intrequing then the mixing instructions. The book did open a whole new appreciation for the variety of plant life we have, and wonder at how humans have discovered some of the steps needed to prepare these plants for use by us.Beacuse there is so much information that one can not remember or access in the audio format, I bought a hardcover edition. I expect it will take me years to go through the interesting recipes. I expect there will be many ingredients I will not be able to find.The one omission that might be worth adding is the anatomy of the coctail in a general level. Maybe it is obvious, but it seems that some explaination of why it 'works' might be in order. These drinks generally contain the base alcohol, then sweeteners and flavorings. It is the balance that makes the drink, and one could muse on how the human body interprets the base flavors.Usually I opt for unabridged books, but in this case it would be a better 'listen' without as much detail. A companion file with the drinks and the names of all the plants would be another useful addition."

My Mom likes Gin and Tonics (which my Dad makes for her!), and the information about tonic was fascinating!! Some of the recipes looked very inviting! And some I was glad to learn about the non-vegan-ness... some are obvious, some not so. (Be careful about Black Russians!) ;)Just all the info about plants and the process is so interesting. For instance, potatoes are associated with vodka, but they actually make the worse kind! Russian vodka makers say the best is made from rye or wheat. Potatoes only became a common ingredient because they were cheap and abundant! ha! And hops are in the cannabis family... closely related to marijuana! And, like left-handedness in humans, they have a genetic predisposition to vine themselves in a clockwise direction around their trellis. But 90% of all climbing plants twine themselves the other way - counter clockwise!Love these little tidbits!! Highly recommended to gardeners and naturalists and curious people!"

It covers the HISTORIES of alcohols and how all they all can be made, the SCIENCE behind different plants and spices and when they taste best, the WHY they work well in certain cocktails and with certain alcohols over others, and includes FUN stories and trivia.Even with all the recommendations, though, the author still encourages you to explore and create your own cocktails, by giving you all the information needed on how to safely do that and to correctly identify ingredients that we think we know (and sometimes don't).

I had to go out and locate a physical copy halfway through the audio version, since I feel that I'm going to be referencing this book for years to come. Not only does Stewart explain how various plants are used in alcohol, but along the way she provides recipes, interesting historical vignettes about specific plants, information on the overall mechanics of brewing, distilling, infusing, and garnishing, and provides what is very nearly a taxonomy of alcohol, told to the story of the plants that make them up.No real criticism.

209,1616200464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8995319-jc,5,"An unhealthy proportion of my podcast consumption is about food. I recently became extremely obsessed with tonic water after listening to a Gastropod episode on it. I was fascinated by this ingredient in classic tonic waters known as quinine, traditionally derived from cinchona bark. Even Canada Dry’s tonic water still contains quinine as advertised on its cans and bottles. Over the past month, I’ve been sipping through overpriced bottles of Fever-Tree (other than bulk in Costco, I’ve discovered that it seems to be cheapest at my neighbourhood Metro), as well as various bottles of chinotto (like Lurisia’s, which has become my absolute favourite) and Italian red bitter tonic waters (like Portofino). I’m now a tonic water socialist. Bad jokes aside though, quinine held a not insignificant role in the unfolding of globalization and its attendant wars. Amy Stewart introduces the cinchona tree like this:“No tree has had a more important role in the history of cocktails than this South American species. The quinine extracted from cinchona bark doesn’t just flavor tonics, bitters, aromatized wines, and other spirits. It also saved the world from malaria and put botanists and plant hunters at the center of several global wars.”For more insight into one of these wars, an excerpt on WW2 cinchona plantations from Daniel Immerwahr’s “How to Hide and Empire” might be helpful:“Malaria was especially nettlesome because the customary remedies were no longer available. More than 95 percent of the supply of quinine, the most effective antimalarial, had come from the cinchona plantations of the Dutch East Indies—now in Japanese hands. And the insecticide used to fumigate the Panama Canal Zone, pyrethrum, had come principally from Japan. Dozens of university laboratories screened more than fourteen thousand compounds in search of a synthetic antimalarial. Prisoners and conscientious objectors were brought in as guinea pigs. Two compounds worked well: atabrine and chloroquine. Atabrine turned the skin an alarming shade of yellow and disturbed the gastrointestinal tract, but it brought down malaria rates considerably. Chloroquine, which debuted at the end of the war, worked even better. Together, the synthetic drugs not only replaced quinine, they surpassed it.”I thought it was interesting that chloroquine was part of this quest to find a synthetic alternative to quinine — chloroquine being the chemical that has recently been floating about media talkingheads due to Trump’s dangerous remarks about chloroquine related to COVID-19. I also find it fascinating that among the guinea pigs that chemicals like chloroquine were tested on were conscientious objectors. War is and has always been deeply entangled with disease. Many victims of imperialist wars were not killed by direct acts of violence but by way of microbial pathogens (if not experimental drugs in the case of conscientious objectors). I think it’s important to note how the mass movement of humans across large distances is central to the spread of fatal diseases, and how wars are so often the engine behind such movement. Immerwahr on Spanish and American colonial interventions in the Philippines:“Doubtless, the guns and torches did kill tens of thousands. But the full story of Philippine mortality is considerably more complicated. As was often the case in the nineteenth century, most victims of the war died from disease… the diseases started under Spanish rule. The late nineteenth century had brought tumult to the Philippines, moving people around the archipelago and disrupting long-standing economic arrangements. Both motion and instability carried lethal epidemiological consequences, most notably during the cholera epidemic in 1882–83, which killed hundreds of thousands, and the rinderpest outbreak in 1887, wiping out nine in ten cattle and carabao… When the war with the United States came, those horsemen charged forth, now all at once and galloping: cholera, malaria, dysentery, beriberi, rinderpest, tuberculosis, smallpox, and bubonic plague.”The military of course knew that disease was a significant threat not only to people already living within their lands of conquest (which they cared little for) but also to their own soldiers deployed in these various far flung regions. This is the story of the American-provoked annexation of Panama (Immerwahr again):“Captain Mahan had suggested opening a canal through the Central American isthmus, which divided the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and Roosevelt agreed. He tried to buy territory from Colombia, without luck. He tried threatening and got no further. Finally, concluding that bargaining with Colombia’s leaders was liking trying to “nail currant jelly to a wall,” Roosevelt threw his support behind rebels, who declared Panama’s independence from Colombia. The newly established republic then leased to the United States a ten-mile-wide strip of land slicing through the middle of the country: the Panama Canal Zone.Still, more territory, more problems—problems of precisely the moving-things-and-people variety. The hot and rainy neck of land throbbed with disease-bearing mosquitoes. Panamanians who had lived with those mosquitoes their whole lives had acquired immunity to yellow fever and resistance to malaria. Outsiders, however, were fresh bait. Of the first batch of U.S. mainlanders to arrive in the Panama Canal Zone, nearly all were immediately laid low by malaria. Later officials came bringing their caskets with them.They weren’t being paranoid. Yellow fever, malaria, chronic diarrhea, dysentery, pneumonia, and bubonic plague tore through the zone. “I shall never forget the train loads of dead men being carted away daily as if they were just so much lumber,” remembered a carpenter… The point here is that, to open a canal, the United States had to exert colonial control. In fact, it transformed the Panama Canal Zone into one of the most intensively governed spots on the planet. Brigades marched forth to cut brush, drain swamps, and put up screens. They fumigated buildings with pyrethrum, an insecticide made from the petals of chrysanthemums—at peak they imported more than 120 tons a month. To combat mosquitoes, which laid eggs in still water, the authorities made war on puddles. They filled or covered any indentation where water might accumulate. They even ordered the holy water in the font of the cathedral changed daily after finding mosquito larvae in it.Altogether, opening the canal took ten years and cost nearly a third of a billion dollars—more if you count the cost of the landslides that perpetually closed the canal in its first years. As usual, records kept on the deaths of nonwhites were shoddy, but we think some fifteen thousand workers, mainly West Indian, died from accident or disease while on the job. And all to tame a strip of land ten miles wide and not even fifty miles long.”Diseases like malaria were of central concern to militaries, and so even by WW2, quinine and the cinchona plantations of Southeast Asia were vital for ensuring the health of soldiers, and that was certainly the case for various colonial militaries preceding WW2 also.This brings me to my next wildly irrelevant tangent. Not too long after wading about the world of tonic water and quinine, I eventually found myself muddling about the world of bitters. And of course there’s no place better to start than Angostura. (Hot tip: No Frills sells Angostura for way cheaper than Loblaws, Metro, or the LCBO). What got me really into Angostura was reading about its history. For one, its produced in Trinidad, home to Bhaskar Sunkara and some guy named C.L.R. James? Fun fact: according to Louise Cripps, the original publication of C.LR. James’ “Modern Politics” had an advertisement for Angostura bitters in it. More fascinating is Angostura’s history before it moved production to Trinidad. Angostura’s recipe was first developed in Venezuela by a German doctor named Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert, who was surgeon general in the revolutionary army of Simon Bolivar. Bolivar is known as the Liberator, whose namesakes include the country of Bolivia and Venezuela’s Bolivarian Revolution at the turn of the 21st century, which brought Chavez to power among the sweeping pink tide of Latin America. Bolivar was actually a rather complicated figure though. In the influential book “Imagined Communities”, Benedict Anderson situates Bolivar in this way (even mentioning the namesake of rapper Tupac Shakur, whose mom as a black revolutionary, was very well versed in world history):“In Peru, memories of the great jacquerie led by Tupac Amarú (1740–1781) were still fresh. In 1791, Toussaint L’Ouverture led an insurrection of black slaves that produced in 1804 the second independent republic in the Western hemisphere – and terrified the great slave-owning planters of Venezuela. When, in 1789, Madrid issued a new, more humane, slave law specifying in detail the rights and duties of masters and slaves, ‘the creoles rejected state intervention on the grounds that slaves were prone to vice and independence [!], and were essential to the economy. In Venezuela – indeed all over the Spanish Caribbean – planters resisted the law and procured its suspension in 1794.’ The Liberator Bolívar himself once opined that a Negro revolt was ‘a thousand times worse than a Spanish invasion… Bolívar came to change his mind about slaves, and his fellow-liberator San Martín decreed in 1821 that ‘in the future the aborigines shall not be called Indians or natives; they are children and citizens of Peru and they shall be known as Peruvians.”That was a slight tangent. Anyway, as for the German Dr. Siegert (Bolivar’s surgeon general), Brad Thomas Parsons, in his book “Bitters” describes the Siegert’s path to Angostura bitters:“Using his medical knowledge, Siegert harvested many of the local herbs, roots, botanicals, and barks (but not, despite the name, the bark of the angostura tree) to create tonics to stimulate the appetite of the troops, aid with digestive distress, and keep the army on its feet. By 1824 he had perfected a proprietary blend of Siegert’s Amargo Aromatico (aromatic bitters). Because it was a trading post on the Orinoco River, the town of Angostura (meaning “the narrows”) saw a brisk maritime activity as ships set sail for locations throughout the Caribbean. Soon Siegert’s bitters were being used by sailors to quell seasickness, and word of his product spread. By 1830 his bitters were available not only in nearby Trinidad but as far away as England. ”The English aspect is important because a cocktail known as Gin Pahit was a simple mix of gin with Angostura bitters, often referred to as pink gin these days. Pahit was the Malay word for ‘bitter’, and this drink was a favourite of Royal Navy officers in colonial Malaya, and mentioned by literary figures such as W. Somerset Maugham and P.G. Wodehouse. It was a common drink in Malayan cocktail bars frequented by colonial administrators, and was served at the Raffles Long Bar up until the 1980s. It has since gone out of fashion. Yet the pink hue of gin pahit is unmistakably the colour of the British Empire plastered onto colonial era maps of the time. And Angostura’s claims to relieve the unsettled stomachs of anti-imperial forces in Venezuela to the the sea-sickness of the British Empire’s Royal Navy marks a curious turn of events. As quinine and its synthetic counterparts were entangled in imperialist wars, so too were those of Angostura bitters, even if the bitters did have their roots in a revolution against empire. The gentian root of Angostura bitters is in fact in the same botanical family as quinine. So too is coffee, one of the beverages that got me into this bougie mess in the first place. Trying to train my palette, so as to better identify tasting notes in coffee, I’ve been working through alcohol and botanically fortified spirits to hone in my palette. Very bougie preoccupation.Anyway, most of this stuff I just wrote about Angostura was not mentioned in the book (the gentian root-quinine-coffee connection being one of a few exceptions). I had actually encountered most of this information before reading the book, but the fascinating story behind Angostura was what compelled me to seek this book out. In fact, there are far more fascinating stories and botanical revelations to be had in Amy Stewart’s book. It is a very fun read. I’ve been acquiring a taste for vermouth because of it, and certainly have been consuming more gin than I should be. Either way, I convinced myself that I eventually just want to move to dry drinks both for the benefit of my brain, liver, and wallet. But I hoped to get a rough outline of spirits and the tastes involved, before being able to experiment more confidently with making soft cocktails for myself. After working a 9-5 for three years, I understand why people become alcoholics. Hopefully I will improve my backyard herb garden this summer (since I’m confined to the house anyway), and get a small bitters collection going, and hopefully save enough to afford myself some nice tonic water, which I can water down with club soda if I really need to. They do tend to be fairly sugary substances. I'm embarrassed this the sort of fluff that I preoccupy myself with these days, lol. Ok, wow, this was a terrible book review. But a fantastic book. Also there’s a Walker Percy cocktail recipe in this book which will totally get you hammered. I feel like I will end up forgetting most of the really cool facts I encountered in this book, considering all the alcohol involved. It will be a challenge to remember star anise and cacao come from evergreen trees, that agave bloom as infrequently as every thirty years, or that vanilla are orchids that need roots exposed to air (not soil) and require the presence of a special fungus and often live on the limbs of trees a hundred feet off the ground, or that whisky is often dyed with soda or spirit caramel the colour chosen often dictated by the length of aging, or how bourbon must contain at least 51% corn spirit and be aged in new charred oak barrels, or how Nixon almost burnt down the White House by trying to show his daughter how Zhou Enlai lit his mao-tai on fire (at least according to Kissinger, if you can trust a war criminal). I will try to remember that cloves are tiny flower buds, and that hops (belonging to the cannabis family) are native to China, and the earliest records of citrus fruits are from China, and that mint is a weedy plant that can basically grow in sidewalk cracks (I will test this claim in my herb garden this summer). Anyway, this is definitely a book I’ll be keeping around for reference."

Within its gorgeous green cover are sections on fermentation/distillation of various plants (from agave to wheat); information on the items that might infuse a spirit; and last, plants that can be used as fresh mixers and garnishes.   It’s part botany, binomial nomenclature and all; part chemistry, which goes a long way to explaining why plants and their distillates taste the way they do; part history, with carefully sifted facts of how this plant traveled from Asia/Africa to Europe to the Americas, or how that product gave rise to several lawsuits, or how the American people were swindled into believing that a chemically bleached and hardened excuse for a cherry was superior to fruit preserved in real maraschino liqueur (spoiler: it’s Prohibition’s fault. Of course it is).   Stewart includes recipes for about a dozen syrups and 4 dozen cocktails - all of them classics, or excellent riffs thereon. She also has sections with advice on how to grow your own plants, if you like, as well as recommended reading for gardeners and mixologists alike. I’d love to say that this book would clear up, say, the various apple beverages or grape-based spirits once and for all, but that will probably take at least one reread. Still, I commend this to the use of anyone who’s ever wondered why spirits are aged in oak barrels, or what potable bitters involve, or which liqueurs are worth getting. For my own part, I long for a bottle of Clear Creek Distillery’s Douglas fir eau-de-vie."

I may not be a big drinker, but I am very curious about the stuff. The Drunken Botanist hits all the right notes for me. It's fascinating historical facts, brewing information, advice (and warnings) on growing the stuff yourself, and recommendations on brands and breweries. Essentially, I should be set for any alcohol-related Trivial Pursuit questions.The sense of humor is dry (or should I say secco?) and livens up the narrative. The book's listing on Amazon contains a short book trailer that sums up the humor quite well. A few times it made me giggle, but more than that it's the sort of book that balances information and amusement in a way that begs to be read out loud to others. Unless you're going to play these people at Trivial Pursuit. Then you may want to hoard the information for yourself.I received an advanced release ebook through NetGalley, though after reading only a short way, I concluded I need to buy a copy for myself and for a family member.

The hardcover edition is designed like a textbook: educational, but constantly interrupting itself with colorful asides. The e-book version suffers from the overall design because of its inherent linearity whereas physical books make flipping back and forth much easily.THE DRUNKEN BOTANIST covers anything and everything booze related. Stewart delves deep into the science behind the plants, process, and presentation of common alcoholic ingredients. From historical facts to cocktail recipes, the intrepid boozehound is bond to find something new to learn about their favorite drinks. It takes talent to combine humor and factual data without swinging too hard into either extreme, but Stewart manages the feat with gusto.Make no mistake: it's a reference book through and through. While beginner friendly, it's better suited on a bartender's bookshelf. Only buy if you plan on mixing drinks in the near future or want to buy the best brands of your particular poison. "

This book must have been written with me in mind. A co-worker who is a cocktail nut lent it to me, and I couldn’t put it down. From alcohols to liquors, mixers to garnishes, this book gives you the history of common ingredients to obscure herbs used in a single defunct liquor by monks in the Tyrols. With a particular eye to the botanical history and discovery of each ingredient, along with the subsequent alcoholic uses, readers are even provided with recipes for drinks and ingredients. The ending seems a little rushed, and there are occasional repetitions, but overall this is a fresh, well written reference.In short—great for anyone with an interest in gardening, drinking, or both."

WHAT ABOUT the LEMON WEDGE? Wheat beers are often served with a lemon wedge to highlight their natural citrus flavors, but some beer aficionados consider this a sacrilege. They argue that good beer should never require additional flavorings. In certain company, what one does with a lemon wedge and a glass of wheat beer could make or break a friendship. It’s your drink, so do what you want—but proceed with caution.
LOL I am one of those people who is horrified by beer served with lemon or lime or orange wedges, I don't even like to see beer served in a frosty mug, because ice-cold temperature kills the flavor. Yes, I will judge you.Ms Stewart is always a fun and enthusiastic author, and this is a fun book with a lot of fascinating information.Much like a fine whiskey (because no I could not resist that obvious metaphor), this is a book best savored slowly, not gulped. I tried to read just one section each day, but the first day I was so delighted, I read from agave straight through to potato.There is A LOT of information here, broken into three parts (the classics that are fermented, the add-ins that go in during fermentation, and mixers), each part organized alphabetically, with plenty of sidebar notes, and an on-going fascination with critters (bugs-in-booze) that pops up throughout.SOME of the fascinating things that I learned from reading this book:* Agave was originally grown as a food source, not for making a fermented beverage.* The oldest domesticated living organism is a yeast.* Corn was (most likely) grown not as a grain but as a source of sugar from the cornstalk, and was supplanted by sugar cane when that plant was brought to the Americas.* a red Italian liqueur was originally made using red dye from alkermes scale. (As a houseplant enthusiast, I'm familiar with the scale insect! I never knew about the red one.)* During Prohibition, California vineyards sold bricks of dried compressed grapes, along with yeast, and a warning not to soak the mixturein warm water - ""fermentation will occur!""* Vodka was originally made from rye and other plants; potato-based vodka was seen as cheap and inferior.* A drink made from fermented sweet potatoes (mobbie) was very popular in the Caribbean, only replaced by sugar cane rum after a beetle infestation wiped out sweet potatoes in Barbados in the late 1700s.* There are over 110,000 varieties of rice.* Cashew shells contain urushiol.* Some people think jasmine flowers smell like urine.A complete list of every plant discussed: Part 1: Agave | Apple | Barley | Corn | Grapes | Potato | Rice | Rye | Sorghum | Sugarcane | WheatBanana | Cashew Apple | Cassava | Date Palm | Jackfruit | Marula | Monkey Puzzle | Parsnip | Prickly Pear Cactus | Savanna Bamboo | Strawberry Tree | TamarindPart 2: Allspice | Aloe | Angelica | Artichoke | Bay Laurel | Betel Leaf | Bison Grass | Calamus (Sweet Flag) | Caraway | Cardamom | Clove | Coca | Coriander | Cubeb | Damiana | Dittany of Crete | Elecampane | European Centaury | Fenugreek | Galangal | Gentian | Germander | Ginger | Grains of Paradise | Juniper | Lemon Balm | Lemon Verbena | Licorice-Flavored Herbs | Maidenhair Fern | Meadowsweet | Nutmeg and Mace | Orris | Pink Peppercorn | Sarsaparilla | Sassafras | Sundew | Sweet Woodruff | Tobacco | Tonka Bean | Vanilla | WormwoodChamomile | Elderflower | Hops | Jasmine | Opium Poppy | Rose | Saffron | VioletAngostura | Birch | Cascarilla | Chinchona | Cinnamon | Douglas Fir | Eucalyptus | Mastic | Mauby | Myrrh | Pine | Senegal Gum Tree | Spruce | Sugar MapleApricot | Black Currant | Cacao | Fig | Marasca Cherry | Plum | Quandong | Rowan Berry | Sloe Berry | Citrus Almond | Coffee | Hazelnut | Kola Nut | WalnutPart 3: spearmint, lavender, pomegranate, strawberry, & pepperI found Part 1 to be the most interesting. I'm not sure if that's because I'd never heard of a lot of the flavorings mentioned in Part 2, or if it's because there are just SO many different plants listed, with little in depth information.Each chapter is full of details on the specific species domesticated, how it is grown, the plant's history, details on harvesting the goodness within, different fermentation methods, cultural significance, environmental issues, and recipes.For example (and it was difficult for me to choose just one example!), from the first chapter, agave: 
Any number of popular books on tequila and mezcal claim that when the Spanish arrived in Mexico, they needed a stronger drink to fortify themselves against the long and bloody struggle to come and introduced distillation as a way to turn pulque into a higher-proof spirit. In fact, tequila and mezcal are made from entirely different species of agave than pulque. The method for harvesting the plant and making the spirit is completely different, too. It turns out to be very difficult to put pulque in a still and get strong liquor from it. The complex sugar molecules in agave nectar don’t break down readily during fermentation, and heat from distillation causes unpleasant chemical reactions that create nasty flavors like sulfur and burning rubber. Extracting agave sugars for distillation requires a different technique—one that had already been perfected before the Spanish arrived. Archeological evidence—including the aforementioned coprolite analysis carried out by Eric Callen and others—proves that people living in Mexico prior to the Spanish invasion enjoyed a long tradition of roasting the heart of the agave for food. Pottery fragments, early tools, paintings, and actual remnants of digested agave all confirm this beyond a doubt. Roasted agave is a gourmet experience; imagine a richer, meatier version of grilled artichoke hearts. It would have made a fine meal by itself.
If you're wondering if she mentions Dogfish Head brewery, the answer is: yes, of course she does! (in five different sections)I can't emphasize enough how completely fascinating this book is!!!!"

The book combines some history of a specific drink and plant with information on how the plants are used in drinks. As a listener, and not a reader, I found the history more intrequing then the mixing instructions. The book did open a whole new appreciation for the variety of plant life we have, and wonder at how humans have discovered some of the steps needed to prepare these plants for use by us.Beacuse there is so much information that one can not remember or access in the audio format, I bought a hardcover edition. I expect it will take me years to go through the interesting recipes. I expect there will be many ingredients I will not be able to find.The one omission that might be worth adding is the anatomy of the coctail in a general level. Maybe it is obvious, but it seems that some explaination of why it 'works' might be in order. These drinks generally contain the base alcohol, then sweeteners and flavorings. It is the balance that makes the drink, and one could muse on how the human body interprets the base flavors.Usually I opt for unabridged books, but in this case it would be a better 'listen' without as much detail. A companion file with the drinks and the names of all the plants would be another useful addition."

For instance, potatoes are associated with vodka, but they actually make the worse kind! Russian vodka makers say the best is made from rye or wheat. Potatoes only became a common ingredient because they were cheap and abundant! ha! And hops are in the cannabis family... closely related to marijuana! And, like left-handedness in humans, they have a genetic predisposition to vine themselves in a clockwise direction around their trellis.

239,1616200464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8995319-jc,5,"An unhealthy proportion of my podcast consumption is about food. I recently became extremely obsessed with tonic water after listening to a Gastropod episode on it. I was fascinated by this ingredient in classic tonic waters known as quinine, traditionally derived from cinchona bark. Even Canada Dry’s tonic water still contains quinine as advertised on its cans and bottles. Over the past month, I’ve been sipping through overpriced bottles of Fever-Tree (other than bulk in Costco, I’ve discovered that it seems to be cheapest at my neighbourhood Metro), as well as various bottles of chinotto (like Lurisia’s, which has become my absolute favourite) and Italian red bitter tonic waters (like Portofino). I’m now a tonic water socialist. Bad jokes aside though, quinine held a not insignificant role in the unfolding of globalization and its attendant wars. Amy Stewart introduces the cinchona tree like this:“No tree has had a more important role in the history of cocktails than this South American species. The quinine extracted from cinchona bark doesn’t just flavor tonics, bitters, aromatized wines, and other spirits. It also saved the world from malaria and put botanists and plant hunters at the center of several global wars.”For more insight into one of these wars, an excerpt on WW2 cinchona plantations from Daniel Immerwahr’s “How to Hide and Empire” might be helpful:“Malaria was especially nettlesome because the customary remedies were no longer available. More than 95 percent of the supply of quinine, the most effective antimalarial, had come from the cinchona plantations of the Dutch East Indies—now in Japanese hands. And the insecticide used to fumigate the Panama Canal Zone, pyrethrum, had come principally from Japan. Dozens of university laboratories screened more than fourteen thousand compounds in search of a synthetic antimalarial. Prisoners and conscientious objectors were brought in as guinea pigs. Two compounds worked well: atabrine and chloroquine. Atabrine turned the skin an alarming shade of yellow and disturbed the gastrointestinal tract, but it brought down malaria rates considerably. Chloroquine, which debuted at the end of the war, worked even better. Together, the synthetic drugs not only replaced quinine, they surpassed it.”I thought it was interesting that chloroquine was part of this quest to find a synthetic alternative to quinine — chloroquine being the chemical that has recently been floating about media talkingheads due to Trump’s dangerous remarks about chloroquine related to COVID-19. I also find it fascinating that among the guinea pigs that chemicals like chloroquine were tested on were conscientious objectors. War is and has always been deeply entangled with disease. Many victims of imperialist wars were not killed by direct acts of violence but by way of microbial pathogens (if not experimental drugs in the case of conscientious objectors). I think it’s important to note how the mass movement of humans across large distances is central to the spread of fatal diseases, and how wars are so often the engine behind such movement. Immerwahr on Spanish and American colonial interventions in the Philippines:“Doubtless, the guns and torches did kill tens of thousands. But the full story of Philippine mortality is considerably more complicated. As was often the case in the nineteenth century, most victims of the war died from disease… the diseases started under Spanish rule. The late nineteenth century had brought tumult to the Philippines, moving people around the archipelago and disrupting long-standing economic arrangements. Both motion and instability carried lethal epidemiological consequences, most notably during the cholera epidemic in 1882–83, which killed hundreds of thousands, and the rinderpest outbreak in 1887, wiping out nine in ten cattle and carabao… When the war with the United States came, those horsemen charged forth, now all at once and galloping: cholera, malaria, dysentery, beriberi, rinderpest, tuberculosis, smallpox, and bubonic plague.”The military of course knew that disease was a significant threat not only to people already living within their lands of conquest (which they cared little for) but also to their own soldiers deployed in these various far flung regions. This is the story of the American-provoked annexation of Panama (Immerwahr again):“Captain Mahan had suggested opening a canal through the Central American isthmus, which divided the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and Roosevelt agreed. He tried to buy territory from Colombia, without luck. He tried threatening and got no further. Finally, concluding that bargaining with Colombia’s leaders was liking trying to “nail currant jelly to a wall,” Roosevelt threw his support behind rebels, who declared Panama’s independence from Colombia. The newly established republic then leased to the United States a ten-mile-wide strip of land slicing through the middle of the country: the Panama Canal Zone.Still, more territory, more problems—problems of precisely the moving-things-and-people variety. The hot and rainy neck of land throbbed with disease-bearing mosquitoes. Panamanians who had lived with those mosquitoes their whole lives had acquired immunity to yellow fever and resistance to malaria. Outsiders, however, were fresh bait. Of the first batch of U.S. mainlanders to arrive in the Panama Canal Zone, nearly all were immediately laid low by malaria. Later officials came bringing their caskets with them.They weren’t being paranoid. Yellow fever, malaria, chronic diarrhea, dysentery, pneumonia, and bubonic plague tore through the zone. “I shall never forget the train loads of dead men being carted away daily as if they were just so much lumber,” remembered a carpenter… The point here is that, to open a canal, the United States had to exert colonial control. In fact, it transformed the Panama Canal Zone into one of the most intensively governed spots on the planet. Brigades marched forth to cut brush, drain swamps, and put up screens. They fumigated buildings with pyrethrum, an insecticide made from the petals of chrysanthemums—at peak they imported more than 120 tons a month. To combat mosquitoes, which laid eggs in still water, the authorities made war on puddles. They filled or covered any indentation where water might accumulate. They even ordered the holy water in the font of the cathedral changed daily after finding mosquito larvae in it.Altogether, opening the canal took ten years and cost nearly a third of a billion dollars—more if you count the cost of the landslides that perpetually closed the canal in its first years. As usual, records kept on the deaths of nonwhites were shoddy, but we think some fifteen thousand workers, mainly West Indian, died from accident or disease while on the job. And all to tame a strip of land ten miles wide and not even fifty miles long.”Diseases like malaria were of central concern to militaries, and so even by WW2, quinine and the cinchona plantations of Southeast Asia were vital for ensuring the health of soldiers, and that was certainly the case for various colonial militaries preceding WW2 also.This brings me to my next wildly irrelevant tangent. Not too long after wading about the world of tonic water and quinine, I eventually found myself muddling about the world of bitters. And of course there’s no place better to start than Angostura. (Hot tip: No Frills sells Angostura for way cheaper than Loblaws, Metro, or the LCBO). What got me really into Angostura was reading about its history. For one, its produced in Trinidad, home to Bhaskar Sunkara and some guy named C.L.R. James? Fun fact: according to Louise Cripps, the original publication of C.LR. James’ “Modern Politics” had an advertisement for Angostura bitters in it. More fascinating is Angostura’s history before it moved production to Trinidad. Angostura’s recipe was first developed in Venezuela by a German doctor named Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert, who was surgeon general in the revolutionary army of Simon Bolivar. Bolivar is known as the Liberator, whose namesakes include the country of Bolivia and Venezuela’s Bolivarian Revolution at the turn of the 21st century, which brought Chavez to power among the sweeping pink tide of Latin America. Bolivar was actually a rather complicated figure though. In the influential book “Imagined Communities”, Benedict Anderson situates Bolivar in this way (even mentioning the namesake of rapper Tupac Shakur, whose mom as a black revolutionary, was very well versed in world history):“In Peru, memories of the great jacquerie led by Tupac Amarú (1740–1781) were still fresh. In 1791, Toussaint L’Ouverture led an insurrection of black slaves that produced in 1804 the second independent republic in the Western hemisphere – and terrified the great slave-owning planters of Venezuela. When, in 1789, Madrid issued a new, more humane, slave law specifying in detail the rights and duties of masters and slaves, ‘the creoles rejected state intervention on the grounds that slaves were prone to vice and independence [!], and were essential to the economy. In Venezuela – indeed all over the Spanish Caribbean – planters resisted the law and procured its suspension in 1794.’ The Liberator Bolívar himself once opined that a Negro revolt was ‘a thousand times worse than a Spanish invasion… Bolívar came to change his mind about slaves, and his fellow-liberator San Martín decreed in 1821 that ‘in the future the aborigines shall not be called Indians or natives; they are children and citizens of Peru and they shall be known as Peruvians.”That was a slight tangent. Anyway, as for the German Dr. Siegert (Bolivar’s surgeon general), Brad Thomas Parsons, in his book “Bitters” describes the Siegert’s path to Angostura bitters:“Using his medical knowledge, Siegert harvested many of the local herbs, roots, botanicals, and barks (but not, despite the name, the bark of the angostura tree) to create tonics to stimulate the appetite of the troops, aid with digestive distress, and keep the army on its feet. By 1824 he had perfected a proprietary blend of Siegert’s Amargo Aromatico (aromatic bitters). Because it was a trading post on the Orinoco River, the town of Angostura (meaning “the narrows”) saw a brisk maritime activity as ships set sail for locations throughout the Caribbean. Soon Siegert’s bitters were being used by sailors to quell seasickness, and word of his product spread. By 1830 his bitters were available not only in nearby Trinidad but as far away as England. ”The English aspect is important because a cocktail known as Gin Pahit was a simple mix of gin with Angostura bitters, often referred to as pink gin these days. Pahit was the Malay word for ‘bitter’, and this drink was a favourite of Royal Navy officers in colonial Malaya, and mentioned by literary figures such as W. Somerset Maugham and P.G. Wodehouse. It was a common drink in Malayan cocktail bars frequented by colonial administrators, and was served at the Raffles Long Bar up until the 1980s. It has since gone out of fashion. Yet the pink hue of gin pahit is unmistakably the colour of the British Empire plastered onto colonial era maps of the time. And Angostura’s claims to relieve the unsettled stomachs of anti-imperial forces in Venezuela to the the sea-sickness of the British Empire’s Royal Navy marks a curious turn of events. As quinine and its synthetic counterparts were entangled in imperialist wars, so too were those of Angostura bitters, even if the bitters did have their roots in a revolution against empire. The gentian root of Angostura bitters is in fact in the same botanical family as quinine. So too is coffee, one of the beverages that got me into this bougie mess in the first place. Trying to train my palette, so as to better identify tasting notes in coffee, I’ve been working through alcohol and botanically fortified spirits to hone in my palette. Very bougie preoccupation.Anyway, most of this stuff I just wrote about Angostura was not mentioned in the book (the gentian root-quinine-coffee connection being one of a few exceptions). I had actually encountered most of this information before reading the book, but the fascinating story behind Angostura was what compelled me to seek this book out. In fact, there are far more fascinating stories and botanical revelations to be had in Amy Stewart’s book. It is a very fun read. I’ve been acquiring a taste for vermouth because of it, and certainly have been consuming more gin than I should be. Either way, I convinced myself that I eventually just want to move to dry drinks both for the benefit of my brain, liver, and wallet. But I hoped to get a rough outline of spirits and the tastes involved, before being able to experiment more confidently with making soft cocktails for myself. After working a 9-5 for three years, I understand why people become alcoholics. Hopefully I will improve my backyard herb garden this summer (since I’m confined to the house anyway), and get a small bitters collection going, and hopefully save enough to afford myself some nice tonic water, which I can water down with club soda if I really need to. They do tend to be fairly sugary substances. I'm embarrassed this the sort of fluff that I preoccupy myself with these days, lol. Ok, wow, this was a terrible book review. But a fantastic book. Also there’s a Walker Percy cocktail recipe in this book which will totally get you hammered. I feel like I will end up forgetting most of the really cool facts I encountered in this book, considering all the alcohol involved. It will be a challenge to remember star anise and cacao come from evergreen trees, that agave bloom as infrequently as every thirty years, or that vanilla are orchids that need roots exposed to air (not soil) and require the presence of a special fungus and often live on the limbs of trees a hundred feet off the ground, or that whisky is often dyed with soda or spirit caramel the colour chosen often dictated by the length of aging, or how bourbon must contain at least 51% corn spirit and be aged in new charred oak barrels, or how Nixon almost burnt down the White House by trying to show his daughter how Zhou Enlai lit his mao-tai on fire (at least according to Kissinger, if you can trust a war criminal). I will try to remember that cloves are tiny flower buds, and that hops (belonging to the cannabis family) are native to China, and the earliest records of citrus fruits are from China, and that mint is a weedy plant that can basically grow in sidewalk cracks (I will test this claim in my herb garden this summer). Anyway, this is definitely a book I’ll be keeping around for reference."

Within its gorgeous green cover are sections on fermentation/distillation of various plants (from agave to wheat); information on the items that might infuse a spirit; and last, plants that can be used as fresh mixers and garnishes.   It’s part botany, binomial nomenclature and all; part chemistry, which goes a long way to explaining why plants and their distillates taste the way they do; part history, with carefully sifted facts of how this plant traveled from Asia/Africa to Europe to the Americas, or how that product gave rise to several lawsuits, or how the American people were swindled into believing that a chemically bleached and hardened excuse for a cherry was superior to fruit preserved in real maraschino liqueur (spoiler: it’s Prohibition’s fault. Of course it is).   Stewart includes recipes for about a dozen syrups and 4 dozen cocktails - all of them classics, or excellent riffs thereon. She also has sections with advice on how to grow your own plants, if you like, as well as recommended reading for gardeners and mixologists alike. I’d love to say that this book would clear up, say, the various apple beverages or grape-based spirits once and for all, but that will probably take at least one reread. Still, I commend this to the use of anyone who’s ever wondered why spirits are aged in oak barrels, or what potable bitters involve, or which liqueurs are worth getting. For my own part, I long for a bottle of Clear Creek Distillery’s Douglas fir eau-de-vie."

I may not be a big drinker, but I am very curious about the stuff. The Drunken Botanist hits all the right notes for me. It's fascinating historical facts, brewing information, advice (and warnings) on growing the stuff yourself, and recommendations on brands and breweries. Essentially, I should be set for any alcohol-related Trivial Pursuit questions.The sense of humor is dry (or should I say secco?) and livens up the narrative. The book's listing on Amazon contains a short book trailer that sums up the humor quite well. A few times it made me giggle, but more than that it's the sort of book that balances information and amusement in a way that begs to be read out loud to others. Unless you're going to play these people at Trivial Pursuit. Then you may want to hoard the information for yourself.I received an advanced release ebook through NetGalley, though after reading only a short way, I concluded I need to buy a copy for myself and for a family member.

The hardcover edition is designed like a textbook: educational, but constantly interrupting itself with colorful asides. The e-book version suffers from the overall design because of its inherent linearity whereas physical books make flipping back and forth much easily.THE DRUNKEN BOTANIST covers anything and everything booze related. Stewart delves deep into the science behind the plants, process, and presentation of common alcoholic ingredients. From historical facts to cocktail recipes, the intrepid boozehound is bond to find something new to learn about their favorite drinks. It takes talent to combine humor and factual data without swinging too hard into either extreme, but Stewart manages the feat with gusto.Make no mistake: it's a reference book through and through. While beginner friendly, it's better suited on a bartender's bookshelf. Only buy if you plan on mixing drinks in the near future or want to buy the best brands of your particular poison. "

From alcohols to liquors, mixers to garnishes, this book gives you the history of common ingredients to obscure herbs used in a single defunct liquor by monks in the Tyrols. With a particular eye to the botanical history and discovery of each ingredient, along with the subsequent alcoholic uses, readers are even provided with recipes for drinks and ingredients. The ending seems a little rushed, and there are occasional repetitions, but overall this is a fresh, well written reference.In short—great for anyone with an interest in gardening, drinking, or both."

WHAT ABOUT the LEMON WEDGE? Wheat beers are often served with a lemon wedge to highlight their natural citrus flavors, but some beer aficionados consider this a sacrilege. They argue that good beer should never require additional flavorings. In certain company, what one does with a lemon wedge and a glass of wheat beer could make or break a friendship. It’s your drink, so do what you want—but proceed with caution.
LOL I am one of those people who is horrified by beer served with lemon or lime or orange wedges, I don't even like to see beer served in a frosty mug, because ice-cold temperature kills the flavor. Yes, I will judge you.Ms Stewart is always a fun and enthusiastic author, and this is a fun book with a lot of fascinating information.Much like a fine whiskey (because no I could not resist that obvious metaphor), this is a book best savored slowly, not gulped. I tried to read just one section each day, but the first day I was so delighted, I read from agave straight through to potato.There is A LOT of information here, broken into three parts (the classics that are fermented, the add-ins that go in during fermentation, and mixers), each part organized alphabetically, with plenty of sidebar notes, and an on-going fascination with critters (bugs-in-booze) that pops up throughout.SOME of the fascinating things that I learned from reading this book:* Agave was originally grown as a food source, not for making a fermented beverage.* The oldest domesticated living organism is a yeast.* Corn was (most likely) grown not as a grain but as a source of sugar from the cornstalk, and was supplanted by sugar cane when that plant was brought to the Americas.* a red Italian liqueur was originally made using red dye from alkermes scale. (As a houseplant enthusiast, I'm familiar with the scale insect! I never knew about the red one.)* During Prohibition, California vineyards sold bricks of dried compressed grapes, along with yeast, and a warning not to soak the mixturein warm water - ""fermentation will occur!""* Vodka was originally made from rye and other plants; potato-based vodka was seen as cheap and inferior.* A drink made from fermented sweet potatoes (mobbie) was very popular in the Caribbean, only replaced by sugar cane rum after a beetle infestation wiped out sweet potatoes in Barbados in the late 1700s.* There are over 110,000 varieties of rice.* Cashew shells contain urushiol.* Some people think jasmine flowers smell like urine.A complete list of every plant discussed: Part 1: Agave | Apple | Barley | Corn | Grapes | Potato | Rice | Rye | Sorghum | Sugarcane | WheatBanana | Cashew Apple | Cassava | Date Palm | Jackfruit | Marula | Monkey Puzzle | Parsnip | Prickly Pear Cactus | Savanna Bamboo | Strawberry Tree | TamarindPart 2: Allspice | Aloe | Angelica | Artichoke | Bay Laurel | Betel Leaf | Bison Grass | Calamus (Sweet Flag) | Caraway | Cardamom | Clove | Coca | Coriander | Cubeb | Damiana | Dittany of Crete | Elecampane | European Centaury | Fenugreek | Galangal | Gentian | Germander | Ginger | Grains of Paradise | Juniper | Lemon Balm | Lemon Verbena | Licorice-Flavored Herbs | Maidenhair Fern | Meadowsweet | Nutmeg and Mace | Orris | Pink Peppercorn | Sarsaparilla | Sassafras | Sundew | Sweet Woodruff | Tobacco | Tonka Bean | Vanilla | WormwoodChamomile | Elderflower | Hops | Jasmine | Opium Poppy | Rose | Saffron | VioletAngostura | Birch | Cascarilla | Chinchona | Cinnamon | Douglas Fir | Eucalyptus | Mastic | Mauby | Myrrh | Pine | Senegal Gum Tree | Spruce | Sugar MapleApricot | Black Currant | Cacao | Fig | Marasca Cherry | Plum | Quandong | Rowan Berry | Sloe Berry | Citrus Almond | Coffee | Hazelnut | Kola Nut | WalnutPart 3: spearmint, lavender, pomegranate, strawberry, & pepperI found Part 1 to be the most interesting. I'm not sure if that's because I'd never heard of a lot of the flavorings mentioned in Part 2, or if it's because there are just SO many different plants listed, with little in depth information.Each chapter is full of details on the specific species domesticated, how it is grown, the plant's history, details on harvesting the goodness within, different fermentation methods, cultural significance, environmental issues, and recipes.For example (and it was difficult for me to choose just one example!), from the first chapter, agave: 
Any number of popular books on tequila and mezcal claim that when the Spanish arrived in Mexico, they needed a stronger drink to fortify themselves against the long and bloody struggle to come and introduced distillation as a way to turn pulque into a higher-proof spirit. In fact, tequila and mezcal are made from entirely different species of agave than pulque. The method for harvesting the plant and making the spirit is completely different, too. It turns out to be very difficult to put pulque in a still and get strong liquor from it. The complex sugar molecules in agave nectar don’t break down readily during fermentation, and heat from distillation causes unpleasant chemical reactions that create nasty flavors like sulfur and burning rubber. Extracting agave sugars for distillation requires a different technique—one that had already been perfected before the Spanish arrived. Archeological evidence—including the aforementioned coprolite analysis carried out by Eric Callen and others—proves that people living in Mexico prior to the Spanish invasion enjoyed a long tradition of roasting the heart of the agave for food. Pottery fragments, early tools, paintings, and actual remnants of digested agave all confirm this beyond a doubt. Roasted agave is a gourmet experience; imagine a richer, meatier version of grilled artichoke hearts. It would have made a fine meal by itself.
If you're wondering if she mentions Dogfish Head brewery, the answer is: yes, of course she does! (in five different sections)I can't emphasize enough how completely fascinating this book is!!!!"

The book combines some history of a specific drink and plant with information on how the plants are used in drinks. As a listener, and not a reader, I found the history more intrequing then the mixing instructions. The book did open a whole new appreciation for the variety of plant life we have, and wonder at how humans have discovered some of the steps needed to prepare these plants for use by us.Beacuse there is so much information that one can not remember or access in the audio format, I bought a hardcover edition. I expect it will take me years to go through the interesting recipes. I expect there will be many ingredients I will not be able to find.The one omission that might be worth adding is the anatomy of the coctail in a general level. Maybe it is obvious, but it seems that some explaination of why it 'works' might be in order. These drinks generally contain the base alcohol, then sweeteners and flavorings. It is the balance that makes the drink, and one could muse on how the human body interprets the base flavors.Usually I opt for unabridged books, but in this case it would be a better 'listen' without as much detail. A companion file with the drinks and the names of all the plants would be another useful addition."

For instance, potatoes are associated with vodka, but they actually make the worse kind! Russian vodka makers say the best is made from rye or wheat. Potatoes only became a common ingredient because they were cheap and abundant! ha! And hops are in the cannabis family... closely related to marijuana!

269,1616200464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8995319-jc,5,"An unhealthy proportion of my podcast consumption is about food. I recently became extremely obsessed with tonic water after listening to a Gastropod episode on it. I was fascinated by this ingredient in classic tonic waters known as quinine, traditionally derived from cinchona bark. Even Canada Dry’s tonic water still contains quinine as advertised on its cans and bottles. Over the past month, I’ve been sipping through overpriced bottles of Fever-Tree (other than bulk in Costco, I’ve discovered that it seems to be cheapest at my neighbourhood Metro), as well as various bottles of chinotto (like Lurisia’s, which has become my absolute favourite) and Italian red bitter tonic waters (like Portofino). I’m now a tonic water socialist. Bad jokes aside though, quinine held a not insignificant role in the unfolding of globalization and its attendant wars. Amy Stewart introduces the cinchona tree like this:“No tree has had a more important role in the history of cocktails than this South American species. The quinine extracted from cinchona bark doesn’t just flavor tonics, bitters, aromatized wines, and other spirits. It also saved the world from malaria and put botanists and plant hunters at the center of several global wars.”For more insight into one of these wars, an excerpt on WW2 cinchona plantations from Daniel Immerwahr’s “How to Hide and Empire” might be helpful:“Malaria was especially nettlesome because the customary remedies were no longer available. More than 95 percent of the supply of quinine, the most effective antimalarial, had come from the cinchona plantations of the Dutch East Indies—now in Japanese hands. And the insecticide used to fumigate the Panama Canal Zone, pyrethrum, had come principally from Japan. Dozens of university laboratories screened more than fourteen thousand compounds in search of a synthetic antimalarial. Prisoners and conscientious objectors were brought in as guinea pigs. Two compounds worked well: atabrine and chloroquine. Atabrine turned the skin an alarming shade of yellow and disturbed the gastrointestinal tract, but it brought down malaria rates considerably. Chloroquine, which debuted at the end of the war, worked even better. Together, the synthetic drugs not only replaced quinine, they surpassed it.”I thought it was interesting that chloroquine was part of this quest to find a synthetic alternative to quinine — chloroquine being the chemical that has recently been floating about media talkingheads due to Trump’s dangerous remarks about chloroquine related to COVID-19. I also find it fascinating that among the guinea pigs that chemicals like chloroquine were tested on were conscientious objectors. War is and has always been deeply entangled with disease. Many victims of imperialist wars were not killed by direct acts of violence but by way of microbial pathogens (if not experimental drugs in the case of conscientious objectors). I think it’s important to note how the mass movement of humans across large distances is central to the spread of fatal diseases, and how wars are so often the engine behind such movement. Immerwahr on Spanish and American colonial interventions in the Philippines:“Doubtless, the guns and torches did kill tens of thousands. But the full story of Philippine mortality is considerably more complicated. As was often the case in the nineteenth century, most victims of the war died from disease… the diseases started under Spanish rule. The late nineteenth century had brought tumult to the Philippines, moving people around the archipelago and disrupting long-standing economic arrangements. Both motion and instability carried lethal epidemiological consequences, most notably during the cholera epidemic in 1882–83, which killed hundreds of thousands, and the rinderpest outbreak in 1887, wiping out nine in ten cattle and carabao… When the war with the United States came, those horsemen charged forth, now all at once and galloping: cholera, malaria, dysentery, beriberi, rinderpest, tuberculosis, smallpox, and bubonic plague.”The military of course knew that disease was a significant threat not only to people already living within their lands of conquest (which they cared little for) but also to their own soldiers deployed in these various far flung regions. This is the story of the American-provoked annexation of Panama (Immerwahr again):“Captain Mahan had suggested opening a canal through the Central American isthmus, which divided the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and Roosevelt agreed. He tried to buy territory from Colombia, without luck. He tried threatening and got no further. Finally, concluding that bargaining with Colombia’s leaders was liking trying to “nail currant jelly to a wall,” Roosevelt threw his support behind rebels, who declared Panama’s independence from Colombia. The newly established republic then leased to the United States a ten-mile-wide strip of land slicing through the middle of the country: the Panama Canal Zone.Still, more territory, more problems—problems of precisely the moving-things-and-people variety. The hot and rainy neck of land throbbed with disease-bearing mosquitoes. Panamanians who had lived with those mosquitoes their whole lives had acquired immunity to yellow fever and resistance to malaria. Outsiders, however, were fresh bait. Of the first batch of U.S. mainlanders to arrive in the Panama Canal Zone, nearly all were immediately laid low by malaria. Later officials came bringing their caskets with them.They weren’t being paranoid. Yellow fever, malaria, chronic diarrhea, dysentery, pneumonia, and bubonic plague tore through the zone. “I shall never forget the train loads of dead men being carted away daily as if they were just so much lumber,” remembered a carpenter… The point here is that, to open a canal, the United States had to exert colonial control. In fact, it transformed the Panama Canal Zone into one of the most intensively governed spots on the planet. Brigades marched forth to cut brush, drain swamps, and put up screens. They fumigated buildings with pyrethrum, an insecticide made from the petals of chrysanthemums—at peak they imported more than 120 tons a month. To combat mosquitoes, which laid eggs in still water, the authorities made war on puddles. They filled or covered any indentation where water might accumulate. They even ordered the holy water in the font of the cathedral changed daily after finding mosquito larvae in it.Altogether, opening the canal took ten years and cost nearly a third of a billion dollars—more if you count the cost of the landslides that perpetually closed the canal in its first years. As usual, records kept on the deaths of nonwhites were shoddy, but we think some fifteen thousand workers, mainly West Indian, died from accident or disease while on the job. And all to tame a strip of land ten miles wide and not even fifty miles long.”Diseases like malaria were of central concern to militaries, and so even by WW2, quinine and the cinchona plantations of Southeast Asia were vital for ensuring the health of soldiers, and that was certainly the case for various colonial militaries preceding WW2 also.This brings me to my next wildly irrelevant tangent. Not too long after wading about the world of tonic water and quinine, I eventually found myself muddling about the world of bitters. And of course there’s no place better to start than Angostura. (Hot tip: No Frills sells Angostura for way cheaper than Loblaws, Metro, or the LCBO). What got me really into Angostura was reading about its history. For one, its produced in Trinidad, home to Bhaskar Sunkara and some guy named C.L.R. James? Fun fact: according to Louise Cripps, the original publication of C.LR. James’ “Modern Politics” had an advertisement for Angostura bitters in it. More fascinating is Angostura’s history before it moved production to Trinidad. Angostura’s recipe was first developed in Venezuela by a German doctor named Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert, who was surgeon general in the revolutionary army of Simon Bolivar. Bolivar is known as the Liberator, whose namesakes include the country of Bolivia and Venezuela’s Bolivarian Revolution at the turn of the 21st century, which brought Chavez to power among the sweeping pink tide of Latin America. Bolivar was actually a rather complicated figure though. In the influential book “Imagined Communities”, Benedict Anderson situates Bolivar in this way (even mentioning the namesake of rapper Tupac Shakur, whose mom as a black revolutionary, was very well versed in world history):“In Peru, memories of the great jacquerie led by Tupac Amarú (1740–1781) were still fresh. In 1791, Toussaint L’Ouverture led an insurrection of black slaves that produced in 1804 the second independent republic in the Western hemisphere – and terrified the great slave-owning planters of Venezuela. When, in 1789, Madrid issued a new, more humane, slave law specifying in detail the rights and duties of masters and slaves, ‘the creoles rejected state intervention on the grounds that slaves were prone to vice and independence [!], and were essential to the economy. In Venezuela – indeed all over the Spanish Caribbean – planters resisted the law and procured its suspension in 1794.’ The Liberator Bolívar himself once opined that a Negro revolt was ‘a thousand times worse than a Spanish invasion… Bolívar came to change his mind about slaves, and his fellow-liberator San Martín decreed in 1821 that ‘in the future the aborigines shall not be called Indians or natives; they are children and citizens of Peru and they shall be known as Peruvians.”That was a slight tangent. Anyway, as for the German Dr. Siegert (Bolivar’s surgeon general), Brad Thomas Parsons, in his book “Bitters” describes the Siegert’s path to Angostura bitters:“Using his medical knowledge, Siegert harvested many of the local herbs, roots, botanicals, and barks (but not, despite the name, the bark of the angostura tree) to create tonics to stimulate the appetite of the troops, aid with digestive distress, and keep the army on its feet. By 1824 he had perfected a proprietary blend of Siegert’s Amargo Aromatico (aromatic bitters). Because it was a trading post on the Orinoco River, the town of Angostura (meaning “the narrows”) saw a brisk maritime activity as ships set sail for locations throughout the Caribbean. Soon Siegert’s bitters were being used by sailors to quell seasickness, and word of his product spread. By 1830 his bitters were available not only in nearby Trinidad but as far away as England. ”The English aspect is important because a cocktail known as Gin Pahit was a simple mix of gin with Angostura bitters, often referred to as pink gin these days. Pahit was the Malay word for ‘bitter’, and this drink was a favourite of Royal Navy officers in colonial Malaya, and mentioned by literary figures such as W. Somerset Maugham and P.G. Wodehouse. It was a common drink in Malayan cocktail bars frequented by colonial administrators, and was served at the Raffles Long Bar up until the 1980s. It has since gone out of fashion. Yet the pink hue of gin pahit is unmistakably the colour of the British Empire plastered onto colonial era maps of the time. And Angostura’s claims to relieve the unsettled stomachs of anti-imperial forces in Venezuela to the the sea-sickness of the British Empire’s Royal Navy marks a curious turn of events. As quinine and its synthetic counterparts were entangled in imperialist wars, so too were those of Angostura bitters, even if the bitters did have their roots in a revolution against empire. The gentian root of Angostura bitters is in fact in the same botanical family as quinine. So too is coffee, one of the beverages that got me into this bougie mess in the first place. Trying to train my palette, so as to better identify tasting notes in coffee, I’ve been working through alcohol and botanically fortified spirits to hone in my palette. Very bougie preoccupation.Anyway, most of this stuff I just wrote about Angostura was not mentioned in the book (the gentian root-quinine-coffee connection being one of a few exceptions). I had actually encountered most of this information before reading the book, but the fascinating story behind Angostura was what compelled me to seek this book out. In fact, there are far more fascinating stories and botanical revelations to be had in Amy Stewart’s book. It is a very fun read. I’ve been acquiring a taste for vermouth because of it, and certainly have been consuming more gin than I should be. Either way, I convinced myself that I eventually just want to move to dry drinks both for the benefit of my brain, liver, and wallet. But I hoped to get a rough outline of spirits and the tastes involved, before being able to experiment more confidently with making soft cocktails for myself. After working a 9-5 for three years, I understand why people become alcoholics. Hopefully I will improve my backyard herb garden this summer (since I’m confined to the house anyway), and get a small bitters collection going, and hopefully save enough to afford myself some nice tonic water, which I can water down with club soda if I really need to. They do tend to be fairly sugary substances. I'm embarrassed this the sort of fluff that I preoccupy myself with these days, lol. Ok, wow, this was a terrible book review. But a fantastic book. Also there’s a Walker Percy cocktail recipe in this book which will totally get you hammered. I feel like I will end up forgetting most of the really cool facts I encountered in this book, considering all the alcohol involved. It will be a challenge to remember star anise and cacao come from evergreen trees, that agave bloom as infrequently as every thirty years, or that vanilla are orchids that need roots exposed to air (not soil) and require the presence of a special fungus and often live on the limbs of trees a hundred feet off the ground, or that whisky is often dyed with soda or spirit caramel the colour chosen often dictated by the length of aging, or how bourbon must contain at least 51% corn spirit and be aged in new charred oak barrels, or how Nixon almost burnt down the White House by trying to show his daughter how Zhou Enlai lit his mao-tai on fire (at least according to Kissinger, if you can trust a war criminal). I will try to remember that cloves are tiny flower buds, and that hops (belonging to the cannabis family) are native to China, and the earliest records of citrus fruits are from China, and that mint is a weedy plant that can basically grow in sidewalk cracks (I will test this claim in my herb garden this summer). Anyway, this is definitely a book I’ll be keeping around for reference."

Within its gorgeous green cover are sections on fermentation/distillation of various plants (from agave to wheat); information on the items that might infuse a spirit; and last, plants that can be used as fresh mixers and garnishes.   It’s part botany, binomial nomenclature and all; part chemistry, which goes a long way to explaining why plants and their distillates taste the way they do; part history, with carefully sifted facts of how this plant traveled from Asia/Africa to Europe to the Americas, or how that product gave rise to several lawsuits, or how the American people were swindled into believing that a chemically bleached and hardened excuse for a cherry was superior to fruit preserved in real maraschino liqueur (spoiler: it’s Prohibition’s fault. Of course it is).   Stewart includes recipes for about a dozen syrups and 4 dozen cocktails - all of them classics, or excellent riffs thereon. She also has sections with advice on how to grow your own plants, if you like, as well as recommended reading for gardeners and mixologists alike. I’d love to say that this book would clear up, say, the various apple beverages or grape-based spirits once and for all, but that will probably take at least one reread. Still, I commend this to the use of anyone who’s ever wondered why spirits are aged in oak barrels, or what potable bitters involve, or which liqueurs are worth getting. For my own part, I long for a bottle of Clear Creek Distillery’s Douglas fir eau-de-vie."

I may not be a big drinker, but I am very curious about the stuff. The Drunken Botanist hits all the right notes for me. It's fascinating historical facts, brewing information, advice (and warnings) on growing the stuff yourself, and recommendations on brands and breweries. Essentially, I should be set for any alcohol-related Trivial Pursuit questions.The sense of humor is dry (or should I say secco?) and livens up the narrative. The book's listing on Amazon contains a short book trailer that sums up the humor quite well. A few times it made me giggle, but more than that it's the sort of book that balances information and amusement in a way that begs to be read out loud to others. Unless you're going to play these people at Trivial Pursuit. Then you may want to hoard the information for yourself.I received an advanced release ebook through NetGalley, though after reading only a short way, I concluded I need to buy a copy for myself and for a family member.

The hardcover edition is designed like a textbook: educational, but constantly interrupting itself with colorful asides. The e-book version suffers from the overall design because of its inherent linearity whereas physical books make flipping back and forth much easily.THE DRUNKEN BOTANIST covers anything and everything booze related. Stewart delves deep into the science behind the plants, process, and presentation of common alcoholic ingredients. From historical facts to cocktail recipes, the intrepid boozehound is bond to find something new to learn about their favorite drinks. It takes talent to combine humor and factual data without swinging too hard into either extreme, but Stewart manages the feat with gusto.Make no mistake: it's a reference book through and through. While beginner friendly, it's better suited on a bartender's bookshelf. Only buy if you plan on mixing drinks in the near future or want to buy the best brands of your particular poison. "

This book must have been written with me in mind. A co-worker who is a cocktail nut lent it to me, and I couldn’t put it down. From alcohols to liquors, mixers to garnishes, this book gives you the history of common ingredients to obscure herbs used in a single defunct liquor by monks in the Tyrols. With a particular eye to the botanical history and discovery of each ingredient, along with the subsequent alcoholic uses, readers are even provided with recipes for drinks and ingredients. The ending seems a little rushed, and there are occasional repetitions, but overall this is a fresh, well written reference.In short—great for anyone with an interest in gardening, drinking, or both."

WHAT ABOUT the LEMON WEDGE? Wheat beers are often served with a lemon wedge to highlight their natural citrus flavors, but some beer aficionados consider this a sacrilege. They argue that good beer should never require additional flavorings. In certain company, what one does with a lemon wedge and a glass of wheat beer could make or break a friendship. It’s your drink, so do what you want—but proceed with caution.
LOL I am one of those people who is horrified by beer served with lemon or lime or orange wedges, I don't even like to see beer served in a frosty mug, because ice-cold temperature kills the flavor. Yes, I will judge you.Ms Stewart is always a fun and enthusiastic author, and this is a fun book with a lot of fascinating information.Much like a fine whiskey (because no I could not resist that obvious metaphor), this is a book best savored slowly, not gulped. I tried to read just one section each day, but the first day I was so delighted, I read from agave straight through to potato.There is A LOT of information here, broken into three parts (the classics that are fermented, the add-ins that go in during fermentation, and mixers), each part organized alphabetically, with plenty of sidebar notes, and an on-going fascination with critters (bugs-in-booze) that pops up throughout.SOME of the fascinating things that I learned from reading this book:* Agave was originally grown as a food source, not for making a fermented beverage.* The oldest domesticated living organism is a yeast.* Corn was (most likely) grown not as a grain but as a source of sugar from the cornstalk, and was supplanted by sugar cane when that plant was brought to the Americas.* a red Italian liqueur was originally made using red dye from alkermes scale. (As a houseplant enthusiast, I'm familiar with the scale insect! I never knew about the red one.)* During Prohibition, California vineyards sold bricks of dried compressed grapes, along with yeast, and a warning not to soak the mixturein warm water - ""fermentation will occur!""* Vodka was originally made from rye and other plants; potato-based vodka was seen as cheap and inferior.* A drink made from fermented sweet potatoes (mobbie) was very popular in the Caribbean, only replaced by sugar cane rum after a beetle infestation wiped out sweet potatoes in Barbados in the late 1700s.* There are over 110,000 varieties of rice.* Cashew shells contain urushiol.* Some people think jasmine flowers smell like urine.A complete list of every plant discussed: Part 1: Agave | Apple | Barley | Corn | Grapes | Potato | Rice | Rye | Sorghum | Sugarcane | WheatBanana | Cashew Apple | Cassava | Date Palm | Jackfruit | Marula | Monkey Puzzle | Parsnip | Prickly Pear Cactus | Savanna Bamboo | Strawberry Tree | TamarindPart 2: Allspice | Aloe | Angelica | Artichoke | Bay Laurel | Betel Leaf | Bison Grass | Calamus (Sweet Flag) | Caraway | Cardamom | Clove | Coca | Coriander | Cubeb | Damiana | Dittany of Crete | Elecampane | European Centaury | Fenugreek | Galangal | Gentian | Germander | Ginger | Grains of Paradise | Juniper | Lemon Balm | Lemon Verbena | Licorice-Flavored Herbs | Maidenhair Fern | Meadowsweet | Nutmeg and Mace | Orris | Pink Peppercorn | Sarsaparilla | Sassafras | Sundew | Sweet Woodruff | Tobacco | Tonka Bean | Vanilla | WormwoodChamomile | Elderflower | Hops | Jasmine | Opium Poppy | Rose | Saffron | VioletAngostura | Birch | Cascarilla | Chinchona | Cinnamon | Douglas Fir | Eucalyptus | Mastic | Mauby | Myrrh | Pine | Senegal Gum Tree | Spruce | Sugar MapleApricot | Black Currant | Cacao | Fig | Marasca Cherry | Plum | Quandong | Rowan Berry | Sloe Berry | Citrus Almond | Coffee | Hazelnut | Kola Nut | WalnutPart 3: spearmint, lavender, pomegranate, strawberry, & pepperI found Part 1 to be the most interesting. I'm not sure if that's because I'd never heard of a lot of the flavorings mentioned in Part 2, or if it's because there are just SO many different plants listed, with little in depth information.Each chapter is full of details on the specific species domesticated, how it is grown, the plant's history, details on harvesting the goodness within, different fermentation methods, cultural significance, environmental issues, and recipes.For example (and it was difficult for me to choose just one example!), from the first chapter, agave: 
Any number of popular books on tequila and mezcal claim that when the Spanish arrived in Mexico, they needed a stronger drink to fortify themselves against the long and bloody struggle to come and introduced distillation as a way to turn pulque into a higher-proof spirit. In fact, tequila and mezcal are made from entirely different species of agave than pulque. The method for harvesting the plant and making the spirit is completely different, too. It turns out to be very difficult to put pulque in a still and get strong liquor from it. The complex sugar molecules in agave nectar don’t break down readily during fermentation, and heat from distillation causes unpleasant chemical reactions that create nasty flavors like sulfur and burning rubber. Extracting agave sugars for distillation requires a different technique—one that had already been perfected before the Spanish arrived. Archeological evidence—including the aforementioned coprolite analysis carried out by Eric Callen and others—proves that people living in Mexico prior to the Spanish invasion enjoyed a long tradition of roasting the heart of the agave for food. Pottery fragments, early tools, paintings, and actual remnants of digested agave all confirm this beyond a doubt. Roasted agave is a gourmet experience; imagine a richer, meatier version of grilled artichoke hearts. It would have made a fine meal by itself.
If you're wondering if she mentions Dogfish Head brewery, the answer is: yes, of course she does! (in five different sections)I can't emphasize enough how completely fascinating this book is!!!!"

The book combines some history of a specific drink and plant with information on how the plants are used in drinks. As a listener, and not a reader, I found the history more intrequing then the mixing instructions. The book did open a whole new appreciation for the variety of plant life we have, and wonder at how humans have discovered some of the steps needed to prepare these plants for use by us.Beacuse there is so much information that one can not remember or access in the audio format, I bought a hardcover edition. I expect it will take me years to go through the interesting recipes. I expect there will be many ingredients I will not be able to find.The one omission that might be worth adding is the anatomy of the coctail in a general level. Maybe it is obvious, but it seems that some explaination of why it 'works' might be in order. These drinks generally contain the base alcohol, then sweeteners and flavorings. It is the balance that makes the drink, and one could muse on how the human body interprets the base flavors.Usually I opt for unabridged books, but in this case it would be a better 'listen' without as much detail. A companion file with the drinks and the names of all the plants would be another useful addition."

My Mom likes Gin and Tonics (which my Dad makes for her!), and the information about tonic was fascinating!! Some of the recipes looked very inviting! And some I was glad to learn about the non-vegan-ness... some are obvious, some not so. (Be careful about Black Russians!) ;)Just all the info about plants and the process is so interesting. For instance, potatoes are associated with vodka, but they actually make the worse kind! Russian vodka makers say the best is made from rye or wheat. Potatoes only became a common ingredient because they were cheap and abundant! ha! And hops are in the cannabis family... closely related to marijuana! And, like left-handedness in humans, they have a genetic predisposition to vine themselves in a clockwise direction around their trellis.

Not only does Stewart explain how various plants are used in alcohol, but along the way she provides recipes, interesting historical vignettes about specific plants, information on the overall mechanics of brewing, distilling, infusing, and garnishing, and provides what is very nearly a taxonomy of alcohol, told to the story of the plants that make them up.No real criticism.

Regardless of the answer to that question, the followup is usually, ""Can I make booze with this?"" This book explores the botanical origin stories of various liquers and liquors. And it has a few suggestions on various cocktail recipes and which plants you can grow at home. It certainly can be read all the way through (that's how I did it, albeit slowly) but it might work better as a reference or a book where you skip around a bit."

If you like booze and plants this is a very good book. It's actually very close to being a really nice ""how to get into food gardening"" type of book. It definitely whets (wets) the appetite. Lots of interesting trivia about your favorite alcohol. A little history, some good recipes, and an overview of the world of spirits. Recommended to ""foodies"" who like booze (boozies??) and gardeners. And folks who want to be either of those two things. "

If it hadn't been for book club, I definitely wouldn't have read it cover-to-cover (if at all, seeing as how I'm not really a plant person), and I wouldn't recommend that to many others. I would, however, recommend it if you're really into the relationship between your produce and your food, which I know many people are. It gave me many fun facts to think about, and honestly, a lot of different kinds of liquors and cocktail recipes that I'd like to try. Also, it's a really neat looking book, so it's worth having on your shelf if you like pretty books with recipes and fun facts."

At least, I don't think it is. But that is how I read it anyway, and while I found many parts of it interesting, as a whole, this book is rather dry.This is one of two books that made me wish I appreciated alcohol, the other being Love by the Glass by Dorothy Gaiter and John Brecher. While I do think I've found a drink I actually enjoy, it will take a while for me to come around to the hard stuff which seems to be the focus of this book.The parts I found most interesting were the growing tips of various plants that can be used in cocktails. I don't live in a place where any of them are really viable, but a girl can dream."

299,1616200464,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8995319-jc,5,"An unhealthy proportion of my podcast consumption is about food. I recently became extremely obsessed with tonic water after listening to a Gastropod episode on it. I was fascinated by this ingredient in classic tonic waters known as quinine, traditionally derived from cinchona bark. Even Canada Dry’s tonic water still contains quinine as advertised on its cans and bottles. Over the past month, I’ve been sipping through overpriced bottles of Fever-Tree (other than bulk in Costco, I’ve discovered that it seems to be cheapest at my neighbourhood Metro), as well as various bottles of chinotto (like Lurisia’s, which has become my absolute favourite) and Italian red bitter tonic waters (like Portofino). I’m now a tonic water socialist. Bad jokes aside though, quinine held a not insignificant role in the unfolding of globalization and its attendant wars. Amy Stewart introduces the cinchona tree like this:“No tree has had a more important role in the history of cocktails than this South American species. The quinine extracted from cinchona bark doesn’t just flavor tonics, bitters, aromatized wines, and other spirits. It also saved the world from malaria and put botanists and plant hunters at the center of several global wars.”For more insight into one of these wars, an excerpt on WW2 cinchona plantations from Daniel Immerwahr’s “How to Hide and Empire” might be helpful:“Malaria was especially nettlesome because the customary remedies were no longer available. More than 95 percent of the supply of quinine, the most effective antimalarial, had come from the cinchona plantations of the Dutch East Indies—now in Japanese hands. And the insecticide used to fumigate the Panama Canal Zone, pyrethrum, had come principally from Japan. Dozens of university laboratories screened more than fourteen thousand compounds in search of a synthetic antimalarial. Prisoners and conscientious objectors were brought in as guinea pigs. Two compounds worked well: atabrine and chloroquine. Atabrine turned the skin an alarming shade of yellow and disturbed the gastrointestinal tract, but it brought down malaria rates considerably. Chloroquine, which debuted at the end of the war, worked even better. Together, the synthetic drugs not only replaced quinine, they surpassed it.”I thought it was interesting that chloroquine was part of this quest to find a synthetic alternative to quinine — chloroquine being the chemical that has recently been floating about media talkingheads due to Trump’s dangerous remarks about chloroquine related to COVID-19. I also find it fascinating that among the guinea pigs that chemicals like chloroquine were tested on were conscientious objectors. War is and has always been deeply entangled with disease. Many victims of imperialist wars were not killed by direct acts of violence but by way of microbial pathogens (if not experimental drugs in the case of conscientious objectors). I think it’s important to note how the mass movement of humans across large distances is central to the spread of fatal diseases, and how wars are so often the engine behind such movement. Immerwahr on Spanish and American colonial interventions in the Philippines:“Doubtless, the guns and torches did kill tens of thousands. But the full story of Philippine mortality is considerably more complicated. As was often the case in the nineteenth century, most victims of the war died from disease… the diseases started under Spanish rule. The late nineteenth century had brought tumult to the Philippines, moving people around the archipelago and disrupting long-standing economic arrangements. Both motion and instability carried lethal epidemiological consequences, most notably during the cholera epidemic in 1882–83, which killed hundreds of thousands, and the rinderpest outbreak in 1887, wiping out nine in ten cattle and carabao… When the war with the United States came, those horsemen charged forth, now all at once and galloping: cholera, malaria, dysentery, beriberi, rinderpest, tuberculosis, smallpox, and bubonic plague.”The military of course knew that disease was a significant threat not only to people already living within their lands of conquest (which they cared little for) but also to their own soldiers deployed in these various far flung regions. This is the story of the American-provoked annexation of Panama (Immerwahr again):“Captain Mahan had suggested opening a canal through the Central American isthmus, which divided the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and Roosevelt agreed. He tried to buy territory from Colombia, without luck. He tried threatening and got no further. Finally, concluding that bargaining with Colombia’s leaders was liking trying to “nail currant jelly to a wall,” Roosevelt threw his support behind rebels, who declared Panama’s independence from Colombia. The newly established republic then leased to the United States a ten-mile-wide strip of land slicing through the middle of the country: the Panama Canal Zone.Still, more territory, more problems—problems of precisely the moving-things-and-people variety. The hot and rainy neck of land throbbed with disease-bearing mosquitoes. Panamanians who had lived with those mosquitoes their whole lives had acquired immunity to yellow fever and resistance to malaria. Outsiders, however, were fresh bait. Of the first batch of U.S. mainlanders to arrive in the Panama Canal Zone, nearly all were immediately laid low by malaria. Later officials came bringing their caskets with them.They weren’t being paranoid. Yellow fever, malaria, chronic diarrhea, dysentery, pneumonia, and bubonic plague tore through the zone. “I shall never forget the train loads of dead men being carted away daily as if they were just so much lumber,” remembered a carpenter… The point here is that, to open a canal, the United States had to exert colonial control. In fact, it transformed the Panama Canal Zone into one of the most intensively governed spots on the planet. Brigades marched forth to cut brush, drain swamps, and put up screens. They fumigated buildings with pyrethrum, an insecticide made from the petals of chrysanthemums—at peak they imported more than 120 tons a month. To combat mosquitoes, which laid eggs in still water, the authorities made war on puddles. They filled or covered any indentation where water might accumulate. They even ordered the holy water in the font of the cathedral changed daily after finding mosquito larvae in it.Altogether, opening the canal took ten years and cost nearly a third of a billion dollars—more if you count the cost of the landslides that perpetually closed the canal in its first years. As usual, records kept on the deaths of nonwhites were shoddy, but we think some fifteen thousand workers, mainly West Indian, died from accident or disease while on the job. And all to tame a strip of land ten miles wide and not even fifty miles long.”Diseases like malaria were of central concern to militaries, and so even by WW2, quinine and the cinchona plantations of Southeast Asia were vital for ensuring the health of soldiers, and that was certainly the case for various colonial militaries preceding WW2 also.This brings me to my next wildly irrelevant tangent. Not too long after wading about the world of tonic water and quinine, I eventually found myself muddling about the world of bitters. And of course there’s no place better to start than Angostura. (Hot tip: No Frills sells Angostura for way cheaper than Loblaws, Metro, or the LCBO). What got me really into Angostura was reading about its history. For one, its produced in Trinidad, home to Bhaskar Sunkara and some guy named C.L.R. James? Fun fact: according to Louise Cripps, the original publication of C.LR. James’ “Modern Politics” had an advertisement for Angostura bitters in it. More fascinating is Angostura’s history before it moved production to Trinidad. Angostura’s recipe was first developed in Venezuela by a German doctor named Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert, who was surgeon general in the revolutionary army of Simon Bolivar. Bolivar is known as the Liberator, whose namesakes include the country of Bolivia and Venezuela’s Bolivarian Revolution at the turn of the 21st century, which brought Chavez to power among the sweeping pink tide of Latin America. Bolivar was actually a rather complicated figure though. In the influential book “Imagined Communities”, Benedict Anderson situates Bolivar in this way (even mentioning the namesake of rapper Tupac Shakur, whose mom as a black revolutionary, was very well versed in world history):“In Peru, memories of the great jacquerie led by Tupac Amarú (1740–1781) were still fresh. In 1791, Toussaint L’Ouverture led an insurrection of black slaves that produced in 1804 the second independent republic in the Western hemisphere – and terrified the great slave-owning planters of Venezuela. When, in 1789, Madrid issued a new, more humane, slave law specifying in detail the rights and duties of masters and slaves, ‘the creoles rejected state intervention on the grounds that slaves were prone to vice and independence [!], and were essential to the economy. In Venezuela – indeed all over the Spanish Caribbean – planters resisted the law and procured its suspension in 1794.’ The Liberator Bolívar himself once opined that a Negro revolt was ‘a thousand times worse than a Spanish invasion… Bolívar came to change his mind about slaves, and his fellow-liberator San Martín decreed in 1821 that ‘in the future the aborigines shall not be called Indians or natives; they are children and citizens of Peru and they shall be known as Peruvians.”That was a slight tangent. Anyway, as for the German Dr. Siegert (Bolivar’s surgeon general), Brad Thomas Parsons, in his book “Bitters” describes the Siegert’s path to Angostura bitters:“Using his medical knowledge, Siegert harvested many of the local herbs, roots, botanicals, and barks (but not, despite the name, the bark of the angostura tree) to create tonics to stimulate the appetite of the troops, aid with digestive distress, and keep the army on its feet. By 1824 he had perfected a proprietary blend of Siegert’s Amargo Aromatico (aromatic bitters). Because it was a trading post on the Orinoco River, the town of Angostura (meaning “the narrows”) saw a brisk maritime activity as ships set sail for locations throughout the Caribbean. Soon Siegert’s bitters were being used by sailors to quell seasickness, and word of his product spread. By 1830 his bitters were available not only in nearby Trinidad but as far away as England. ”The English aspect is important because a cocktail known as Gin Pahit was a simple mix of gin with Angostura bitters, often referred to as pink gin these days. Pahit was the Malay word for ‘bitter’, and this drink was a favourite of Royal Navy officers in colonial Malaya, and mentioned by literary figures such as W. Somerset Maugham and P.G. Wodehouse. It was a common drink in Malayan cocktail bars frequented by colonial administrators, and was served at the Raffles Long Bar up until the 1980s. It has since gone out of fashion. Yet the pink hue of gin pahit is unmistakably the colour of the British Empire plastered onto colonial era maps of the time. And Angostura’s claims to relieve the unsettled stomachs of anti-imperial forces in Venezuela to the the sea-sickness of the British Empire’s Royal Navy marks a curious turn of events. As quinine and its synthetic counterparts were entangled in imperialist wars, so too were those of Angostura bitters, even if the bitters did have their roots in a revolution against empire. The gentian root of Angostura bitters is in fact in the same botanical family as quinine. So too is coffee, one of the beverages that got me into this bougie mess in the first place. Trying to train my palette, so as to better identify tasting notes in coffee, I’ve been working through alcohol and botanically fortified spirits to hone in my palette. Very bougie preoccupation.Anyway, most of this stuff I just wrote about Angostura was not mentioned in the book (the gentian root-quinine-coffee connection being one of a few exceptions). I had actually encountered most of this information before reading the book, but the fascinating story behind Angostura was what compelled me to seek this book out. In fact, there are far more fascinating stories and botanical revelations to be had in Amy Stewart’s book. It is a very fun read. I’ve been acquiring a taste for vermouth because of it, and certainly have been consuming more gin than I should be. Either way, I convinced myself that I eventually just want to move to dry drinks both for the benefit of my brain, liver, and wallet. But I hoped to get a rough outline of spirits and the tastes involved, before being able to experiment more confidently with making soft cocktails for myself. After working a 9-5 for three years, I understand why people become alcoholics. Hopefully I will improve my backyard herb garden this summer (since I’m confined to the house anyway), and get a small bitters collection going, and hopefully save enough to afford myself some nice tonic water, which I can water down with club soda if I really need to. They do tend to be fairly sugary substances. I'm embarrassed this the sort of fluff that I preoccupy myself with these days, lol. Ok, wow, this was a terrible book review. But a fantastic book. Also there’s a Walker Percy cocktail recipe in this book which will totally get you hammered. I feel like I will end up forgetting most of the really cool facts I encountered in this book, considering all the alcohol involved. It will be a challenge to remember star anise and cacao come from evergreen trees, that agave bloom as infrequently as every thirty years, or that vanilla are orchids that need roots exposed to air (not soil) and require the presence of a special fungus and often live on the limbs of trees a hundred feet off the ground, or that whisky is often dyed with soda or spirit caramel the colour chosen often dictated by the length of aging, or how bourbon must contain at least 51% corn spirit and be aged in new charred oak barrels, or how Nixon almost burnt down the White House by trying to show his daughter how Zhou Enlai lit his mao-tai on fire (at least according to Kissinger, if you can trust a war criminal). I will try to remember that cloves are tiny flower buds, and that hops (belonging to the cannabis family) are native to China, and the earliest records of citrus fruits are from China, and that mint is a weedy plant that can basically grow in sidewalk cracks (I will test this claim in my herb garden this summer). Anyway, this is definitely a book I’ll be keeping around for reference."
