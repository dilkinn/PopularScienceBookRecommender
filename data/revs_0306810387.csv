0,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1421407-janet,5,"I must have taken this out of the library ten times as I was growing up.. My mother loved biography, especially biographies of great women, and recommended this to me as a sixth grader, at a time when the world was saying no to me a lot. Girls couldn't grow up to be jockeys. No you can't take print shop, you don't want to dirty your hands, little lady. Here's cooking and sewing class. Here's Cress Delahanty and Cherry Ames, Student Nurse. The biography of Marie Curie by her daughter Eve was one of my favorites, the story of a great scientist and the first woman to win the Nobel Prize, and she won it twice, once in Physics and once in Chemistry. I learned that exceptional women didn't worry about what people told them they could not do, they used their intelligence and their energy and changed the world. There is a gorgeous illustrated book about the love affair between Pierre and Marie Curie called ""Radioactive"" by Lauren Redniss, for those who become hooked on Curie and her story."
1,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/638605-krista,5,"A rare find. I have a vague memory of salvaging this 1959 Pocket Book edition from my parents' garage sale box 14 years ago; while cleaning out my closet a few weeks ago, I almost tossed it...I’m not sure what made me change my mind and actually start to read the musty pocketbook with browned pages, a broken spine, and too-small print. I’m glad I did; it is, quite simply, an extraordinary story, beautifully written.I’m a little embarrassed to admit that I knew nothing about Marie Curie before reading this book except perhaps the most basic Trivial Pursuit knowledge, vaguely remembered--she and her husband were scientists (right?), I think they may have won the Nobel Prize (right?), something about radioactivity or something...?This book tells the story, from the age of five, of a poor young Polish girl named Marya Sklodovska (better known by her adopted French first name, Marie, and her married name, Curie) who scraped together enough money by working as a governess first to help her elder sister Bronya through medical school in Paris, then to finally join her and continue her own studies, at the Sorbonne. (Women were not permitted to study at the university level in Russian-occupied Poland.)Marya had every intent of returning to her homeland to continue to live and work in solidarity with the fomenting revolution against the Russian oppressors. But, after nearly a year of entreaty and almost against Marya’s will, a man named Pierre Curie--a renowned scientist who had become a close friend and fallen in love with her--persuaded her to stay in Paris to continue her scientific work, to be his partner in science and in marriage (in that order).In the early months of her independent doctoral research studying the radioactive properties of materials containing uranium, Marie observed unexepected behaviors; she soon became convinced of the existence of another, more highly radioactive, substance. Her husband joined her as a much-needed collaborator. The rest is, most certainly, history: the discovery and subsequent isolation of the elements Polonium and Radium, and the discovery that Radium could be used to treat cancer. Astonishingly, although the Curies had struggled for years with meager finances and poor working conditions, they refused to apply for the patent that would have assured them a fortune--because it was not ""in the scientific spirit.""Written by her youngest daughter, Eve (who, incidentally, I discovered, died just a few months ago at the age of 102), the story captures a life of intense passions, intense loves, and intense joys--which were practically inseparable from equally intense sorrows, sacrifices, and suffering. It is the kind of life you have to have extraordinary courage to live out. In the truest sense of the word, Marie Curie expended herself, all of herself."
2,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2580971-smiley,4,"4.50-starI thought I would never finish reading this wonderful biography depicting Mme. Curie's life, work and character as one of the great lady scientists in 20th century and beyond. I think it is a must read one for those interested to know her intimately since it was written objectively and sometimes movingly by her daughter whose account is still readable and inspiring. Reading it off and on due to my ongoing work and stopped at Chapter XVIII APRIL 19, 1906, I resumed reading it last week and finally made it, one of my reading missions completed. I am not sure if we can still find its reprinted editions in bookstores nowadays; however, we can borrow a copy to read from any good public or university library in any city in the world. Moreover, this biography would not disappoint us because there are innumerable, rare balck-and-white photographs related to her life, family and work. I think I would write more when I have time on her as a woman scientist of genius from Poland, the first famous lady scholar I have known and admired since my early teens more than five decades ago.As for her greatness famously awarded by her two Nobel Prizes, first in Physics (shared with her husband) in 1903 and second in Chemistry in 1911, the first lady and still the only one Nobel lady laureate, in the world, who has since been awarded the prestigious two Prizes. Therefore, her biography has sometime reminded me of the quote by William Shakespeare in his Twelfth Night, that is, ''Be not afraid of greatness. Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and others have greatness thrust upon them."" Indeed, I think her success acquired by sheer willingness, love of physics and chemistry as well as academic charisma eventually proved that she has definitely reached unequal supremacy in her two scientific fields of study and research in which few or none could surpass her, a respectfully brilliant lady scientist second to none in the world."
3,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175480-helen-helena-nell,5,"I have read an old copy of this book, not the one in the picture located by GoodReads. It is a Heinemann hardback, originally produced (a translation from the French) in 1938, and reprinted many times until the one in my possession, which is on thin discoloured paper and dated 1947.I knew a little about the legend: the Marie Curie who appeared in passing in a reading book at primary school, and perhaps dimly in a black and white film seen somewhere or other. I read this because (as a small publisher) I'm about to bring out a pamphlet of light-verse poems by Geoff Lander about great scientists, and Marie Curie is one of them.I had no IDEA.Of course she was famous for her astonishing discoveries, and radium forever linked with her name. But she was extraordinary. Extraordinary.She is now my official all-time hero. She loved work. She hated fame. And wealth. And fuss. She was devoted to her children, and family, and students. She feared the boring tedium of formal education and pioneered an inspirational form of home education, for as long as she could get away with it. Her older little girl quickly learned to love physics. I mean love. I mean physics! (Irene was also a Nobel prize winner later.) The younger daughter wrote this biography --and it is a beautifully written, compelling and utterly humbling book. Marie Curie was skilled in five languages. She 'knew by heart thousands of verses - in French, German, Russian, English or Polish'. She loved plants and gardens and swimming and walking and cycling, and (above all) working in a laboratory. The precision of experiments was a joy to her. She lost a great deal and won a great deal. Success was hers. But she didn't want to be an example to other women. She wanted them 'to have a simple family life and some work that will interest them'.She stalwartly resisted the idea that she would accrue wealth from her invaluable discoveries. She turned down as many honours as she accepted. Humanity, she said, 'needs dreamers, for whom the disinterested development of an enterprise is so captivating that it becomes impossible for them to devote their care to their own material profit'.She was absolutely opposed to the cult of personality. For her (as for her husband and co-worker Pierre, who died decades before her) it was all about the work, not the individuals. She silenced one journalist with the remark: 'In science we must be interested in things, not in persons,' and she repeated this statement in a lecture many years later. She had, her daughter says, 'an incurable inaptitude for vanity'. An incurable inaptitude. What could be better?Towards the end of her life, she visited America with her two daughters, where she was much feted. She went because they were to give her much-needed radium for her research work in Paris. She, who so hated fuss, had become an international star. 'The years had taught her that the public, and even the governments, did not know how to be interested in things except through persons. Whether she wished to do so or not, she had to use her prestige to honour and enrich science - to 'dignify' it as the Americans said - and she allowed her own legend to be the agent of propaganda for a cause which was dear to her.'And yet she 'did not succeed in making her pact with fame.'On her travels she witnessed another international star arriving on a station platform in Berlin. It was the famous boxer Dempsey who had been on the same train as herself. The crowd was bustling and shouting waiting to meet him. She took a good look at him:'He looked quite content. After all, is there much difference between acclaiming Dempsey and acclaiming me? It seems to me that the mere fact of acclaiming in this way has in itself something not to be commended, whatever may be the object of the manifestation. I don't see, nevertheless, just how one ought to proceed, nor to what degree it is permissible to confound the person with the idea that person represents ....'I don't see it either. But in the age of personality at all costs, it raises a central issue. Marie Curie would never in a million years have appeared on a chat show. She would have been far too busy."
4,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1100812-shirleen,5,"Marie Curie is someone I greatly admire for her dedication to science, her incredible work ethic, her total disdain for material wealth, her love of her children, her love affair with her husband, her humility in spite of great honors, her dedication to help mankind. Additionally, I loved reading her letters to friends and family members. This book taught me that to excel in an area many times means you have to dedicate much of your life to whatever that interest is - in other words, success comes at great cost in health, time, energy, personal interests, etc. Marie Curie excelled in science because she loved it. She and her beloved physicist husband Pierre Curie, with no complaints, worked in a shed so dilapidated that not even a workman would work in it. It was here that radium was first extracted from pitchblend and the 20th century world was changed forever. This is an amazing biography written by Marie Curie's daughter Eve.Quote from Einstein: ""Marie Curie is of all celebrated beings, the only one who fame has not corrupted""...... "
5,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20609265-jennifer-margulis,5,"Though I love reading memoirs to see how people construct and tell the story of their lives, I realized recently that I have not read many biographies. Looking for a place to start, I saw this biography of Marie Curie listed among the top ten science biographies ever written. That assessment was spot on. This is one of the most interesting books I've ever read. Eve Curie gets so close to her characters and puts us so squarely in Marie Curie's point of view that the book reads like a novel. Marie Curie's life--and the hardships she endured--are fascinating. The book was published three years after her mother's death but I wonder how long it took Eve Curie to write. I can only surmise that she had the idea for a biography of her mother before Marie Curie died as amassing this wealth of information in this book and making it so readable and compelling must have taken longer than three years. Eve's sister Irène won a Nobel Prize. What a tremendously gifted family. I plan to re-read this book in French, the language in which it was originally published."
6,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9707151-ratatoskr,5,"I read a first edition hard copy owned by my mother's mother (who died when my mother was quite young), with her book plate in the front, and at a time when my father is going through chemotherapy, so the experience of reading this book was particularly moving. However, this classic biography stands on its own merits. It's subject is of course marvelous, but I want to praise the writing itself. The book is panegyric, not surprisingly considering it was written by the subject's daughter shortly after Madame Curie's death, but is beautifully written and detailed. It is structured like a opera, in three acts with a perfect balance of aria and recitative, so as never to lose the reader's interest. Each act is given equal weight and has its own well-structured arc. The first act covers Curie's youth in Russian controlled Poland, the second deals with her life in Paris, including the discovery of radium and right up to Pierre Curie's tragic death, and the the third covers her life thereafter, touching on her fascinating work with mobile x-ray units during WWI and her travels, including a visit to the U.S. that is at turns touching and grotesque in a Barnumesque kind of way (grotesque to Curie herself who had a horror of her own celebrity). The set pieces in this biography are wonders and Eve Curie is able to set a scene like nobody's business, conveying interest in the nominally least interesting of events (her description of vacations in Brittany is thoroughly charming) as well as the big moments (the observation of the luminosity of radium and the death of Pierre both left me in tears). If there is a weakness, it is the passing over of sensitive moments and a desire not to criticize. I'd like to have seen something more on the xenophobia Marie Curie faced in the French press and among conservative Catholics and on Marie Curie's scandalous affair with a married colleague after her husband's death. The desire of Eve for greater attention from her mother comes through subtly and poignantly however. I enjoyed this book thoroughly."
7,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8725522-sydney-skala,4,"I really enjoyed this novel. I didn't know who Marie Curie was and this book thoroughly described her. Marie was a very strong and independent character in the novel. I looked up to that greatly. She would do whatever she needed to get her studying done, and studying always came first. Her relationship with Pierre warmed my heart and broke it at the same time. They were so in love but it broke my heart when they couldn't even afford to buy ores to make the radium. Marie was also very passionate about her family and hometown, Poland. She would step up to the plate whenever she needed to and even worked as a nanny so her older sister, Bronya could get an education. Marie Curie not only was she passionate about her family but also with her daughter. She was so motherly and nurturing with her. I admired how dedicated she was for her science studies. Marie would help out everywhere around her. During the WWI, she dedicated helping the wounded people by going to different places with an x ray machine to try to help. I truly enjoyed this book and I would recommend this book to everyone. This book would appeal to everyone not just a specific group. "
8,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20735143-yaaresse,4,"I remember reading this as a kid. It was ancient even then, but I really enjoyed it. My rating reflects my enjoyment only, and is not a comment to the content. It's hardly a reliable narrator who wrote it. "
9,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/716403-ellee,2,"Eve Curie tried hard to depict her mother's life and did a pretty good job of it, but there's just too much hero-worship for my taste in a biography. I like them to be more objective."
10,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63617026-prashanthi-kadambi,5,"I knew the broad outlines of Marie's story, but I wasn't familiar with the finer details. What better way than to read a biography written by her daughter? The book fulfilled its promise by shedding quite a bit of light on the woman who discovered radium and the family which has five Nobel prizes to its credit. The book paints a faithful picture of Marie, right from her childhood to the day she died, with generous extracts from her diaries, letters and other sources.""Humanity needs dreamers, for whom the disinterested development of an enterprise is so captivating that it becomes impossible for them to devote their care to their own material profit.""Marie was one such dreamer-- she was indifferent to fame, wealth and every other materialistic gain the world offered her. She retained her simplicity and humility till the very end. Her work ethic is quite inspiring to me, and it is such a pleasure to see a woman of her fame live her life by the principles she deemed right, without feeling any pressure to conform to society. Would recommend this for anyone looking for a biography of Marie!"
11,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18916088-jenn-schu,5,"This was such a beautiful book. Eve Curie had a wonderful gift of language as depicted in her loving tribute to her mother. Marie and Pierre Curie were remarkable individuals with a respectful relationship of equality. I found them to be inspiring with their humble givings to science, their aptitude and passion for physics, and how they raised their daughters. I found myself awed by Madame Curie's ceaseless energy for caring for her family after losing her husband and continuing with her research in radium and radioactivity. She was such a passionate individual who cared greatly for science, family, and country. Moreover, I revered her modesty, she wasn't vain about her knowledge and she spoke in a matter of fact way without belittling others. One can learn so much about this remarkable woman and find themselves inspired by her strength, determination, and courage. "
12,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/706130-jessica,2,"I have Opinions. None of which reflect on the eventful life of Marie Curie, all of which are related to the expectations of a reader in 2018. Suffice to say: if you are only going to read one book on Marie Curie and her science (I have read a few) choose a different one, for a more full picture of the context and importance of her discoveries as well as a more well-rounded image of Marie herself. Eve, as makes sense for her time and place, wrote a sort of extended eulogy that attempted to make her mother always beautiful and perfect; in the process, she also made her a little boring. A good read perhaps for those who like their heroes perfect, and good for researchers and completists, but a modern reader who just wants an introduction should probably pick something different."
13,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12154857-megan,5,I’m not sure why I waited so long to read this one. Loved it and love Marie Curie’s story!
14,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16767917-sherri,5,"I've always been curious about Marie Curie and her life. She seems to be the sole woman who shows up in lists of historical science greats, and she was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize for her (and her husband's) discovery of radium.This biography is written by her daughter, Eva Curie. It's important to know this because there's a lot of hero-worship (or in this case, mother-worship) in the book. Eva Curie loved her mother and admired her tremendously with very good reason. I'm sure Marie Curie had personal weakness and faults, but you won't hear about them in this book. That was okay with me, though, because the book gives something else: a close and tender view of a great mind and scientist who was also a loving mother and wife.Eva Curie is a good writer, and she held my interest the entire time. I love reading about people like Marie Curie who have so much passion for what they do. To read about her struggles and persistence is inspiring. She battled poverty, political turmoil, gender expectations, health problems, the violent and unexpected death of her husband, a lack of financial and facility support for her important work, and so many other hardships. Any one of these things would have deterred most anyone else, and yet she persisted to the benefit of all the rest of us."
15,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/620387-joanna,5,"What a wonderful tribute to her mother! This biography of Madame Curie, written soon after her death by her youngest daughter, is lively, highly engaging, and a lovely book. The collection of personal letters used to give voice to Madame Curie's personal thoughts combined with all the personal stories that family and friends were willing to share make this extremely readable. I knew little of Madame Curie's personal story and had forgotten that her husband died so early in their lives (and with such tragedy). I have no idea if this book has much to add to general knowledge of the scientists, but I found it both enlightening and heartwarming. Highly recommended for readers of biographies."
16,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26891512-maria-zarpellon,5,"It took me twenty years to find a copy of this book which my school teacher recommended to me when I was about twelve. In this intimate and delicate portrait of a mother by her daughter, Marie Curie's unordinary determination and intense dedication to science (until her very last days) are even more remarkable than her brilliance and sharp mind. Her story demonstrates that passion is crucial to success. Easily one of the most inspiring books I have ever read. I wish I had read it before!"
17,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45664009-raz,5,"This biography was written by Marie Curie's youngest daughter Eve, and it's a sentimental description of an incredible human being and the rare love that Marie shared with her husband Pierre. To be honest, my entire library of knowledge about Marie Curie prior to reading this book was that she discovered radiation and that she died of cancer from studying it. I never really grasped the enormity of what Marie Curie's work has meant to the world or the amazing life that she lived until I read this biography. In addition I feel like we're very fortunate that it was Eve who chronicled Marie's life, because first and foremost we learn what an amazing person Marie Curie was; when you see her struggles and achievements through that lens it has more meaning than if it were just a dry recital of facts.I almost gave this book 4 stars rather than 5 because there are a very few instances where Eve breaks her voice as narrator to throw in her personal view and it's kind of jarring or cringey at times but even with that taken into consideration this is a heartfelt and important book and I'm glad I got the opportunity to read Marie's story. "
18,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66763231-mihaela-froehlich,5,"Loved every single page of this book. At times, I could identify with Marie, at time with her father and at time with her daughter. The book has painted a life of a scientist through eyes of those who knew her and aboundance of letters and papers she and those who were in her circle left behind. She was made real in this book. I have read some comments to the contrary but I think that dissonance comes from understanding the culture and time she comes from. She needs to be looked through the lense of that and not from the place of comfortable safe living in 2018. "
19,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87618348-mar-a-jos,5,What a wonderful book and such a extraordinary woman!
20,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5222600-rhonda-elkins,5,"I've always known about Madame Curie to a small extent, a great scientist, the discoverer of Radium, but the other day I happened upon the old 1940s movie with Greer Garson titled ""Madame Curie"" and I watched it. I noticed before it began that it was based on the book written by her daughter Eve in the 1930s. I loved the movie and was so moved by this woman's life, that I just had to read that book, so I immediately ordered it.This is one of, if not THE best biographies I've ever read, and I've read many. It not only told about the scientist, it also told about her personal life. I was absolutely fascinated that from her beginnings of being born and raised in Russian oppressed Poland, daughter of two intellectuals that were nonetheless forced into menial teaching jobs, they were poor, the Polish people were not allowed to learn their history or speak their language. Even so, her parents made sure that she and her siblings received a high level of education by actually sneaking around to do so, in hiding. Her eldest sister wanted to be a doctor, women could not go to a university in Poland, teen aged Marie worked as a governess and helped her sister go to France to medical school. After she graduated, Marie went to France to the famous university there.From these meager beginnings, she continued to endure hardships, fainting from lack of food, living in poor conditions, but she continued on. She met and married her husband, also a scientist, who lo and behold, respected her and encouraged her and admired her for her gift of intelligence and endurance. They had a wonderful life and loved each other greatly. However, tragedy stuck and she was left alone to raise her small children. But she did and she was amazingly a good mother all the while being a great scientist. She was the first woman to win a Nobel prize and the only person at that time to win 2 Nobel Prizes, one in Physics, one in chemistry. She received her Phd.In WW1 she unselfishly put her lab work on hold and contributed to the war effort by putting together the first portable x-ray machines carried by car and also installed many x-ray machines in hundreds of hospitals, and worked with them in the field. She often drove herself with these machines to the battle fronts. She did this for 4 years.I took away from this biography a great respect and admiration for this woman of genius, who never gave up at and accomplished so very much in a time where women hardly ever even went to college. It just amazes me. Another amazing thing is, she could have been a wealthy woman after the discovery of Radium if she had only put a patent on it. But she refused to do this because she said that was not in the scientific spirit. She always avoided wealth and was really uncomfortable receiving so much overwhelming fame. She never did what she did for fame, she only wanted, more than anything since she was a child, to be some good to the world. And she did.My most admired person in history. This book was not dry in the least. It was written so well and flowed like a novel. I was interested in it from the first word, to the last sentence when I cried. Her daughter Eve was amazing at giving a personal, and factual biography of her mother who she admired and loved so much. The book was written from going over letters to and from Madame Curie to many people, memories of people that knew her, her lectures, her speeches,and her memories (Eve and her other daughter Irene). Nothing was fictionalized or made more than what is was, it showed this great lady in a very human light. It had enough personal parts in it and just enough scientific subject in it to make it interesting to anyone.What a great woman, what a great story. I will read no other books on her, this is the most perfect book that could have been written about her. Who could have known her any better than her own daughter? What an inspiration!"
21,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2212378-tamhack,4,"This book was surprising to read just because I knew who Marie Curie was, that she discovered Radium and her work with it. But I didn't know her as a person. Her love and devotion to her husband, Pierre Curie, who they worked side by side. Her as a mother. How humble she was and devoted to her work as a pure scientist. Working for scientist for science sake. She won 2 Noble Prizes and was a director a lab and had positions and honors that women in a man's world was unheard of. She was very passionate about her work, her home country (Poland) and her family. She was self-sacrificing- she worked as a nanny to give her older sister, Bronya who she was very close to, a chance to gain an education.From a young age she was gifted with a mind to memorize and learn and was very focused.She went about her life with humility, quietly working, without complaint. ""She was proud but she was not resigned.""""Her brain was so precise, her intelligence who marvelously clear, that no ""Slavic"" disorder intruded to corrupt her effort. She was supported by her will of iron, by a maniacal fast for perfection, and by an incredible stubbornness. Systematically, patiently, she attained each of the ends she set for herself: she passed first in the master's examination in physics in 1893 and sec on in the master's in mathematics in 1894."" She decided to learn the French language perfectly...Of Pierre Curie: They had ..."" one of the finest bonds that ever united man and woman. Tow hearts beat together, two bodies were united, and two minds of genius learned to think together. Marie could have married no other than this great physicist, than this wise and noble man. Pierre could have married no woman other than the fair, tender Polish girl, who could be childish or transcendent within the same few moments; for she was a friend and a wife, a lover and a a scientist.:"" Pierre's existence tended toward one ideal only: to engage in scientific research at the side of the beloved woman who also lived for scientific research. Marie's was a harder life, because to the obsession of work was added the humble and tiring tasks of womankind (As I can fully empathize with Marie, as I had to stop this and run down to prepare a meal for the family. Yes, the woman always has 4 times the work and burdens as a men--but Marie was a good example of how to deal with this--she did it uncomplainingly and tried to perfect her duties as wife and mother.). She could no longer neglect material life, as she had done in the austere and careless days of her study at the Sorbonne; and her first purchase on their return from the holiday was a black account book with the great word EXPENSES printed in letters of gold on its cover.""She was a devoted mother: "" Marie was soon obliged to give up nursing on doctors orders--gut morning, noon, evening and night she changed, bathed, and dressed her daughter."""" She had no unmeasured generosities and no whims...""During the WWI, she dedicated helping the wounded by going from place to place with a primative x-ray machine (Roentgen apparatus)."" She was never to speak of the hardships and dangers to which she exposed herself during these four years. She spoke neither of her unfathomable fatigues, nor the risk of death, nor of the cruel effect of X rays and radium upon her damaged organism. She showed her working companions a careless and even gay face--gayer than it had ever been. The war was to tech her that good humor which is the finest mask of courage.""She triumphed over cataracts."
22,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54105618-antaya,4,"This biography was a load of information straight to my head. This book was recommended to me by the school librarian. I would recommend this to those that love science, and want to learn more about an iconic woman who helped shape the world of science."
23,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12181320-spinster,4,"I recently watched a documentary on Marie Curie and remembered I'd bought an old biography on a whim - what's a few cents when it might be an interesting book about someone I know very little of, other than the part of Marie Curie being a famous Nobel winning scientist who died as a result of her work. So far many of my book purchases remain seated on the shelf, waiting to be read, but now I had the motivation to pick up Curie's biography and see beyond the details grazed in the documentary.Biographies written by family members have always made me a little wary. They obviously have more insight to the subject's true self, their private personality, their soul, so to speak. They usually also care about the subject and their life more than an outsider and might feel the need to censor things to protect the subject, their reputation or other close people. Their views of events might also be blurred by love and affection and thereby get facts slightly altered.In some cases it can be a positive thing and I think it worked well in Madame Curie. Some (embarrassing) things I remembered from the documentary were barely hinted at in a couple of sentences, but I doubt Marie Curie would have wanted her biography disgraced by gossip anyways. Eve Curie writes beautifully about her mother, but sometimes it felt like she was going just a little too over the top with her praises. It was clearly difficult for her to juggle between the roles of a daughter and an author but she did fine most of the time. I feel like I really got to know Marie Curie better, a woman who revealed very little of herself in public. Also, apparently, in private.I don't know if it was the translation (from ~1938) or what, but I was infinitely amused by some tiny little details translated funny. Philadelphia became Filadelfia which i guess makes sense, but Grand Canyon becoming Grand cañon really doesn't. We have no 'ñ' in Finnish and I have no idea where that came from. Unless it was originally in the French text. Which makes little sense as well, to be honest. Still, hihgly amusing, as were the odd forgotten translations from old words. It's amazing how fast language evolves!I'm very glad I stumbled upon the book when I did, that I bought it and that I finally read it. I have so much more respect for Madame Curie now, not just as a scientist and a brilliant mind but as a multitasking workaholic. A recommendable read but probably hard to find these days."

She dedicated herself to education and science. She shared her knowledge of different languages with others. Her husband, Pierre, and herself were able to share their love of one another and of science with the world. Marie endured the loss of Pierre and continue to remain devoted to accomplishing their dreams. She always carried him in her heart until her death. Fame and fortune was not important to her or her husband. Science and the improvement of humanity was their focus. I enjoyed reading this beautifully written biography by Eve Curie. Marie Curie was a person and her personality was unique. She overcame many obstacles and encouraged women to contribute to science. I am inspired to not put limitations on myself based on the views of society. Women are able to contribute to the world as wives, mothers, daughters, and experts in the chosen field. I will not forget how human we all are."

The book was written using a combination of the in-person accounts of her youngest daughter, Eve, (the author), friends, family, fellow scientists, and the actual writings of Marie Curie. An intimate account of an extraordinary life that contributed discoveries that have had a great impact ever since her devotion to work in the laboratory and teaching in the classroom was initially commenced as a young woman."

I passed my afternoon after afternoons with this book in the library for 2 months. This is one of the best books I have ever read. I would love to say this is a must-read for women in STEM. It inspires me a lot in all steps of my Engineering. I loved the childhood part of the book most. This book taught me a woman should not be guided by the social norms and prejudices about her but by her own determination and intelligence. Thanks to Eve Curie for letting us know about this wonderful woman. For me, she is the superwoman in real world."

It helped me to better ask some questions related to femininity and doing good in the world. Marie Palmer"
28,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9321372-paulomonic,4,"A pleasurable read, but with too much romance and glamour, which Marie Curie's personna does not need.

41,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8266629-erich,5,"Once again, one of the great historical moments of scientific discovery (radiation) is achieved against enormous odds, and accompanied by as much apathy, jealousy and intellectual intransigence among scientists and intellectuals as is generally found in the rest of the population. I am not a global-warming naysayer, but Michael Crichton was making very good points about the scientific establishment. And we now know from the science of psychology why it is that intellectuals are typically just as close-minded as the rest of us. The Manifest of the 93, the widespread support for eugenics - both are of her time.Einstein, who Marie also was to become friends with, once famously said that there were all of 3 people in the world who knew how to think. (My late voice teacher also knew Einstein, and confirmed that he told filthy jokes...).In this case, the lack of support for her work was also influenced by the fact that she was Polish, and a woman, notwithstanding Pierre's partnership with her. Marie and her French husband did their work on a scientific university campus - in a literal shack without heat - and this continued well after they won the Nobel Prize. Crichton would also have approved - and probably knew - of the Curies' decision not to claim any material benefits from patenting any part of their discovery, even though that meant their continued research remained highly under-funded for years. They simply believed that the elements of nature belonged to the whole human race, and that it would be a mistake to set any precedent otherwise. This was one of Crichton's most urgent last wishes - that the laws of governments be changed to forbid patenting anything found in nature. It was a theme in his last novel ""Next"", which I've long suspected was an unstated inspiration behind the latest reboot of the ""Planet of the Apes"" films.As it happened, I was simultaneously reading Hanya Yanagihara's ""A Little Life"" - @alittlelifebook - which is very much about a man's limited success in overcoming the aftereffects of a truly horrendous childhood. Marie's life was a good psychological counterpoint for my own sanity. She encountered extremely difficult obstacles just trying to get educated as well as all the early years of research and much of her life after Pierre's early death. But she succeeded - as a human being as well as a scientist, and while the average person knows as much as I did before reading the book - that she discovered radiation, and that she ""worked herself to death"", both statements fairly true - she did in fact live quite a long life for the time.Eve does not shy away from describing her other's flaws, weaknesses, shortcomings as a mother even - she presents a fully realized human being. But it is overall a highly admirable one, and I certainly found that refreshing..Deep into her story, around the time Marie passes her fiftieth year, Eve steps back from her narrative to speak directly to that point:- Well, yes. ""Sympathetic characters"" abound in this story. It is not my fault: they existed.... Marie's companions...would furnish very poor subjects for analysis to our novelists with their liking for dark colors. Strange, abnormal families, these Sklodovskis and Curies, in which parents and children did not hate each other, in which human beings were guided by tenderness, in which nobody listened at doors or dreamed of treacheries and inheritances, in which nobody murdered anybody! - in which everybody was, in fact, perfectly honest! A last thought that speaks so poignantly to our times - Marie truly detested the trappings of her fame, regarded it as a great burden, largely but not solely because it took her away from her time for further research. She did eventually come to a certain rapprochement with it, learning only after a good number of years to wield some the power of her popularity to benefit the causes she believed in - scientific research, the providing of adequate medical equipment and resources to #fightcancer with her new discovery, education particularly of girls, and of the lower classes.The book is a great joy to read for this and many other stories and reasons. It is written in a style that is as open and frank as it is outdated in style and turns of phrase (and has been translated into dozens of languages - I read the English one by Vincent Sheean, a now forgotten but once highly regarded intellectual himself) - and that is all part of its refreshing charm. It ought to be a staple in #WomensHistory and #ScienceHistory collections @WomensHistory -it's also a great companion to Alcott's and Hugo's classics.It is for anyone who loves a great story of overcoming great odds, of travel to foreign places, of the thrill of intellectual discovery, of the evidence of what can be accomplished in a big life by a little woman."
42,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90419058-kaitlyn,5,"I broke the most ardent rules of book buying and purchased this book mostly for the aesthetic nature of the cover photo. A simple picture of a strikingly focused woman gazing into a glass beaker surrounded by a plethora of Scientific equipment remnant of the 1920s. Madame Curie. I, myself, a woman who has always been filled with a childhood spirit for the sciences and been drawn by its most basic element, discovery. With that in mind, Madame Curie has always been the perfect thematic heroine to my childhood, and a more proper second reason for purchasing this now cherished book.This book is monumental at capturing the authentic life of Ms Curie. It goes beyond our common 7th grade lecture notes , who was the first female Nobel prize winner? This biography delves much deeper than that and into the soul of the genius. From her upbringing in the oppressed lands of Poland where she was first to begin to show a gift for brilliance, to her adolescents where her selfless nature exhibited itself to its highest peak as she bequest her chance at college to her elder sister whom she deemed only fair to get the chance first. Later it discusses in details her at last arrival to the university and her undying commitment to learn and master every point of physics with an almost obsessive compulsion.In the middle of this book or might I say in life’s journey we find ourselves are caught up in the love story of her finding her dear Pierre Currie who by all accounts more so found her and considered Mrs Curie to be his life’s completion. Curie’s together, we find friendship, companionships, discovery, dedication, and remarkable love. For chapters on end we are breathless at the purity of the relationship, at the building of a family full of life, love and brilliance. The successful scientist now nurturing mother, took motherhood seriously and cherished it greatly with pages and pages of loving letters to her daughters. A picturesque scene is formed of a family of four, mother, father and daughters. But with like many grand love stories we are left in tears at its sudden tragic end. Chapters that tore at my very soul.For some this would be the end of genius’s journey, but for Madame Curie, to end her life in science would be more or less to end her life’s meaning, to end her spirit. We walk with her still with pages and pages of research, dedication, successes, awards, accolades, her war efforts, healths demise, and so on. The book is marvelous from beginning to end, filled to the brim of personal letters that convey Madame Curies inner most thoughts. I’m left feeling I lived a lifetime, vibrantly and passionately in the course of just 385 pages. Pages brought to life even more so with the knowledge that they are the writings of Ms Curies very own daughter, Eve Curie. Precious stories gathered together by her greatest admirer and shared with the world so that they can come to truly know the timid lady who poured her soul into the laboratory. One of the worlds greatest minds, who has changed the face of medicine, physics, and chemistry forever with the discovery of Radium and radioactivity. A discovery that would ultimately and almost poetically claim her victim at life’s end. This book will be read and re-read and left suffering on my bookshelf for years to come as it’s pages become worn and binding fragile. And I look forward to the day I can pass it on to my now 6 year old daughter who shares the same innate spirit, a spirit forever in aw of the sciences. "

Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.”― Marie Curie, Madame Curie by Eve CurieSo, I still have the need to talk about Madame Curie before I move on in life because this book was so dear to me. This book is the best biography of Marie Curie, narrated by her own daughter, with lots of letters exchanged. And the fact that Eve Curie was a writer made this book a memorable reading indeed. Not only it portrayed the life of a genius scientist, but also a love story between her and her husband. And a story of a single mother. Born Marya Skłodowska in Tsarist Poland, her life had always been difficult. She lost her mother and a sister since she was very young. The family of 4, father, her older sister, herself and her brother tried to keep life above poverty. At age 17, Marie had to work as a governess, started saving for her dream education and split the rest to help her older sister who was to pursue the Sorbonne.When Marie got accepted to the Sorbonne, she took 3 days train ride to Paris. Lived alone in a tiny room, no heater, not enough money to buy food, she kept studying in that frozen room. To me, Marie Curie wasn't born a genius, but being naturally curious, love of study, have a deep passion for physics and consistency of grit in the face of adversity actually made whom she became. All day long she would study, buried herself in Physics, slept very little, and starved. She wrote to her brother:“Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that? We must have perseverance and above all confidence in ourselves. We must believe that we are gifted for something and that this thing must be attained.”Because this book contained mostly the letters, it really illustrated the true grit from Marie's own words. And also revealed her personality–a vulnerable person.""My life is upset in such a way that it will never be put right again. I think it will always be like this, and I shall not try to live otherwise""Mindfulness living, a letter to her two daughters:✎""My dear children, I send you my best wishes for a happy New Year–that is to say, a year of good health, good humor, and good work, a year in which you will have pleasure in living every day, without waiting for days to be gone before finding charm in them, and without putting all hope of pleasure in the days to come""✎This is only the tiny part from this book and I felt so lucky to have read it. It is emotional reading and enormously inspiring. I can see myself rereading it again. The first reading of my 2019 reading goal, My Year of Reading the Women Pioneers, was already phenomenal, I can not wait to start my second one :)Hope you'll find the opportunity to read Madame Curie. I can't recommend this book highly enough. "
44,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/288297-the-library-lady,5,"I am giving this book 5 stars because it is amazing on so many levels.This is the book that sparked my interest in Marie Curie--and since physics was a torture class for me in high school, that was pretty amazing in itself! But I must have read it around that time, my mother had a paperback copy on her bookshelves, and I wore it out re-reading it.Decades later, I am reading it in a whole new way and I am blown away by it. Eve Curie, Marie's daughter, finished this book only 3 years after her mother's death, and it could have been a sugar dripping, mother glorifying, plastic superwoman story. But it is not.Eve Curie was the only member of the Curie family to NOT become a scientist, but her writing combines scientific analysis with fluid storytelling as she recounts her mother's life. She sees Marie as she was, a very human woman whose life was driven by her brilliant scientific mind. Pierre Curie was her perfect partner, both as a spouse and as a scientist she could share her work with, and his loss impacted the rest of her life. Curie does not say that she and her sister were neglected, and indeed they were not, but she shows Marie's failings and virtues as a mother, not in a ""Mommie Dearest"" way, but in the way of a loving daughter. She gives us Marie at work, but she also gives us Marie at play by the sea, in a lovely chapter that shows the Curie women did have their chances to be happy and together.The one bit of whitewash here is Eve's near silence on Marie's ill fated romance with fellow scientist Paul Langevin. Only a few paragraphs on a single page, and his name is not mentioned:A scientist, devoted to her work, whose life was dignified, reserved and in recent years especially pitiable, was accused of breaking up homes and of dishonoring the name she bore with too much brilliance.You can read what actually happened here  It's not surprising that Curie chooses not to write about that sad episode, and aside from that she tries to give a full picture of her mother as a human being and succeeds.One more note: I didn't know much about Eve Curie beyond this, but she is worthy of a book of her own--perhaps even a novel. She became a pianist, a journalist, a member of the Free French Forces, and the wife of the first Executive Director of UNICEF. She herself was known at the ""First Lady of UNICEF,"" and worked actively with her husband. Unlike her parents and sister, Eve never won a Nobel prize, but her husband won the Nobel Peace Prize! Both Marie and Eve's sister Irene succumbed to radiation related illnesses, but Eve did not. In fact, she lived to be 102. A life well lived, and this book alone would have made it such."
45,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69521493-richard,3,"Madame Curie is a biography of the scientist Marie Sklodowska-Curie by the subject's daughter Eve Curie. She is the daughter who didn't win the Nobel prize. Her mother won two, and her sister won one. The biography is cradle to grave but is really split into three roughly equal sections, her life in Poland, her studies and discovery of radium along with her marriage to Pierre Curie, then her later life of largely unwanted fame.The book is florid in style and you get absolutely no idea of Sklodowska-Curie as a person at all. Indeed, from the biography she appears completely inscrutable. The book is almost the definition of hagiographic and so her motives are entirely opaque. The book puts forwards her life of physically ruinous hard work as coming from some combination of love of country (both Poland and France, the latter of which's academy treated her rather shabbily) and love of science. Not a bad word is written about either of the writer's parents and there is only warmth towards the subjects from the author, they are said to live a life of love and devotion. However, and I understand that it was the style in older pictures to look more serious, when you see them in the old photographs they look absolutely miserable. Eve Curie goes at great lengths to talk about the beauty of her mother, and indeed this sort of devotion and intelligence and tenacity has a kind of beauty, but she means physically so. There is also very little scientific explanation in the book. The discovery of radium, polonium, and actinium, and the great advances made in understanding radioactivity and what this meant in a broader scientific context is not explored at all. This may be due to the fact that the book was written in 1938 and a modern work would be more instructive here.Overall, the book presents a subject who is entirely admirable and inspirational to anyone (Marie's time in the shed trying to discover truth in a squalid environment reminds me of Newton in his own) but you sometimes get the feeling that there is a major facet of her life that is missing and that you are looking at a less than complete portrait of the great scientist."

A life full of commitment and hard work to discover the nature and the edges of scientific knowledge.Must-read biography from her daughter Eve Curie and inspiration to all.“For the admirable gift of himself, and for the magnificent service he renders humanity, what reward does our society offer the scientist? Have these servants of an idea the necessary means of work? Have they an assured existence, sheltered from care? The example of Pierre Curiee, and of others, shows that they have none of these things; and that more often, before they can secure possible working conditions, they have to exhaust their youth and their powers in daily anxieties. Our society, in which reigns an eager desire for riches and luxury, does not understand the value of science. It does not realize that science is a most precious part of its moral patrimony. Nor does it take sufficient cognizance of the fact that science is at the base of all the progress that lightens the burden of life and lessens its suffering. Neither public powers nor private generosity actually accord to science and to scientists the support and the subsidies indispensable to fully effective work.” Rest in peace, Madame Curie."
47,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5827579-librarianka,5,"I am enchanted by this biography of Marie Curie written by her daughter. It is a lovely Polish translation published to commemorate the one hundred anniversary of Marie's birth. I love a slightly anachronistic style of writing corresponding to the times. The book is written so lovingly one might think it is not objective at all, however a lot can be read between the lines. Eve Curie quotes extensively from Marie's letters and notes providing us with the voice of her mother as well as enchanting details from her private life. I enjoyed for example reading about Marie and her daughters' vacation spent in a small village in Brittany called Larcouest in the company of the greatest scientific minds as humble vacationers living as slowly and as simple as possible.The last chapter describes heartbreaking last moments of Marie Curie who died so prematurely still full of plans for the future.I ended up being so completely moved by the dedication to their scientific work, by the passion they shared and the idealism that guided Marie Curie and Pierre Curie throughout their life."

But I finally finished and even though I didn't LOVE it I am still glad I pushed through.Marie Curie certainly was an amazing woman and I learned a lot about her in this book. Since I am a physicist myself (or I am going to be), and a woman, I really believe that this book was a must-read for me.It's not written in a particularly engaging way and even though it is written by her own daughter it feels strangely distant at times. But perhaps that is only fitting for a logical and rational mind like Marie Curie's.So if you have any connection to Science or Poland or Feminism or Cancer Therapy or any other topic that is in relation to Marie Curie, or you are generally interested in her life, I definitely recommend this book, but go in knowing that it can be a bit ... not boring, but also not very captivating, at times."
49,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72517838-tina-marga,5,"I read this book in Dutch, but it had a blue hard-cover. The whole life story of Marie is beautifully written by Marie's daughter Eve in old Dutch-translated language. The detailed descriptions of the situation in Poland around the end of the 19th century under Soviet regime and Paris in the beginning of the 20th century. About a wonderful woman who sacrificed herself for physical, mathematical and chemistry science. It is funny to read that this lady learned everything about radium while she did not know how to cook herself a meal. It is far less funny to read how she and her husband, both highly-qualified and naturally driven, had to fight for having a laboratory in Paris; just a place to do their experiments. And how friends wrote them letters, expressing their sincere concerns about Marie's physical condition and too-seriousness. It is all passion for wild nature and science. Purity pur sang. "

Part 2 tells us about Marie's life in France. Part 3 speaks about Marie's life after the death of Pierre Curie. This book consists of many letters which were written or received by Marie Curie. Marie Curie wrote many letters to Pierre, Eve, Irene, Henrietta, Bronya etc. This book also has many photographs in it. There is some French in this book. So Maria Sklodowska was born in Warsaw, Poland. She was born in the Sklodowska family. Her parents were teachers. She had three elder sisters and an elder brother. Her siblings were Bronya, Joseph, Helena and Zofia. Zofia died at an early age. Also Maria's mother died. Maria was a very bright student at school. She knew five languages, namely: French, English, German, Russian and Polish. She loved her motherland. Joseph grew up to pursue medicine. Maria finished her high school and she received a gold medal for achieving the first mark. Maria and Bronya made a decision that Maria would work as a governess and earn money for Bronya to study medicine and in turn Bronya would complete her studies and work as a doctor to earn money for Maria's studies. So Maria worked as a governess while Bronya went to Paris, France. Bronya studied medicine at the Sorbonne. Maria fell in love with the eldest son of her employer while she worked as a governess in their house. But the parents refused to accept Maria as a daughter-in-law due to her poverty. Bronya became a gynaecologist. She married a doctor in Paris. Joseph got married. Maria changed her name to Marie because she was now in Paris. She started her studies in Paris. She studied Physics and Mathematics. She fell in love with Pierre Curie. Pierre and Marie got married. They worked together in a shed. After four years of intense research and isolation, they were able to discover Radium and Polonium. Marie named one of the elements as Polonium in honour of her motherland, Poland. Pierre and Marie received the Nobel prize for Physics. Pierre and Marie had two children: Irene and Eve. Pierre died in an accident. Marie felt very lonely, isolated, alone and solitary for sometime. But then she continued her research with indomitable courage. She became very famous. She received the Nobel prize for Chemistry. She started teaching Physics at the Sorbonne. Radium was used to cure cancer and this technique was named as Curietherapy. Irene studied Physics and she became Marie's assistant. Irene married Frederic Joliot. Eve studied music. Irene became a physicist. Eve became a writer. Marie built the Radium institute at Paris, France. She also built the Radium institute at Warsaw, Poland. Marie actively took part in the war by curing patients with Curietherapy. Marie spent her holidays at Larcouëst. She spent holidays with her close friends and her daughters. Irene and Frederic gave birth to a daughter. Marie went to America to receive a gram of radium. She was welcomed warmly by the Americans. Marie never liked fame. Marie's eyes became weak. She could no longer see properly. Also her ears were giving her some problem. Radium had damaged her body, she had stones in her gallbladder​. Also there was some problem in her lungs and in her blood. She eventually died. She had written a book named Radioactivity which was published posthumously​."

But this book encourages me as a woman and as a non-scientist to learn about physics and chemistry. In this book the sciences are adventurous fields that have great, and hopefully good, implications for everyone, and that can still be upended excitingly by new discoveries. That said, the book is clear about the health, personal and financial costs that Marie and Pierre Curie paid for everything they achieved and were honoured for."

If you haven't read this book, but are interested in science, history or outstanding people, start reading it.One think I must note: since the book was written by her daughter, some parts of her life are not really written about, as she probably didn't want to believe some rumours or wanted to save her mother's reputation, but I don't think those rumours make her less valuable, they just show that she was a person too. I've read many biographies about her, and though others may be more open about some things, this is far the best showing her as a person by someone who knew her the most."

The book written by Madame Curie's daughter comprises of many letters (few are still radioactive to date) from Madame Curie, gives insights into how devoted to science and family the Madame Curie was. The hardships that Madame faced along with her beloved, Pierre to break through the stigma in the early 1900's. It's really an honor to be able to access the life of the legend and relive the discoveries through a roller-coaster."

My dad picked this up at a thrift store somewhere and after he read it, he urged me to read it as well, and so I did. I’m far from intelligent but I thought this was a great book about a great woman and so anyone who’s considering reading this, I strongly recommend this. This reminded me a lot of The Agony and the Ecstasy by Irving Stone, a biography about Michelangelo Buonarroti (might not be spelt correctly whoops) which was also I great read, and now stands as the favorite book I ever read. This book comes very close to that. :)"
55,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2099235-s,3,"Good biography. Madame Curie should be required reading for grade school children as it is, not in some simplified version. It shows how a woman overcame many obstacles in her life to reach the highest achievements in the scientific world which was dominated by men at the time. My only criticism is that the writing style of the author, who also happens to be the daughter of Madame Curie, is a kind of hero worship. It was not the more objective style which I have grown accustomed to for biographical works like this. "

Role model among role model. Eve Curie explained in such rich details, what most scientific articles lack, the severity and love for truth and knowledge. I just finished reading this, while my heart is appropriately humbled, my mind is emboldened with courage. Every scientist, everyone should read this book to learn of a determined life."

It is expected that the daughter would revere such a figure. In most cases, the beauty of a biography is in showing the positives traits of the person, as well as the negatives. Eve Curie painted a picture of an infallible person, depriving us as readers from knowing the actual woman Madam curie was."

Manya's personal struggles and successes are equally as remarkable as her scientific achievements. She believed each of us should strive to develop our full potential so that we may fulfill our greater duty to humanity. And while she set numerous firsts for women, let's remember that she remains the only human to ever earn the Nobel Prize in two scientific fields."

The book is written by her daughter and has quite a lot of hero worship. Marie is talked about in entirely positive ways. However, if her daughter felt so worshipful about her, she may really have been that wonderful. Worth the read, but I may have not felt this way if it was not the abridged version!"

71,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8266629-erich,5,"Once again, one of the great historical moments of scientific discovery (radiation) is achieved against enormous odds, and accompanied by as much apathy, jealousy and intellectual intransigence among scientists and intellectuals as is generally found in the rest of the population. I am not a global-warming naysayer, but Michael Crichton was making very good points about the scientific establishment. And we now know from the science of psychology why it is that intellectuals are typically just as close-minded as the rest of us. The Manifest of the 93, the widespread support for eugenics - both are of her time.Einstein, who Marie also was to become friends with, once famously said that there were all of 3 people in the world who knew how to think. (My late voice teacher also knew Einstein, and confirmed that he told filthy jokes...).In this case, the lack of support for her work was also influenced by the fact that she was Polish, and a woman, notwithstanding Pierre's partnership with her. Marie and her French husband did their work on a scientific university campus - in a literal shack without heat - and this continued well after they won the Nobel Prize. Crichton would also have approved - and probably knew - of the Curies' decision not to claim any material benefits from patenting any part of their discovery, even though that meant their continued research remained highly under-funded for years. They simply believed that the elements of nature belonged to the whole human race, and that it would be a mistake to set any precedent otherwise. This was one of Crichton's most urgent last wishes - that the laws of governments be changed to forbid patenting anything found in nature. It was a theme in his last novel ""Next"", which I've long suspected was an unstated inspiration behind the latest reboot of the ""Planet of the Apes"" films.As it happened, I was simultaneously reading Hanya Yanagihara's ""A Little Life"" - @alittlelifebook - which is very much about a man's limited success in overcoming the aftereffects of a truly horrendous childhood. Marie's life was a good psychological counterpoint for my own sanity. She encountered extremely difficult obstacles just trying to get educated as well as all the early years of research and much of her life after Pierre's early death. But she succeeded - as a human being as well as a scientist, and while the average person knows as much as I did before reading the book - that she discovered radiation, and that she ""worked herself to death"", both statements fairly true - she did in fact live quite a long life for the time.Eve does not shy away from describing her other's flaws, weaknesses, shortcomings as a mother even - she presents a fully realized human being. But it is overall a highly admirable one, and I certainly found that refreshing..Deep into her story, around the time Marie passes her fiftieth year, Eve steps back from her narrative to speak directly to that point:- Well, yes. ""Sympathetic characters"" abound in this story. It is not my fault: they existed.... Marie's companions...would furnish very poor subjects for analysis to our novelists with their liking for dark colors. Strange, abnormal families, these Sklodovskis and Curies, in which parents and children did not hate each other, in which human beings were guided by tenderness, in which nobody listened at doors or dreamed of treacheries and inheritances, in which nobody murdered anybody! - in which everybody was, in fact, perfectly honest! A last thought that speaks so poignantly to our times - Marie truly detested the trappings of her fame, regarded it as a great burden, largely but not solely because it took her away from her time for further research. She did eventually come to a certain rapprochement with it, learning only after a good number of years to wield some the power of her popularity to benefit the causes she believed in - scientific research, the providing of adequate medical equipment and resources to #fightcancer with her new discovery, education particularly of girls, and of the lower classes.The book is a great joy to read for this and many other stories and reasons. It is written in a style that is as open and frank as it is outdated in style and turns of phrase (and has been translated into dozens of languages - I read the English one by Vincent Sheean, a now forgotten but once highly regarded intellectual himself) - and that is all part of its refreshing charm. It ought to be a staple in #WomensHistory and #ScienceHistory collections @WomensHistory -it's also a great companion to Alcott's and Hugo's classics.It is for anyone who loves a great story of overcoming great odds, of travel to foreign places, of the thrill of intellectual discovery, of the evidence of what can be accomplished in a big life by a little woman."
72,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90419058-kaitlyn,5,"I broke the most ardent rules of book buying and purchased this book mostly for the aesthetic nature of the cover photo. A simple picture of a strikingly focused woman gazing into a glass beaker surrounded by a plethora of Scientific equipment remnant of the 1920s. Madame Curie. I, myself, a woman who has always been filled with a childhood spirit for the sciences and been drawn by its most basic element, discovery. With that in mind, Madame Curie has always been the perfect thematic heroine to my childhood, and a more proper second reason for purchasing this now cherished book.This book is monumental at capturing the authentic life of Ms Curie. It goes beyond our common 7th grade lecture notes , who was the first female Nobel prize winner? This biography delves much deeper than that and into the soul of the genius. From her upbringing in the oppressed lands of Poland where she was first to begin to show a gift for brilliance, to her adolescents where her selfless nature exhibited itself to its highest peak as she bequest her chance at college to her elder sister whom she deemed only fair to get the chance first. Later it discusses in details her at last arrival to the university and her undying commitment to learn and master every point of physics with an almost obsessive compulsion.In the middle of this book or might I say in life’s journey we find ourselves are caught up in the love story of her finding her dear Pierre Currie who by all accounts more so found her and considered Mrs Curie to be his life’s completion. Curie’s together, we find friendship, companionships, discovery, dedication, and remarkable love. For chapters on end we are breathless at the purity of the relationship, at the building of a family full of life, love and brilliance. The successful scientist now nurturing mother, took motherhood seriously and cherished it greatly with pages and pages of loving letters to her daughters. A picturesque scene is formed of a family of four, mother, father and daughters. But with like many grand love stories we are left in tears at its sudden tragic end. Chapters that tore at my very soul.For some this would be the end of genius’s journey, but for Madame Curie, to end her life in science would be more or less to end her life’s meaning, to end her spirit. We walk with her still with pages and pages of research, dedication, successes, awards, accolades, her war efforts, healths demise, and so on. The book is marvelous from beginning to end, filled to the brim of personal letters that convey Madame Curies inner most thoughts. I’m left feeling I lived a lifetime, vibrantly and passionately in the course of just 385 pages. Pages brought to life even more so with the knowledge that they are the writings of Ms Curies very own daughter, Eve Curie. Precious stories gathered together by her greatest admirer and shared with the world so that they can come to truly know the timid lady who poured her soul into the laboratory. One of the worlds greatest minds, who has changed the face of medicine, physics, and chemistry forever with the discovery of Radium and radioactivity. A discovery that would ultimately and almost poetically claim her victim at life’s end. This book will be read and re-read and left suffering on my bookshelf for years to come as it’s pages become worn and binding fragile. And I look forward to the day I can pass it on to my now 6 year old daughter who shares the same innate spirit, a spirit forever in aw of the sciences. "

Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.”― Marie Curie, Madame Curie by Eve CurieSo, I still have the need to talk about Madame Curie before I move on in life because this book was so dear to me. This book is the best biography of Marie Curie, narrated by her own daughter, with lots of letters exchanged. And the fact that Eve Curie was a writer made this book a memorable reading indeed. Not only it portrayed the life of a genius scientist, but also a love story between her and her husband. And a story of a single mother. Born Marya Skłodowska in Tsarist Poland, her life had always been difficult. She lost her mother and a sister since she was very young. The family of 4, father, her older sister, herself and her brother tried to keep life above poverty. At age 17, Marie had to work as a governess, started saving for her dream education and split the rest to help her older sister who was to pursue the Sorbonne.When Marie got accepted to the Sorbonne, she took 3 days train ride to Paris. Lived alone in a tiny room, no heater, not enough money to buy food, she kept studying in that frozen room. To me, Marie Curie wasn't born a genius, but being naturally curious, love of study, have a deep passion for physics and consistency of grit in the face of adversity actually made whom she became. All day long she would study, buried herself in Physics, slept very little, and starved. She wrote to her brother:“Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that? We must have perseverance and above all confidence in ourselves. We must believe that we are gifted for something and that this thing must be attained.”Because this book contained mostly the letters, it really illustrated the true grit from Marie's own words. And also revealed her personality–a vulnerable person.""My life is upset in such a way that it will never be put right again. I think it will always be like this, and I shall not try to live otherwise""Mindfulness living, a letter to her two daughters:✎""My dear children, I send you my best wishes for a happy New Year–that is to say, a year of good health, good humor, and good work, a year in which you will have pleasure in living every day, without waiting for days to be gone before finding charm in them, and without putting all hope of pleasure in the days to come""✎This is only the tiny part from this book and I felt so lucky to have read it. It is emotional reading and enormously inspiring. I can see myself rereading it again. The first reading of my 2019 reading goal, My Year of Reading the Women Pioneers, was already phenomenal, I can not wait to start my second one :)Hope you'll find the opportunity to read Madame Curie. I can't recommend this book highly enough. "
74,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/288297-the-library-lady,5,"I am giving this book 5 stars because it is amazing on so many levels.This is the book that sparked my interest in Marie Curie--and since physics was a torture class for me in high school, that was pretty amazing in itself! But I must have read it around that time, my mother had a paperback copy on her bookshelves, and I wore it out re-reading it.Decades later, I am reading it in a whole new way and I am blown away by it. Eve Curie, Marie's daughter, finished this book only 3 years after her mother's death, and it could have been a sugar dripping, mother glorifying, plastic superwoman story. But it is not.Eve Curie was the only member of the Curie family to NOT become a scientist, but her writing combines scientific analysis with fluid storytelling as she recounts her mother's life. She sees Marie as she was, a very human woman whose life was driven by her brilliant scientific mind. Pierre Curie was her perfect partner, both as a spouse and as a scientist she could share her work with, and his loss impacted the rest of her life. Curie does not say that she and her sister were neglected, and indeed they were not, but she shows Marie's failings and virtues as a mother, not in a ""Mommie Dearest"" way, but in the way of a loving daughter. She gives us Marie at work, but she also gives us Marie at play by the sea, in a lovely chapter that shows the Curie women did have their chances to be happy and together.The one bit of whitewash here is Eve's near silence on Marie's ill fated romance with fellow scientist Paul Langevin. Only a few paragraphs on a single page, and his name is not mentioned:A scientist, devoted to her work, whose life was dignified, reserved and in recent years especially pitiable, was accused of breaking up homes and of dishonoring the name she bore with too much brilliance.You can read what actually happened here  It's not surprising that Curie chooses not to write about that sad episode, and aside from that she tries to give a full picture of her mother as a human being and succeeds.One more note: I didn't know much about Eve Curie beyond this, but she is worthy of a book of her own--perhaps even a novel. She became a pianist, a journalist, a member of the Free French Forces, and the wife of the first Executive Director of UNICEF. She herself was known at the ""First Lady of UNICEF,"" and worked actively with her husband. Unlike her parents and sister, Eve never won a Nobel prize, but her husband won the Nobel Peace Prize! Both Marie and Eve's sister Irene succumbed to radiation related illnesses, but Eve did not. In fact, she lived to be 102. A life well lived, and this book alone would have made it such."
75,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69521493-richard,3,"Madame Curie is a biography of the scientist Marie Sklodowska-Curie by the subject's daughter Eve Curie. She is the daughter who didn't win the Nobel prize. Her mother won two, and her sister won one. The biography is cradle to grave but is really split into three roughly equal sections, her life in Poland, her studies and discovery of radium along with her marriage to Pierre Curie, then her later life of largely unwanted fame.The book is florid in style and you get absolutely no idea of Sklodowska-Curie as a person at all. Indeed, from the biography she appears completely inscrutable. The book is almost the definition of hagiographic and so her motives are entirely opaque. The book puts forwards her life of physically ruinous hard work as coming from some combination of love of country (both Poland and France, the latter of which's academy treated her rather shabbily) and love of science. Not a bad word is written about either of the writer's parents and there is only warmth towards the subjects from the author, they are said to live a life of love and devotion. However, and I understand that it was the style in older pictures to look more serious, when you see them in the old photographs they look absolutely miserable. Eve Curie goes at great lengths to talk about the beauty of her mother, and indeed this sort of devotion and intelligence and tenacity has a kind of beauty, but she means physically so. There is also very little scientific explanation in the book. The discovery of radium, polonium, and actinium, and the great advances made in understanding radioactivity and what this meant in a broader scientific context is not explored at all. This may be due to the fact that the book was written in 1938 and a modern work would be more instructive here.Overall, the book presents a subject who is entirely admirable and inspirational to anyone (Marie's time in the shed trying to discover truth in a squalid environment reminds me of Newton in his own) but you sometimes get the feeling that there is a major facet of her life that is missing and that you are looking at a less than complete portrait of the great scientist."

A life full of commitment and hard work to discover the nature and the edges of scientific knowledge.Must-read biography from her daughter Eve Curie and inspiration to all.“For the admirable gift of himself, and for the magnificent service he renders humanity, what reward does our society offer the scientist? Have these servants of an idea the necessary means of work? Have they an assured existence, sheltered from care? The example of Pierre Curiee, and of others, shows that they have none of these things; and that more often, before they can secure possible working conditions, they have to exhaust their youth and their powers in daily anxieties. Our society, in which reigns an eager desire for riches and luxury, does not understand the value of science. It does not realize that science is a most precious part of its moral patrimony. Nor does it take sufficient cognizance of the fact that science is at the base of all the progress that lightens the burden of life and lessens its suffering. Neither public powers nor private generosity actually accord to science and to scientists the support and the subsidies indispensable to fully effective work.” Rest in peace, Madame Curie."
77,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5827579-librarianka,5,"I am enchanted by this biography of Marie Curie written by her daughter. It is a lovely Polish translation published to commemorate the one hundred anniversary of Marie's birth. I love a slightly anachronistic style of writing corresponding to the times. The book is written so lovingly one might think it is not objective at all, however a lot can be read between the lines. Eve Curie quotes extensively from Marie's letters and notes providing us with the voice of her mother as well as enchanting details from her private life. I enjoyed for example reading about Marie and her daughters' vacation spent in a small village in Brittany called Larcouest in the company of the greatest scientific minds as humble vacationers living as slowly and as simple as possible.The last chapter describes heartbreaking last moments of Marie Curie who died so prematurely still full of plans for the future.I ended up being so completely moved by the dedication to their scientific work, by the passion they shared and the idealism that guided Marie Curie and Pierre Curie throughout their life."

But I finally finished and even though I didn't LOVE it I am still glad I pushed through.Marie Curie certainly was an amazing woman and I learned a lot about her in this book. Since I am a physicist myself (or I am going to be), and a woman, I really believe that this book was a must-read for me.It's not written in a particularly engaging way and even though it is written by her own daughter it feels strangely distant at times. But perhaps that is only fitting for a logical and rational mind like Marie Curie's.So if you have any connection to Science or Poland or Feminism or Cancer Therapy or any other topic that is in relation to Marie Curie, or you are generally interested in her life, I definitely recommend this book, but go in knowing that it can be a bit ... not boring, but also not very captivating, at times."

The whole life story of Marie is beautifully written by Marie's daughter Eve in old Dutch-translated language. The detailed descriptions of the situation in Poland around the end of the 19th century under Soviet regime and Paris in the beginning of the 20th century. About a wonderful woman who sacrificed herself for physical, mathematical and chemistry science. It is funny to read that this lady learned everything about radium while she did not know how to cook herself a meal. It is far less funny to read how she and her husband, both highly-qualified and naturally driven, had to fight for having a laboratory in Paris; just a place to do their experiments. And how friends wrote them letters, expressing their sincere concerns about Marie's physical condition and too-seriousness. It is all passion for wild nature and science. Purity pur sang. "

Part 2 tells us about Marie's life in France. Part 3 speaks about Marie's life after the death of Pierre Curie. This book consists of many letters which were written or received by Marie Curie. Marie Curie wrote many letters to Pierre, Eve, Irene, Henrietta, Bronya etc. This book also has many photographs in it. There is some French in this book. So Maria Sklodowska was born in Warsaw, Poland. She was born in the Sklodowska family. Her parents were teachers. She had three elder sisters and an elder brother. Her siblings were Bronya, Joseph, Helena and Zofia. Zofia died at an early age. Also Maria's mother died. Maria was a very bright student at school. She knew five languages, namely: French, English, German, Russian and Polish. She loved her motherland. Joseph grew up to pursue medicine. Maria finished her high school and she received a gold medal for achieving the first mark. Maria and Bronya made a decision that Maria would work as a governess and earn money for Bronya to study medicine and in turn Bronya would complete her studies and work as a doctor to earn money for Maria's studies. So Maria worked as a governess while Bronya went to Paris, France. Bronya studied medicine at the Sorbonne. Maria fell in love with the eldest son of her employer while she worked as a governess in their house. But the parents refused to accept Maria as a daughter-in-law due to her poverty. Bronya became a gynaecologist. She married a doctor in Paris. Joseph got married. Maria changed her name to Marie because she was now in Paris. She started her studies in Paris. She studied Physics and Mathematics. She fell in love with Pierre Curie. Pierre and Marie got married. They worked together in a shed. After four years of intense research and isolation, they were able to discover Radium and Polonium. Marie named one of the elements as Polonium in honour of her motherland, Poland. Pierre and Marie received the Nobel prize for Physics. Pierre and Marie had two children: Irene and Eve. Pierre died in an accident. Marie felt very lonely, isolated, alone and solitary for sometime. But then she continued her research with indomitable courage. She became very famous. She received the Nobel prize for Chemistry. She started teaching Physics at the Sorbonne. Radium was used to cure cancer and this technique was named as Curietherapy. Irene studied Physics and she became Marie's assistant. Irene married Frederic Joliot. Eve studied music. Irene became a physicist. Eve became a writer. Marie built the Radium institute at Paris, France. She also built the Radium institute at Warsaw, Poland. Marie actively took part in the war by curing patients with Curietherapy. Marie spent her holidays at Larcouëst. She spent holidays with her close friends and her daughters. Irene and Frederic gave birth to a daughter. Marie went to America to receive a gram of radium. She was welcomed warmly by the Americans. Marie never liked fame. Marie's eyes became weak. She could no longer see properly. Also her ears were giving her some problem. Radium had damaged her body, she had stones in her gallbladder​. Also there was some problem in her lungs and in her blood. She eventually died. She had written a book named Radioactivity which was published posthumously​."

But this book encourages me as a woman and as a non-scientist to learn about physics and chemistry. In this book the sciences are adventurous fields that have great, and hopefully good, implications for everyone, and that can still be upended excitingly by new discoveries. That said, the book is clear about the health, personal and financial costs that Marie and Pierre Curie paid for everything they achieved and were honoured for."

Maria Skłodowska-Curie was a brilliant scientist and an amazing person, a real role-model. If you haven't read this book, but are interested in science, history or outstanding people, start reading it.One think I must note: since the book was written by her daughter, some parts of her life are not really written about, as she probably didn't want to believe some rumours or wanted to save her mother's reputation, but I don't think those rumours make her less valuable, they just show that she was a person too. I've read many biographies about her, and though others may be more open about some things, this is far the best showing her as a person by someone who knew her the most."

The book written by Madame Curie's daughter comprises of many letters (few are still radioactive to date) from Madame Curie, gives insights into how devoted to science and family the Madame Curie was. The hardships that Madame faced along with her beloved, Pierre to break through the stigma in the early 1900's. It's really an honor to be able to access the life of the legend and relive the discoveries through a roller-coaster."

My dad picked this up at a thrift store somewhere and after he read it, he urged me to read it as well, and so I did. I’m far from intelligent but I thought this was a great book about a great woman and so anyone who’s considering reading this, I strongly recommend this. This reminded me a lot of The Agony and the Ecstasy by Irving Stone, a biography about Michelangelo Buonarroti (might not be spelt correctly whoops) which was also I great read, and now stands as the favorite book I ever read. This book comes very close to that. :)"

It shows how a woman overcame many obstacles in her life to reach the highest achievements in the scientific world which was dominated by men at the time. My only criticism is that the writing style of the author, who also happens to be the daughter of Madame Curie, is a kind of hero worship. It was not the more objective style which I have grown accustomed to for biographical works like this. "

Role model among role model. Eve Curie explained in such rich details, what most scientific articles lack, the severity and love for truth and knowledge. I just finished reading this, while my heart is appropriately humbled, my mind is emboldened with courage. Every scientist, everyone should read this book to learn of a determined life."

It is expected that the daughter would revere such a figure. In most cases, the beauty of a biography is in showing the positives traits of the person, as well as the negatives. Eve Curie painted a picture of an infallible person, depriving us as readers from knowing the actual woman Madam curie was."

The book is written by her daughter and has quite a lot of hero worship. Marie is talked about in entirely positive ways.

101,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8266629-erich,5,"Once again, one of the great historical moments of scientific discovery (radiation) is achieved against enormous odds, and accompanied by as much apathy, jealousy and intellectual intransigence among scientists and intellectuals as is generally found in the rest of the population. I am not a global-warming naysayer, but Michael Crichton was making very good points about the scientific establishment. And we now know from the science of psychology why it is that intellectuals are typically just as close-minded as the rest of us. The Manifest of the 93, the widespread support for eugenics - both are of her time.Einstein, who Marie also was to become friends with, once famously said that there were all of 3 people in the world who knew how to think. (My late voice teacher also knew Einstein, and confirmed that he told filthy jokes...).In this case, the lack of support for her work was also influenced by the fact that she was Polish, and a woman, notwithstanding Pierre's partnership with her. Marie and her French husband did their work on a scientific university campus - in a literal shack without heat - and this continued well after they won the Nobel Prize. Crichton would also have approved - and probably knew - of the Curies' decision not to claim any material benefits from patenting any part of their discovery, even though that meant their continued research remained highly under-funded for years. They simply believed that the elements of nature belonged to the whole human race, and that it would be a mistake to set any precedent otherwise. This was one of Crichton's most urgent last wishes - that the laws of governments be changed to forbid patenting anything found in nature. It was a theme in his last novel ""Next"", which I've long suspected was an unstated inspiration behind the latest reboot of the ""Planet of the Apes"" films.As it happened, I was simultaneously reading Hanya Yanagihara's ""A Little Life"" - @alittlelifebook - which is very much about a man's limited success in overcoming the aftereffects of a truly horrendous childhood. Marie's life was a good psychological counterpoint for my own sanity. She encountered extremely difficult obstacles just trying to get educated as well as all the early years of research and much of her life after Pierre's early death. But she succeeded - as a human being as well as a scientist, and while the average person knows as much as I did before reading the book - that she discovered radiation, and that she ""worked herself to death"", both statements fairly true - she did in fact live quite a long life for the time.Eve does not shy away from describing her other's flaws, weaknesses, shortcomings as a mother even - she presents a fully realized human being. But it is overall a highly admirable one, and I certainly found that refreshing..Deep into her story, around the time Marie passes her fiftieth year, Eve steps back from her narrative to speak directly to that point:- Well, yes. ""Sympathetic characters"" abound in this story. It is not my fault: they existed.... Marie's companions...would furnish very poor subjects for analysis to our novelists with their liking for dark colors. Strange, abnormal families, these Sklodovskis and Curies, in which parents and children did not hate each other, in which human beings were guided by tenderness, in which nobody listened at doors or dreamed of treacheries and inheritances, in which nobody murdered anybody! - in which everybody was, in fact, perfectly honest! A last thought that speaks so poignantly to our times - Marie truly detested the trappings of her fame, regarded it as a great burden, largely but not solely because it took her away from her time for further research. She did eventually come to a certain rapprochement with it, learning only after a good number of years to wield some the power of her popularity to benefit the causes she believed in - scientific research, the providing of adequate medical equipment and resources to #fightcancer with her new discovery, education particularly of girls, and of the lower classes.The book is a great joy to read for this and many other stories and reasons. It is written in a style that is as open and frank as it is outdated in style and turns of phrase (and has been translated into dozens of languages - I read the English one by Vincent Sheean, a now forgotten but once highly regarded intellectual himself) - and that is all part of its refreshing charm. It ought to be a staple in #WomensHistory and #ScienceHistory collections @WomensHistory -it's also a great companion to Alcott's and Hugo's classics.It is for anyone who loves a great story of overcoming great odds, of travel to foreign places, of the thrill of intellectual discovery, of the evidence of what can be accomplished in a big life by a little woman."
102,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90419058-kaitlyn,5,"I broke the most ardent rules of book buying and purchased this book mostly for the aesthetic nature of the cover photo. A simple picture of a strikingly focused woman gazing into a glass beaker surrounded by a plethora of Scientific equipment remnant of the 1920s. Madame Curie. I, myself, a woman who has always been filled with a childhood spirit for the sciences and been drawn by its most basic element, discovery. With that in mind, Madame Curie has always been the perfect thematic heroine to my childhood, and a more proper second reason for purchasing this now cherished book.This book is monumental at capturing the authentic life of Ms Curie. It goes beyond our common 7th grade lecture notes , who was the first female Nobel prize winner? This biography delves much deeper than that and into the soul of the genius. From her upbringing in the oppressed lands of Poland where she was first to begin to show a gift for brilliance, to her adolescents where her selfless nature exhibited itself to its highest peak as she bequest her chance at college to her elder sister whom she deemed only fair to get the chance first. Later it discusses in details her at last arrival to the university and her undying commitment to learn and master every point of physics with an almost obsessive compulsion.In the middle of this book or might I say in life’s journey we find ourselves are caught up in the love story of her finding her dear Pierre Currie who by all accounts more so found her and considered Mrs Curie to be his life’s completion. Curie’s together, we find friendship, companionships, discovery, dedication, and remarkable love. For chapters on end we are breathless at the purity of the relationship, at the building of a family full of life, love and brilliance. The successful scientist now nurturing mother, took motherhood seriously and cherished it greatly with pages and pages of loving letters to her daughters. A picturesque scene is formed of a family of four, mother, father and daughters. But with like many grand love stories we are left in tears at its sudden tragic end. Chapters that tore at my very soul.For some this would be the end of genius’s journey, but for Madame Curie, to end her life in science would be more or less to end her life’s meaning, to end her spirit. We walk with her still with pages and pages of research, dedication, successes, awards, accolades, her war efforts, healths demise, and so on. The book is marvelous from beginning to end, filled to the brim of personal letters that convey Madame Curies inner most thoughts. I’m left feeling I lived a lifetime, vibrantly and passionately in the course of just 385 pages. Pages brought to life even more so with the knowledge that they are the writings of Ms Curies very own daughter, Eve Curie. Precious stories gathered together by her greatest admirer and shared with the world so that they can come to truly know the timid lady who poured her soul into the laboratory. One of the worlds greatest minds, who has changed the face of medicine, physics, and chemistry forever with the discovery of Radium and radioactivity. A discovery that would ultimately and almost poetically claim her victim at life’s end. This book will be read and re-read and left suffering on my bookshelf for years to come as it’s pages become worn and binding fragile. And I look forward to the day I can pass it on to my now 6 year old daughter who shares the same innate spirit, a spirit forever in aw of the sciences. "

Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.”― Marie Curie, Madame Curie by Eve CurieSo, I still have the need to talk about Madame Curie before I move on in life because this book was so dear to me. This book is the best biography of Marie Curie, narrated by her own daughter, with lots of letters exchanged. And the fact that Eve Curie was a writer made this book a memorable reading indeed. Not only it portrayed the life of a genius scientist, but also a love story between her and her husband. And a story of a single mother. Born Marya Skłodowska in Tsarist Poland, her life had always been difficult. She lost her mother and a sister since she was very young. The family of 4, father, her older sister, herself and her brother tried to keep life above poverty. At age 17, Marie had to work as a governess, started saving for her dream education and split the rest to help her older sister who was to pursue the Sorbonne.When Marie got accepted to the Sorbonne, she took 3 days train ride to Paris. Lived alone in a tiny room, no heater, not enough money to buy food, she kept studying in that frozen room. To me, Marie Curie wasn't born a genius, but being naturally curious, love of study, have a deep passion for physics and consistency of grit in the face of adversity actually made whom she became. All day long she would study, buried herself in Physics, slept very little, and starved. She wrote to her brother:“Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that? We must have perseverance and above all confidence in ourselves. We must believe that we are gifted for something and that this thing must be attained.”Because this book contained mostly the letters, it really illustrated the true grit from Marie's own words. And also revealed her personality–a vulnerable person.""My life is upset in such a way that it will never be put right again. I think it will always be like this, and I shall not try to live otherwise""Mindfulness living, a letter to her two daughters:✎""My dear children, I send you my best wishes for a happy New Year–that is to say, a year of good health, good humor, and good work, a year in which you will have pleasure in living every day, without waiting for days to be gone before finding charm in them, and without putting all hope of pleasure in the days to come""✎This is only the tiny part from this book and I felt so lucky to have read it. It is emotional reading and enormously inspiring. I can see myself rereading it again. The first reading of my 2019 reading goal, My Year of Reading the Women Pioneers, was already phenomenal, I can not wait to start my second one :)Hope you'll find the opportunity to read Madame Curie. I can't recommend this book highly enough. "
104,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/288297-the-library-lady,5,"I am giving this book 5 stars because it is amazing on so many levels.This is the book that sparked my interest in Marie Curie--and since physics was a torture class for me in high school, that was pretty amazing in itself! But I must have read it around that time, my mother had a paperback copy on her bookshelves, and I wore it out re-reading it.Decades later, I am reading it in a whole new way and I am blown away by it. Eve Curie, Marie's daughter, finished this book only 3 years after her mother's death, and it could have been a sugar dripping, mother glorifying, plastic superwoman story. But it is not.Eve Curie was the only member of the Curie family to NOT become a scientist, but her writing combines scientific analysis with fluid storytelling as she recounts her mother's life. She sees Marie as she was, a very human woman whose life was driven by her brilliant scientific mind. Pierre Curie was her perfect partner, both as a spouse and as a scientist she could share her work with, and his loss impacted the rest of her life. Curie does not say that she and her sister were neglected, and indeed they were not, but she shows Marie's failings and virtues as a mother, not in a ""Mommie Dearest"" way, but in the way of a loving daughter. She gives us Marie at work, but she also gives us Marie at play by the sea, in a lovely chapter that shows the Curie women did have their chances to be happy and together.The one bit of whitewash here is Eve's near silence on Marie's ill fated romance with fellow scientist Paul Langevin. Only a few paragraphs on a single page, and his name is not mentioned:A scientist, devoted to her work, whose life was dignified, reserved and in recent years especially pitiable, was accused of breaking up homes and of dishonoring the name she bore with too much brilliance.You can read what actually happened here  It's not surprising that Curie chooses not to write about that sad episode, and aside from that she tries to give a full picture of her mother as a human being and succeeds.One more note: I didn't know much about Eve Curie beyond this, but she is worthy of a book of her own--perhaps even a novel. She became a pianist, a journalist, a member of the Free French Forces, and the wife of the first Executive Director of UNICEF. She herself was known at the ""First Lady of UNICEF,"" and worked actively with her husband. Unlike her parents and sister, Eve never won a Nobel prize, but her husband won the Nobel Peace Prize! Both Marie and Eve's sister Irene succumbed to radiation related illnesses, but Eve did not. In fact, she lived to be 102. A life well lived, and this book alone would have made it such."
105,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69521493-richard,3,"Madame Curie is a biography of the scientist Marie Sklodowska-Curie by the subject's daughter Eve Curie. She is the daughter who didn't win the Nobel prize. Her mother won two, and her sister won one. The biography is cradle to grave but is really split into three roughly equal sections, her life in Poland, her studies and discovery of radium along with her marriage to Pierre Curie, then her later life of largely unwanted fame.The book is florid in style and you get absolutely no idea of Sklodowska-Curie as a person at all. Indeed, from the biography she appears completely inscrutable. The book is almost the definition of hagiographic and so her motives are entirely opaque. The book puts forwards her life of physically ruinous hard work as coming from some combination of love of country (both Poland and France, the latter of which's academy treated her rather shabbily) and love of science. Not a bad word is written about either of the writer's parents and there is only warmth towards the subjects from the author, they are said to live a life of love and devotion. However, and I understand that it was the style in older pictures to look more serious, when you see them in the old photographs they look absolutely miserable. Eve Curie goes at great lengths to talk about the beauty of her mother, and indeed this sort of devotion and intelligence and tenacity has a kind of beauty, but she means physically so. There is also very little scientific explanation in the book. The discovery of radium, polonium, and actinium, and the great advances made in understanding radioactivity and what this meant in a broader scientific context is not explored at all. This may be due to the fact that the book was written in 1938 and a modern work would be more instructive here.Overall, the book presents a subject who is entirely admirable and inspirational to anyone (Marie's time in the shed trying to discover truth in a squalid environment reminds me of Newton in his own) but you sometimes get the feeling that there is a major facet of her life that is missing and that you are looking at a less than complete portrait of the great scientist."

A life full of commitment and hard work to discover the nature and the edges of scientific knowledge.Must-read biography from her daughter Eve Curie and inspiration to all.“For the admirable gift of himself, and for the magnificent service he renders humanity, what reward does our society offer the scientist? Have these servants of an idea the necessary means of work? Have they an assured existence, sheltered from care? The example of Pierre Curiee, and of others, shows that they have none of these things; and that more often, before they can secure possible working conditions, they have to exhaust their youth and their powers in daily anxieties. Our society, in which reigns an eager desire for riches and luxury, does not understand the value of science. It does not realize that science is a most precious part of its moral patrimony. Nor does it take sufficient cognizance of the fact that science is at the base of all the progress that lightens the burden of life and lessens its suffering. Neither public powers nor private generosity actually accord to science and to scientists the support and the subsidies indispensable to fully effective work.” Rest in peace, Madame Curie."
107,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5827579-librarianka,5,"I am enchanted by this biography of Marie Curie written by her daughter. It is a lovely Polish translation published to commemorate the one hundred anniversary of Marie's birth. I love a slightly anachronistic style of writing corresponding to the times. The book is written so lovingly one might think it is not objective at all, however a lot can be read between the lines. Eve Curie quotes extensively from Marie's letters and notes providing us with the voice of her mother as well as enchanting details from her private life. I enjoyed for example reading about Marie and her daughters' vacation spent in a small village in Brittany called Larcouest in the company of the greatest scientific minds as humble vacationers living as slowly and as simple as possible.The last chapter describes heartbreaking last moments of Marie Curie who died so prematurely still full of plans for the future.I ended up being so completely moved by the dedication to their scientific work, by the passion they shared and the idealism that guided Marie Curie and Pierre Curie throughout their life."

But I finally finished and even though I didn't LOVE it I am still glad I pushed through.Marie Curie certainly was an amazing woman and I learned a lot about her in this book. Since I am a physicist myself (or I am going to be), and a woman, I really believe that this book was a must-read for me.It's not written in a particularly engaging way and even though it is written by her own daughter it feels strangely distant at times. But perhaps that is only fitting for a logical and rational mind like Marie Curie's.So if you have any connection to Science or Poland or Feminism or Cancer Therapy or any other topic that is in relation to Marie Curie, or you are generally interested in her life, I definitely recommend this book, but go in knowing that it can be a bit ... not boring, but also not very captivating, at times."

The whole life story of Marie is beautifully written by Marie's daughter Eve in old Dutch-translated language. The detailed descriptions of the situation in Poland around the end of the 19th century under Soviet regime and Paris in the beginning of the 20th century. About a wonderful woman who sacrificed herself for physical, mathematical and chemistry science. It is funny to read that this lady learned everything about radium while she did not know how to cook herself a meal. It is far less funny to read how she and her husband, both highly-qualified and naturally driven, had to fight for having a laboratory in Paris; just a place to do their experiments. And how friends wrote them letters, expressing their sincere concerns about Marie's physical condition and too-seriousness. It is all passion for wild nature and science. Purity pur sang. "

Part 2 tells us about Marie's life in France. Part 3 speaks about Marie's life after the death of Pierre Curie. This book consists of many letters which were written or received by Marie Curie. Marie Curie wrote many letters to Pierre, Eve, Irene, Henrietta, Bronya etc. This book also has many photographs in it. There is some French in this book. So Maria Sklodowska was born in Warsaw, Poland. She was born in the Sklodowska family. Her parents were teachers. She had three elder sisters and an elder brother. Her siblings were Bronya, Joseph, Helena and Zofia. Zofia died at an early age. Also Maria's mother died. Maria was a very bright student at school. She knew five languages, namely: French, English, German, Russian and Polish. She loved her motherland. Joseph grew up to pursue medicine. Maria finished her high school and she received a gold medal for achieving the first mark. Maria and Bronya made a decision that Maria would work as a governess and earn money for Bronya to study medicine and in turn Bronya would complete her studies and work as a doctor to earn money for Maria's studies. So Maria worked as a governess while Bronya went to Paris, France. Bronya studied medicine at the Sorbonne. Maria fell in love with the eldest son of her employer while she worked as a governess in their house. But the parents refused to accept Maria as a daughter-in-law due to her poverty. Bronya became a gynaecologist. She married a doctor in Paris. Joseph got married. Maria changed her name to Marie because she was now in Paris. She started her studies in Paris. She studied Physics and Mathematics. She fell in love with Pierre Curie. Pierre and Marie got married. They worked together in a shed. After four years of intense research and isolation, they were able to discover Radium and Polonium. Marie named one of the elements as Polonium in honour of her motherland, Poland. Pierre and Marie received the Nobel prize for Physics. Pierre and Marie had two children: Irene and Eve. Pierre died in an accident. Marie felt very lonely, isolated, alone and solitary for sometime. But then she continued her research with indomitable courage. She became very famous. She received the Nobel prize for Chemistry. She started teaching Physics at the Sorbonne. Radium was used to cure cancer and this technique was named as Curietherapy. Irene studied Physics and she became Marie's assistant. Irene married Frederic Joliot. Eve studied music. Irene became a physicist. Eve became a writer. Marie built the Radium institute at Paris, France. She also built the Radium institute at Warsaw, Poland. Marie actively took part in the war by curing patients with Curietherapy. Marie spent her holidays at Larcouëst. She spent holidays with her close friends and her daughters. Irene and Frederic gave birth to a daughter. Marie went to America to receive a gram of radium. She was welcomed warmly by the Americans. Marie never liked fame. Marie's eyes became weak. She could no longer see properly. Also her ears were giving her some problem. Radium had damaged her body, she had stones in her gallbladder​. Also there was some problem in her lungs and in her blood. She eventually died. She had written a book named Radioactivity which was published posthumously​."

But this book encourages me as a woman and as a non-scientist to learn about physics and chemistry. In this book the sciences are adventurous fields that have great, and hopefully good, implications for everyone, and that can still be upended excitingly by new discoveries. That said, the book is clear about the health, personal and financial costs that Marie and Pierre Curie paid for everything they achieved and were honoured for."

Maria Skłodowska-Curie was a brilliant scientist and an amazing person, a real role-model. If you haven't read this book, but are interested in science, history or outstanding people, start reading it.One think I must note: since the book was written by her daughter, some parts of her life are not really written about, as she probably didn't want to believe some rumours or wanted to save her mother's reputation, but I don't think those rumours make her less valuable, they just show that she was a person too. I've read many biographies about her, and though others may be more open about some things, this is far the best showing her as a person by someone who knew her the most."

My dad picked this up at a thrift store somewhere and after he read it, he urged me to read it as well, and so I did. I’m far from intelligent but I thought this was a great book about a great woman and so anyone who’s considering reading this, I strongly recommend this. This reminded me a lot of The Agony and the Ecstasy by Irving Stone, a biography about Michelangelo Buonarroti (might not be spelt correctly whoops) which was also I great read, and now stands as the favorite book I ever read. This book comes very close to that. :)"

It shows how a woman overcame many obstacles in her life to reach the highest achievements in the scientific world which was dominated by men at the time. My only criticism is that the writing style of the author, who also happens to be the daughter of Madame Curie, is a kind of hero worship. It was not the more objective style which I have grown accustomed to for biographical works like this. "

It is expected that the daughter would revere such a figure. In most cases, the beauty of a biography is in showing the positives traits of the person, as well as the negatives. Eve Curie painted a picture of an infallible person, depriving us as readers from knowing the actual woman Madam curie was."

131,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8266629-erich,5,"Once again, one of the great historical moments of scientific discovery (radiation) is achieved against enormous odds, and accompanied by as much apathy, jealousy and intellectual intransigence among scientists and intellectuals as is generally found in the rest of the population. I am not a global-warming naysayer, but Michael Crichton was making very good points about the scientific establishment. And we now know from the science of psychology why it is that intellectuals are typically just as close-minded as the rest of us. The Manifest of the 93, the widespread support for eugenics - both are of her time.Einstein, who Marie also was to become friends with, once famously said that there were all of 3 people in the world who knew how to think. (My late voice teacher also knew Einstein, and confirmed that he told filthy jokes...).In this case, the lack of support for her work was also influenced by the fact that she was Polish, and a woman, notwithstanding Pierre's partnership with her. Marie and her French husband did their work on a scientific university campus - in a literal shack without heat - and this continued well after they won the Nobel Prize. Crichton would also have approved - and probably knew - of the Curies' decision not to claim any material benefits from patenting any part of their discovery, even though that meant their continued research remained highly under-funded for years. They simply believed that the elements of nature belonged to the whole human race, and that it would be a mistake to set any precedent otherwise. This was one of Crichton's most urgent last wishes - that the laws of governments be changed to forbid patenting anything found in nature. It was a theme in his last novel ""Next"", which I've long suspected was an unstated inspiration behind the latest reboot of the ""Planet of the Apes"" films.As it happened, I was simultaneously reading Hanya Yanagihara's ""A Little Life"" - @alittlelifebook - which is very much about a man's limited success in overcoming the aftereffects of a truly horrendous childhood. Marie's life was a good psychological counterpoint for my own sanity. She encountered extremely difficult obstacles just trying to get educated as well as all the early years of research and much of her life after Pierre's early death. But she succeeded - as a human being as well as a scientist, and while the average person knows as much as I did before reading the book - that she discovered radiation, and that she ""worked herself to death"", both statements fairly true - she did in fact live quite a long life for the time.Eve does not shy away from describing her other's flaws, weaknesses, shortcomings as a mother even - she presents a fully realized human being. But it is overall a highly admirable one, and I certainly found that refreshing..Deep into her story, around the time Marie passes her fiftieth year, Eve steps back from her narrative to speak directly to that point:- Well, yes. ""Sympathetic characters"" abound in this story. It is not my fault: they existed.... Marie's companions...would furnish very poor subjects for analysis to our novelists with their liking for dark colors. Strange, abnormal families, these Sklodovskis and Curies, in which parents and children did not hate each other, in which human beings were guided by tenderness, in which nobody listened at doors or dreamed of treacheries and inheritances, in which nobody murdered anybody! - in which everybody was, in fact, perfectly honest! A last thought that speaks so poignantly to our times - Marie truly detested the trappings of her fame, regarded it as a great burden, largely but not solely because it took her away from her time for further research. She did eventually come to a certain rapprochement with it, learning only after a good number of years to wield some the power of her popularity to benefit the causes she believed in - scientific research, the providing of adequate medical equipment and resources to #fightcancer with her new discovery, education particularly of girls, and of the lower classes.The book is a great joy to read for this and many other stories and reasons. It is written in a style that is as open and frank as it is outdated in style and turns of phrase (and has been translated into dozens of languages - I read the English one by Vincent Sheean, a now forgotten but once highly regarded intellectual himself) - and that is all part of its refreshing charm. It ought to be a staple in #WomensHistory and #ScienceHistory collections @WomensHistory -it's also a great companion to Alcott's and Hugo's classics.It is for anyone who loves a great story of overcoming great odds, of travel to foreign places, of the thrill of intellectual discovery, of the evidence of what can be accomplished in a big life by a little woman."
132,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90419058-kaitlyn,5,"I broke the most ardent rules of book buying and purchased this book mostly for the aesthetic nature of the cover photo. A simple picture of a strikingly focused woman gazing into a glass beaker surrounded by a plethora of Scientific equipment remnant of the 1920s. Madame Curie. I, myself, a woman who has always been filled with a childhood spirit for the sciences and been drawn by its most basic element, discovery. With that in mind, Madame Curie has always been the perfect thematic heroine to my childhood, and a more proper second reason for purchasing this now cherished book.This book is monumental at capturing the authentic life of Ms Curie. It goes beyond our common 7th grade lecture notes , who was the first female Nobel prize winner? This biography delves much deeper than that and into the soul of the genius. From her upbringing in the oppressed lands of Poland where she was first to begin to show a gift for brilliance, to her adolescents where her selfless nature exhibited itself to its highest peak as she bequest her chance at college to her elder sister whom she deemed only fair to get the chance first. Later it discusses in details her at last arrival to the university and her undying commitment to learn and master every point of physics with an almost obsessive compulsion.In the middle of this book or might I say in life’s journey we find ourselves are caught up in the love story of her finding her dear Pierre Currie who by all accounts more so found her and considered Mrs Curie to be his life’s completion. Curie’s together, we find friendship, companionships, discovery, dedication, and remarkable love. For chapters on end we are breathless at the purity of the relationship, at the building of a family full of life, love and brilliance. The successful scientist now nurturing mother, took motherhood seriously and cherished it greatly with pages and pages of loving letters to her daughters. A picturesque scene is formed of a family of four, mother, father and daughters. But with like many grand love stories we are left in tears at its sudden tragic end. Chapters that tore at my very soul.For some this would be the end of genius’s journey, but for Madame Curie, to end her life in science would be more or less to end her life’s meaning, to end her spirit. We walk with her still with pages and pages of research, dedication, successes, awards, accolades, her war efforts, healths demise, and so on. The book is marvelous from beginning to end, filled to the brim of personal letters that convey Madame Curies inner most thoughts. I’m left feeling I lived a lifetime, vibrantly and passionately in the course of just 385 pages. Pages brought to life even more so with the knowledge that they are the writings of Ms Curies very own daughter, Eve Curie. Precious stories gathered together by her greatest admirer and shared with the world so that they can come to truly know the timid lady who poured her soul into the laboratory. One of the worlds greatest minds, who has changed the face of medicine, physics, and chemistry forever with the discovery of Radium and radioactivity. A discovery that would ultimately and almost poetically claim her victim at life’s end. This book will be read and re-read and left suffering on my bookshelf for years to come as it’s pages become worn and binding fragile. And I look forward to the day I can pass it on to my now 6 year old daughter who shares the same innate spirit, a spirit forever in aw of the sciences. "

Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.”― Marie Curie, Madame Curie by Eve CurieSo, I still have the need to talk about Madame Curie before I move on in life because this book was so dear to me. This book is the best biography of Marie Curie, narrated by her own daughter, with lots of letters exchanged. And the fact that Eve Curie was a writer made this book a memorable reading indeed. Not only it portrayed the life of a genius scientist, but also a love story between her and her husband. And a story of a single mother. Born Marya Skłodowska in Tsarist Poland, her life had always been difficult. She lost her mother and a sister since she was very young. The family of 4, father, her older sister, herself and her brother tried to keep life above poverty. At age 17, Marie had to work as a governess, started saving for her dream education and split the rest to help her older sister who was to pursue the Sorbonne.When Marie got accepted to the Sorbonne, she took 3 days train ride to Paris. Lived alone in a tiny room, no heater, not enough money to buy food, she kept studying in that frozen room. To me, Marie Curie wasn't born a genius, but being naturally curious, love of study, have a deep passion for physics and consistency of grit in the face of adversity actually made whom she became. All day long she would study, buried herself in Physics, slept very little, and starved. She wrote to her brother:“Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that? We must have perseverance and above all confidence in ourselves. We must believe that we are gifted for something and that this thing must be attained.”Because this book contained mostly the letters, it really illustrated the true grit from Marie's own words. And also revealed her personality–a vulnerable person.""My life is upset in such a way that it will never be put right again. I think it will always be like this, and I shall not try to live otherwise""Mindfulness living, a letter to her two daughters:✎""My dear children, I send you my best wishes for a happy New Year–that is to say, a year of good health, good humor, and good work, a year in which you will have pleasure in living every day, without waiting for days to be gone before finding charm in them, and without putting all hope of pleasure in the days to come""✎This is only the tiny part from this book and I felt so lucky to have read it. It is emotional reading and enormously inspiring. I can see myself rereading it again. The first reading of my 2019 reading goal, My Year of Reading the Women Pioneers, was already phenomenal, I can not wait to start my second one :)Hope you'll find the opportunity to read Madame Curie. I can't recommend this book highly enough. "
134,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/288297-the-library-lady,5,"I am giving this book 5 stars because it is amazing on so many levels.This is the book that sparked my interest in Marie Curie--and since physics was a torture class for me in high school, that was pretty amazing in itself! But I must have read it around that time, my mother had a paperback copy on her bookshelves, and I wore it out re-reading it.Decades later, I am reading it in a whole new way and I am blown away by it. Eve Curie, Marie's daughter, finished this book only 3 years after her mother's death, and it could have been a sugar dripping, mother glorifying, plastic superwoman story. But it is not.Eve Curie was the only member of the Curie family to NOT become a scientist, but her writing combines scientific analysis with fluid storytelling as she recounts her mother's life. She sees Marie as she was, a very human woman whose life was driven by her brilliant scientific mind. Pierre Curie was her perfect partner, both as a spouse and as a scientist she could share her work with, and his loss impacted the rest of her life. Curie does not say that she and her sister were neglected, and indeed they were not, but she shows Marie's failings and virtues as a mother, not in a ""Mommie Dearest"" way, but in the way of a loving daughter. She gives us Marie at work, but she also gives us Marie at play by the sea, in a lovely chapter that shows the Curie women did have their chances to be happy and together.The one bit of whitewash here is Eve's near silence on Marie's ill fated romance with fellow scientist Paul Langevin. Only a few paragraphs on a single page, and his name is not mentioned:A scientist, devoted to her work, whose life was dignified, reserved and in recent years especially pitiable, was accused of breaking up homes and of dishonoring the name she bore with too much brilliance.You can read what actually happened here  It's not surprising that Curie chooses not to write about that sad episode, and aside from that she tries to give a full picture of her mother as a human being and succeeds.One more note: I didn't know much about Eve Curie beyond this, but she is worthy of a book of her own--perhaps even a novel. She became a pianist, a journalist, a member of the Free French Forces, and the wife of the first Executive Director of UNICEF. She herself was known at the ""First Lady of UNICEF,"" and worked actively with her husband. Unlike her parents and sister, Eve never won a Nobel prize, but her husband won the Nobel Peace Prize! Both Marie and Eve's sister Irene succumbed to radiation related illnesses, but Eve did not. In fact, she lived to be 102. A life well lived, and this book alone would have made it such."
135,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69521493-richard,3,"Madame Curie is a biography of the scientist Marie Sklodowska-Curie by the subject's daughter Eve Curie. She is the daughter who didn't win the Nobel prize. Her mother won two, and her sister won one. The biography is cradle to grave but is really split into three roughly equal sections, her life in Poland, her studies and discovery of radium along with her marriage to Pierre Curie, then her later life of largely unwanted fame.The book is florid in style and you get absolutely no idea of Sklodowska-Curie as a person at all. Indeed, from the biography she appears completely inscrutable. The book is almost the definition of hagiographic and so her motives are entirely opaque. The book puts forwards her life of physically ruinous hard work as coming from some combination of love of country (both Poland and France, the latter of which's academy treated her rather shabbily) and love of science. Not a bad word is written about either of the writer's parents and there is only warmth towards the subjects from the author, they are said to live a life of love and devotion. However, and I understand that it was the style in older pictures to look more serious, when you see them in the old photographs they look absolutely miserable. Eve Curie goes at great lengths to talk about the beauty of her mother, and indeed this sort of devotion and intelligence and tenacity has a kind of beauty, but she means physically so. There is also very little scientific explanation in the book. The discovery of radium, polonium, and actinium, and the great advances made in understanding radioactivity and what this meant in a broader scientific context is not explored at all. This may be due to the fact that the book was written in 1938 and a modern work would be more instructive here.Overall, the book presents a subject who is entirely admirable and inspirational to anyone (Marie's time in the shed trying to discover truth in a squalid environment reminds me of Newton in his own) but you sometimes get the feeling that there is a major facet of her life that is missing and that you are looking at a less than complete portrait of the great scientist."

A life full of commitment and hard work to discover the nature and the edges of scientific knowledge.Must-read biography from her daughter Eve Curie and inspiration to all.“For the admirable gift of himself, and for the magnificent service he renders humanity, what reward does our society offer the scientist? Have these servants of an idea the necessary means of work? Have they an assured existence, sheltered from care? The example of Pierre Curiee, and of others, shows that they have none of these things; and that more often, before they can secure possible working conditions, they have to exhaust their youth and their powers in daily anxieties. Our society, in which reigns an eager desire for riches and luxury, does not understand the value of science. It does not realize that science is a most precious part of its moral patrimony. Nor does it take sufficient cognizance of the fact that science is at the base of all the progress that lightens the burden of life and lessens its suffering. Neither public powers nor private generosity actually accord to science and to scientists the support and the subsidies indispensable to fully effective work.” Rest in peace, Madame Curie."

It is a lovely Polish translation published to commemorate the one hundred anniversary of Marie's birth. I love a slightly anachronistic style of writing corresponding to the times. The book is written so lovingly one might think it is not objective at all, however a lot can be read between the lines. Eve Curie quotes extensively from Marie's letters and notes providing us with the voice of her mother as well as enchanting details from her private life. I enjoyed for example reading about Marie and her daughters' vacation spent in a small village in Brittany called Larcouest in the company of the greatest scientific minds as humble vacationers living as slowly and as simple as possible.The last chapter describes heartbreaking last moments of Marie Curie who died so prematurely still full of plans for the future.I ended up being so completely moved by the dedication to their scientific work, by the passion they shared and the idealism that guided Marie Curie and Pierre Curie throughout their life."

But I finally finished and even though I didn't LOVE it I am still glad I pushed through.Marie Curie certainly was an amazing woman and I learned a lot about her in this book. Since I am a physicist myself (or I am going to be), and a woman, I really believe that this book was a must-read for me.It's not written in a particularly engaging way and even though it is written by her own daughter it feels strangely distant at times. But perhaps that is only fitting for a logical and rational mind like Marie Curie's.So if you have any connection to Science or Poland or Feminism or Cancer Therapy or any other topic that is in relation to Marie Curie, or you are generally interested in her life, I definitely recommend this book, but go in knowing that it can be a bit ... not boring, but also not very captivating, at times."

The whole life story of Marie is beautifully written by Marie's daughter Eve in old Dutch-translated language. The detailed descriptions of the situation in Poland around the end of the 19th century under Soviet regime and Paris in the beginning of the 20th century. About a wonderful woman who sacrificed herself for physical, mathematical and chemistry science. It is funny to read that this lady learned everything about radium while she did not know how to cook herself a meal. It is far less funny to read how she and her husband, both highly-qualified and naturally driven, had to fight for having a laboratory in Paris; just a place to do their experiments. And how friends wrote them letters, expressing their sincere concerns about Marie's physical condition and too-seriousness. It is all passion for wild nature and science. Purity pur sang. "
140,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55248857-nandini,1,"This book consists of three parts. Part 1 deals with the life of Manya (aka Marya or Maria or Marie) while she was at Poland. Part 2 tells us about Marie's life in France. Part 3 speaks about Marie's life after the death of Pierre Curie. This book consists of many letters which were written or received by Marie Curie. Marie Curie wrote many letters to Pierre, Eve, Irene, Henrietta, Bronya etc. This book also has many photographs in it. There is some French in this book. So Maria Sklodowska was born in Warsaw, Poland. She was born in the Sklodowska family. Her parents were teachers. She had three elder sisters and an elder brother. Her siblings were Bronya, Joseph, Helena and Zofia. Zofia died at an early age. Also Maria's mother died. Maria was a very bright student at school. She knew five languages, namely: French, English, German, Russian and Polish. She loved her motherland. Joseph grew up to pursue medicine. Maria finished her high school and she received a gold medal for achieving the first mark. Maria and Bronya made a decision that Maria would work as a governess and earn money for Bronya to study medicine and in turn Bronya would complete her studies and work as a doctor to earn money for Maria's studies. So Maria worked as a governess while Bronya went to Paris, France. Bronya studied medicine at the Sorbonne. Maria fell in love with the eldest son of her employer while she worked as a governess in their house. But the parents refused to accept Maria as a daughter-in-law due to her poverty. Bronya became a gynaecologist. She married a doctor in Paris. Joseph got married. Maria changed her name to Marie because she was now in Paris. She started her studies in Paris. She studied Physics and Mathematics. She fell in love with Pierre Curie. Pierre and Marie got married. They worked together in a shed. After four years of intense research and isolation, they were able to discover Radium and Polonium. Marie named one of the elements as Polonium in honour of her motherland, Poland. Pierre and Marie received the Nobel prize for Physics. Pierre and Marie had two children: Irene and Eve. Pierre died in an accident. Marie felt very lonely, isolated, alone and solitary for sometime. But then she continued her research with indomitable courage. She became very famous. She received the Nobel prize for Chemistry. She started teaching Physics at the Sorbonne. Radium was used to cure cancer and this technique was named as Curietherapy. Irene studied Physics and she became Marie's assistant. Irene married Frederic Joliot. Eve studied music. Irene became a physicist. Eve became a writer. Marie built the Radium institute at Paris, France. She also built the Radium institute at Warsaw, Poland. Marie actively took part in the war by curing patients with Curietherapy. Marie spent her holidays at Larcouëst. She spent holidays with her close friends and her daughters. Irene and Frederic gave birth to a daughter. Marie went to America to receive a gram of radium. She was welcomed warmly by the Americans. Marie never liked fame. Marie's eyes became weak. She could no longer see properly. Also her ears were giving her some problem. Radium had damaged her body, she had stones in her gallbladder​. Also there was some problem in her lungs and in her blood. She eventually died. She had written a book named Radioactivity which was published posthumously​."

But this book encourages me as a woman and as a non-scientist to learn about physics and chemistry. In this book the sciences are adventurous fields that have great, and hopefully good, implications for everyone, and that can still be upended excitingly by new discoveries. That said, the book is clear about the health, personal and financial costs that Marie and Pierre Curie paid for everything they achieved and were honoured for."

Maria Skłodowska-Curie was a brilliant scientist and an amazing person, a real role-model. If you haven't read this book, but are interested in science, history or outstanding people, start reading it.One think I must note: since the book was written by her daughter, some parts of her life are not really written about, as she probably didn't want to believe some rumours or wanted to save her mother's reputation, but I don't think those rumours make her less valuable, they just show that she was a person too. I've read many biographies about her, and though others may be more open about some things, this is far the best showing her as a person by someone who knew her the most."

My dad picked this up at a thrift store somewhere and after he read it, he urged me to read it as well, and so I did. I’m far from intelligent but I thought this was a great book about a great woman and so anyone who’s considering reading this, I strongly recommend this. This reminded me a lot of The Agony and the Ecstasy by Irving Stone, a biography about Michelangelo Buonarroti (might not be spelt correctly whoops) which was also I great read, and now stands as the favorite book I ever read.

It shows how a woman overcame many obstacles in her life to reach the highest achievements in the scientific world which was dominated by men at the time. My only criticism is that the writing style of the author, who also happens to be the daughter of Madame Curie, is a kind of hero worship. It was not the more objective style which I have grown accustomed to for biographical works like this. "

It is expected that the daughter would revere such a figure. In most cases, the beauty of a biography is in showing the positives traits of the person, as well as the negatives. Eve Curie painted a picture of an infallible person, depriving us as readers from knowing the actual woman Madam curie was."

161,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8266629-erich,5,"Once again, one of the great historical moments of scientific discovery (radiation) is achieved against enormous odds, and accompanied by as much apathy, jealousy and intellectual intransigence among scientists and intellectuals as is generally found in the rest of the population. I am not a global-warming naysayer, but Michael Crichton was making very good points about the scientific establishment. And we now know from the science of psychology why it is that intellectuals are typically just as close-minded as the rest of us. The Manifest of the 93, the widespread support for eugenics - both are of her time.Einstein, who Marie also was to become friends with, once famously said that there were all of 3 people in the world who knew how to think. (My late voice teacher also knew Einstein, and confirmed that he told filthy jokes...).In this case, the lack of support for her work was also influenced by the fact that she was Polish, and a woman, notwithstanding Pierre's partnership with her. Marie and her French husband did their work on a scientific university campus - in a literal shack without heat - and this continued well after they won the Nobel Prize. Crichton would also have approved - and probably knew - of the Curies' decision not to claim any material benefits from patenting any part of their discovery, even though that meant their continued research remained highly under-funded for years. They simply believed that the elements of nature belonged to the whole human race, and that it would be a mistake to set any precedent otherwise. This was one of Crichton's most urgent last wishes - that the laws of governments be changed to forbid patenting anything found in nature. It was a theme in his last novel ""Next"", which I've long suspected was an unstated inspiration behind the latest reboot of the ""Planet of the Apes"" films.As it happened, I was simultaneously reading Hanya Yanagihara's ""A Little Life"" - @alittlelifebook - which is very much about a man's limited success in overcoming the aftereffects of a truly horrendous childhood. Marie's life was a good psychological counterpoint for my own sanity. She encountered extremely difficult obstacles just trying to get educated as well as all the early years of research and much of her life after Pierre's early death. But she succeeded - as a human being as well as a scientist, and while the average person knows as much as I did before reading the book - that she discovered radiation, and that she ""worked herself to death"", both statements fairly true - she did in fact live quite a long life for the time.Eve does not shy away from describing her other's flaws, weaknesses, shortcomings as a mother even - she presents a fully realized human being. But it is overall a highly admirable one, and I certainly found that refreshing..Deep into her story, around the time Marie passes her fiftieth year, Eve steps back from her narrative to speak directly to that point:- Well, yes. ""Sympathetic characters"" abound in this story. It is not my fault: they existed.... Marie's companions...would furnish very poor subjects for analysis to our novelists with their liking for dark colors. Strange, abnormal families, these Sklodovskis and Curies, in which parents and children did not hate each other, in which human beings were guided by tenderness, in which nobody listened at doors or dreamed of treacheries and inheritances, in which nobody murdered anybody! - in which everybody was, in fact, perfectly honest! A last thought that speaks so poignantly to our times - Marie truly detested the trappings of her fame, regarded it as a great burden, largely but not solely because it took her away from her time for further research. She did eventually come to a certain rapprochement with it, learning only after a good number of years to wield some the power of her popularity to benefit the causes she believed in - scientific research, the providing of adequate medical equipment and resources to #fightcancer with her new discovery, education particularly of girls, and of the lower classes.The book is a great joy to read for this and many other stories and reasons. It is written in a style that is as open and frank as it is outdated in style and turns of phrase (and has been translated into dozens of languages - I read the English one by Vincent Sheean, a now forgotten but once highly regarded intellectual himself) - and that is all part of its refreshing charm. It ought to be a staple in #WomensHistory and #ScienceHistory collections @WomensHistory -it's also a great companion to Alcott's and Hugo's classics.It is for anyone who loves a great story of overcoming great odds, of travel to foreign places, of the thrill of intellectual discovery, of the evidence of what can be accomplished in a big life by a little woman."
162,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90419058-kaitlyn,5,"I broke the most ardent rules of book buying and purchased this book mostly for the aesthetic nature of the cover photo. A simple picture of a strikingly focused woman gazing into a glass beaker surrounded by a plethora of Scientific equipment remnant of the 1920s. Madame Curie. I, myself, a woman who has always been filled with a childhood spirit for the sciences and been drawn by its most basic element, discovery. With that in mind, Madame Curie has always been the perfect thematic heroine to my childhood, and a more proper second reason for purchasing this now cherished book.This book is monumental at capturing the authentic life of Ms Curie. It goes beyond our common 7th grade lecture notes , who was the first female Nobel prize winner? This biography delves much deeper than that and into the soul of the genius. From her upbringing in the oppressed lands of Poland where she was first to begin to show a gift for brilliance, to her adolescents where her selfless nature exhibited itself to its highest peak as she bequest her chance at college to her elder sister whom she deemed only fair to get the chance first. Later it discusses in details her at last arrival to the university and her undying commitment to learn and master every point of physics with an almost obsessive compulsion.In the middle of this book or might I say in life’s journey we find ourselves are caught up in the love story of her finding her dear Pierre Currie who by all accounts more so found her and considered Mrs Curie to be his life’s completion. Curie’s together, we find friendship, companionships, discovery, dedication, and remarkable love. For chapters on end we are breathless at the purity of the relationship, at the building of a family full of life, love and brilliance. The successful scientist now nurturing mother, took motherhood seriously and cherished it greatly with pages and pages of loving letters to her daughters. A picturesque scene is formed of a family of four, mother, father and daughters. But with like many grand love stories we are left in tears at its sudden tragic end. Chapters that tore at my very soul.For some this would be the end of genius’s journey, but for Madame Curie, to end her life in science would be more or less to end her life’s meaning, to end her spirit. We walk with her still with pages and pages of research, dedication, successes, awards, accolades, her war efforts, healths demise, and so on. The book is marvelous from beginning to end, filled to the brim of personal letters that convey Madame Curies inner most thoughts. I’m left feeling I lived a lifetime, vibrantly and passionately in the course of just 385 pages. Pages brought to life even more so with the knowledge that they are the writings of Ms Curies very own daughter, Eve Curie. Precious stories gathered together by her greatest admirer and shared with the world so that they can come to truly know the timid lady who poured her soul into the laboratory. One of the worlds greatest minds, who has changed the face of medicine, physics, and chemistry forever with the discovery of Radium and radioactivity. A discovery that would ultimately and almost poetically claim her victim at life’s end. This book will be read and re-read and left suffering on my bookshelf for years to come as it’s pages become worn and binding fragile. And I look forward to the day I can pass it on to my now 6 year old daughter who shares the same innate spirit, a spirit forever in aw of the sciences. "

Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.”― Marie Curie, Madame Curie by Eve CurieSo, I still have the need to talk about Madame Curie before I move on in life because this book was so dear to me. This book is the best biography of Marie Curie, narrated by her own daughter, with lots of letters exchanged. And the fact that Eve Curie was a writer made this book a memorable reading indeed. Not only it portrayed the life of a genius scientist, but also a love story between her and her husband. And a story of a single mother. Born Marya Skłodowska in Tsarist Poland, her life had always been difficult. She lost her mother and a sister since she was very young. The family of 4, father, her older sister, herself and her brother tried to keep life above poverty. At age 17, Marie had to work as a governess, started saving for her dream education and split the rest to help her older sister who was to pursue the Sorbonne.When Marie got accepted to the Sorbonne, she took 3 days train ride to Paris. Lived alone in a tiny room, no heater, not enough money to buy food, she kept studying in that frozen room. To me, Marie Curie wasn't born a genius, but being naturally curious, love of study, have a deep passion for physics and consistency of grit in the face of adversity actually made whom she became. All day long she would study, buried herself in Physics, slept very little, and starved. She wrote to her brother:“Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that? We must have perseverance and above all confidence in ourselves. We must believe that we are gifted for something and that this thing must be attained.”Because this book contained mostly the letters, it really illustrated the true grit from Marie's own words. And also revealed her personality–a vulnerable person.""My life is upset in such a way that it will never be put right again. I think it will always be like this, and I shall not try to live otherwise""Mindfulness living, a letter to her two daughters:✎""My dear children, I send you my best wishes for a happy New Year–that is to say, a year of good health, good humor, and good work, a year in which you will have pleasure in living every day, without waiting for days to be gone before finding charm in them, and without putting all hope of pleasure in the days to come""✎This is only the tiny part from this book and I felt so lucky to have read it. It is emotional reading and enormously inspiring. I can see myself rereading it again. The first reading of my 2019 reading goal, My Year of Reading the Women Pioneers, was already phenomenal, I can not wait to start my second one :)Hope you'll find the opportunity to read Madame Curie. I can't recommend this book highly enough. "
164,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/288297-the-library-lady,5,"I am giving this book 5 stars because it is amazing on so many levels.This is the book that sparked my interest in Marie Curie--and since physics was a torture class for me in high school, that was pretty amazing in itself! But I must have read it around that time, my mother had a paperback copy on her bookshelves, and I wore it out re-reading it.Decades later, I am reading it in a whole new way and I am blown away by it. Eve Curie, Marie's daughter, finished this book only 3 years after her mother's death, and it could have been a sugar dripping, mother glorifying, plastic superwoman story. But it is not.Eve Curie was the only member of the Curie family to NOT become a scientist, but her writing combines scientific analysis with fluid storytelling as she recounts her mother's life. She sees Marie as she was, a very human woman whose life was driven by her brilliant scientific mind. Pierre Curie was her perfect partner, both as a spouse and as a scientist she could share her work with, and his loss impacted the rest of her life. Curie does not say that she and her sister were neglected, and indeed they were not, but she shows Marie's failings and virtues as a mother, not in a ""Mommie Dearest"" way, but in the way of a loving daughter. She gives us Marie at work, but she also gives us Marie at play by the sea, in a lovely chapter that shows the Curie women did have their chances to be happy and together.The one bit of whitewash here is Eve's near silence on Marie's ill fated romance with fellow scientist Paul Langevin. Only a few paragraphs on a single page, and his name is not mentioned:A scientist, devoted to her work, whose life was dignified, reserved and in recent years especially pitiable, was accused of breaking up homes and of dishonoring the name she bore with too much brilliance.You can read what actually happened here  It's not surprising that Curie chooses not to write about that sad episode, and aside from that she tries to give a full picture of her mother as a human being and succeeds.One more note: I didn't know much about Eve Curie beyond this, but she is worthy of a book of her own--perhaps even a novel. She became a pianist, a journalist, a member of the Free French Forces, and the wife of the first Executive Director of UNICEF. She herself was known at the ""First Lady of UNICEF,"" and worked actively with her husband. Unlike her parents and sister, Eve never won a Nobel prize, but her husband won the Nobel Peace Prize! Both Marie and Eve's sister Irene succumbed to radiation related illnesses, but Eve did not. In fact, she lived to be 102. A life well lived, and this book alone would have made it such."
165,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69521493-richard,3,"Madame Curie is a biography of the scientist Marie Sklodowska-Curie by the subject's daughter Eve Curie. She is the daughter who didn't win the Nobel prize. Her mother won two, and her sister won one. The biography is cradle to grave but is really split into three roughly equal sections, her life in Poland, her studies and discovery of radium along with her marriage to Pierre Curie, then her later life of largely unwanted fame.The book is florid in style and you get absolutely no idea of Sklodowska-Curie as a person at all. Indeed, from the biography she appears completely inscrutable. The book is almost the definition of hagiographic and so her motives are entirely opaque. The book puts forwards her life of physically ruinous hard work as coming from some combination of love of country (both Poland and France, the latter of which's academy treated her rather shabbily) and love of science. Not a bad word is written about either of the writer's parents and there is only warmth towards the subjects from the author, they are said to live a life of love and devotion. However, and I understand that it was the style in older pictures to look more serious, when you see them in the old photographs they look absolutely miserable. Eve Curie goes at great lengths to talk about the beauty of her mother, and indeed this sort of devotion and intelligence and tenacity has a kind of beauty, but she means physically so. There is also very little scientific explanation in the book. The discovery of radium, polonium, and actinium, and the great advances made in understanding radioactivity and what this meant in a broader scientific context is not explored at all. This may be due to the fact that the book was written in 1938 and a modern work would be more instructive here.Overall, the book presents a subject who is entirely admirable and inspirational to anyone (Marie's time in the shed trying to discover truth in a squalid environment reminds me of Newton in his own) but you sometimes get the feeling that there is a major facet of her life that is missing and that you are looking at a less than complete portrait of the great scientist."

A life full of commitment and hard work to discover the nature and the edges of scientific knowledge.Must-read biography from her daughter Eve Curie and inspiration to all.“For the admirable gift of himself, and for the magnificent service he renders humanity, what reward does our society offer the scientist? Have these servants of an idea the necessary means of work? Have they an assured existence, sheltered from care? The example of Pierre Curiee, and of others, shows that they have none of these things; and that more often, before they can secure possible working conditions, they have to exhaust their youth and their powers in daily anxieties. Our society, in which reigns an eager desire for riches and luxury, does not understand the value of science. It does not realize that science is a most precious part of its moral patrimony. Nor does it take sufficient cognizance of the fact that science is at the base of all the progress that lightens the burden of life and lessens its suffering. Neither public powers nor private generosity actually accord to science and to scientists the support and the subsidies indispensable to fully effective work.” Rest in peace, Madame Curie."

It is a lovely Polish translation published to commemorate the one hundred anniversary of Marie's birth. I love a slightly anachronistic style of writing corresponding to the times. The book is written so lovingly one might think it is not objective at all, however a lot can be read between the lines. Eve Curie quotes extensively from Marie's letters and notes providing us with the voice of her mother as well as enchanting details from her private life. I enjoyed for example reading about Marie and her daughters' vacation spent in a small village in Brittany called Larcouest in the company of the greatest scientific minds as humble vacationers living as slowly and as simple as possible.The last chapter describes heartbreaking last moments of Marie Curie who died so prematurely still full of plans for the future.I ended up being so completely moved by the dedication to their scientific work, by the passion they shared and the idealism that guided Marie Curie and Pierre Curie throughout their life."

But I finally finished and even though I didn't LOVE it I am still glad I pushed through.Marie Curie certainly was an amazing woman and I learned a lot about her in this book. Since I am a physicist myself (or I am going to be), and a woman, I really believe that this book was a must-read for me.It's not written in a particularly engaging way and even though it is written by her own daughter it feels strangely distant at times. But perhaps that is only fitting for a logical and rational mind like Marie Curie's.So if you have any connection to Science or Poland or Feminism or Cancer Therapy or any other topic that is in relation to Marie Curie, or you are generally interested in her life, I definitely recommend this book, but go in knowing that it can be a bit ... not boring, but also not very captivating, at times."
169,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72517838-tina-marga,5,"I read this book in Dutch, but it had a blue hard-cover. The whole life story of Marie is beautifully written by Marie's daughter Eve in old Dutch-translated language. The detailed descriptions of the situation in Poland around the end of the 19th century under Soviet regime and Paris in the beginning of the 20th century. About a wonderful woman who sacrificed herself for physical, mathematical and chemistry science. It is funny to read that this lady learned everything about radium while she did not know how to cook herself a meal. It is far less funny to read how she and her husband, both highly-qualified and naturally driven, had to fight for having a laboratory in Paris; just a place to do their experiments. And how friends wrote them letters, expressing their sincere concerns about Marie's physical condition and too-seriousness. It is all passion for wild nature and science. Purity pur sang. "
170,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55248857-nandini,1,"This book consists of three parts. Part 1 deals with the life of Manya (aka Marya or Maria or Marie) while she was at Poland. Part 2 tells us about Marie's life in France. Part 3 speaks about Marie's life after the death of Pierre Curie. This book consists of many letters which were written or received by Marie Curie. Marie Curie wrote many letters to Pierre, Eve, Irene, Henrietta, Bronya etc. This book also has many photographs in it. There is some French in this book. So Maria Sklodowska was born in Warsaw, Poland. She was born in the Sklodowska family. Her parents were teachers. She had three elder sisters and an elder brother. Her siblings were Bronya, Joseph, Helena and Zofia. Zofia died at an early age. Also Maria's mother died. Maria was a very bright student at school. She knew five languages, namely: French, English, German, Russian and Polish. She loved her motherland. Joseph grew up to pursue medicine. Maria finished her high school and she received a gold medal for achieving the first mark. Maria and Bronya made a decision that Maria would work as a governess and earn money for Bronya to study medicine and in turn Bronya would complete her studies and work as a doctor to earn money for Maria's studies. So Maria worked as a governess while Bronya went to Paris, France. Bronya studied medicine at the Sorbonne. Maria fell in love with the eldest son of her employer while she worked as a governess in their house. But the parents refused to accept Maria as a daughter-in-law due to her poverty. Bronya became a gynaecologist. She married a doctor in Paris. Joseph got married. Maria changed her name to Marie because she was now in Paris. She started her studies in Paris. She studied Physics and Mathematics. She fell in love with Pierre Curie. Pierre and Marie got married. They worked together in a shed. After four years of intense research and isolation, they were able to discover Radium and Polonium. Marie named one of the elements as Polonium in honour of her motherland, Poland. Pierre and Marie received the Nobel prize for Physics. Pierre and Marie had two children: Irene and Eve. Pierre died in an accident. Marie felt very lonely, isolated, alone and solitary for sometime. But then she continued her research with indomitable courage. She became very famous. She received the Nobel prize for Chemistry. She started teaching Physics at the Sorbonne. Radium was used to cure cancer and this technique was named as Curietherapy. Irene studied Physics and she became Marie's assistant. Irene married Frederic Joliot. Eve studied music. Irene became a physicist. Eve became a writer. Marie built the Radium institute at Paris, France. She also built the Radium institute at Warsaw, Poland. Marie actively took part in the war by curing patients with Curietherapy. Marie spent her holidays at Larcouëst. She spent holidays with her close friends and her daughters. Irene and Frederic gave birth to a daughter. Marie went to America to receive a gram of radium. She was welcomed warmly by the Americans. Marie never liked fame. Marie's eyes became weak. She could no longer see properly. Also her ears were giving her some problem. Radium had damaged her body, she had stones in her gallbladder​. Also there was some problem in her lungs and in her blood. She eventually died. She had written a book named Radioactivity which was published posthumously​."

But this book encourages me as a woman and as a non-scientist to learn about physics and chemistry. In this book the sciences are adventurous fields that have great, and hopefully good, implications for everyone, and that can still be upended excitingly by new discoveries. That said, the book is clear about the health, personal and financial costs that Marie and Pierre Curie paid for everything they achieved and were honoured for."

Maria Skłodowska-Curie was a brilliant scientist and an amazing person, a real role-model. If you haven't read this book, but are interested in science, history or outstanding people, start reading it.One think I must note: since the book was written by her daughter, some parts of her life are not really written about, as she probably didn't want to believe some rumours or wanted to save her mother's reputation, but I don't think those rumours make her less valuable, they just show that she was a person too. I've read many biographies about her, and though others may be more open about some things, this is far the best showing her as a person by someone who knew her the most."

I’m far from intelligent but I thought this was a great book about a great woman and so anyone who’s considering reading this, I strongly recommend this.

It shows how a woman overcame many obstacles in her life to reach the highest achievements in the scientific world which was dominated by men at the time.

191,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8266629-erich,5,"Once again, one of the great historical moments of scientific discovery (radiation) is achieved against enormous odds, and accompanied by as much apathy, jealousy and intellectual intransigence among scientists and intellectuals as is generally found in the rest of the population. I am not a global-warming naysayer, but Michael Crichton was making very good points about the scientific establishment. And we now know from the science of psychology why it is that intellectuals are typically just as close-minded as the rest of us. The Manifest of the 93, the widespread support for eugenics - both are of her time.Einstein, who Marie also was to become friends with, once famously said that there were all of 3 people in the world who knew how to think. (My late voice teacher also knew Einstein, and confirmed that he told filthy jokes...).In this case, the lack of support for her work was also influenced by the fact that she was Polish, and a woman, notwithstanding Pierre's partnership with her. Marie and her French husband did their work on a scientific university campus - in a literal shack without heat - and this continued well after they won the Nobel Prize. Crichton would also have approved - and probably knew - of the Curies' decision not to claim any material benefits from patenting any part of their discovery, even though that meant their continued research remained highly under-funded for years. They simply believed that the elements of nature belonged to the whole human race, and that it would be a mistake to set any precedent otherwise. This was one of Crichton's most urgent last wishes - that the laws of governments be changed to forbid patenting anything found in nature. It was a theme in his last novel ""Next"", which I've long suspected was an unstated inspiration behind the latest reboot of the ""Planet of the Apes"" films.As it happened, I was simultaneously reading Hanya Yanagihara's ""A Little Life"" - @alittlelifebook - which is very much about a man's limited success in overcoming the aftereffects of a truly horrendous childhood. Marie's life was a good psychological counterpoint for my own sanity. She encountered extremely difficult obstacles just trying to get educated as well as all the early years of research and much of her life after Pierre's early death. But she succeeded - as a human being as well as a scientist, and while the average person knows as much as I did before reading the book - that she discovered radiation, and that she ""worked herself to death"", both statements fairly true - she did in fact live quite a long life for the time.Eve does not shy away from describing her other's flaws, weaknesses, shortcomings as a mother even - she presents a fully realized human being. But it is overall a highly admirable one, and I certainly found that refreshing..Deep into her story, around the time Marie passes her fiftieth year, Eve steps back from her narrative to speak directly to that point:- Well, yes. ""Sympathetic characters"" abound in this story. It is not my fault: they existed.... Marie's companions...would furnish very poor subjects for analysis to our novelists with their liking for dark colors. Strange, abnormal families, these Sklodovskis and Curies, in which parents and children did not hate each other, in which human beings were guided by tenderness, in which nobody listened at doors or dreamed of treacheries and inheritances, in which nobody murdered anybody! - in which everybody was, in fact, perfectly honest! A last thought that speaks so poignantly to our times - Marie truly detested the trappings of her fame, regarded it as a great burden, largely but not solely because it took her away from her time for further research. She did eventually come to a certain rapprochement with it, learning only after a good number of years to wield some the power of her popularity to benefit the causes she believed in - scientific research, the providing of adequate medical equipment and resources to #fightcancer with her new discovery, education particularly of girls, and of the lower classes.The book is a great joy to read for this and many other stories and reasons. It is written in a style that is as open and frank as it is outdated in style and turns of phrase (and has been translated into dozens of languages - I read the English one by Vincent Sheean, a now forgotten but once highly regarded intellectual himself) - and that is all part of its refreshing charm. It ought to be a staple in #WomensHistory and #ScienceHistory collections @WomensHistory -it's also a great companion to Alcott's and Hugo's classics.It is for anyone who loves a great story of overcoming great odds, of travel to foreign places, of the thrill of intellectual discovery, of the evidence of what can be accomplished in a big life by a little woman."
192,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90419058-kaitlyn,5,"I broke the most ardent rules of book buying and purchased this book mostly for the aesthetic nature of the cover photo. A simple picture of a strikingly focused woman gazing into a glass beaker surrounded by a plethora of Scientific equipment remnant of the 1920s. Madame Curie. I, myself, a woman who has always been filled with a childhood spirit for the sciences and been drawn by its most basic element, discovery. With that in mind, Madame Curie has always been the perfect thematic heroine to my childhood, and a more proper second reason for purchasing this now cherished book.This book is monumental at capturing the authentic life of Ms Curie. It goes beyond our common 7th grade lecture notes , who was the first female Nobel prize winner? This biography delves much deeper than that and into the soul of the genius. From her upbringing in the oppressed lands of Poland where she was first to begin to show a gift for brilliance, to her adolescents where her selfless nature exhibited itself to its highest peak as she bequest her chance at college to her elder sister whom she deemed only fair to get the chance first. Later it discusses in details her at last arrival to the university and her undying commitment to learn and master every point of physics with an almost obsessive compulsion.In the middle of this book or might I say in life’s journey we find ourselves are caught up in the love story of her finding her dear Pierre Currie who by all accounts more so found her and considered Mrs Curie to be his life’s completion. Curie’s together, we find friendship, companionships, discovery, dedication, and remarkable love. For chapters on end we are breathless at the purity of the relationship, at the building of a family full of life, love and brilliance. The successful scientist now nurturing mother, took motherhood seriously and cherished it greatly with pages and pages of loving letters to her daughters. A picturesque scene is formed of a family of four, mother, father and daughters. But with like many grand love stories we are left in tears at its sudden tragic end. Chapters that tore at my very soul.For some this would be the end of genius’s journey, but for Madame Curie, to end her life in science would be more or less to end her life’s meaning, to end her spirit. We walk with her still with pages and pages of research, dedication, successes, awards, accolades, her war efforts, healths demise, and so on. The book is marvelous from beginning to end, filled to the brim of personal letters that convey Madame Curies inner most thoughts. I’m left feeling I lived a lifetime, vibrantly and passionately in the course of just 385 pages. Pages brought to life even more so with the knowledge that they are the writings of Ms Curies very own daughter, Eve Curie. Precious stories gathered together by her greatest admirer and shared with the world so that they can come to truly know the timid lady who poured her soul into the laboratory. One of the worlds greatest minds, who has changed the face of medicine, physics, and chemistry forever with the discovery of Radium and radioactivity. A discovery that would ultimately and almost poetically claim her victim at life’s end. This book will be read and re-read and left suffering on my bookshelf for years to come as it’s pages become worn and binding fragile. And I look forward to the day I can pass it on to my now 6 year old daughter who shares the same innate spirit, a spirit forever in aw of the sciences. "

Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.”― Marie Curie, Madame Curie by Eve CurieSo, I still have the need to talk about Madame Curie before I move on in life because this book was so dear to me. This book is the best biography of Marie Curie, narrated by her own daughter, with lots of letters exchanged. And the fact that Eve Curie was a writer made this book a memorable reading indeed. Not only it portrayed the life of a genius scientist, but also a love story between her and her husband. And a story of a single mother. Born Marya Skłodowska in Tsarist Poland, her life had always been difficult. She lost her mother and a sister since she was very young. The family of 4, father, her older sister, herself and her brother tried to keep life above poverty. At age 17, Marie had to work as a governess, started saving for her dream education and split the rest to help her older sister who was to pursue the Sorbonne.When Marie got accepted to the Sorbonne, she took 3 days train ride to Paris. Lived alone in a tiny room, no heater, not enough money to buy food, she kept studying in that frozen room. To me, Marie Curie wasn't born a genius, but being naturally curious, love of study, have a deep passion for physics and consistency of grit in the face of adversity actually made whom she became. All day long she would study, buried herself in Physics, slept very little, and starved. She wrote to her brother:“Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that? We must have perseverance and above all confidence in ourselves. We must believe that we are gifted for something and that this thing must be attained.”Because this book contained mostly the letters, it really illustrated the true grit from Marie's own words. And also revealed her personality–a vulnerable person.""My life is upset in such a way that it will never be put right again. I think it will always be like this, and I shall not try to live otherwise""Mindfulness living, a letter to her two daughters:✎""My dear children, I send you my best wishes for a happy New Year–that is to say, a year of good health, good humor, and good work, a year in which you will have pleasure in living every day, without waiting for days to be gone before finding charm in them, and without putting all hope of pleasure in the days to come""✎This is only the tiny part from this book and I felt so lucky to have read it. It is emotional reading and enormously inspiring. I can see myself rereading it again. The first reading of my 2019 reading goal, My Year of Reading the Women Pioneers, was already phenomenal, I can not wait to start my second one :)Hope you'll find the opportunity to read Madame Curie. I can't recommend this book highly enough. "
194,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/288297-the-library-lady,5,"I am giving this book 5 stars because it is amazing on so many levels.This is the book that sparked my interest in Marie Curie--and since physics was a torture class for me in high school, that was pretty amazing in itself! But I must have read it around that time, my mother had a paperback copy on her bookshelves, and I wore it out re-reading it.Decades later, I am reading it in a whole new way and I am blown away by it. Eve Curie, Marie's daughter, finished this book only 3 years after her mother's death, and it could have been a sugar dripping, mother glorifying, plastic superwoman story. But it is not.Eve Curie was the only member of the Curie family to NOT become a scientist, but her writing combines scientific analysis with fluid storytelling as she recounts her mother's life. She sees Marie as she was, a very human woman whose life was driven by her brilliant scientific mind. Pierre Curie was her perfect partner, both as a spouse and as a scientist she could share her work with, and his loss impacted the rest of her life. Curie does not say that she and her sister were neglected, and indeed they were not, but she shows Marie's failings and virtues as a mother, not in a ""Mommie Dearest"" way, but in the way of a loving daughter. She gives us Marie at work, but she also gives us Marie at play by the sea, in a lovely chapter that shows the Curie women did have their chances to be happy and together.The one bit of whitewash here is Eve's near silence on Marie's ill fated romance with fellow scientist Paul Langevin. Only a few paragraphs on a single page, and his name is not mentioned:A scientist, devoted to her work, whose life was dignified, reserved and in recent years especially pitiable, was accused of breaking up homes and of dishonoring the name she bore with too much brilliance.You can read what actually happened here  It's not surprising that Curie chooses not to write about that sad episode, and aside from that she tries to give a full picture of her mother as a human being and succeeds.One more note: I didn't know much about Eve Curie beyond this, but she is worthy of a book of her own--perhaps even a novel. She became a pianist, a journalist, a member of the Free French Forces, and the wife of the first Executive Director of UNICEF. She herself was known at the ""First Lady of UNICEF,"" and worked actively with her husband. Unlike her parents and sister, Eve never won a Nobel prize, but her husband won the Nobel Peace Prize! Both Marie and Eve's sister Irene succumbed to radiation related illnesses, but Eve did not. In fact, she lived to be 102. A life well lived, and this book alone would have made it such."
195,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69521493-richard,3,"Madame Curie is a biography of the scientist Marie Sklodowska-Curie by the subject's daughter Eve Curie. She is the daughter who didn't win the Nobel prize. Her mother won two, and her sister won one. The biography is cradle to grave but is really split into three roughly equal sections, her life in Poland, her studies and discovery of radium along with her marriage to Pierre Curie, then her later life of largely unwanted fame.The book is florid in style and you get absolutely no idea of Sklodowska-Curie as a person at all. Indeed, from the biography she appears completely inscrutable. The book is almost the definition of hagiographic and so her motives are entirely opaque. The book puts forwards her life of physically ruinous hard work as coming from some combination of love of country (both Poland and France, the latter of which's academy treated her rather shabbily) and love of science. Not a bad word is written about either of the writer's parents and there is only warmth towards the subjects from the author, they are said to live a life of love and devotion. However, and I understand that it was the style in older pictures to look more serious, when you see them in the old photographs they look absolutely miserable. Eve Curie goes at great lengths to talk about the beauty of her mother, and indeed this sort of devotion and intelligence and tenacity has a kind of beauty, but she means physically so. There is also very little scientific explanation in the book. The discovery of radium, polonium, and actinium, and the great advances made in understanding radioactivity and what this meant in a broader scientific context is not explored at all. This may be due to the fact that the book was written in 1938 and a modern work would be more instructive here.Overall, the book presents a subject who is entirely admirable and inspirational to anyone (Marie's time in the shed trying to discover truth in a squalid environment reminds me of Newton in his own) but you sometimes get the feeling that there is a major facet of her life that is missing and that you are looking at a less than complete portrait of the great scientist."

A life full of commitment and hard work to discover the nature and the edges of scientific knowledge.Must-read biography from her daughter Eve Curie and inspiration to all.“For the admirable gift of himself, and for the magnificent service he renders humanity, what reward does our society offer the scientist? Have these servants of an idea the necessary means of work? Have they an assured existence, sheltered from care? The example of Pierre Curiee, and of others, shows that they have none of these things; and that more often, before they can secure possible working conditions, they have to exhaust their youth and their powers in daily anxieties. Our society, in which reigns an eager desire for riches and luxury, does not understand the value of science. It does not realize that science is a most precious part of its moral patrimony. Nor does it take sufficient cognizance of the fact that science is at the base of all the progress that lightens the burden of life and lessens its suffering. Neither public powers nor private generosity actually accord to science and to scientists the support and the subsidies indispensable to fully effective work.” Rest in peace, Madame Curie."

It is a lovely Polish translation published to commemorate the one hundred anniversary of Marie's birth. I love a slightly anachronistic style of writing corresponding to the times. The book is written so lovingly one might think it is not objective at all, however a lot can be read between the lines. Eve Curie quotes extensively from Marie's letters and notes providing us with the voice of her mother as well as enchanting details from her private life. I enjoyed for example reading about Marie and her daughters' vacation spent in a small village in Brittany called Larcouest in the company of the greatest scientific minds as humble vacationers living as slowly and as simple as possible.The last chapter describes heartbreaking last moments of Marie Curie who died so prematurely still full of plans for the future.I ended up being so completely moved by the dedication to their scientific work, by the passion they shared and the idealism that guided Marie Curie and Pierre Curie throughout their life."

But I finally finished and even though I didn't LOVE it I am still glad I pushed through.Marie Curie certainly was an amazing woman and I learned a lot about her in this book. Since I am a physicist myself (or I am going to be), and a woman, I really believe that this book was a must-read for me.It's not written in a particularly engaging way and even though it is written by her own daughter it feels strangely distant at times. But perhaps that is only fitting for a logical and rational mind like Marie Curie's.So if you have any connection to Science or Poland or Feminism or Cancer Therapy or any other topic that is in relation to Marie Curie, or you are generally interested in her life, I definitely recommend this book, but go in knowing that it can be a bit ... not boring, but also not very captivating, at times."

The whole life story of Marie is beautifully written by Marie's daughter Eve in old Dutch-translated language. The detailed descriptions of the situation in Poland around the end of the 19th century under Soviet regime and Paris in the beginning of the 20th century. About a wonderful woman who sacrificed herself for physical, mathematical and chemistry science. It is funny to read that this lady learned everything about radium while she did not know how to cook herself a meal. It is far less funny to read how she and her husband, both highly-qualified and naturally driven, had to fight for having a laboratory in Paris; just a place to do their experiments. And how friends wrote them letters, expressing their sincere concerns about Marie's physical condition and too-seriousness. It is all passion for wild nature and science. Purity pur sang. "

Part 2 tells us about Marie's life in France. Part 3 speaks about Marie's life after the death of Pierre Curie. This book consists of many letters which were written or received by Marie Curie. Marie Curie wrote many letters to Pierre, Eve, Irene, Henrietta, Bronya etc. This book also has many photographs in it. There is some French in this book. So Maria Sklodowska was born in Warsaw, Poland. She was born in the Sklodowska family. Her parents were teachers. She had three elder sisters and an elder brother. Her siblings were Bronya, Joseph, Helena and Zofia. Zofia died at an early age. Also Maria's mother died. Maria was a very bright student at school. She knew five languages, namely: French, English, German, Russian and Polish. She loved her motherland. Joseph grew up to pursue medicine. Maria finished her high school and she received a gold medal for achieving the first mark. Maria and Bronya made a decision that Maria would work as a governess and earn money for Bronya to study medicine and in turn Bronya would complete her studies and work as a doctor to earn money for Maria's studies. So Maria worked as a governess while Bronya went to Paris, France. Bronya studied medicine at the Sorbonne. Maria fell in love with the eldest son of her employer while she worked as a governess in their house. But the parents refused to accept Maria as a daughter-in-law due to her poverty. Bronya became a gynaecologist. She married a doctor in Paris. Joseph got married. Maria changed her name to Marie because she was now in Paris. She started her studies in Paris. She studied Physics and Mathematics. She fell in love with Pierre Curie. Pierre and Marie got married. They worked together in a shed. After four years of intense research and isolation, they were able to discover Radium and Polonium. Marie named one of the elements as Polonium in honour of her motherland, Poland. Pierre and Marie received the Nobel prize for Physics. Pierre and Marie had two children: Irene and Eve. Pierre died in an accident. Marie felt very lonely, isolated, alone and solitary for sometime. But then she continued her research with indomitable courage. She became very famous. She received the Nobel prize for Chemistry. She started teaching Physics at the Sorbonne. Radium was used to cure cancer and this technique was named as Curietherapy. Irene studied Physics and she became Marie's assistant. Irene married Frederic Joliot. Eve studied music. Irene became a physicist. Eve became a writer. Marie built the Radium institute at Paris, France. She also built the Radium institute at Warsaw, Poland. Marie actively took part in the war by curing patients with Curietherapy. Marie spent her holidays at Larcouëst. She spent holidays with her close friends and her daughters. Irene and Frederic gave birth to a daughter. Marie went to America to receive a gram of radium. She was welcomed warmly by the Americans. Marie never liked fame. Marie's eyes became weak. She could no longer see properly. Also her ears were giving her some problem. Radium had damaged her body, she had stones in her gallbladder​. Also there was some problem in her lungs and in her blood. She eventually died. She had written a book named Radioactivity which was published posthumously​."

But this book encourages me as a woman and as a non-scientist to learn about physics and chemistry. In this book the sciences are adventurous fields that have great, and hopefully good, implications for everyone, and that can still be upended excitingly by new discoveries. That said, the book is clear about the health, personal and financial costs that Marie and Pierre Curie paid for everything they achieved and were honoured for."

Maria Skłodowska-Curie was a brilliant scientist and an amazing person, a real role-model. If you haven't read this book, but are interested in science, history or outstanding people, start reading it.One think I must note: since the book was written by her daughter, some parts of her life are not really written about, as she probably didn't want to believe some rumours or wanted to save her mother's reputation, but I don't think those rumours make her less valuable, they just show that she was a person too. I've read many biographies about her, and though others may be more open about some things, this is far the best showing her as a person by someone who knew her the most."

I’m far from intelligent but I thought this was a great book about a great woman and so anyone who’s considering reading this, I strongly recommend this. This reminded me a lot of The Agony and the Ecstasy by Irving Stone, a biography about Michelangelo Buonarroti (might not be spelt correctly whoops) which was also I great read, and now stands as the favorite book I ever read.

It shows how a woman overcame many obstacles in her life to reach the highest achievements in the scientific world which was dominated by men at the time.

Eve Curie painted a picture of an infallible person, depriving us as readers from knowing the actual woman Madam curie was."

221,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8266629-erich,5,"Once again, one of the great historical moments of scientific discovery (radiation) is achieved against enormous odds, and accompanied by as much apathy, jealousy and intellectual intransigence among scientists and intellectuals as is generally found in the rest of the population. I am not a global-warming naysayer, but Michael Crichton was making very good points about the scientific establishment. And we now know from the science of psychology why it is that intellectuals are typically just as close-minded as the rest of us. The Manifest of the 93, the widespread support for eugenics - both are of her time.Einstein, who Marie also was to become friends with, once famously said that there were all of 3 people in the world who knew how to think. (My late voice teacher also knew Einstein, and confirmed that he told filthy jokes...).In this case, the lack of support for her work was also influenced by the fact that she was Polish, and a woman, notwithstanding Pierre's partnership with her. Marie and her French husband did their work on a scientific university campus - in a literal shack without heat - and this continued well after they won the Nobel Prize. Crichton would also have approved - and probably knew - of the Curies' decision not to claim any material benefits from patenting any part of their discovery, even though that meant their continued research remained highly under-funded for years. They simply believed that the elements of nature belonged to the whole human race, and that it would be a mistake to set any precedent otherwise. This was one of Crichton's most urgent last wishes - that the laws of governments be changed to forbid patenting anything found in nature. It was a theme in his last novel ""Next"", which I've long suspected was an unstated inspiration behind the latest reboot of the ""Planet of the Apes"" films.As it happened, I was simultaneously reading Hanya Yanagihara's ""A Little Life"" - @alittlelifebook - which is very much about a man's limited success in overcoming the aftereffects of a truly horrendous childhood. Marie's life was a good psychological counterpoint for my own sanity. She encountered extremely difficult obstacles just trying to get educated as well as all the early years of research and much of her life after Pierre's early death. But she succeeded - as a human being as well as a scientist, and while the average person knows as much as I did before reading the book - that she discovered radiation, and that she ""worked herself to death"", both statements fairly true - she did in fact live quite a long life for the time.Eve does not shy away from describing her other's flaws, weaknesses, shortcomings as a mother even - she presents a fully realized human being. But it is overall a highly admirable one, and I certainly found that refreshing..Deep into her story, around the time Marie passes her fiftieth year, Eve steps back from her narrative to speak directly to that point:- Well, yes. ""Sympathetic characters"" abound in this story. It is not my fault: they existed.... Marie's companions...would furnish very poor subjects for analysis to our novelists with their liking for dark colors. Strange, abnormal families, these Sklodovskis and Curies, in which parents and children did not hate each other, in which human beings were guided by tenderness, in which nobody listened at doors or dreamed of treacheries and inheritances, in which nobody murdered anybody! - in which everybody was, in fact, perfectly honest! A last thought that speaks so poignantly to our times - Marie truly detested the trappings of her fame, regarded it as a great burden, largely but not solely because it took her away from her time for further research. She did eventually come to a certain rapprochement with it, learning only after a good number of years to wield some the power of her popularity to benefit the causes she believed in - scientific research, the providing of adequate medical equipment and resources to #fightcancer with her new discovery, education particularly of girls, and of the lower classes.The book is a great joy to read for this and many other stories and reasons. It is written in a style that is as open and frank as it is outdated in style and turns of phrase (and has been translated into dozens of languages - I read the English one by Vincent Sheean, a now forgotten but once highly regarded intellectual himself) - and that is all part of its refreshing charm. It ought to be a staple in #WomensHistory and #ScienceHistory collections @WomensHistory -it's also a great companion to Alcott's and Hugo's classics.It is for anyone who loves a great story of overcoming great odds, of travel to foreign places, of the thrill of intellectual discovery, of the evidence of what can be accomplished in a big life by a little woman."
222,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90419058-kaitlyn,5,"I broke the most ardent rules of book buying and purchased this book mostly for the aesthetic nature of the cover photo. A simple picture of a strikingly focused woman gazing into a glass beaker surrounded by a plethora of Scientific equipment remnant of the 1920s. Madame Curie. I, myself, a woman who has always been filled with a childhood spirit for the sciences and been drawn by its most basic element, discovery. With that in mind, Madame Curie has always been the perfect thematic heroine to my childhood, and a more proper second reason for purchasing this now cherished book.This book is monumental at capturing the authentic life of Ms Curie. It goes beyond our common 7th grade lecture notes , who was the first female Nobel prize winner? This biography delves much deeper than that and into the soul of the genius. From her upbringing in the oppressed lands of Poland where she was first to begin to show a gift for brilliance, to her adolescents where her selfless nature exhibited itself to its highest peak as she bequest her chance at college to her elder sister whom she deemed only fair to get the chance first. Later it discusses in details her at last arrival to the university and her undying commitment to learn and master every point of physics with an almost obsessive compulsion.In the middle of this book or might I say in life’s journey we find ourselves are caught up in the love story of her finding her dear Pierre Currie who by all accounts more so found her and considered Mrs Curie to be his life’s completion. Curie’s together, we find friendship, companionships, discovery, dedication, and remarkable love. For chapters on end we are breathless at the purity of the relationship, at the building of a family full of life, love and brilliance. The successful scientist now nurturing mother, took motherhood seriously and cherished it greatly with pages and pages of loving letters to her daughters. A picturesque scene is formed of a family of four, mother, father and daughters. But with like many grand love stories we are left in tears at its sudden tragic end. Chapters that tore at my very soul.For some this would be the end of genius’s journey, but for Madame Curie, to end her life in science would be more or less to end her life’s meaning, to end her spirit. We walk with her still with pages and pages of research, dedication, successes, awards, accolades, her war efforts, healths demise, and so on. The book is marvelous from beginning to end, filled to the brim of personal letters that convey Madame Curies inner most thoughts. I’m left feeling I lived a lifetime, vibrantly and passionately in the course of just 385 pages. Pages brought to life even more so with the knowledge that they are the writings of Ms Curies very own daughter, Eve Curie. Precious stories gathered together by her greatest admirer and shared with the world so that they can come to truly know the timid lady who poured her soul into the laboratory. One of the worlds greatest minds, who has changed the face of medicine, physics, and chemistry forever with the discovery of Radium and radioactivity. A discovery that would ultimately and almost poetically claim her victim at life’s end. This book will be read and re-read and left suffering on my bookshelf for years to come as it’s pages become worn and binding fragile. And I look forward to the day I can pass it on to my now 6 year old daughter who shares the same innate spirit, a spirit forever in aw of the sciences. "

Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.”― Marie Curie, Madame Curie by Eve CurieSo, I still have the need to talk about Madame Curie before I move on in life because this book was so dear to me. This book is the best biography of Marie Curie, narrated by her own daughter, with lots of letters exchanged. And the fact that Eve Curie was a writer made this book a memorable reading indeed. Not only it portrayed the life of a genius scientist, but also a love story between her and her husband. And a story of a single mother. Born Marya Skłodowska in Tsarist Poland, her life had always been difficult. She lost her mother and a sister since she was very young. The family of 4, father, her older sister, herself and her brother tried to keep life above poverty. At age 17, Marie had to work as a governess, started saving for her dream education and split the rest to help her older sister who was to pursue the Sorbonne.When Marie got accepted to the Sorbonne, she took 3 days train ride to Paris. Lived alone in a tiny room, no heater, not enough money to buy food, she kept studying in that frozen room. To me, Marie Curie wasn't born a genius, but being naturally curious, love of study, have a deep passion for physics and consistency of grit in the face of adversity actually made whom she became. All day long she would study, buried herself in Physics, slept very little, and starved. She wrote to her brother:“Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that? We must have perseverance and above all confidence in ourselves. We must believe that we are gifted for something and that this thing must be attained.”Because this book contained mostly the letters, it really illustrated the true grit from Marie's own words. And also revealed her personality–a vulnerable person.""My life is upset in such a way that it will never be put right again. I think it will always be like this, and I shall not try to live otherwise""Mindfulness living, a letter to her two daughters:✎""My dear children, I send you my best wishes for a happy New Year–that is to say, a year of good health, good humor, and good work, a year in which you will have pleasure in living every day, without waiting for days to be gone before finding charm in them, and without putting all hope of pleasure in the days to come""✎This is only the tiny part from this book and I felt so lucky to have read it. It is emotional reading and enormously inspiring. I can see myself rereading it again. The first reading of my 2019 reading goal, My Year of Reading the Women Pioneers, was already phenomenal, I can not wait to start my second one :)Hope you'll find the opportunity to read Madame Curie. I can't recommend this book highly enough. "
224,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/288297-the-library-lady,5,"I am giving this book 5 stars because it is amazing on so many levels.This is the book that sparked my interest in Marie Curie--and since physics was a torture class for me in high school, that was pretty amazing in itself! But I must have read it around that time, my mother had a paperback copy on her bookshelves, and I wore it out re-reading it.Decades later, I am reading it in a whole new way and I am blown away by it. Eve Curie, Marie's daughter, finished this book only 3 years after her mother's death, and it could have been a sugar dripping, mother glorifying, plastic superwoman story. But it is not.Eve Curie was the only member of the Curie family to NOT become a scientist, but her writing combines scientific analysis with fluid storytelling as she recounts her mother's life. She sees Marie as she was, a very human woman whose life was driven by her brilliant scientific mind. Pierre Curie was her perfect partner, both as a spouse and as a scientist she could share her work with, and his loss impacted the rest of her life. Curie does not say that she and her sister were neglected, and indeed they were not, but she shows Marie's failings and virtues as a mother, not in a ""Mommie Dearest"" way, but in the way of a loving daughter. She gives us Marie at work, but she also gives us Marie at play by the sea, in a lovely chapter that shows the Curie women did have their chances to be happy and together.The one bit of whitewash here is Eve's near silence on Marie's ill fated romance with fellow scientist Paul Langevin. Only a few paragraphs on a single page, and his name is not mentioned:A scientist, devoted to her work, whose life was dignified, reserved and in recent years especially pitiable, was accused of breaking up homes and of dishonoring the name she bore with too much brilliance.You can read what actually happened here  It's not surprising that Curie chooses not to write about that sad episode, and aside from that she tries to give a full picture of her mother as a human being and succeeds.One more note: I didn't know much about Eve Curie beyond this, but she is worthy of a book of her own--perhaps even a novel. She became a pianist, a journalist, a member of the Free French Forces, and the wife of the first Executive Director of UNICEF. She herself was known at the ""First Lady of UNICEF,"" and worked actively with her husband. Unlike her parents and sister, Eve never won a Nobel prize, but her husband won the Nobel Peace Prize! Both Marie and Eve's sister Irene succumbed to radiation related illnesses, but Eve did not. In fact, she lived to be 102. A life well lived, and this book alone would have made it such."
225,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69521493-richard,3,"Madame Curie is a biography of the scientist Marie Sklodowska-Curie by the subject's daughter Eve Curie. She is the daughter who didn't win the Nobel prize. Her mother won two, and her sister won one. The biography is cradle to grave but is really split into three roughly equal sections, her life in Poland, her studies and discovery of radium along with her marriage to Pierre Curie, then her later life of largely unwanted fame.The book is florid in style and you get absolutely no idea of Sklodowska-Curie as a person at all. Indeed, from the biography she appears completely inscrutable. The book is almost the definition of hagiographic and so her motives are entirely opaque. The book puts forwards her life of physically ruinous hard work as coming from some combination of love of country (both Poland and France, the latter of which's academy treated her rather shabbily) and love of science. Not a bad word is written about either of the writer's parents and there is only warmth towards the subjects from the author, they are said to live a life of love and devotion. However, and I understand that it was the style in older pictures to look more serious, when you see them in the old photographs they look absolutely miserable. Eve Curie goes at great lengths to talk about the beauty of her mother, and indeed this sort of devotion and intelligence and tenacity has a kind of beauty, but she means physically so. There is also very little scientific explanation in the book. The discovery of radium, polonium, and actinium, and the great advances made in understanding radioactivity and what this meant in a broader scientific context is not explored at all. This may be due to the fact that the book was written in 1938 and a modern work would be more instructive here.Overall, the book presents a subject who is entirely admirable and inspirational to anyone (Marie's time in the shed trying to discover truth in a squalid environment reminds me of Newton in his own) but you sometimes get the feeling that there is a major facet of her life that is missing and that you are looking at a less than complete portrait of the great scientist."

A life full of commitment and hard work to discover the nature and the edges of scientific knowledge.Must-read biography from her daughter Eve Curie and inspiration to all.“For the admirable gift of himself, and for the magnificent service he renders humanity, what reward does our society offer the scientist? Have these servants of an idea the necessary means of work? Have they an assured existence, sheltered from care? The example of Pierre Curiee, and of others, shows that they have none of these things; and that more often, before they can secure possible working conditions, they have to exhaust their youth and their powers in daily anxieties. Our society, in which reigns an eager desire for riches and luxury, does not understand the value of science. It does not realize that science is a most precious part of its moral patrimony. Nor does it take sufficient cognizance of the fact that science is at the base of all the progress that lightens the burden of life and lessens its suffering. Neither public powers nor private generosity actually accord to science and to scientists the support and the subsidies indispensable to fully effective work.” Rest in peace, Madame Curie."

It is a lovely Polish translation published to commemorate the one hundred anniversary of Marie's birth. I love a slightly anachronistic style of writing corresponding to the times. The book is written so lovingly one might think it is not objective at all, however a lot can be read between the lines. Eve Curie quotes extensively from Marie's letters and notes providing us with the voice of her mother as well as enchanting details from her private life. I enjoyed for example reading about Marie and her daughters' vacation spent in a small village in Brittany called Larcouest in the company of the greatest scientific minds as humble vacationers living as slowly and as simple as possible.The last chapter describes heartbreaking last moments of Marie Curie who died so prematurely still full of plans for the future.I ended up being so completely moved by the dedication to their scientific work, by the passion they shared and the idealism that guided Marie Curie and Pierre Curie throughout their life."

But I finally finished and even though I didn't LOVE it I am still glad I pushed through.Marie Curie certainly was an amazing woman and I learned a lot about her in this book. Since I am a physicist myself (or I am going to be), and a woman, I really believe that this book was a must-read for me.It's not written in a particularly engaging way and even though it is written by her own daughter it feels strangely distant at times. But perhaps that is only fitting for a logical and rational mind like Marie Curie's.So if you have any connection to Science or Poland or Feminism or Cancer Therapy or any other topic that is in relation to Marie Curie, or you are generally interested in her life, I definitely recommend this book, but go in knowing that it can be a bit ... not boring, but also not very captivating, at times."

The whole life story of Marie is beautifully written by Marie's daughter Eve in old Dutch-translated language. The detailed descriptions of the situation in Poland around the end of the 19th century under Soviet regime and Paris in the beginning of the 20th century. About a wonderful woman who sacrificed herself for physical, mathematical and chemistry science. It is funny to read that this lady learned everything about radium while she did not know how to cook herself a meal. It is far less funny to read how she and her husband, both highly-qualified and naturally driven, had to fight for having a laboratory in Paris; just a place to do their experiments. And how friends wrote them letters, expressing their sincere concerns about Marie's physical condition and too-seriousness. It is all passion for wild nature and science. Purity pur sang. "

Her siblings were Bronya, Joseph, Helena and Zofia. Zofia died at an early age. Also Maria's mother died. Maria was a very bright student at school. She knew five languages, namely: French, English, German, Russian and Polish. She loved her motherland. Joseph grew up to pursue medicine. Maria finished her high school and she received a gold medal for achieving the first mark. Maria and Bronya made a decision that Maria would work as a governess and earn money for Bronya to study medicine and in turn Bronya would complete her studies and work as a doctor to earn money for Maria's studies. So Maria worked as a governess while Bronya went to Paris, France. Bronya studied medicine at the Sorbonne. Maria fell in love with the eldest son of her employer while she worked as a governess in their house. But the parents refused to accept Maria as a daughter-in-law due to her poverty. Bronya became a gynaecologist. She married a doctor in Paris. Joseph got married. Maria changed her name to Marie because she was now in Paris. She started her studies in Paris. She studied Physics and Mathematics. She fell in love with Pierre Curie. Pierre and Marie got married. They worked together in a shed. After four years of intense research and isolation, they were able to discover Radium and Polonium. Marie named one of the elements as Polonium in honour of her motherland, Poland. Pierre and Marie received the Nobel prize for Physics. Pierre and Marie had two children: Irene and Eve. Pierre died in an accident. Marie felt very lonely, isolated, alone and solitary for sometime. But then she continued her research with indomitable courage. She became very famous. She received the Nobel prize for Chemistry. She started teaching Physics at the Sorbonne. Radium was used to cure cancer and this technique was named as Curietherapy. Irene studied Physics and she became Marie's assistant. Irene married Frederic Joliot. Eve studied music. Irene became a physicist. Eve became a writer. Marie built the Radium institute at Paris, France. She also built the Radium institute at Warsaw, Poland. Marie actively took part in the war by curing patients with Curietherapy. Marie spent her holidays at Larcouëst. She spent holidays with her close friends and her daughters. Irene and Frederic gave birth to a daughter. Marie went to America to receive a gram of radium. She was welcomed warmly by the Americans. Marie never liked fame. Marie's eyes became weak. She could no longer see properly. Also her ears were giving her some problem. Radium had damaged her body, she had stones in her gallbladder​. Also there was some problem in her lungs and in her blood. She eventually died. She had written a book named Radioactivity which was published posthumously​."

But this book encourages me as a woman and as a non-scientist to learn about physics and chemistry. In this book the sciences are adventurous fields that have great, and hopefully good, implications for everyone, and that can still be upended excitingly by new discoveries. That said, the book is clear about the health, personal and financial costs that Marie and Pierre Curie paid for everything they achieved and were honoured for."

Maria Skłodowska-Curie was a brilliant scientist and an amazing person, a real role-model. If you haven't read this book, but are interested in science, history or outstanding people, start reading it.One think I must note: since the book was written by her daughter, some parts of her life are not really written about, as she probably didn't want to believe some rumours or wanted to save her mother's reputation, but I don't think those rumours make her less valuable, they just show that she was a person too. I've read many biographies about her, and though others may be more open about some things, this is far the best showing her as a person by someone who knew her the most."

The hardships that Madame faced along with her beloved, Pierre to break through the stigma in the early 1900's.

My dad picked this up at a thrift store somewhere and after he read it, he urged me to read it as well, and so I did. I’m far from intelligent but I thought this was a great book about a great woman and so anyone who’s considering reading this, I strongly recommend this. This reminded me a lot of The Agony and the Ecstasy by Irving Stone, a biography about Michelangelo Buonarroti (might not be spelt correctly whoops) which was also I great read, and now stands as the favorite book I ever read. This book comes very close to that. :)"

It shows how a woman overcame many obstacles in her life to reach the highest achievements in the scientific world which was dominated by men at the time. My only criticism is that the writing style of the author, who also happens to be the daughter of Madame Curie, is a kind of hero worship. It was not the more objective style which I have grown accustomed to for biographical works like this. "

I just finished reading this, while my heart is appropriately humbled, my mind is emboldened with courage. Every scientist, everyone should read this book to learn of a determined life."

It is expected that the daughter would revere such a figure. In most cases, the beauty of a biography is in showing the positives traits of the person, as well as the negatives. Eve Curie painted a picture of an infallible person, depriving us as readers from knowing the actual woman Madam curie was."

The book is written by her daughter and has quite a lot of hero worship. Marie is talked about in entirely positive ways.

251,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8266629-erich,5,"Once again, one of the great historical moments of scientific discovery (radiation) is achieved against enormous odds, and accompanied by as much apathy, jealousy and intellectual intransigence among scientists and intellectuals as is generally found in the rest of the population. I am not a global-warming naysayer, but Michael Crichton was making very good points about the scientific establishment. And we now know from the science of psychology why it is that intellectuals are typically just as close-minded as the rest of us. The Manifest of the 93, the widespread support for eugenics - both are of her time.Einstein, who Marie also was to become friends with, once famously said that there were all of 3 people in the world who knew how to think. (My late voice teacher also knew Einstein, and confirmed that he told filthy jokes...).In this case, the lack of support for her work was also influenced by the fact that she was Polish, and a woman, notwithstanding Pierre's partnership with her. Marie and her French husband did their work on a scientific university campus - in a literal shack without heat - and this continued well after they won the Nobel Prize. Crichton would also have approved - and probably knew - of the Curies' decision not to claim any material benefits from patenting any part of their discovery, even though that meant their continued research remained highly under-funded for years. They simply believed that the elements of nature belonged to the whole human race, and that it would be a mistake to set any precedent otherwise. This was one of Crichton's most urgent last wishes - that the laws of governments be changed to forbid patenting anything found in nature. It was a theme in his last novel ""Next"", which I've long suspected was an unstated inspiration behind the latest reboot of the ""Planet of the Apes"" films.As it happened, I was simultaneously reading Hanya Yanagihara's ""A Little Life"" - @alittlelifebook - which is very much about a man's limited success in overcoming the aftereffects of a truly horrendous childhood. Marie's life was a good psychological counterpoint for my own sanity. She encountered extremely difficult obstacles just trying to get educated as well as all the early years of research and much of her life after Pierre's early death. But she succeeded - as a human being as well as a scientist, and while the average person knows as much as I did before reading the book - that she discovered radiation, and that she ""worked herself to death"", both statements fairly true - she did in fact live quite a long life for the time.Eve does not shy away from describing her other's flaws, weaknesses, shortcomings as a mother even - she presents a fully realized human being. But it is overall a highly admirable one, and I certainly found that refreshing..Deep into her story, around the time Marie passes her fiftieth year, Eve steps back from her narrative to speak directly to that point:- Well, yes. ""Sympathetic characters"" abound in this story. It is not my fault: they existed.... Marie's companions...would furnish very poor subjects for analysis to our novelists with their liking for dark colors. Strange, abnormal families, these Sklodovskis and Curies, in which parents and children did not hate each other, in which human beings were guided by tenderness, in which nobody listened at doors or dreamed of treacheries and inheritances, in which nobody murdered anybody! - in which everybody was, in fact, perfectly honest! A last thought that speaks so poignantly to our times - Marie truly detested the trappings of her fame, regarded it as a great burden, largely but not solely because it took her away from her time for further research. She did eventually come to a certain rapprochement with it, learning only after a good number of years to wield some the power of her popularity to benefit the causes she believed in - scientific research, the providing of adequate medical equipment and resources to #fightcancer with her new discovery, education particularly of girls, and of the lower classes.The book is a great joy to read for this and many other stories and reasons. It is written in a style that is as open and frank as it is outdated in style and turns of phrase (and has been translated into dozens of languages - I read the English one by Vincent Sheean, a now forgotten but once highly regarded intellectual himself) - and that is all part of its refreshing charm. It ought to be a staple in #WomensHistory and #ScienceHistory collections @WomensHistory -it's also a great companion to Alcott's and Hugo's classics.It is for anyone who loves a great story of overcoming great odds, of travel to foreign places, of the thrill of intellectual discovery, of the evidence of what can be accomplished in a big life by a little woman."
252,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90419058-kaitlyn,5,"I broke the most ardent rules of book buying and purchased this book mostly for the aesthetic nature of the cover photo. A simple picture of a strikingly focused woman gazing into a glass beaker surrounded by a plethora of Scientific equipment remnant of the 1920s. Madame Curie. I, myself, a woman who has always been filled with a childhood spirit for the sciences and been drawn by its most basic element, discovery. With that in mind, Madame Curie has always been the perfect thematic heroine to my childhood, and a more proper second reason for purchasing this now cherished book.This book is monumental at capturing the authentic life of Ms Curie. It goes beyond our common 7th grade lecture notes , who was the first female Nobel prize winner? This biography delves much deeper than that and into the soul of the genius. From her upbringing in the oppressed lands of Poland where she was first to begin to show a gift for brilliance, to her adolescents where her selfless nature exhibited itself to its highest peak as she bequest her chance at college to her elder sister whom she deemed only fair to get the chance first. Later it discusses in details her at last arrival to the university and her undying commitment to learn and master every point of physics with an almost obsessive compulsion.In the middle of this book or might I say in life’s journey we find ourselves are caught up in the love story of her finding her dear Pierre Currie who by all accounts more so found her and considered Mrs Curie to be his life’s completion. Curie’s together, we find friendship, companionships, discovery, dedication, and remarkable love. For chapters on end we are breathless at the purity of the relationship, at the building of a family full of life, love and brilliance. The successful scientist now nurturing mother, took motherhood seriously and cherished it greatly with pages and pages of loving letters to her daughters. A picturesque scene is formed of a family of four, mother, father and daughters. But with like many grand love stories we are left in tears at its sudden tragic end. Chapters that tore at my very soul.For some this would be the end of genius’s journey, but for Madame Curie, to end her life in science would be more or less to end her life’s meaning, to end her spirit. We walk with her still with pages and pages of research, dedication, successes, awards, accolades, her war efforts, healths demise, and so on. The book is marvelous from beginning to end, filled to the brim of personal letters that convey Madame Curies inner most thoughts. I’m left feeling I lived a lifetime, vibrantly and passionately in the course of just 385 pages. Pages brought to life even more so with the knowledge that they are the writings of Ms Curies very own daughter, Eve Curie. Precious stories gathered together by her greatest admirer and shared with the world so that they can come to truly know the timid lady who poured her soul into the laboratory. One of the worlds greatest minds, who has changed the face of medicine, physics, and chemistry forever with the discovery of Radium and radioactivity. A discovery that would ultimately and almost poetically claim her victim at life’s end. This book will be read and re-read and left suffering on my bookshelf for years to come as it’s pages become worn and binding fragile. And I look forward to the day I can pass it on to my now 6 year old daughter who shares the same innate spirit, a spirit forever in aw of the sciences. "

Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.”― Marie Curie, Madame Curie by Eve CurieSo, I still have the need to talk about Madame Curie before I move on in life because this book was so dear to me. This book is the best biography of Marie Curie, narrated by her own daughter, with lots of letters exchanged. And the fact that Eve Curie was a writer made this book a memorable reading indeed. Not only it portrayed the life of a genius scientist, but also a love story between her and her husband. And a story of a single mother. Born Marya Skłodowska in Tsarist Poland, her life had always been difficult. She lost her mother and a sister since she was very young. The family of 4, father, her older sister, herself and her brother tried to keep life above poverty. At age 17, Marie had to work as a governess, started saving for her dream education and split the rest to help her older sister who was to pursue the Sorbonne.When Marie got accepted to the Sorbonne, she took 3 days train ride to Paris. Lived alone in a tiny room, no heater, not enough money to buy food, she kept studying in that frozen room. To me, Marie Curie wasn't born a genius, but being naturally curious, love of study, have a deep passion for physics and consistency of grit in the face of adversity actually made whom she became. All day long she would study, buried herself in Physics, slept very little, and starved. She wrote to her brother:“Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that? We must have perseverance and above all confidence in ourselves. We must believe that we are gifted for something and that this thing must be attained.”Because this book contained mostly the letters, it really illustrated the true grit from Marie's own words. And also revealed her personality–a vulnerable person.""My life is upset in such a way that it will never be put right again. I think it will always be like this, and I shall not try to live otherwise""Mindfulness living, a letter to her two daughters:✎""My dear children, I send you my best wishes for a happy New Year–that is to say, a year of good health, good humor, and good work, a year in which you will have pleasure in living every day, without waiting for days to be gone before finding charm in them, and without putting all hope of pleasure in the days to come""✎This is only the tiny part from this book and I felt so lucky to have read it. It is emotional reading and enormously inspiring. I can see myself rereading it again. The first reading of my 2019 reading goal, My Year of Reading the Women Pioneers, was already phenomenal, I can not wait to start my second one :)Hope you'll find the opportunity to read Madame Curie. I can't recommend this book highly enough. "
254,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/288297-the-library-lady,5,"I am giving this book 5 stars because it is amazing on so many levels.This is the book that sparked my interest in Marie Curie--and since physics was a torture class for me in high school, that was pretty amazing in itself! But I must have read it around that time, my mother had a paperback copy on her bookshelves, and I wore it out re-reading it.Decades later, I am reading it in a whole new way and I am blown away by it. Eve Curie, Marie's daughter, finished this book only 3 years after her mother's death, and it could have been a sugar dripping, mother glorifying, plastic superwoman story. But it is not.Eve Curie was the only member of the Curie family to NOT become a scientist, but her writing combines scientific analysis with fluid storytelling as she recounts her mother's life. She sees Marie as she was, a very human woman whose life was driven by her brilliant scientific mind. Pierre Curie was her perfect partner, both as a spouse and as a scientist she could share her work with, and his loss impacted the rest of her life. Curie does not say that she and her sister were neglected, and indeed they were not, but she shows Marie's failings and virtues as a mother, not in a ""Mommie Dearest"" way, but in the way of a loving daughter. She gives us Marie at work, but she also gives us Marie at play by the sea, in a lovely chapter that shows the Curie women did have their chances to be happy and together.The one bit of whitewash here is Eve's near silence on Marie's ill fated romance with fellow scientist Paul Langevin. Only a few paragraphs on a single page, and his name is not mentioned:A scientist, devoted to her work, whose life was dignified, reserved and in recent years especially pitiable, was accused of breaking up homes and of dishonoring the name she bore with too much brilliance.You can read what actually happened here  It's not surprising that Curie chooses not to write about that sad episode, and aside from that she tries to give a full picture of her mother as a human being and succeeds.One more note: I didn't know much about Eve Curie beyond this, but she is worthy of a book of her own--perhaps even a novel. She became a pianist, a journalist, a member of the Free French Forces, and the wife of the first Executive Director of UNICEF. She herself was known at the ""First Lady of UNICEF,"" and worked actively with her husband. Unlike her parents and sister, Eve never won a Nobel prize, but her husband won the Nobel Peace Prize! Both Marie and Eve's sister Irene succumbed to radiation related illnesses, but Eve did not. In fact, she lived to be 102. A life well lived, and this book alone would have made it such."
255,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69521493-richard,3,"Madame Curie is a biography of the scientist Marie Sklodowska-Curie by the subject's daughter Eve Curie. She is the daughter who didn't win the Nobel prize. Her mother won two, and her sister won one. The biography is cradle to grave but is really split into three roughly equal sections, her life in Poland, her studies and discovery of radium along with her marriage to Pierre Curie, then her later life of largely unwanted fame.The book is florid in style and you get absolutely no idea of Sklodowska-Curie as a person at all. Indeed, from the biography she appears completely inscrutable. The book is almost the definition of hagiographic and so her motives are entirely opaque. The book puts forwards her life of physically ruinous hard work as coming from some combination of love of country (both Poland and France, the latter of which's academy treated her rather shabbily) and love of science. Not a bad word is written about either of the writer's parents and there is only warmth towards the subjects from the author, they are said to live a life of love and devotion. However, and I understand that it was the style in older pictures to look more serious, when you see them in the old photographs they look absolutely miserable. Eve Curie goes at great lengths to talk about the beauty of her mother, and indeed this sort of devotion and intelligence and tenacity has a kind of beauty, but she means physically so. There is also very little scientific explanation in the book. The discovery of radium, polonium, and actinium, and the great advances made in understanding radioactivity and what this meant in a broader scientific context is not explored at all. This may be due to the fact that the book was written in 1938 and a modern work would be more instructive here.Overall, the book presents a subject who is entirely admirable and inspirational to anyone (Marie's time in the shed trying to discover truth in a squalid environment reminds me of Newton in his own) but you sometimes get the feeling that there is a major facet of her life that is missing and that you are looking at a less than complete portrait of the great scientist."

A life full of commitment and hard work to discover the nature and the edges of scientific knowledge.Must-read biography from her daughter Eve Curie and inspiration to all.“For the admirable gift of himself, and for the magnificent service he renders humanity, what reward does our society offer the scientist? Have these servants of an idea the necessary means of work? Have they an assured existence, sheltered from care? The example of Pierre Curiee, and of others, shows that they have none of these things; and that more often, before they can secure possible working conditions, they have to exhaust their youth and their powers in daily anxieties. Our society, in which reigns an eager desire for riches and luxury, does not understand the value of science. It does not realize that science is a most precious part of its moral patrimony. Nor does it take sufficient cognizance of the fact that science is at the base of all the progress that lightens the burden of life and lessens its suffering. Neither public powers nor private generosity actually accord to science and to scientists the support and the subsidies indispensable to fully effective work.” Rest in peace, Madame Curie."

It is a lovely Polish translation published to commemorate the one hundred anniversary of Marie's birth. I love a slightly anachronistic style of writing corresponding to the times. The book is written so lovingly one might think it is not objective at all, however a lot can be read between the lines. Eve Curie quotes extensively from Marie's letters and notes providing us with the voice of her mother as well as enchanting details from her private life. I enjoyed for example reading about Marie and her daughters' vacation spent in a small village in Brittany called Larcouest in the company of the greatest scientific minds as humble vacationers living as slowly and as simple as possible.The last chapter describes heartbreaking last moments of Marie Curie who died so prematurely still full of plans for the future.I ended up being so completely moved by the dedication to their scientific work, by the passion they shared and the idealism that guided Marie Curie and Pierre Curie throughout their life."

But I finally finished and even though I didn't LOVE it I am still glad I pushed through.Marie Curie certainly was an amazing woman and I learned a lot about her in this book. Since I am a physicist myself (or I am going to be), and a woman, I really believe that this book was a must-read for me.It's not written in a particularly engaging way and even though it is written by her own daughter it feels strangely distant at times. But perhaps that is only fitting for a logical and rational mind like Marie Curie's.So if you have any connection to Science or Poland or Feminism or Cancer Therapy or any other topic that is in relation to Marie Curie, or you are generally interested in her life, I definitely recommend this book, but go in knowing that it can be a bit ... not boring, but also not very captivating, at times."

The whole life story of Marie is beautifully written by Marie's daughter Eve in old Dutch-translated language. The detailed descriptions of the situation in Poland around the end of the 19th century under Soviet regime and Paris in the beginning of the 20th century. About a wonderful woman who sacrificed herself for physical, mathematical and chemistry science. It is funny to read that this lady learned everything about radium while she did not know how to cook herself a meal. It is far less funny to read how she and her husband, both highly-qualified and naturally driven, had to fight for having a laboratory in Paris; just a place to do their experiments. And how friends wrote them letters, expressing their sincere concerns about Marie's physical condition and too-seriousness. It is all passion for wild nature and science. Purity pur sang. "

Part 2 tells us about Marie's life in France. Part 3 speaks about Marie's life after the death of Pierre Curie. This book consists of many letters which were written or received by Marie Curie. Marie Curie wrote many letters to Pierre, Eve, Irene, Henrietta, Bronya etc. This book also has many photographs in it. There is some French in this book. So Maria Sklodowska was born in Warsaw, Poland. She was born in the Sklodowska family. Her parents were teachers. She had three elder sisters and an elder brother. Her siblings were Bronya, Joseph, Helena and Zofia. Zofia died at an early age. Also Maria's mother died. Maria was a very bright student at school. She knew five languages, namely: French, English, German, Russian and Polish. She loved her motherland. Joseph grew up to pursue medicine. Maria finished her high school and she received a gold medal for achieving the first mark. Maria and Bronya made a decision that Maria would work as a governess and earn money for Bronya to study medicine and in turn Bronya would complete her studies and work as a doctor to earn money for Maria's studies. So Maria worked as a governess while Bronya went to Paris, France. Bronya studied medicine at the Sorbonne. Maria fell in love with the eldest son of her employer while she worked as a governess in their house. But the parents refused to accept Maria as a daughter-in-law due to her poverty. Bronya became a gynaecologist. She married a doctor in Paris. Joseph got married. Maria changed her name to Marie because she was now in Paris. She started her studies in Paris. She studied Physics and Mathematics. She fell in love with Pierre Curie. Pierre and Marie got married. They worked together in a shed. After four years of intense research and isolation, they were able to discover Radium and Polonium. Marie named one of the elements as Polonium in honour of her motherland, Poland. Pierre and Marie received the Nobel prize for Physics. Pierre and Marie had two children: Irene and Eve. Pierre died in an accident. Marie felt very lonely, isolated, alone and solitary for sometime. But then she continued her research with indomitable courage. She became very famous. She received the Nobel prize for Chemistry. She started teaching Physics at the Sorbonne. Radium was used to cure cancer and this technique was named as Curietherapy. Irene studied Physics and she became Marie's assistant. Irene married Frederic Joliot. Eve studied music. Irene became a physicist. Eve became a writer. Marie built the Radium institute at Paris, France. She also built the Radium institute at Warsaw, Poland. Marie actively took part in the war by curing patients with Curietherapy. Marie spent her holidays at Larcouëst. She spent holidays with her close friends and her daughters. Irene and Frederic gave birth to a daughter. Marie went to America to receive a gram of radium. She was welcomed warmly by the Americans. Marie never liked fame. Marie's eyes became weak. She could no longer see properly. Also her ears were giving her some problem. Radium had damaged her body, she had stones in her gallbladder​. Also there was some problem in her lungs and in her blood. She eventually died. She had written a book named Radioactivity which was published posthumously​."

But this book encourages me as a woman and as a non-scientist to learn about physics and chemistry. In this book the sciences are adventurous fields that have great, and hopefully good, implications for everyone, and that can still be upended excitingly by new discoveries. That said, the book is clear about the health, personal and financial costs that Marie and Pierre Curie paid for everything they achieved and were honoured for."

Maria Skłodowska-Curie was a brilliant scientist and an amazing person, a real role-model. If you haven't read this book, but are interested in science, history or outstanding people, start reading it.One think I must note: since the book was written by her daughter, some parts of her life are not really written about, as she probably didn't want to believe some rumours or wanted to save her mother's reputation, but I don't think those rumours make her less valuable, they just show that she was a person too. I've read many biographies about her, and though others may be more open about some things, this is far the best showing her as a person by someone who knew her the most."

I’m far from intelligent but I thought this was a great book about a great woman and so anyone who’s considering reading this, I strongly recommend this.

It shows how a woman overcame many obstacles in her life to reach the highest achievements in the scientific world which was dominated by men at the time.

281,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8266629-erich,5,"Once again, one of the great historical moments of scientific discovery (radiation) is achieved against enormous odds, and accompanied by as much apathy, jealousy and intellectual intransigence among scientists and intellectuals as is generally found in the rest of the population. I am not a global-warming naysayer, but Michael Crichton was making very good points about the scientific establishment. And we now know from the science of psychology why it is that intellectuals are typically just as close-minded as the rest of us. The Manifest of the 93, the widespread support for eugenics - both are of her time.Einstein, who Marie also was to become friends with, once famously said that there were all of 3 people in the world who knew how to think. (My late voice teacher also knew Einstein, and confirmed that he told filthy jokes...).In this case, the lack of support for her work was also influenced by the fact that she was Polish, and a woman, notwithstanding Pierre's partnership with her. Marie and her French husband did their work on a scientific university campus - in a literal shack without heat - and this continued well after they won the Nobel Prize. Crichton would also have approved - and probably knew - of the Curies' decision not to claim any material benefits from patenting any part of their discovery, even though that meant their continued research remained highly under-funded for years. They simply believed that the elements of nature belonged to the whole human race, and that it would be a mistake to set any precedent otherwise. This was one of Crichton's most urgent last wishes - that the laws of governments be changed to forbid patenting anything found in nature. It was a theme in his last novel ""Next"", which I've long suspected was an unstated inspiration behind the latest reboot of the ""Planet of the Apes"" films.As it happened, I was simultaneously reading Hanya Yanagihara's ""A Little Life"" - @alittlelifebook - which is very much about a man's limited success in overcoming the aftereffects of a truly horrendous childhood. Marie's life was a good psychological counterpoint for my own sanity. She encountered extremely difficult obstacles just trying to get educated as well as all the early years of research and much of her life after Pierre's early death. But she succeeded - as a human being as well as a scientist, and while the average person knows as much as I did before reading the book - that she discovered radiation, and that she ""worked herself to death"", both statements fairly true - she did in fact live quite a long life for the time.Eve does not shy away from describing her other's flaws, weaknesses, shortcomings as a mother even - she presents a fully realized human being. But it is overall a highly admirable one, and I certainly found that refreshing..Deep into her story, around the time Marie passes her fiftieth year, Eve steps back from her narrative to speak directly to that point:- Well, yes. ""Sympathetic characters"" abound in this story. It is not my fault: they existed.... Marie's companions...would furnish very poor subjects for analysis to our novelists with their liking for dark colors. Strange, abnormal families, these Sklodovskis and Curies, in which parents and children did not hate each other, in which human beings were guided by tenderness, in which nobody listened at doors or dreamed of treacheries and inheritances, in which nobody murdered anybody! - in which everybody was, in fact, perfectly honest! A last thought that speaks so poignantly to our times - Marie truly detested the trappings of her fame, regarded it as a great burden, largely but not solely because it took her away from her time for further research. She did eventually come to a certain rapprochement with it, learning only after a good number of years to wield some the power of her popularity to benefit the causes she believed in - scientific research, the providing of adequate medical equipment and resources to #fightcancer with her new discovery, education particularly of girls, and of the lower classes.The book is a great joy to read for this and many other stories and reasons. It is written in a style that is as open and frank as it is outdated in style and turns of phrase (and has been translated into dozens of languages - I read the English one by Vincent Sheean, a now forgotten but once highly regarded intellectual himself) - and that is all part of its refreshing charm. It ought to be a staple in #WomensHistory and #ScienceHistory collections @WomensHistory -it's also a great companion to Alcott's and Hugo's classics.It is for anyone who loves a great story of overcoming great odds, of travel to foreign places, of the thrill of intellectual discovery, of the evidence of what can be accomplished in a big life by a little woman."
282,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90419058-kaitlyn,5,"I broke the most ardent rules of book buying and purchased this book mostly for the aesthetic nature of the cover photo. A simple picture of a strikingly focused woman gazing into a glass beaker surrounded by a plethora of Scientific equipment remnant of the 1920s. Madame Curie. I, myself, a woman who has always been filled with a childhood spirit for the sciences and been drawn by its most basic element, discovery. With that in mind, Madame Curie has always been the perfect thematic heroine to my childhood, and a more proper second reason for purchasing this now cherished book.This book is monumental at capturing the authentic life of Ms Curie. It goes beyond our common 7th grade lecture notes , who was the first female Nobel prize winner? This biography delves much deeper than that and into the soul of the genius. From her upbringing in the oppressed lands of Poland where she was first to begin to show a gift for brilliance, to her adolescents where her selfless nature exhibited itself to its highest peak as she bequest her chance at college to her elder sister whom she deemed only fair to get the chance first. Later it discusses in details her at last arrival to the university and her undying commitment to learn and master every point of physics with an almost obsessive compulsion.In the middle of this book or might I say in life’s journey we find ourselves are caught up in the love story of her finding her dear Pierre Currie who by all accounts more so found her and considered Mrs Curie to be his life’s completion. Curie’s together, we find friendship, companionships, discovery, dedication, and remarkable love. For chapters on end we are breathless at the purity of the relationship, at the building of a family full of life, love and brilliance. The successful scientist now nurturing mother, took motherhood seriously and cherished it greatly with pages and pages of loving letters to her daughters. A picturesque scene is formed of a family of four, mother, father and daughters. But with like many grand love stories we are left in tears at its sudden tragic end. Chapters that tore at my very soul.For some this would be the end of genius’s journey, but for Madame Curie, to end her life in science would be more or less to end her life’s meaning, to end her spirit. We walk with her still with pages and pages of research, dedication, successes, awards, accolades, her war efforts, healths demise, and so on. The book is marvelous from beginning to end, filled to the brim of personal letters that convey Madame Curies inner most thoughts. I’m left feeling I lived a lifetime, vibrantly and passionately in the course of just 385 pages. Pages brought to life even more so with the knowledge that they are the writings of Ms Curies very own daughter, Eve Curie. Precious stories gathered together by her greatest admirer and shared with the world so that they can come to truly know the timid lady who poured her soul into the laboratory. One of the worlds greatest minds, who has changed the face of medicine, physics, and chemistry forever with the discovery of Radium and radioactivity. A discovery that would ultimately and almost poetically claim her victim at life’s end. This book will be read and re-read and left suffering on my bookshelf for years to come as it’s pages become worn and binding fragile. And I look forward to the day I can pass it on to my now 6 year old daughter who shares the same innate spirit, a spirit forever in aw of the sciences. "

Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.”― Marie Curie, Madame Curie by Eve CurieSo, I still have the need to talk about Madame Curie before I move on in life because this book was so dear to me. This book is the best biography of Marie Curie, narrated by her own daughter, with lots of letters exchanged. And the fact that Eve Curie was a writer made this book a memorable reading indeed. Not only it portrayed the life of a genius scientist, but also a love story between her and her husband. And a story of a single mother. Born Marya Skłodowska in Tsarist Poland, her life had always been difficult. She lost her mother and a sister since she was very young. The family of 4, father, her older sister, herself and her brother tried to keep life above poverty. At age 17, Marie had to work as a governess, started saving for her dream education and split the rest to help her older sister who was to pursue the Sorbonne.When Marie got accepted to the Sorbonne, she took 3 days train ride to Paris. Lived alone in a tiny room, no heater, not enough money to buy food, she kept studying in that frozen room. To me, Marie Curie wasn't born a genius, but being naturally curious, love of study, have a deep passion for physics and consistency of grit in the face of adversity actually made whom she became. All day long she would study, buried herself in Physics, slept very little, and starved. She wrote to her brother:“Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that? We must have perseverance and above all confidence in ourselves. We must believe that we are gifted for something and that this thing must be attained.”Because this book contained mostly the letters, it really illustrated the true grit from Marie's own words. And also revealed her personality–a vulnerable person.""My life is upset in such a way that it will never be put right again. I think it will always be like this, and I shall not try to live otherwise""Mindfulness living, a letter to her two daughters:✎""My dear children, I send you my best wishes for a happy New Year–that is to say, a year of good health, good humor, and good work, a year in which you will have pleasure in living every day, without waiting for days to be gone before finding charm in them, and without putting all hope of pleasure in the days to come""✎This is only the tiny part from this book and I felt so lucky to have read it. It is emotional reading and enormously inspiring. I can see myself rereading it again. The first reading of my 2019 reading goal, My Year of Reading the Women Pioneers, was already phenomenal, I can not wait to start my second one :)Hope you'll find the opportunity to read Madame Curie. I can't recommend this book highly enough. "
284,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/288297-the-library-lady,5,"I am giving this book 5 stars because it is amazing on so many levels.This is the book that sparked my interest in Marie Curie--and since physics was a torture class for me in high school, that was pretty amazing in itself! But I must have read it around that time, my mother had a paperback copy on her bookshelves, and I wore it out re-reading it.Decades later, I am reading it in a whole new way and I am blown away by it. Eve Curie, Marie's daughter, finished this book only 3 years after her mother's death, and it could have been a sugar dripping, mother glorifying, plastic superwoman story. But it is not.Eve Curie was the only member of the Curie family to NOT become a scientist, but her writing combines scientific analysis with fluid storytelling as she recounts her mother's life. She sees Marie as she was, a very human woman whose life was driven by her brilliant scientific mind. Pierre Curie was her perfect partner, both as a spouse and as a scientist she could share her work with, and his loss impacted the rest of her life. Curie does not say that she and her sister were neglected, and indeed they were not, but she shows Marie's failings and virtues as a mother, not in a ""Mommie Dearest"" way, but in the way of a loving daughter. She gives us Marie at work, but she also gives us Marie at play by the sea, in a lovely chapter that shows the Curie women did have their chances to be happy and together.The one bit of whitewash here is Eve's near silence on Marie's ill fated romance with fellow scientist Paul Langevin. Only a few paragraphs on a single page, and his name is not mentioned:A scientist, devoted to her work, whose life was dignified, reserved and in recent years especially pitiable, was accused of breaking up homes and of dishonoring the name she bore with too much brilliance.You can read what actually happened here  It's not surprising that Curie chooses not to write about that sad episode, and aside from that she tries to give a full picture of her mother as a human being and succeeds.One more note: I didn't know much about Eve Curie beyond this, but she is worthy of a book of her own--perhaps even a novel. She became a pianist, a journalist, a member of the Free French Forces, and the wife of the first Executive Director of UNICEF. She herself was known at the ""First Lady of UNICEF,"" and worked actively with her husband. Unlike her parents and sister, Eve never won a Nobel prize, but her husband won the Nobel Peace Prize! Both Marie and Eve's sister Irene succumbed to radiation related illnesses, but Eve did not. In fact, she lived to be 102. A life well lived, and this book alone would have made it such."
285,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69521493-richard,3,"Madame Curie is a biography of the scientist Marie Sklodowska-Curie by the subject's daughter Eve Curie. She is the daughter who didn't win the Nobel prize. Her mother won two, and her sister won one. The biography is cradle to grave but is really split into three roughly equal sections, her life in Poland, her studies and discovery of radium along with her marriage to Pierre Curie, then her later life of largely unwanted fame.The book is florid in style and you get absolutely no idea of Sklodowska-Curie as a person at all. Indeed, from the biography she appears completely inscrutable. The book is almost the definition of hagiographic and so her motives are entirely opaque. The book puts forwards her life of physically ruinous hard work as coming from some combination of love of country (both Poland and France, the latter of which's academy treated her rather shabbily) and love of science. Not a bad word is written about either of the writer's parents and there is only warmth towards the subjects from the author, they are said to live a life of love and devotion. However, and I understand that it was the style in older pictures to look more serious, when you see them in the old photographs they look absolutely miserable. Eve Curie goes at great lengths to talk about the beauty of her mother, and indeed this sort of devotion and intelligence and tenacity has a kind of beauty, but she means physically so. There is also very little scientific explanation in the book. The discovery of radium, polonium, and actinium, and the great advances made in understanding radioactivity and what this meant in a broader scientific context is not explored at all. This may be due to the fact that the book was written in 1938 and a modern work would be more instructive here.Overall, the book presents a subject who is entirely admirable and inspirational to anyone (Marie's time in the shed trying to discover truth in a squalid environment reminds me of Newton in his own) but you sometimes get the feeling that there is a major facet of her life that is missing and that you are looking at a less than complete portrait of the great scientist."

A life full of commitment and hard work to discover the nature and the edges of scientific knowledge.Must-read biography from her daughter Eve Curie and inspiration to all.“For the admirable gift of himself, and for the magnificent service he renders humanity, what reward does our society offer the scientist? Have these servants of an idea the necessary means of work? Have they an assured existence, sheltered from care? The example of Pierre Curiee, and of others, shows that they have none of these things; and that more often, before they can secure possible working conditions, they have to exhaust their youth and their powers in daily anxieties. Our society, in which reigns an eager desire for riches and luxury, does not understand the value of science. It does not realize that science is a most precious part of its moral patrimony. Nor does it take sufficient cognizance of the fact that science is at the base of all the progress that lightens the burden of life and lessens its suffering. Neither public powers nor private generosity actually accord to science and to scientists the support and the subsidies indispensable to fully effective work.” Rest in peace, Madame Curie."

It is a lovely Polish translation published to commemorate the one hundred anniversary of Marie's birth. I love a slightly anachronistic style of writing corresponding to the times. The book is written so lovingly one might think it is not objective at all, however a lot can be read between the lines. Eve Curie quotes extensively from Marie's letters and notes providing us with the voice of her mother as well as enchanting details from her private life. I enjoyed for example reading about Marie and her daughters' vacation spent in a small village in Brittany called Larcouest in the company of the greatest scientific minds as humble vacationers living as slowly and as simple as possible.The last chapter describes heartbreaking last moments of Marie Curie who died so prematurely still full of plans for the future.I ended up being so completely moved by the dedication to their scientific work, by the passion they shared and the idealism that guided Marie Curie and Pierre Curie throughout their life."

But I finally finished and even though I didn't LOVE it I am still glad I pushed through.Marie Curie certainly was an amazing woman and I learned a lot about her in this book. Since I am a physicist myself (or I am going to be), and a woman, I really believe that this book was a must-read for me.It's not written in a particularly engaging way and even though it is written by her own daughter it feels strangely distant at times. But perhaps that is only fitting for a logical and rational mind like Marie Curie's.So if you have any connection to Science or Poland or Feminism or Cancer Therapy or any other topic that is in relation to Marie Curie, or you are generally interested in her life, I definitely recommend this book, but go in knowing that it can be a bit ... not boring, but also not very captivating, at times."

The detailed descriptions of the situation in Poland around the end of the 19th century under Soviet regime and Paris in the beginning of the 20th century. About a wonderful woman who sacrificed herself for physical, mathematical and chemistry science. It is funny to read that this lady learned everything about radium while she did not know how to cook herself a meal. It is far less funny to read how she and her husband, both highly-qualified and naturally driven, had to fight for having a laboratory in Paris; just a place to do their experiments. And how friends wrote them letters, expressing their sincere concerns about Marie's physical condition and too-seriousness. It is all passion for wild nature and science. Purity pur sang. "

Part 2 tells us about Marie's life in France. Part 3 speaks about Marie's life after the death of Pierre Curie. This book consists of many letters which were written or received by Marie Curie. Marie Curie wrote many letters to Pierre, Eve, Irene, Henrietta, Bronya etc. This book also has many photographs in it. There is some French in this book. So Maria Sklodowska was born in Warsaw, Poland. She was born in the Sklodowska family. Her parents were teachers. She had three elder sisters and an elder brother. Her siblings were Bronya, Joseph, Helena and Zofia. Zofia died at an early age. Also Maria's mother died. Maria was a very bright student at school. She knew five languages, namely: French, English, German, Russian and Polish. She loved her motherland. Joseph grew up to pursue medicine. Maria finished her high school and she received a gold medal for achieving the first mark. Maria and Bronya made a decision that Maria would work as a governess and earn money for Bronya to study medicine and in turn Bronya would complete her studies and work as a doctor to earn money for Maria's studies. So Maria worked as a governess while Bronya went to Paris, France. Bronya studied medicine at the Sorbonne. Maria fell in love with the eldest son of her employer while she worked as a governess in their house. But the parents refused to accept Maria as a daughter-in-law due to her poverty. Bronya became a gynaecologist. She married a doctor in Paris. Joseph got married. Maria changed her name to Marie because she was now in Paris. She started her studies in Paris. She studied Physics and Mathematics. She fell in love with Pierre Curie. Pierre and Marie got married. They worked together in a shed. After four years of intense research and isolation, they were able to discover Radium and Polonium. Marie named one of the elements as Polonium in honour of her motherland, Poland. Pierre and Marie received the Nobel prize for Physics. Pierre and Marie had two children: Irene and Eve. Pierre died in an accident. Marie felt very lonely, isolated, alone and solitary for sometime. But then she continued her research with indomitable courage. She became very famous. She received the Nobel prize for Chemistry. She started teaching Physics at the Sorbonne. Radium was used to cure cancer and this technique was named as Curietherapy. Irene studied Physics and she became Marie's assistant. Irene married Frederic Joliot. Eve studied music. Irene became a physicist. Eve became a writer. Marie built the Radium institute at Paris, France. She also built the Radium institute at Warsaw, Poland. Marie actively took part in the war by curing patients with Curietherapy. Marie spent her holidays at Larcouëst. She spent holidays with her close friends and her daughters. Irene and Frederic gave birth to a daughter. Marie went to America to receive a gram of radium. She was welcomed warmly by the Americans. Marie never liked fame. Marie's eyes became weak. She could no longer see properly. Also her ears were giving her some problem. Radium had damaged her body, she had stones in her gallbladder​. Also there was some problem in her lungs and in her blood. She eventually died. She had written a book named Radioactivity which was published posthumously​."

But this book encourages me as a woman and as a non-scientist to learn about physics and chemistry. In this book the sciences are adventurous fields that have great, and hopefully good, implications for everyone, and that can still be upended excitingly by new discoveries. That said, the book is clear about the health, personal and financial costs that Marie and Pierre Curie paid for everything they achieved and were honoured for."
292,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104918254-zsuzsanna-karlik,5,"This is one of the most beautiful books I've ever read. Maria Skłodowska-Curie was a brilliant scientist and an amazing person, a real role-model. If you haven't read this book, but are interested in science, history or outstanding people, start reading it.One think I must note: since the book was written by her daughter, some parts of her life are not really written about, as she probably didn't want to believe some rumours or wanted to save her mother's reputation, but I don't think those rumours make her less valuable, they just show that she was a person too. I've read many biographies about her, and though others may be more open about some things, this is far the best showing her as a person by someone who knew her the most."
293,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58299967-dhruv,5,"The only person to date to receive two Nobel prizes in different sciences, Madame Curie is one strong inspiration for young men/women across the globe to pursue research in Science. The book written by Madame Curie's daughter comprises of many letters (few are still radioactive to date) from Madame Curie, gives insights into how devoted to science and family the Madame Curie was. The hardships that Madame faced along with her beloved, Pierre to break through the stigma in the early 1900's. It's really an honor to be able to access the life of the legend and relive the discoveries through a roller-coaster."
294,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102234320-magnus-h,4,"I enjoyed this a lot, and I only give it four stars because I did find it a bit boring although that’s just because I’m more into action or fantasy type books. My dad picked this up at a thrift store somewhere and after he read it, he urged me to read it as well, and so I did. I’m far from intelligent but I thought this was a great book about a great woman and so anyone who’s considering reading this, I strongly recommend this. This reminded me a lot of The Agony and the Ecstasy by Irving Stone, a biography about Michelangelo Buonarroti (might not be spelt correctly whoops) which was also I great read, and now stands as the favorite book I ever read. This book comes very close to that. :)"
295,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2099235-s,3,"Good biography. Madame Curie should be required reading for grade school children as it is, not in some simplified version. It shows how a woman overcame many obstacles in her life to reach the highest achievements in the scientific world which was dominated by men at the time. My only criticism is that the writing style of the author, who also happens to be the daughter of Madame Curie, is a kind of hero worship. It was not the more objective style which I have grown accustomed to for biographical works like this. "
296,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27484790-merlyn,5,"A determined life in pursuit of truth of our universe.When you read this treasure, the extraordinary life of this scientist, all vanity and ego are brought down to the nanoscale. Role model among role model. Eve Curie explained in such rich details, what most scientific articles lack, the severity and love for truth and knowledge. I just finished reading this, while my heart is appropriately humbled, my mind is emboldened with courage. Every scientist, everyone should read this book to learn of a determined life."
297,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38672492-hassan-aljama,3,"The inherent flaw in the book is that the daughter is writing about a great person, who happens to be her mother. It is expected that the daughter would revere such a figure. In most cases, the beauty of a biography is in showing the positives traits of the person, as well as the negatives. Eve Curie painted a picture of an infallible person, depriving us as readers from knowing the actual woman Madam curie was."
298,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63409976-alexander-evans,5,"I don't typically post reviews but most readers aren't going to pick this one up without a nudge. Manya's personal struggles and successes are equally as remarkable as her scientific achievements. She believed each of us should strive to develop our full potential so that we may fulfill our greater duty to humanity. And while she set numerous firsts for women, let's remember that she remains the only human to ever earn the Nobel Prize in two scientific fields."
299,0306810387,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47294942-chloe,4,"Came across the abridged version of this biography while looking for something to read at my mother-in-law's house. The book is written by her daughter and has quite a lot of hero worship. Marie is talked about in entirely positive ways. However, if her daughter felt so worshipful about her, she may really have been that wonderful. Worth the read, but I may have not felt this way if it was not the abridged version!"
