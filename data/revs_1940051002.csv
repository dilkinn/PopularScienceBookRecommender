0,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4928576-marta,1,"This book - or booklet, with its couple dozen pages - is an attempt of Sam Harris to describe and justify his personal philosophy of honesty and avoiding lies if at all possible. The author does not shy away from the classical ""but what if an axe-murderer asks me about a child hiding in my house"" dilemma, and from providing a scathing critique of white lies and lies that spare someone's feelings, and in this, I found the essay interesting. It is well-written, too, interesting, not a word too long - but still, I find it to be a deeply flawed book.For all of Sam Harris' in-depth discussion of lies and their destructive influence on our daily life (and I completely agree that we tell too many of them), he remains blind to the realities of life of people less affluent (and also white, male, cis, heterosexual) than he is. In the discussion of all those big, life-changing things like ""lying to a person about their terminal disease"", ""murderers looking for a victim"" and ""lying by omission and therefore aiding an adulterer in hiding his affair"", Harris forgets about all the people who are poor (and lie to keep their livelihood in the form of, say, a disliked job), who are discriminated against or persecuted (and this is not a small number in our world), who are not in the comfortable situation where they can choose who to deal with. His is a lovely moral philosophy, but one applicable only to those of us rich and privileged enough to choose who we depend on - and it is this failure of charity, combined with the way he insists his way is good and perfect for all of us (barring spies, supposedly), which spoiled the book for me utterly."
1,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1257629-karl-o,4,"I liked this essay. I read its majority while at a cafe with my wife, and it stirred very interesting discussions. Even while reading it alone, I remember constantly stopping and thinking about the insightful ideas and examples that Harris demonstrated. Harris shows how lies, even those (conveniently?) called ""white"" do more harm than good. He proposes living a life without a single lie, even at the cost of much discomfort. Of course, situations where telling the truth will undoubtedly cause harm (like in case of a murderer looking for a child hiding in your house), lying is justified, though he takes the matter a step further which I presume most people will disagree with. I agree with most of what Harris says here, even when in situations where I will (sadly) opt for lying, I can't and won't deny that it harms my relationship with the person being lied to. However, he could have talked more (as he usually does) about the underlying causes of lying from an evolutionary or even social point of view, which of course can help in developing better strategies in coping with the urge to lie. "
2,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,4,"This is less of a book than a long essay, one that is currently available in free downloadable PDF form from Harris' website.Throughout the piece, Harris makes the argument that there are significant benefits to be gained both personally and societally by rejecting lying in both large and small forms.Most of us think of ourselves as honest people, yet may still frequently engage in the ""white lie,"" an act of dishonesty designed to spare both ourselves and another discomfort. Harris offers some compelling reasons why this widely accepted practice is not as harmless as it seems and offers good examples of the damage it can do to trust on multiple levels. In Harris' mind, rejecting lying is not the same as forfeiting all privacy in one's communication - one can still be honest about one's decision not to disclose certain things. His is a more nuanced position than what I understand of Brad Blanton's Radical Honesty.Despite its brevity, I found this a thought provoking piece. I can't imagine engaging in some of the more egregious lying examples Harris mentions, yet realized I have my own fuzzy edge when it comes to avoiding awkwardness. Consciously examining the downsides of this behavior has helped me clarify those edges. "

5,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/122235--uht,1,"When is it okay to lie? When is it not? Sam has opinions which he'll gladly tell you. But they seem a bit arbitrary to me.On top of that, the writing is incredibly dry. I do think the subject could be interesting (especially if approached by an author with a less simplistic but more internally consistent view), but Sam's take didn't do it for me. There's no sense of humor, there's no exploration, there's just simple and dry utterance of what amounts to moralism.But let's take an example he gives. Someone asks Sam if he is overweight. Sam admits that he knows the guy wants reassurance. Sam tells the guy he needs to lose 25 pounds. And it must be all well and good because the guy then went and lost 15 pounds. (Doesn't everybody need to be thin?)First off, what was the guy asking Sam? Not with his words, but what was he emotionally requesting from Sam? Reassurance. But Sam doesn't focus on his friend's emotions, but decides instead to use this as a moment to criticize. You're 25 lbs overweight. He got hung up on the actual words and did not answer the real question (will you reassure me?).Who is being dishonest here? Would it be dishonest to act like you're answering someone's question because you were able to use their words to justify leveling a criticism, regardless of their intention? Would it be dishonest to decide that I am the one person who gets to judge what all my friends should weigh?Maybe it was as simple-minded and moralistic as Sam made it out to be, but I think the book would've been far more interesting and believable if Sam was more honest about the situation, or if his book was about why he can't be totally honest about it. Or if the book were about exploring the complexities of why this is not a straightforward situation to begin with.When Sam tries to get out of the situation where his friend is asking if he likes the gift they gave him and weasels out of saying no, didn't he just contradict the shit he wrote before that part? And then it's okay to lie in war. Meh. He tried to build some kind of ethical argument, but he ended up hiding behind morality. Grey is the new black and white, Sam. Didn't you get the memo?How about, don't lie to yourself about why you are telling people things? Don't tell yourself you have good intentions when you have bad intentions. That's ethics. Levinas does this a lot more simply. The Other makes a claim on me which lets me know that he and I are similar and both have rights to our desires. From that realization alone, I know the good. That's ethics.Anyway, at least the book was short."

7,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5172557-kirstine,3,"This is a very neat little book about lying. It's not out to flesh out the subject in all its glory, but instead to give you enough information and insight that you can make an informed decision on the subject and feel you know what it's about (and that's in 58 pages, *slow clap*). It can also work as a bit of an eye opener. We're quite used to lying in our every day life - so much so it becomes habit, we don't even think about it. The great thing about Sam Harris is that he doesn't just tell you to stop it, he tries to tell you how to stop. It's the equivalent of a tiny angel on your should going ""you can do it, come on"". I guess that makes it a self-help book in a way. But it's the good kind of self-help book, because not lying will actually improve your life. Truth rocks, guys. So go throw it at people (gently). "
8,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22189980-belhor,2,"This is a short essay about lying and its implications. The book has many short comings in my opinion and it could have been written much better and I wish it was longer; I wish it could have been developed into a proper book. There are so many things left unexplained and premises unproven, yet the subject is interesting. The writer basically argues that is is almost always bad to lie, except in very very rare cases that would probably never happen in the course of the lifetime of the average individual. The premise is that lying is consequentially counter productive. The whole argument is based on consequential-ism and the fact that morality is an important factor; yet no argument is provided to support the importance of morality. Although, the the writer never tries to argue about lying from an epistemological stance and also severely criticized the work of Kant on the problem of lying.It is assumed that we are somehow obligated to share with others the realities of the world! When people ask you to provide them with a perception (your belief or understanding of the world) the simple act of their request of you burdens you to tell the truth and you become responsible for the consequences of their actions based on your perception. These ideas, too, are never discussed in detail and no argument is provided to support them. I'm not convinced how this burden is justified. I agree with most of what this book has to say, but I feel Sam Harris takes this ideology too far to a point that it cannot be supported; it becomes weak, simplified and terribly impractical. "
9,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4026928-gail,3,"As someone who finds it incredibly difficult and unnatural to lie, and who, as a result, knows full well the pitfalls of being constantly honest, I was curious to read this book. It had very good reviews - but after reading it I wasn't really sure why. It's not a terrible book, but what it says is either blatantly obvious (to me, at any rate), or else not entirely true. While of course there are many kinds of untruth that cause all kinds of problem, the author goes as far as to argue that any kind of untruth is wrong and unhelpful, including white lies, and that telling white lies will inevitably make life more difficult. This simply isn't the case. I think people for whom social lying comes naturally are simply unaware that they do it half the time, so will only notice on the rare occasion when it goes wrong. I was hoping for a book that would explore both sides of lying, and look at social expectations and social understandings, rather than a simplistic 'Lying is always bad - don't do it' argument."
10,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/262254-greg,4,"On the whole, this little novella (long essay) was really fantastic. Sam Harris makes a really strong case for never lying. And I think the case he makes transcends his commitment to utilitarianism (which he doesn't even mention in this essay), and resonates strongly with this virtue ethicist. I have two problems with his prescription. 1) Harris would be committed to the argument that even lying to someone to keep a surprise party you are throwing for them a secret is wrong. Examples along those lines strike me as times where it doesn't make sense to chastise lying. 2) One of his examples uses evasive tactics, which while not technically lying, seems to me to be in exactly the same vain and intent as a white lie would be in the same situation. i.e. - when someone asks you if you like a present they just gave you (a sweater in this case), rather than saying ""no"", and rather than telling a white lie and saying, ""oh, yes, it's wonderful"", Harris suggests answering with something like, ""I'm really touched you thought of me, but I don't think I can pull this off"" This isn't a lie, but it's also not an answer to the question, it's evasive, and I'm not entirely comfortable with using this as a tool to ""get out of lying"". Those points aside, the broader conceptual framework that Harris sets up and the kinds of considerations he asks us to think about when contemplating lying, are quite piercing and thought provoking. I was sympathetic to something along the lines of what Sam Harris prescribes before reading this essay, but I have to say, reading it has given me another boost in the direction. "
11,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1496261-cora-judd,5,"Harris' writing here is so clear and elegant that it might be easy for one to mistake his ideas as simple. However, while 'Lying' can be read in a sitting, it can be mulled over for a very long time. The ideas that linger are of the power of honest speech. Of his lie-related proposals, however, the most compelling is the destructive nature of the white lie; the one we tell out of compassion or embarrassment. I'm equally moved by his portrayal of plain truth-telling as a ""source of power and an engine of simplicity"" in relationships. He makes no statement without logically supporting it and provides a few examples that will resonate with a pang. (Bonus: the only really correct way to answer the ""does this make me look fat"" type of question) I think it's an essential topic at a time when we've acquired so many social personas (masks?) for our complex lives and, unfortunately, a little lying here and there is seeming much less shameful than it once was. "
12,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22409011-brendan-monroe,5,"Despite its pithy title and sparse number of pages, ""Lying"" packs a wallop! This is perhaps one of the most important books I've ever read and it's clear once reading it that the world would be a sorely better one if everyone followed the precepts written within.This thin volume has received some criticism of the ""oh well, it's just what grandma says and everyone already knows it"" variety. Clearly these people didn't take away much from this book, but that likely has more to do with themselves than with the general wisdom contained inside. Sure, I know lying is bad too. I've always known it. And yet throughout my life I've continued to lie and, in many cases, been little troubled at the ease with which I've done so. Now, is that because while I believe lying is truly wrong and has ultimately negative consequences I simply don't care enough to make an effort to stop? Or is it because I have just never understood why lying, in the vast majority of instances according to Harris, does damage not just to the people we tell our lies to but ultimately to ourselves? In my case I can attest it is the latter. Even the seemingly innocuous act of offering someone false encouragement can prove to be harmful, as Harris writes, “False encouragement is a kind of theft: it steals time, energy, and motivation a person could put toward some other purpose.”I never would have thought, before reading this, that there was any harm in telling the occasional ""white lie"" or in denying someone the truth in cases in which it was bound to hurt them. Sam Harris has changed my mind and made me completely rethink this. As he writes here, “Research suggests that all forms of lying—including white lies meant to spare the feelings of others—are associated with poorer-quality relationships.”The simple truth is that while we all know that lying is bad we can't exactly put our finger on why, in seemingly innocuous cases, it is so. Certainly those who have read this book won't have any difficulty in making that case.Despite the fact that this is a very quick read, Harris does a great job of covering the topic fully. I wouldn't have minded a little more information on the ease with which some people (e.g. politicians) lie while many others just don't have the ""knack"" for it. Bill Clinton, to name just one politician, was such a great liar in part because he actually convinced himself to believe his own lies. ""Lying"" is such an essential read precisely because it tells us that in order to improve our relationships, we have to stop all forms of lying."

This is more like an essay or small script about the philosophies of lying, it's not really a book.Food for thought:- Whatever our purpose in telling them, lies can be gross or subtle. Some entail elaborate ruses or forged documents. Others consist merely of euphemisms or tactical silences. But it is in believing one thing while intending to communicate another that every lie is born. -Ethical transgressions are generally divided into two categories: the bad things we do (acts of commission) and the good things we fail to do (acts of omission).

16,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3856007-sean-liu,5,"Fantastic - should be required reading for everyone, especially because it's so short. This book will make you think twice about telling lies—even the most subtle, well-intentioned white lies. The key things I took away from this book are:1. ""To lie is to recoil from relationship.""2. Lies, even white lies, are indicators of a poor quality relationship.3. To offer insincere praise is to treat someone like a child when everyone else will judge them as adults. We do them no favors by sparing their feelings (and our discomfort) now, because we are actually setting them up for embarrassment later.Read this book._______________________________To lie is to intentionally mislead others when they expect honest communication.People lie so that others will form beliefs that are not true. The more consequential the beliefs—that is, the more a person’s well-being depends upon a correct understanding of the world—the more consequential the lie.The intent to communicate honestly is the measure of truthfulness.Of course, the liar often imagines that he does no harm as long as his lies go undetected. But the one lied to almost never shares this view. The moment we consider our dishonesty from the point of view of those we lie to, we recognize that we would feel betrayed if the roles were reversed.Research suggests that all forms of lying—including white lies meant to spare the feelings of others—are associated with poorer quality relationships.Honest people are a refuge: You know they mean what they say; you know they will not say one thing to your face and another behind your back; you know they will tell you when they think you have failed—and for this reason their praise cannot be mistaken for mere flattery.Honesty is a gift we can give to others. It is also a source of power and an engine of simplicity. Knowing that we will attempt to tell the truth, whatever the circumstances, leaves us with little to prepare for. We can simply be ourselves.Ethical transgressions are divided into two categories: the bad things we do (acts of commission) and the good things we fail to do (acts of omission). We tend to judge the former more harshly.White lies—lies we tell for the purpose of sparing others discomfort—most often tempt us. And they tend to be the only lies that good people tell while imagining they are being good in the process.A white lie is simply a denial of these realities. It is a refusal to offer honest guidance in a storm. Even on so touchy a subject, lying seems a clear failure of friendship. By reassuring your friend about her appearance, you are not helping her to do what you think she should do to get what she wants out of life.But if we are convinced that a friend has taken a wrong turn in life, it is no sign of friendship to simply smile and wave him onward.We are often tempted to encourage others with insincere praise. In this we treat them like children—while failing to help them prepare for encounters with those who will judge them like adults. I’m not saying that we need to go out of our way to criticize others. But when asked for our opinion, we do our friends no favors by pretending not to notice flaws in their work, especially when those who are not their friends are bound to notice these same flaws. Saving our friends disappointment and embarrassment is a great kindness. And if we haha history of being honest, our praise and encouragement will actually mean something.One of the greatest problems for the liar is that he must keep track of his lies. Some people are better at this than others. Psychopaths can assume this burden of mental accounting without any obvious distress. That is no accident: They are psychopaths.Lies beget other lies. Unlike statements of fact, which require no further work on our part, lies must be continually protected from collisions with reality. When you tell the truth, you have nothing to keep track of. The world itself becomes your memory, and if questions arise, you can always point others back to it. You can even reconsider certain facts and honestly change your views. And you can openly discuss your confusion, conflicts, and doubts with all comers. In this way, a commitment to the truth is naturally purifying of error.But the liar must remember what he said, and to whom, and must take care to maintain his falsehoods in the future. This can require an extraordinary amount of work—all of which comes at the expense of authentic communication and free attention. The liar must weigh each new disclosure, whatever the source, to see whether it might damage the facade that he has built. And all these stresses accrue, whether or not anyone discovers that he has been lying.Lying is, almost by definition, a refusal to cooperate with others. It condenses a lack of trust and trustworthiness into a single act. It is both a failure of understanding and an unwillingness to be understood. To lie is to recoil from relationship.By lying, we den others a view of the world as it is. Our dishonesty not only influences the choices they make, it often determines the choices they can make—and in ways we cannot even predict. Every lie is a direct assault upon the autonomy of those we lie to.How would your relationships change if you resolved never to lie again? What truths might suddenly come into view in your life? What kind of person would you become? And how might you change the people around you? It is worth finding out."

This requires us to avoid behavior that readily leads to shame or remorse. To truly have integrity, we must not feel the need to lie about our personal lives.

18,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71312811-jaker,4,"Lying. Is about what it implies. I love how the author said lying was rejecting the other from accessing the truth. The main problem presented in this book was that lying and telling the truth both have its goods and bad. I believe truth is the right way to go depending on the situation. When lying or telling the truth, we need to imagine the consequences, yet that truth is pure subjectivity or it might not be. If the consequence was pretty definite and negative, then you should probably lie. Yet sometimes that is subjective too, it also depends on who you are and if the situation itself is ethical and worth the risk of lying or not. The problem of lying is the uncertainty of it. What are the problems it might trigger? What happens when the lie was revealed? The truth however, we might believe that it hurts. Yet sometimes it is something we have to face, we lie to get away from confrontation. Hurtful truths is not something to avoid, but to confront. Lying or telling the truth are all ethical problems that really depends on the situation. The author has provided many examples of them that is a better way of explaining the problem of lying then what I'm doing right now. Sometimes, you do need to change perspectives. We have this human instinct to lie or tell the truth. Should we use the logical part of us which might not have the correct morals (e.g. criminals, if they are committing a crime, they lie for their own sake that they believe is just), or the emotional part, which might lead to consequences we didn't intend to make?I can only leave you with questions, because it is ultimately dependent on the situation itself. There's no ultimate guide to answer with a lie and truth for each situation you encounter.To sum up, the problem of lying or not are depending on the following factors: magnitude of the lie, consequences it entails and situation. Of course, there are more factors that are involved in this kind of decision. By then, we will need to step into both the shoes of a logical man, an emotional man, and a prophet. These people should not be you, they should be this moral standard that society accepts. We tend to make selfish decisions, no matter if our intentions are good or bad. So the next time you choose to tell a lie, you'll have to consider a lot of factors. Don't make rash decisions, take a time to breath and think, and answer that question with a truth or a lie. I highly recommend this book, it is a quick reading, but it entails many things that we should consider into decisions we make in our daily lives."

He's got a great clarity of speaking, and his method is to take the listener through the issue at hand in a thoughtful and considered way. His writing shows the same method: everything is clear and precise and deliberate.His background in neuroscience puts his approach towards the issue of belief and disbelief on a different level than other famed atheists such as Christopher Hitchens (snarky, acerbic and entertaining) and Richard Dawkins (evolutionary biology).Harris' detour from atheism into this realm of The Lie was rather thought-provoking despite its short length. There were plenty of examples he deployed that had me considering and reconsidering my own fibbing habit. Whether I'll change or not is yet to be seen. ;P"

Sam Harris's book Lying is not a philosophical book which tells you the ramifications of lying or speaking the truth but it merely shows the two side of the same coin and ultimately leaves it to the reader on making any decision. It could be thought-provoking for those who are about to take the journey of life in his hand and also for those who are to write an essay on the same topic. I came across this book on YouTube while watching a podcast and hence thought of giving a try after seeing the number of pages. I won't say I am disappointed with not so new things in this book but it has really led me to think before lying or speaking the truth for whatsoever reason that, What's the right thing to do?"

22,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7419917-talbot-hook,4,"This review might be just as long as the book, but, as the kids say, yeet.Coming to TermsLying is a fraught little concept, quite charged in use and bandied about whenever people don't like what they hear. But what is it precisely? Harris's definition, which works for me, is simply that it is an intentional misleading of other people who are expecting honest communication. The keys here are that: A) the liar is intentionally leaving out information or manufacturing it; and, B) the person on the other end is expecting the truth. Unless both of these criteria are met, what is communicated cannot be a lie. For instance, if I am representing reality to the best of my ability (even if I am technically wrong), I am not lying. I am communicating openly and honestly. I simply happen to be incorrect. Likewise, if my interlocutor isn't expecting the truth, no lie is possible; going to a magic show expecting a spectacle or going to a masquerade where everyone is no one, yet they are certainly someone — both are situations in which I am expecting some degree of falsehood. And both circumstances would be made wholly inappropriate by the truth. There are a few gradations in this definition; as Harris points out, wearing make-up isn't a lie, per se, though it is certainly a form of deception. We all know that the purpose of make-up is to cover up our blemishes, and yet we don't fault others for masking the ""truth"" of their appearance simply because they wear rouge. If this is a lie, then it is a lie that we as a society take as normal and perhaps even desirable. So both of our criteria must be met in order for a true lie to exist.Harris also distinguishes between ""lies of commission"" and ""lies of omission"". Lies of commission, ethically speaking, are bad things that we do whereas lies of omission are simply things that we fail to speak up about. If lies of omission result from us simply choosing to overlook things and not correct them, lies of commission involve the expenditure of energy with the intent to mislead. And I think the moral difference here to be obvious. We do not blame the person that fails to return the $100 dollars that the cashier gave them as much as we blame the person that sets about to actually steal it. Harris, in this book, is mostly focused on lies of commission, in which we are intentionally communicating in a way that misleads others, although there is certainly something to be said about lies of omission and the harm they do to our relationships.Key PropositionsThis book doesn't take an iron-clad position against lying. It is both gradational and situational, but even then there is a basic thrust of argumentation, and it is this: generally speaking it is better to tell the truth than to lie. And it is more an invitation to tell the truth than an exhortation. Ask yourself these questions: What if our lives and our relationships were founded in truth? What if our communication was bound by it, and what if we were totally honest with ourselves and others? What would life be like if we were vulnerable to the truth, and trusted others to engage in our vulnerability? How much could we deepen our friendships?Of course, there are instances where lying is appropriate (Nazis are at the door, and you have Anne Frank upstairs, to use Harris's example), but, most of the time, our lies are small things, and they are generally to save us from small discomforts. We'd rather not answer our friends and family honestly because we don't want the momentary discomfort of having to cause shame, embarrassment, or self-criticism. We don't like this, and so we avoid it. But what problems are caused by our habitual white lies? Harris sees several problems with a pattern of lying in life:1) We are hiding our own authenticity, thus obscuring what could be a clear and deep relationship with another person. We never say as we really feel, and thus the other person doesn’t ever truly get to know us. Of course we do not want to openly, callously insult our friends, but we shouldn't seek to infantilize them, either. Not telling them that uncomfortable truth is to treat them like someone undeserving of the truth — or incapable of receiving it. These lies stand between us and the other people in our lives. 2) Lying forces us to keep two ledgers in life: one for truths told, and one for the lies we must remember. ""What did I end up telling him that one time? Was it (Lie A) or (Lie B)?"" Whatever it was, it was not reality, and therefore you need not only remember what actually happened, but what you pretended was the case. And that requires much more thought, much more (unhealthy) planning, and much more mental space. Why not just be our honest selves and simplify our lives?3) Telling small lies in the present can bring about avoidable long-term pain. Is your friend writing a book based on a genuinely bad idea? Do you want them to write for two years only to discover that and see their past two years as a waste? Is your friend now dating someone that you know to be bad for them? Should they engage in a year-long relationship only to come to your same realization? Does that dress make me look bad? For goodness' sake, tell me so that I don't go in public with it on! A moment of truth can save us days, months, or years of suffering.4) Even these tiny ""erosions of trust"" can lead to bad places. For instance, if I discover a streak of white lies in your conversations with me, what does that lead me to think of you? Each instance of lying undermines actual relationships and leads to a break-down of trust. It corrodes the sanctity of vulnerability with another person, and makes us doubt even when our friends are telling the truth. 5) We destroy our own ""moral wealth"". We cheat ourselves by acting unvirtuously. It is just like overeating, stealing, cheating on one's spouse, using violence whimsically, or being lazy. It is acting against what good is within us — what we could and should be. Lastly, I should say that Harris is very careful about the way in which truth is told. "". . . your purpose in telling the truth is not to offend people. You simply want them to have the information you have and would want to have if you were in their shoes."" For instance, when a friend asks if he is overweight, one needn't say: ""Yes, you are fat to the point where it is disgusting for even me to look at you."" One can present the truth (almost always) in a way that is both full of care, and yet helpful to the person. And, honestly, wouldn't you want to have a friend who cared enough about you to tell you the truth, even when uncomfortable? A friend that has your long-term well-being in mind?I'll leave you with one of the most powerful quotes from the conclusion: ""Lying is, almost by definition, a refusal to cooperate with others. It condenses a lack of trust and trustworthiness into a single act. It is both a failure of understanding and an unwillingness to be understood. To lie is to recoil from relationship. By lying, we deny others our view of the world. And our dishonesty not only influences the choices they make, it often determines the choices they can make — in ways we cannot always predict. Every lie is an assault on the autonomy of those we lie to."""

Sam Harris thesis is that lying is by definition unethical and he carefully dissects different situations to show how lying is no alternative to telling the truth. The small booklet (which I read) also contains a dialogue with Harris old philosophy teacher at Stanford. I found this dialogue to be more informative than the essay by Harris because it provided more reasons to actually believe in Harris arguments. He isn't saying that lying will in every case make a person happier but in general self-deception (as well as lying to others) will not provide a good breeding ground for development as a person. When you are honest in relationships you can handle problems easier and face them together, rather than alone. "

Just like in Waking Up, and in fact through using his meditation app by the same name, my respect for him grows and grows. As a young man I got deeply involved in Buddhism, and went as far as becoming a monk for a few years. But as is often the case I left after a crisis of faith and understanding, and took years to assimilate what i had learned. Sam Harris is massively influential in my coming to terms with what I feel Buddhism and in particular Insight Meditation is and taught me. Sam Harris's views on truth and lying are a big part of this growing realisation and understanding. This text is short and simple, and not perfect. But it does get to the core of why Right Speech as taught in Buddhism is such a powerful tool.I highly recommend anyone reading this."

That might also be a bad thing, since it is what got me to read it. It starts out with some superficial comments about lying being bad in some particular ways. Most of the comments are things you'd think about the first time you thought about the subject, and I had to go back and look to see if this was perhaps targetted to pre-teens, but alas it wasn't. There's nothing deep in the opinionizing, nor broad, and most of it is based on practicality rather than any sense of morality. Following this, and the bulk of the essay, is a series of illustrative stories. While they are occasionally interesting, argument by anecdote never really is very convincing, that technique being a sort of logical fallacy that one might call, well, lying.I'd say more but I've already put more effort into this than I think went into the book. Then again, maybe it just all went over my head. You can decide for yourself, I guess - it's short. Which, now that I think about it, might be actually be the best thing about it."

So, I don't want to lie and I expect the others not to lie and promote honesty, by not lying and being honest not only helps in being truthful to oneself it also helps strengthen relationships, with credibility and self-improvement.After all we're all interconnected in this world why don't we stop lying, as sincerity contributes to our well-being, to quote from the book “Lies beget other lies.”."
30,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56884005-kalle-nordenstorm,4,"2nd read and I bet I will read it againWhat he is sayingIn committing to be honest with everyone, we commit to avoiding a wide range of long- term problems, but at the cost of occasional, short-term discomfort. However, the discomfort should not be exaggerated: You can be honest and kind, because your purpose in telling the truth is not to offend people: You simply want them to have the information you have, and would want to have if you were in their position. What truth feels likeThe year was 1987, but it might as well have been the Summer of Love: I was twenty, had hair down to my shoulders, and was dressed like an Indian rickshaw driver. For those charged with enforcing our nation's drug laws, it would have been only prudent to subject my luggage to special scrutiny. Happily, I had nothing to hide. ""Where are you coming from?"" the officer asked, glancing skeptically at my backpack. ""India, Nepal, Thailand..."" I said. ""Did you take any drugs while you were over there?"" As it happens, I had. The temptation to lie was obvious — why speak to a customs officer about my recent drug use? But there was no real reason not to tell the truth, apart from the risk that it would lead to an even more thorough search of my luggage (and perhaps of my person) than had already commenced. Yes,"" I said. The officer stopped searching my bag and looked up. ""Which drugs did you take? ""I smoked pot a few times... And I tried opium in India."" ""Opium?"" ""Yes."" ""Opium or heroin? ""It was opium."" 'You don't hear much about opium these days."" ""I know. It was the first time I'd ever tried it."" ""Are you carrying any drugs with you now?"" ""No."" The officer eyed me warily for a moment and then returned to searching my bag. Given the nature of our conversation, I reconciled myself to being there for a very long time. I was, therefore, as patient as a tree. Which was a good thing, because the officer was now examining my belongings as though any one item — a toothbrush, a book, a flashlight, a bit of nylon cord — might reveal the deepest secrets of the universe. ""What is opium like?"" he asked after a time. And I told him. In fact, over the next ten minutes, I told this lawman almost everything I knew about the use of mind-altering substances. Eventually he completed his search and closed my luggage. One thing was perfectly obvious at the end of our encounter: We both felt very good about it. What it is like being honest and what it is like being dishonestHonesty demands confidence and intelligence. It places you in difficult situations, just like lying does. But honesty takes you there more quickly. Lying often means delaying the difficult. While honesty means taking it on right away. Seems related to conscientiousness.For instance, say a friend asks you how you are feeling and makes clear she wants the real answer, not just the standard fine. It is not obvious which information you would want to have if you were in the other persons situation, and as Harris states so well at the beginning of his essay You simply want them to have the information you have, and would want to have if you were in their position.  To handle this well you need prudence and prudence comes from experience, experience which you amass much faster by practicing radical honesty and by building life experience.I guess honesty makes you look good because the good have less to hide, either because there is so little problematic about you, or because you are skilled enough to speak about the problematic and complex.

34,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"This is a bit longer than a magazine essay and in its length feels more like a journal article than a book. It covers a lot of ground and makes the point quite clearly.Harris is a consequentialist, something he does not argue for in this book but explained previously in The Moral Landscape. Consequentialism is a theory that maintains that the ethical value of an act is determined by its consequences. Consequentialism is often broken down into two main types: one in which the outcome of each specific act must be evaluated separately (as much as possible), and one in which general rules may be formulated based on the usual or probable outcomes of similar acts. Harris presents a clear example of the latter type in his wholesale rejection of lying.What is lying? It's a deliberate attempt to deceive others into believing something different than what we believe to be true. It may be an act of omission -- we can lie through what we don't say -- but this is a little more slippery, as Harris finds nothing offensive about the concept of privacy and furthermore is aware that if we resolved to communicate all the information we knew and correct every error we perceived we'd never have time to sleep. So Harris chose to focus on acts of commission. He gives a lot of attention to so-called ""white lies"" that are usually well-meaning attempts to spare others' feelings.Why does Harris say lying is undesirable? For a multitude of reasons. For one, it breaks down human relationships. It is wonderful to have friends who will tell you the truth, even when it is hard to hear, he says. When we hide our weaknesses or fail to critique someone who is asking for honest feedback, we are giving up opportunities to grow. This sort of stunting becomes offensive in principle: ""deciding how much (another) can know about himself seems the quintessence of arrogance,"" and as a result of keeping others ignorant of the truth, ""to lie is to infringe upon the freedom of those we care about."" For another reason, liars have to remember everything they've lied about. ""To agree to keep a secret,"" small as it may seem, ""is to assume a burden."" Due to a strange fact about human psychology, liars deprecate their ""victims"" so as to justify their own lying behavior to themselves, and thus liars become less trustful of other people even as those who have been lied to have more reason not to trust the liars. Lying thus makes everyone unhappier. When authorities lie, it causes mass confusion when people no longer know what information sources to trust, and this ruins public debate. For yet another reason, while liars have to remember everything they've lied about, people who are lied to cannot forget anything they've been lied to about. What psychologists call the ""illusory truth effect"" means that ""We seem to be predisposed to remember statements as true even after they have been disconfirmed."" A lie is forever, no matter how many times you try to take it back.To Harris, as a consequentialist, anything that harms the ability of humans to thrive is morally wrong. Therefore, lying is wrong.He does, briefly, admit that there might be some exceptions to the rule. ""If you think that it can ever be appropriate to injure or kill a person in self-defense, or in defense of another, it makes no sense to rule out lying in the same circumstances,"" he explains. It is permissible to lie in the unusual circumstance that ""we have judged the prospects of establishing a real relationship with this person to be nonexistent."" Even then, however, he suggests that the truth is often better than a lie. He provides a typical example of giving shelter to a child pursued by a murderer. If the murderer asks if you are sheltering the child, rather than saying ""no,"" you could say (in Harris's script), ""I wouldn't tell you even if I knew. And if you take another step, I'll put a bullet in your brain."" Something seems amiss here. Supplying a physical threat surely assumes the inability to develop a ""real relationship"" as much as lying assumes it, and degrades an existing relationship as much as lying degrades it. Furthermore, the one-liner is only available to people who do not stutter when facing a serial killer at their front door and happen to have a loaded pistol in their pocket. Elsewhere, in describing war, Harris said: ""The moment one begins dropping bombs, or destroying a country's infrastructure with cyber attacks, lying has become just another weapon in the arsenal."" If lying is a kind of weapon, then surely it is a useful weapon for the physically weak to fairly level the playing field against those who have initiated physical force against them. This wrinkle is not something he addresses.One other example sounds a bit askew. He writes that one possible result of honesty is that ""real problems in your life can be forced to the surface. Are you in an abusive relationship? A refusal to lie to others--How did you get that bruise?--might oblige you to come to grips with this situation very quickly."" It seems generally true that people in abusive or self-harming situations are better off telling the truth so they can get help. However, there are complicated psychological reasons why they may lie (by commission or omission) to protect their abusers, skate through a fearful moment, and maintain their dangerous situations. Faced with such an event, I would add more nuance to the consequentialist perspective and emphasize the ""lying is harmful"" while almost entirely dropping off the ""and therefore immoral."" In certain situations, judging an action to be ""morally wrong"" can be an effective way of bringing about a stop to that behavior. It can put a cork in selfishness, hubris, and so forth. By contrast, judging abuse victims to be committing moral wrong against themselves while they try to navigate their way out of a psychological prison does not help their situation, but only compounds their confusion. Part of the issue here is that Harris, throughout his book, depicts lies as having very short shelf-lives--their usefulness can begin deteriorating within seconds after the lie's cover is blown. Those of us who are concerned with long-term decision-making may read philosophy to learn how to live happier lives overall. Yet even those of us who consider ourselves long-term thinkers may experience certain moments -- confronting a serial killer at the front door, being stuck in an abusive relationship -- when we are trapped in short-term survival thinking. In those moments, we don't really care about the long-term prognosis of our lies of various colors. The long-term effects of our words may be objectively relevant and applicable, but we are not capable of analyzing them or caring about them. This oversight is a weakness in this short book.The book is nevertheless a good introduction to thinking about the question of lying. It makes a number of good points clearly and raises many worthwhile questions."

I believe the world would be a different place if everyone was completely honest, even with the small social lies we tell to spare the feelings of others.

Yet I don't want to go through life criticizing others with my personal opinions.

40,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13315860-peter-colclasure,4,"A few years back I read Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs, where he quotes Steve Wozniak as saying ""I never lie. I haven't told a lie in years."" I remember reading that and thinking, how is that possible? How can you just not lie? So I decided to run an experiment and see how long I could go without saying anything that was dishonest, evasive, or misleading. It was harder than I thought it would be. The first step was self-awareness. In order to refrain from lying, I had to first be aware of it, and I wasn't always aware of it. I'd catch myself saying, ""Oh, there was a traffic jam,"" when I was five minutes late for work, only to realize halfway through my utterance that it was complete bullshit. I hadn't premeditated the lie, it was reflexive. It just came out. So the first thing I realized was how habitual white lies were for me. Not an everyday occurrence, but often enough. I can say that I never lied about anything significant, but I often bent the truth in my own interests as social lubricant, and the process was unconscious. For instance, I would regularly give people compliments that I only half believed because I wanted to be nice to them. I wouldn't describe myself as a dishonest person when I was younger, but in my teens and early 20s I had a tendency to embellish stories, for entertainment value, or brevity. And there was at least one occasion when I told a significant, consequential lie, to a man I cared about. I regret it to this day. Becoming a more honest person meant, for me, first getting in touch with the truth. In order to not lie, you have to actually think about what is true and what is false as you go through your day. You have to be honest with yourself about what you really feel. You can't just  mindlessly blurt out anything that's expedient, and that can be a tough habit to break.I still catch myself lying occasionally, but it's gotten to the point where it's once every couple of months, and the big difference is that now every time I say anything that isn't true I am 100% aware of it, like there's a spotlight on me.For instance, last October I was playing a solo show at a community college in the afternoon. The act going up on stage after me was a husband and wife duo that rapped in Arabic. They asked if I would stick around and watch them play. I said, ""I'd love to, but I have another gig downtown."" That was a lie. The other gig had been canceled. But I wanted to meet a friend for lunch. I'm working to eradicate behavior like this. Oh yeah, the book. I supposed I should talk about it since this is a book review. It's short. It's slightly dry but very thoughtful. Sam Harris takes a hardline stance on lying: don't do it ever. Don't tell your kids about Santa Claus. Don't throw surprise birthday parties. I think many readers would find this extreme, but he does a fine job of explaining, in detail, why he thinks these well-intentioned and admittedly benign behaviors could have unintended consequences. I disagree with him about Santa and surprise birthday parties, but I agree with pretty much everything else. Most people, myself included, are incapable of clearing the high moral bar that Harris sets for humanity. But I'm still glad the bar is there."

Neuroscientist, atheist icon and accomplished author Dr. Sam Harris provides yet another thought-provoking title.

The Mirror of Honesty, 3. Two Types of Lies, 4. White Lies, 5. Trust, 6. Faint Praise, 7. Secrets, 8. Lies in Extremis, 9. Mental Accounting, 10. Integrity, 11. Big Lies, and 12. Conclusion.Positives:1.	A great thinker who has mastered the ability to convey cogent thoughts in an accessible and memorable manner.2.	I always learn something new from Dr. Harris, always.3.	Always thought-provoking and compelling.4.	A trustworthy track record of high-quality work. 5.	Dissects the concept of lying with mastery. ""To lie is to intentionally mislead others when they expect honest communication"".6.	Clearly explains why people lie and the implications of such lies.7.	Clearly differentiates speaking truthfully from the held beliefs being true. Fabulous!8.	The main points of being truthful. Compelling.9.	Two types of lies: commission and omission. 10.	Great quotes, ""To lie is to infringe upon the freedom of those we care about"".11.	Interesting look at false encouragement.12.	A lesson learned with faint praise.13.	Interesting cases that help understand the points being made.14.	The importance of integrity.15.	Summarizes his essay with expertise.16.	Links worked fine.17.	Brief essay that is worth reading multiple times.Negatives:1.	My expectation are always high with Dr. Harris. So I must be truthful in saying that I was expecting more. As an example, I was hoping to get evidence from a scientific point of view. What does lying do to the brain for instance...2.	The idea of using evasive language instead of lying at times may work but even in extreme cases? Hmmm...3.	Dr. Harris espouses objective morality one that can be traced back to the brain but once again no evidence provided. I would have liked to have seen the link between our sense of morality and lying.4.	No charts or illustrations provided. 5.	Very few iconic quotes or intellectual homeruns that characterize Dr. Harris. The burden of living up to high expectations.In summary, I'm a big fan of Dr. Harris. He is one of my favorite thinkers and is able to say and write eloquently thoughts many of us have in common. His work is always thought-provoking and in this essay he provides strong arguments in support of his general thesis: that our lives would simplify and improve if we didn't lie. My only complaint is the lack of scientific depth, Dr. Harris relies mainly on his remarkable sense of logic and even that is persuasive enough on its own. An essay worth reading multiple times, I highly recommend it!"
42,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6108634-therese,3,"As part of my ""self-improvment/self-help"" reading kick, I read this very short book on lying by Sam Harris. It caught my attention because I've always prided myself on being an honest, open person, but a big part of his argument is that even lies of omission or white lies, told for the sake of kindness, are harmful and unethical. Thinking about it, I feel like I do that a lot trying to spare people's feelings, and Sam Harris argues that this kind of thing is hurtful, because by not being honest about negative things, you're depriving people of knowledge that could help them.One reason I think I'm so wary of saying critical things to people is that, partly as a result of being influenced by existentialism, I have a deep respect for other people's freedom to make their own choices and be their own authentic selves through those choices. As a friend, it's not my job to fix or improve or change or influence anyone - at best I think friends can help each other figure out who they really are and want to be and to become more true to themselves, by listening and asking questions and having conversations exploring those things. Conversely, it *is* my job to take responsibility for my own life choices and happiness, and part of that involves trying to be around people who affect my life in positive ways, and protecting myself from people who hurt me, by choosing not to be around them if I can help it.In the case of people whose behavior I sometimes don't like, because it's hurtful or self-destructive or some way distasteful to me, I feel like the best approach is most of the time positive reinforcement rather than being critical and calling them out on their bad behavior. So you give support and encouragement and praise when you see them doing something positive, and when the bad behavior happens you just don't give it any attention or communication at all, because the problem is that it's very easy from childhood on for people to learn that bad behavior can get them attention, and the negative attention feels better than no interaction at all. So negative attention always risks reinforcing the negative behavior.I can see Sam Harris's point though, about depriving people of helpful insights by refraining from criticism or negative comments ... but I think maybe a healthy balance is that if you value someone's role in your life as a friend or partner, yet you find their behavior is hurting you, the ethical approach is to give them at least a few chances to change by telling them honestly that they're being hurtful. If you've tried to communicate about it two or three times and the problems keep resurfacing, then you just have to let go and walk away and leave them to work out their issues at a safe distance ..."

I think those are fun and generally harmless.Something I wish the author would have addressed is that the person asking a question needs to own up the responsibility/gravity of the question/request they are asking. If a girl asks if she is fat in a dress. She should think ""Do I really want to hear the answer if it's yes?"" Or the author used the example of a dying person asking before going into operation, and the chances are slim that they will survive, ""Am I going to make it?"" Instead of dumping the emotional load on the person who already has the enormous task of being honest and telling the truth, why not depart from it and have the person who is asking the dang question be accountable for what he/she is asking? Why does the honest listener get the blame for being honest? The stupid question-asker should think about both possible answers to the question they want to know and ask themselves if they can handle both answers. This then distributes the honesty principle evenly between both parties.A simple solution to not lie is to just say ""I don't want to talk about it,"" or ""that's inappropriate."" That's it."

Our dishonesty not only influences the choices they make, it often determines the choices they can make—and in ways we cannot always predict. Every lie is a direct assault upon the autonomy of those we lie to.” ― Sam Harris, LyingHe does not frame it in a moralistic way but as a logical conclusion that liberates both the liar and the recipient of the lie from many burdens and possible negative outcomes, while building a better relationship and trust.“Unlike statements of fact, which require no further work on our part, lies must be continually protected from collisions with reality.” ― Sam Harris, LyingAn excellent exploration of what is a way of life for some or an occasional failure for others; all of us have done it and have had others inflict it on us, making it very personal and useful topic that touches all of humanity. Everyday philosophy served as a very fulfilling read.“Honesty is a gift we can give to others. It is also a source of power and an engine of simplicity.” ― Sam Harris, Lying"

It's concise and presents a compelling argument.Lying creates more problems than it is worth. What we are actually doing is investing in the illusion of avoiding complications.He also makes the point that this taints our relationships. If we cannot be fully open and honest (even including so called white lies), then are we being truly loving? We often think that protecting our friends and loved ones from the pain of the truth is the loving thing to do when, in actuality, telling unpleasant truths may inspire them to change, grow, and heal. More importantly, it releases the mental static necessary to maintain these untruths, leaving one free to invest that mental energy in being present. This is a subtle effect but an important one.There are arguments to be made, of course, but I generally agree.In fact, I was withholding something from someone close to me. It was an unpleasant fact about myself, that I wasn't comfortable sharing (lie of omission). I shared it and immediately felt better. Not only that, the person I shared it with felt closer to me, and, in return, opened up and shared some of their pain. Bonding us closer together. It was a beautiful thing, and I'm grateful that I read this book when I did. I will continue incorporating its principles in my life."

The argument is that, unless you're dealing with someone you never want to have any kind of relationship with (ex. psychopath, enemy in war)--and maybe not even then--lying does more harm than good. Even white lies meant to spare the other person's feelings or be polite cause damage to a relationship. He gives the example of ""Does this dress make me look fat?""--Instead of rushing to say ""no!"", consider the truth, which might be any of these:- That's an unflattering dress for you. You'd look better in a different cut.- I love you no matter what you look like.- You would feel a lot better about yourself if you dropped a few pounds.Any of these, if they're the truth and expressed kindly, would be more helpful in the long run than a lie of ""No, you look great!""It's a really interesting argument, and what he says makes a lot of sense. I try to avoid lying whenever possible, but I do sugar-coat and dissemble, and sometimes I white-lie to be ""nice."" I'm so bad at thinking on my feet, and my natural way of expressing things is so blunt!

We live in a world now days where honesty is hardly appreciated, lying is a subconscience behavior of our daily lives and we use our lies as skills to communicate with others without knowing how destructive this might be for those who are around us and for ourselves in the first place, even though it's harder and sometimes less socially convenient for us to tell the truth, we should always try to be honest in our answers and discussions. because by not letting the truth out, thinking that it's better to avoid uncomfortable situations or hurtful comments, we are being selfish and misleading without knowing.""By lying, we deny others a view of the world as it is.

They started with the simple question taking sense on the nature of reality and it took more than 2 hours for them to move on without succumbing to one another's argument. According to Jordan Peterson, truth is whatever the fact or beliefs that doesnt kill us which would makes us stronger - more like scientific anthrocentrism whereas Sam Harris took upon scientific realism that truth is independent of our existence, irrespective of the fact we got turned to ashes or not. The philosophy put forth by the neuroscientist here corresponds to realism but in a deep anthropocentric sense and maybe that's the reason people find it way too obvious.""How would your relationships change if you resolved never to lie again? What truths might suddenly come into view in your life? What kind of person would you become? And how might you change the people around you?"" Philosophy in a more personal sense would work out if implemented to the world, as individuals, it can lead to the betterment. I would consider this a decent self help book."

After reading this book this is what happens: you can't stop noticing all the times you tell little little white lies for your convenience. I was astounded how often I would fall into this trap and how unaware of it I was!Now, after reading this book I would immediately notice and either stop or try to recover from it.The key message of the book is that we, as a society, tend to believe white lies are ok, but they indeed have a very negative effect on our interactions and our personal integrity. Lying often exchanges short term benefits for long term troubles.A good idea expressed in the book is this: if you never lie there is nothing you have to remember, you need only this little rule. Do not lie. If you know you never lie, you never have to deal with it.The book discusses also edge cases in which lying may be necessary (e.g., dealing with a murderer). But the golden rule works in practice 99.9% of the times. DO NOT LIE. NEVER EVER AGAIN. It's very liberating!"

If one lacks free will , how does one have the choice of telling the truth or not?!(5) Calling this a book (42 pages.

60,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56884005-kalle-nordenstorm,4,"2nd read and I bet I will read it againWhat he is sayingIn committing to be honest with everyone, we commit to avoiding a wide range of long- term problems, but at the cost of occasional, short-term discomfort. However, the discomfort should not be exaggerated: You can be honest and kind, because your purpose in telling the truth is not to offend people: You simply want them to have the information you have, and would want to have if you were in their position. What truth feels likeThe year was 1987, but it might as well have been the Summer of Love: I was twenty, had hair down to my shoulders, and was dressed like an Indian rickshaw driver. For those charged with enforcing our nation's drug laws, it would have been only prudent to subject my luggage to special scrutiny. Happily, I had nothing to hide. ""Where are you coming from?"" the officer asked, glancing skeptically at my backpack. ""India, Nepal, Thailand..."" I said. ""Did you take any drugs while you were over there?"" As it happens, I had. The temptation to lie was obvious — why speak to a customs officer about my recent drug use? But there was no real reason not to tell the truth, apart from the risk that it would lead to an even more thorough search of my luggage (and perhaps of my person) than had already commenced. Yes,"" I said. The officer stopped searching my bag and looked up. ""Which drugs did you take? ""I smoked pot a few times... And I tried opium in India."" ""Opium?"" ""Yes."" ""Opium or heroin? ""It was opium."" 'You don't hear much about opium these days."" ""I know. It was the first time I'd ever tried it."" ""Are you carrying any drugs with you now?"" ""No."" The officer eyed me warily for a moment and then returned to searching my bag. Given the nature of our conversation, I reconciled myself to being there for a very long time. I was, therefore, as patient as a tree. Which was a good thing, because the officer was now examining my belongings as though any one item — a toothbrush, a book, a flashlight, a bit of nylon cord — might reveal the deepest secrets of the universe. ""What is opium like?"" he asked after a time. And I told him. In fact, over the next ten minutes, I told this lawman almost everything I knew about the use of mind-altering substances. Eventually he completed his search and closed my luggage. One thing was perfectly obvious at the end of our encounter: We both felt very good about it. What it is like being honest and what it is like being dishonestHonesty demands confidence and intelligence. It places you in difficult situations, just like lying does. But honesty takes you there more quickly. Lying often means delaying the difficult. While honesty means taking it on right away. Seems related to conscientiousness.For instance, say a friend asks you how you are feeling and makes clear she wants the real answer, not just the standard fine. It is not obvious which information you would want to have if you were in the other persons situation, and as Harris states so well at the beginning of his essay You simply want them to have the information you have, and would want to have if you were in their position.  To handle this well you need prudence and prudence comes from experience, experience which you amass much faster by practicing radical honesty and by building life experience.I guess honesty makes you look good because the good have less to hide, either because there is so little problematic about you, or because you are skilled enough to speak about the problematic and complex.

64,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"This is a bit longer than a magazine essay and in its length feels more like a journal article than a book. It covers a lot of ground and makes the point quite clearly.Harris is a consequentialist, something he does not argue for in this book but explained previously in The Moral Landscape. Consequentialism is a theory that maintains that the ethical value of an act is determined by its consequences. Consequentialism is often broken down into two main types: one in which the outcome of each specific act must be evaluated separately (as much as possible), and one in which general rules may be formulated based on the usual or probable outcomes of similar acts. Harris presents a clear example of the latter type in his wholesale rejection of lying.What is lying? It's a deliberate attempt to deceive others into believing something different than what we believe to be true. It may be an act of omission -- we can lie through what we don't say -- but this is a little more slippery, as Harris finds nothing offensive about the concept of privacy and furthermore is aware that if we resolved to communicate all the information we knew and correct every error we perceived we'd never have time to sleep. So Harris chose to focus on acts of commission. He gives a lot of attention to so-called ""white lies"" that are usually well-meaning attempts to spare others' feelings.Why does Harris say lying is undesirable? For a multitude of reasons. For one, it breaks down human relationships. It is wonderful to have friends who will tell you the truth, even when it is hard to hear, he says. When we hide our weaknesses or fail to critique someone who is asking for honest feedback, we are giving up opportunities to grow. This sort of stunting becomes offensive in principle: ""deciding how much (another) can know about himself seems the quintessence of arrogance,"" and as a result of keeping others ignorant of the truth, ""to lie is to infringe upon the freedom of those we care about."" For another reason, liars have to remember everything they've lied about. ""To agree to keep a secret,"" small as it may seem, ""is to assume a burden."" Due to a strange fact about human psychology, liars deprecate their ""victims"" so as to justify their own lying behavior to themselves, and thus liars become less trustful of other people even as those who have been lied to have more reason not to trust the liars. Lying thus makes everyone unhappier. When authorities lie, it causes mass confusion when people no longer know what information sources to trust, and this ruins public debate. For yet another reason, while liars have to remember everything they've lied about, people who are lied to cannot forget anything they've been lied to about. What psychologists call the ""illusory truth effect"" means that ""We seem to be predisposed to remember statements as true even after they have been disconfirmed."" A lie is forever, no matter how many times you try to take it back.To Harris, as a consequentialist, anything that harms the ability of humans to thrive is morally wrong. Therefore, lying is wrong.He does, briefly, admit that there might be some exceptions to the rule. ""If you think that it can ever be appropriate to injure or kill a person in self-defense, or in defense of another, it makes no sense to rule out lying in the same circumstances,"" he explains. It is permissible to lie in the unusual circumstance that ""we have judged the prospects of establishing a real relationship with this person to be nonexistent."" Even then, however, he suggests that the truth is often better than a lie. He provides a typical example of giving shelter to a child pursued by a murderer. If the murderer asks if you are sheltering the child, rather than saying ""no,"" you could say (in Harris's script), ""I wouldn't tell you even if I knew. And if you take another step, I'll put a bullet in your brain."" Something seems amiss here. Supplying a physical threat surely assumes the inability to develop a ""real relationship"" as much as lying assumes it, and degrades an existing relationship as much as lying degrades it. Furthermore, the one-liner is only available to people who do not stutter when facing a serial killer at their front door and happen to have a loaded pistol in their pocket. Elsewhere, in describing war, Harris said: ""The moment one begins dropping bombs, or destroying a country's infrastructure with cyber attacks, lying has become just another weapon in the arsenal."" If lying is a kind of weapon, then surely it is a useful weapon for the physically weak to fairly level the playing field against those who have initiated physical force against them. This wrinkle is not something he addresses.One other example sounds a bit askew. He writes that one possible result of honesty is that ""real problems in your life can be forced to the surface. Are you in an abusive relationship? A refusal to lie to others--How did you get that bruise?--might oblige you to come to grips with this situation very quickly."" It seems generally true that people in abusive or self-harming situations are better off telling the truth so they can get help. However, there are complicated psychological reasons why they may lie (by commission or omission) to protect their abusers, skate through a fearful moment, and maintain their dangerous situations. Faced with such an event, I would add more nuance to the consequentialist perspective and emphasize the ""lying is harmful"" while almost entirely dropping off the ""and therefore immoral."" In certain situations, judging an action to be ""morally wrong"" can be an effective way of bringing about a stop to that behavior. It can put a cork in selfishness, hubris, and so forth. By contrast, judging abuse victims to be committing moral wrong against themselves while they try to navigate their way out of a psychological prison does not help their situation, but only compounds their confusion. Part of the issue here is that Harris, throughout his book, depicts lies as having very short shelf-lives--their usefulness can begin deteriorating within seconds after the lie's cover is blown. Those of us who are concerned with long-term decision-making may read philosophy to learn how to live happier lives overall. Yet even those of us who consider ourselves long-term thinkers may experience certain moments -- confronting a serial killer at the front door, being stuck in an abusive relationship -- when we are trapped in short-term survival thinking. In those moments, we don't really care about the long-term prognosis of our lies of various colors. The long-term effects of our words may be objectively relevant and applicable, but we are not capable of analyzing them or caring about them. This oversight is a weakness in this short book.The book is nevertheless a good introduction to thinking about the question of lying. It makes a number of good points clearly and raises many worthwhile questions."

I believe the world would be a different place if everyone was completely honest, even with the small social lies we tell to spare the feelings of others. My mind has been dwelling on authenticity and the quandary of getting true personal critisism to become a better person, when everyone feels too awkward to give any meaningful feedback. Yet I don't want to go through life criticizing others with my personal opinions. Sam Harris provided interesting discussion on this issue without giving advice except that, in his opinion it is always better to tell the truth, come what may. "

70,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13315860-peter-colclasure,4,"A few years back I read Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs, where he quotes Steve Wozniak as saying ""I never lie. I haven't told a lie in years."" I remember reading that and thinking, how is that possible? How can you just not lie? So I decided to run an experiment and see how long I could go without saying anything that was dishonest, evasive, or misleading. It was harder than I thought it would be. The first step was self-awareness. In order to refrain from lying, I had to first be aware of it, and I wasn't always aware of it. I'd catch myself saying, ""Oh, there was a traffic jam,"" when I was five minutes late for work, only to realize halfway through my utterance that it was complete bullshit. I hadn't premeditated the lie, it was reflexive. It just came out. So the first thing I realized was how habitual white lies were for me. Not an everyday occurrence, but often enough. I can say that I never lied about anything significant, but I often bent the truth in my own interests as social lubricant, and the process was unconscious. For instance, I would regularly give people compliments that I only half believed because I wanted to be nice to them. I wouldn't describe myself as a dishonest person when I was younger, but in my teens and early 20s I had a tendency to embellish stories, for entertainment value, or brevity. And there was at least one occasion when I told a significant, consequential lie, to a man I cared about. I regret it to this day. Becoming a more honest person meant, for me, first getting in touch with the truth. In order to not lie, you have to actually think about what is true and what is false as you go through your day. You have to be honest with yourself about what you really feel. You can't just  mindlessly blurt out anything that's expedient, and that can be a tough habit to break.I still catch myself lying occasionally, but it's gotten to the point where it's once every couple of months, and the big difference is that now every time I say anything that isn't true I am 100% aware of it, like there's a spotlight on me.For instance, last October I was playing a solo show at a community college in the afternoon. The act going up on stage after me was a husband and wife duo that rapped in Arabic. They asked if I would stick around and watch them play. I said, ""I'd love to, but I have another gig downtown."" That was a lie. The other gig had been canceled. But I wanted to meet a friend for lunch. I'm working to eradicate behavior like this. Oh yeah, the book. I supposed I should talk about it since this is a book review. It's short. It's slightly dry but very thoughtful. Sam Harris takes a hardline stance on lying: don't do it ever. Don't tell your kids about Santa Claus. Don't throw surprise birthday parties. I think many readers would find this extreme, but he does a fine job of explaining, in detail, why he thinks these well-intentioned and admittedly benign behaviors could have unintended consequences. I disagree with him about Santa and surprise birthday parties, but I agree with pretty much everything else. Most people, myself included, are incapable of clearing the high moral bar that Harris sets for humanity. But I'm still glad the bar is there."

Neuroscientist, atheist icon and accomplished author Dr. Sam Harris provides yet another thought-provoking title. In this brief but eloquent essay, Harris convincingly establishes the virtues of not lying. This 145-KB book is composed of the following twelve chapters: 1. What is a Lie?, 2. The Mirror of Honesty, 3. Two Types of Lies, 4. White Lies, 5. Trust, 6. Faint Praise, 7. Secrets, 8. Lies in Extremis, 9. Mental Accounting, 10. Integrity, 11. Big Lies, and 12. Conclusion.Positives:1.	A great thinker who has mastered the ability to convey cogent thoughts in an accessible and memorable manner.2.	I always learn something new from Dr. Harris, always.3.	Always thought-provoking and compelling.4.	A trustworthy track record of high-quality work. 5.	Dissects the concept of lying with mastery. ""To lie is to intentionally mislead others when they expect honest communication"".6.	Clearly explains why people lie and the implications of such lies.7.	Clearly differentiates speaking truthfully from the held beliefs being true. Fabulous!8.	The main points of being truthful. Compelling.9.	Two types of lies: commission and omission. 10.	Great quotes, ""To lie is to infringe upon the freedom of those we care about"".11.	Interesting look at false encouragement.12.	A lesson learned with faint praise.13.	Interesting cases that help understand the points being made.14.	The importance of integrity.15.	Summarizes his essay with expertise.16.	Links worked fine.17.	Brief essay that is worth reading multiple times.Negatives:1.	My expectation are always high with Dr. Harris. So I must be truthful in saying that I was expecting more. As an example, I was hoping to get evidence from a scientific point of view. What does lying do to the brain for instance...2.	The idea of using evasive language instead of lying at times may work but even in extreme cases? Hmmm...3.	Dr. Harris espouses objective morality one that can be traced back to the brain but once again no evidence provided. I would have liked to have seen the link between our sense of morality and lying.4.	No charts or illustrations provided. 5.	Very few iconic quotes or intellectual homeruns that characterize Dr. Harris. The burden of living up to high expectations.In summary, I'm a big fan of Dr. Harris. He is one of my favorite thinkers and is able to say and write eloquently thoughts many of us have in common. His work is always thought-provoking and in this essay he provides strong arguments in support of his general thesis: that our lives would simplify and improve if we didn't lie. My only complaint is the lack of scientific depth, Dr. Harris relies mainly on his remarkable sense of logic and even that is persuasive enough on its own. An essay worth reading multiple times, I highly recommend it!"
72,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6108634-therese,3,"As part of my ""self-improvment/self-help"" reading kick, I read this very short book on lying by Sam Harris. It caught my attention because I've always prided myself on being an honest, open person, but a big part of his argument is that even lies of omission or white lies, told for the sake of kindness, are harmful and unethical. Thinking about it, I feel like I do that a lot trying to spare people's feelings, and Sam Harris argues that this kind of thing is hurtful, because by not being honest about negative things, you're depriving people of knowledge that could help them.One reason I think I'm so wary of saying critical things to people is that, partly as a result of being influenced by existentialism, I have a deep respect for other people's freedom to make their own choices and be their own authentic selves through those choices. As a friend, it's not my job to fix or improve or change or influence anyone - at best I think friends can help each other figure out who they really are and want to be and to become more true to themselves, by listening and asking questions and having conversations exploring those things. Conversely, it *is* my job to take responsibility for my own life choices and happiness, and part of that involves trying to be around people who affect my life in positive ways, and protecting myself from people who hurt me, by choosing not to be around them if I can help it.In the case of people whose behavior I sometimes don't like, because it's hurtful or self-destructive or some way distasteful to me, I feel like the best approach is most of the time positive reinforcement rather than being critical and calling them out on their bad behavior. So you give support and encouragement and praise when you see them doing something positive, and when the bad behavior happens you just don't give it any attention or communication at all, because the problem is that it's very easy from childhood on for people to learn that bad behavior can get them attention, and the negative attention feels better than no interaction at all. So negative attention always risks reinforcing the negative behavior.I can see Sam Harris's point though, about depriving people of helpful insights by refraining from criticism or negative comments ... but I think maybe a healthy balance is that if you value someone's role in your life as a friend or partner, yet you find their behavior is hurting you, the ethical approach is to give them at least a few chances to change by telling them honestly that they're being hurtful. If you've tried to communicate about it two or three times and the problems keep resurfacing, then you just have to let go and walk away and leave them to work out their issues at a safe distance ..."

74,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9533949-kimball,4,"A good little informative booklet. I wish it was longer. It reminds me of this neat article I read about stopping lying %100. If you're reading this review please read this article. Some of the comments are pretty funny/good too. I didn't agree with the author's opinion about surprise parties. I think those are fun and generally harmless.Something I wish the author would have addressed is that the person asking a question needs to own up the responsibility/gravity of the question/request they are asking. If a girl asks if she is fat in a dress. She should think ""Do I really want to hear the answer if it's yes?"" Or the author used the example of a dying person asking before going into operation, and the chances are slim that they will survive, ""Am I going to make it?"" Instead of dumping the emotional load on the person who already has the enormous task of being honest and telling the truth, why not depart from it and have the person who is asking the dang question be accountable for what he/she is asking? Why does the honest listener get the blame for being honest? The stupid question-asker should think about both possible answers to the question they want to know and ask themselves if they can handle both answers. This then distributes the honesty principle evenly between both parties.A simple solution to not lie is to just say ""I don't want to talk about it,"" or ""that's inappropriate."" That's it."

Our dishonesty not only influences the choices they make, it often determines the choices they can make—and in ways we cannot always predict. Every lie is a direct assault upon the autonomy of those we lie to.” ― Sam Harris, LyingHe does not frame it in a moralistic way but as a logical conclusion that liberates both the liar and the recipient of the lie from many burdens and possible negative outcomes, while building a better relationship and trust.“Unlike statements of fact, which require no further work on our part, lies must be continually protected from collisions with reality.” ― Sam Harris, LyingAn excellent exploration of what is a way of life for some or an occasional failure for others; all of us have done it and have had others inflict it on us, making it very personal and useful topic that touches all of humanity. Everyday philosophy served as a very fulfilling read.“Honesty is a gift we can give to others. It is also a source of power and an engine of simplicity.” ― Sam Harris, Lying"
76,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4906386-chris,4,"Pretty solid. It's a short book, but well worth reading. It's concise and presents a compelling argument.Lying creates more problems than it is worth. What we are actually doing is investing in the illusion of avoiding complications.He also makes the point that this taints our relationships. If we cannot be fully open and honest (even including so called white lies), then are we being truly loving? We often think that protecting our friends and loved ones from the pain of the truth is the loving thing to do when, in actuality, telling unpleasant truths may inspire them to change, grow, and heal. More importantly, it releases the mental static necessary to maintain these untruths, leaving one free to invest that mental energy in being present. This is a subtle effect but an important one.There are arguments to be made, of course, but I generally agree.In fact, I was withholding something from someone close to me. It was an unpleasant fact about myself, that I wasn't comfortable sharing (lie of omission). I shared it and immediately felt better. Not only that, the person I shared it with felt closer to me, and, in return, opened up and shared some of their pain. Bonding us closer together. It was a beautiful thing, and I'm grateful that I read this book when I did. I will continue incorporating its principles in my life."
77,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2021933-cara,4,"This is a philosophical Kindle Short about lying. The argument is that, unless you're dealing with someone you never want to have any kind of relationship with (ex. psychopath, enemy in war)--and maybe not even then--lying does more harm than good. Even white lies meant to spare the other person's feelings or be polite cause damage to a relationship. He gives the example of ""Does this dress make me look fat?""--Instead of rushing to say ""no!"", consider the truth, which might be any of these:- That's an unflattering dress for you. You'd look better in a different cut.- I love you no matter what you look like.- You would feel a lot better about yourself if you dropped a few pounds.Any of these, if they're the truth and expressed kindly, would be more helpful in the long run than a lie of ""No, you look great!""It's a really interesting argument, and what he says makes a lot of sense. I try to avoid lying whenever possible, but I do sugar-coat and dissemble, and sometimes I white-lie to be ""nice."" I'm so bad at thinking on my feet, and my natural way of expressing things is so blunt! But I think he's right--it would be better to quit.This is the first thing I've read in quite some time that's actually made me think. Good stuff."

We live in a world now days where honesty is hardly appreciated, lying is a subconscience behavior of our daily lives and we use our lies as skills to communicate with others without knowing how destructive this might be for those who are around us and for ourselves in the first place, even though it's harder and sometimes less socially convenient for us to tell the truth, we should always try to be honest in our answers and discussions. because by not letting the truth out, thinking that it's better to avoid uncomfortable situations or hurtful comments, we are being selfish and misleading without knowing.""By lying, we deny others a view of the world as it is.

79,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41690792-muthuvel,3,"I happened to listen a podcast of Sam Harris interviewing Jordan Peterson on the question of 'what is truth'? They started with the simple question taking sense on the nature of reality and it took more than 2 hours for them to move on without succumbing to one another's argument. According to Jordan Peterson, truth is whatever the fact or beliefs that doesnt kill us which would makes us stronger - more like scientific anthrocentrism whereas Sam Harris took upon scientific realism that truth is independent of our existence, irrespective of the fact we got turned to ashes or not. The philosophy put forth by the neuroscientist here corresponds to realism but in a deep anthropocentric sense and maybe that's the reason people find it way too obvious.""How would your relationships change if you resolved never to lie again? What truths might suddenly come into view in your life? What kind of person would you become? And how might you change the people around you?"" Philosophy in a more personal sense would work out if implemented to the world, as individuals, it can lead to the betterment. I would consider this a decent self help book."

After reading this book this is what happens: you can't stop noticing all the times you tell little little white lies for your convenience. I was astounded how often I would fall into this trap and how unaware of it I was!Now, after reading this book I would immediately notice and either stop or try to recover from it.The key message of the book is that we, as a society, tend to believe white lies are ok, but they indeed have a very negative effect on our interactions and our personal integrity. Lying often exchanges short term benefits for long term troubles.A good idea expressed in the book is this: if you never lie there is nothing you have to remember, you need only this little rule. Do not lie. If you know you never lie, you never have to deal with it.The book discusses also edge cases in which lying may be necessary (e.g., dealing with a murderer). But the golden rule works in practice 99.9% of the times. DO NOT LIE. NEVER EVER AGAIN. It's very liberating!"

If one lacks free will , how does one have the choice of telling the truth or not?!(5) Calling this a book (42 pages.

It destroys trust in relationships. While I was motivated and inspired by his words, I did find a bit of repetition on the scant number of pages, when I wanted something new to sink my teeth into. He could have said so much more, but then it would have been a book instead of an e-booklet. For the low cost the message has enormous value."

90,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56884005-kalle-nordenstorm,4,"2nd read and I bet I will read it againWhat he is sayingIn committing to be honest with everyone, we commit to avoiding a wide range of long- term problems, but at the cost of occasional, short-term discomfort. However, the discomfort should not be exaggerated: You can be honest and kind, because your purpose in telling the truth is not to offend people: You simply want them to have the information you have, and would want to have if you were in their position. What truth feels likeThe year was 1987, but it might as well have been the Summer of Love: I was twenty, had hair down to my shoulders, and was dressed like an Indian rickshaw driver. For those charged with enforcing our nation's drug laws, it would have been only prudent to subject my luggage to special scrutiny. Happily, I had nothing to hide. ""Where are you coming from?"" the officer asked, glancing skeptically at my backpack. ""India, Nepal, Thailand..."" I said. ""Did you take any drugs while you were over there?"" As it happens, I had. The temptation to lie was obvious — why speak to a customs officer about my recent drug use? But there was no real reason not to tell the truth, apart from the risk that it would lead to an even more thorough search of my luggage (and perhaps of my person) than had already commenced. Yes,"" I said. The officer stopped searching my bag and looked up. ""Which drugs did you take? ""I smoked pot a few times... And I tried opium in India."" ""Opium?"" ""Yes."" ""Opium or heroin? ""It was opium."" 'You don't hear much about opium these days."" ""I know. It was the first time I'd ever tried it."" ""Are you carrying any drugs with you now?"" ""No."" The officer eyed me warily for a moment and then returned to searching my bag. Given the nature of our conversation, I reconciled myself to being there for a very long time. I was, therefore, as patient as a tree. Which was a good thing, because the officer was now examining my belongings as though any one item — a toothbrush, a book, a flashlight, a bit of nylon cord — might reveal the deepest secrets of the universe. ""What is opium like?"" he asked after a time. And I told him. In fact, over the next ten minutes, I told this lawman almost everything I knew about the use of mind-altering substances. Eventually he completed his search and closed my luggage. One thing was perfectly obvious at the end of our encounter: We both felt very good about it. What it is like being honest and what it is like being dishonestHonesty demands confidence and intelligence. It places you in difficult situations, just like lying does. But honesty takes you there more quickly. Lying often means delaying the difficult. While honesty means taking it on right away. Seems related to conscientiousness.For instance, say a friend asks you how you are feeling and makes clear she wants the real answer, not just the standard fine. It is not obvious which information you would want to have if you were in the other persons situation, and as Harris states so well at the beginning of his essay You simply want them to have the information you have, and would want to have if you were in their position.  To handle this well you need prudence and prudence comes from experience, experience which you amass much faster by practicing radical honesty and by building life experience.I guess honesty makes you look good because the good have less to hide, either because there is so little problematic about you, or because you are skilled enough to speak about the problematic and complex.

94,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"This is a bit longer than a magazine essay and in its length feels more like a journal article than a book. It covers a lot of ground and makes the point quite clearly.Harris is a consequentialist, something he does not argue for in this book but explained previously in The Moral Landscape. Consequentialism is a theory that maintains that the ethical value of an act is determined by its consequences. Consequentialism is often broken down into two main types: one in which the outcome of each specific act must be evaluated separately (as much as possible), and one in which general rules may be formulated based on the usual or probable outcomes of similar acts. Harris presents a clear example of the latter type in his wholesale rejection of lying.What is lying? It's a deliberate attempt to deceive others into believing something different than what we believe to be true. It may be an act of omission -- we can lie through what we don't say -- but this is a little more slippery, as Harris finds nothing offensive about the concept of privacy and furthermore is aware that if we resolved to communicate all the information we knew and correct every error we perceived we'd never have time to sleep. So Harris chose to focus on acts of commission. He gives a lot of attention to so-called ""white lies"" that are usually well-meaning attempts to spare others' feelings.Why does Harris say lying is undesirable? For a multitude of reasons. For one, it breaks down human relationships. It is wonderful to have friends who will tell you the truth, even when it is hard to hear, he says. When we hide our weaknesses or fail to critique someone who is asking for honest feedback, we are giving up opportunities to grow. This sort of stunting becomes offensive in principle: ""deciding how much (another) can know about himself seems the quintessence of arrogance,"" and as a result of keeping others ignorant of the truth, ""to lie is to infringe upon the freedom of those we care about."" For another reason, liars have to remember everything they've lied about. ""To agree to keep a secret,"" small as it may seem, ""is to assume a burden."" Due to a strange fact about human psychology, liars deprecate their ""victims"" so as to justify their own lying behavior to themselves, and thus liars become less trustful of other people even as those who have been lied to have more reason not to trust the liars. Lying thus makes everyone unhappier. When authorities lie, it causes mass confusion when people no longer know what information sources to trust, and this ruins public debate. For yet another reason, while liars have to remember everything they've lied about, people who are lied to cannot forget anything they've been lied to about. What psychologists call the ""illusory truth effect"" means that ""We seem to be predisposed to remember statements as true even after they have been disconfirmed."" A lie is forever, no matter how many times you try to take it back.To Harris, as a consequentialist, anything that harms the ability of humans to thrive is morally wrong. Therefore, lying is wrong.He does, briefly, admit that there might be some exceptions to the rule. ""If you think that it can ever be appropriate to injure or kill a person in self-defense, or in defense of another, it makes no sense to rule out lying in the same circumstances,"" he explains. It is permissible to lie in the unusual circumstance that ""we have judged the prospects of establishing a real relationship with this person to be nonexistent."" Even then, however, he suggests that the truth is often better than a lie. He provides a typical example of giving shelter to a child pursued by a murderer. If the murderer asks if you are sheltering the child, rather than saying ""no,"" you could say (in Harris's script), ""I wouldn't tell you even if I knew. And if you take another step, I'll put a bullet in your brain."" Something seems amiss here. Supplying a physical threat surely assumes the inability to develop a ""real relationship"" as much as lying assumes it, and degrades an existing relationship as much as lying degrades it. Furthermore, the one-liner is only available to people who do not stutter when facing a serial killer at their front door and happen to have a loaded pistol in their pocket. Elsewhere, in describing war, Harris said: ""The moment one begins dropping bombs, or destroying a country's infrastructure with cyber attacks, lying has become just another weapon in the arsenal."" If lying is a kind of weapon, then surely it is a useful weapon for the physically weak to fairly level the playing field against those who have initiated physical force against them. This wrinkle is not something he addresses.One other example sounds a bit askew. He writes that one possible result of honesty is that ""real problems in your life can be forced to the surface. Are you in an abusive relationship? A refusal to lie to others--How did you get that bruise?--might oblige you to come to grips with this situation very quickly."" It seems generally true that people in abusive or self-harming situations are better off telling the truth so they can get help. However, there are complicated psychological reasons why they may lie (by commission or omission) to protect their abusers, skate through a fearful moment, and maintain their dangerous situations. Faced with such an event, I would add more nuance to the consequentialist perspective and emphasize the ""lying is harmful"" while almost entirely dropping off the ""and therefore immoral."" In certain situations, judging an action to be ""morally wrong"" can be an effective way of bringing about a stop to that behavior. It can put a cork in selfishness, hubris, and so forth. By contrast, judging abuse victims to be committing moral wrong against themselves while they try to navigate their way out of a psychological prison does not help their situation, but only compounds their confusion. Part of the issue here is that Harris, throughout his book, depicts lies as having very short shelf-lives--their usefulness can begin deteriorating within seconds after the lie's cover is blown. Those of us who are concerned with long-term decision-making may read philosophy to learn how to live happier lives overall. Yet even those of us who consider ourselves long-term thinkers may experience certain moments -- confronting a serial killer at the front door, being stuck in an abusive relationship -- when we are trapped in short-term survival thinking. In those moments, we don't really care about the long-term prognosis of our lies of various colors. The long-term effects of our words may be objectively relevant and applicable, but we are not capable of analyzing them or caring about them. This oversight is a weakness in this short book.The book is nevertheless a good introduction to thinking about the question of lying. It makes a number of good points clearly and raises many worthwhile questions."

I believe the world would be a different place if everyone was completely honest, even with the small social lies we tell to spare the feelings of others. My mind has been dwelling on authenticity and the quandary of getting true personal critisism to become a better person, when everyone feels too awkward to give any meaningful feedback. Yet I don't want to go through life criticizing others with my personal opinions.

100,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13315860-peter-colclasure,4,"A few years back I read Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs, where he quotes Steve Wozniak as saying ""I never lie. I haven't told a lie in years."" I remember reading that and thinking, how is that possible? How can you just not lie? So I decided to run an experiment and see how long I could go without saying anything that was dishonest, evasive, or misleading. It was harder than I thought it would be. The first step was self-awareness. In order to refrain from lying, I had to first be aware of it, and I wasn't always aware of it. I'd catch myself saying, ""Oh, there was a traffic jam,"" when I was five minutes late for work, only to realize halfway through my utterance that it was complete bullshit. I hadn't premeditated the lie, it was reflexive. It just came out. So the first thing I realized was how habitual white lies were for me. Not an everyday occurrence, but often enough. I can say that I never lied about anything significant, but I often bent the truth in my own interests as social lubricant, and the process was unconscious. For instance, I would regularly give people compliments that I only half believed because I wanted to be nice to them. I wouldn't describe myself as a dishonest person when I was younger, but in my teens and early 20s I had a tendency to embellish stories, for entertainment value, or brevity. And there was at least one occasion when I told a significant, consequential lie, to a man I cared about. I regret it to this day. Becoming a more honest person meant, for me, first getting in touch with the truth. In order to not lie, you have to actually think about what is true and what is false as you go through your day. You have to be honest with yourself about what you really feel. You can't just  mindlessly blurt out anything that's expedient, and that can be a tough habit to break.I still catch myself lying occasionally, but it's gotten to the point where it's once every couple of months, and the big difference is that now every time I say anything that isn't true I am 100% aware of it, like there's a spotlight on me.For instance, last October I was playing a solo show at a community college in the afternoon. The act going up on stage after me was a husband and wife duo that rapped in Arabic. They asked if I would stick around and watch them play. I said, ""I'd love to, but I have another gig downtown."" That was a lie. The other gig had been canceled. But I wanted to meet a friend for lunch. I'm working to eradicate behavior like this. Oh yeah, the book. I supposed I should talk about it since this is a book review. It's short. It's slightly dry but very thoughtful. Sam Harris takes a hardline stance on lying: don't do it ever. Don't tell your kids about Santa Claus. Don't throw surprise birthday parties. I think many readers would find this extreme, but he does a fine job of explaining, in detail, why he thinks these well-intentioned and admittedly benign behaviors could have unintended consequences. I disagree with him about Santa and surprise birthday parties, but I agree with pretty much everything else. Most people, myself included, are incapable of clearing the high moral bar that Harris sets for humanity. But I'm still glad the bar is there."
101,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"Lying (Kindle Single) by Sam Harris“Lying"" is the Kindle Single that makes the compelling case that society and our own lives would simplify and improve if we didn't lie. Neuroscientist, atheist icon and accomplished author Dr. Sam Harris provides yet another thought-provoking title. In this brief but eloquent essay, Harris convincingly establishes the virtues of not lying. This 145-KB book is composed of the following twelve chapters: 1. What is a Lie?, 2. The Mirror of Honesty, 3. Two Types of Lies, 4. White Lies, 5. Trust, 6. Faint Praise, 7. Secrets, 8. Lies in Extremis, 9. Mental Accounting, 10. Integrity, 11. Big Lies, and 12. Conclusion.Positives:1.	A great thinker who has mastered the ability to convey cogent thoughts in an accessible and memorable manner.2.	I always learn something new from Dr. Harris, always.3.	Always thought-provoking and compelling.4.	A trustworthy track record of high-quality work. 5.	Dissects the concept of lying with mastery. ""To lie is to intentionally mislead others when they expect honest communication"".6.	Clearly explains why people lie and the implications of such lies.7.	Clearly differentiates speaking truthfully from the held beliefs being true. Fabulous!8.	The main points of being truthful. Compelling.9.	Two types of lies: commission and omission. 10.	Great quotes, ""To lie is to infringe upon the freedom of those we care about"".11.	Interesting look at false encouragement.12.	A lesson learned with faint praise.13.	Interesting cases that help understand the points being made.14.	The importance of integrity.15.	Summarizes his essay with expertise.16.	Links worked fine.17.	Brief essay that is worth reading multiple times.Negatives:1.	My expectation are always high with Dr. Harris. So I must be truthful in saying that I was expecting more. As an example, I was hoping to get evidence from a scientific point of view. What does lying do to the brain for instance...2.	The idea of using evasive language instead of lying at times may work but even in extreme cases? Hmmm...3.	Dr. Harris espouses objective morality one that can be traced back to the brain but once again no evidence provided. I would have liked to have seen the link between our sense of morality and lying.4.	No charts or illustrations provided. 5.	Very few iconic quotes or intellectual homeruns that characterize Dr. Harris. The burden of living up to high expectations.In summary, I'm a big fan of Dr. Harris. He is one of my favorite thinkers and is able to say and write eloquently thoughts many of us have in common. His work is always thought-provoking and in this essay he provides strong arguments in support of his general thesis: that our lives would simplify and improve if we didn't lie. My only complaint is the lack of scientific depth, Dr. Harris relies mainly on his remarkable sense of logic and even that is persuasive enough on its own. An essay worth reading multiple times, I highly recommend it!"
102,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6108634-therese,3,"As part of my ""self-improvment/self-help"" reading kick, I read this very short book on lying by Sam Harris. It caught my attention because I've always prided myself on being an honest, open person, but a big part of his argument is that even lies of omission or white lies, told for the sake of kindness, are harmful and unethical. Thinking about it, I feel like I do that a lot trying to spare people's feelings, and Sam Harris argues that this kind of thing is hurtful, because by not being honest about negative things, you're depriving people of knowledge that could help them.One reason I think I'm so wary of saying critical things to people is that, partly as a result of being influenced by existentialism, I have a deep respect for other people's freedom to make their own choices and be their own authentic selves through those choices. As a friend, it's not my job to fix or improve or change or influence anyone - at best I think friends can help each other figure out who they really are and want to be and to become more true to themselves, by listening and asking questions and having conversations exploring those things. Conversely, it *is* my job to take responsibility for my own life choices and happiness, and part of that involves trying to be around people who affect my life in positive ways, and protecting myself from people who hurt me, by choosing not to be around them if I can help it.In the case of people whose behavior I sometimes don't like, because it's hurtful or self-destructive or some way distasteful to me, I feel like the best approach is most of the time positive reinforcement rather than being critical and calling them out on their bad behavior. So you give support and encouragement and praise when you see them doing something positive, and when the bad behavior happens you just don't give it any attention or communication at all, because the problem is that it's very easy from childhood on for people to learn that bad behavior can get them attention, and the negative attention feels better than no interaction at all. So negative attention always risks reinforcing the negative behavior.I can see Sam Harris's point though, about depriving people of helpful insights by refraining from criticism or negative comments ... but I think maybe a healthy balance is that if you value someone's role in your life as a friend or partner, yet you find their behavior is hurting you, the ethical approach is to give them at least a few chances to change by telling them honestly that they're being hurtful. If you've tried to communicate about it two or three times and the problems keep resurfacing, then you just have to let go and walk away and leave them to work out their issues at a safe distance ..."

104,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9533949-kimball,4,"A good little informative booklet. I wish it was longer. It reminds me of this neat article I read about stopping lying %100. If you're reading this review please read this article. Some of the comments are pretty funny/good too. I didn't agree with the author's opinion about surprise parties. I think those are fun and generally harmless.Something I wish the author would have addressed is that the person asking a question needs to own up the responsibility/gravity of the question/request they are asking. If a girl asks if she is fat in a dress. She should think ""Do I really want to hear the answer if it's yes?"" Or the author used the example of a dying person asking before going into operation, and the chances are slim that they will survive, ""Am I going to make it?"" Instead of dumping the emotional load on the person who already has the enormous task of being honest and telling the truth, why not depart from it and have the person who is asking the dang question be accountable for what he/she is asking? Why does the honest listener get the blame for being honest? The stupid question-asker should think about both possible answers to the question they want to know and ask themselves if they can handle both answers. This then distributes the honesty principle evenly between both parties.A simple solution to not lie is to just say ""I don't want to talk about it,"" or ""that's inappropriate."" That's it."

Our dishonesty not only influences the choices they make, it often determines the choices they can make—and in ways we cannot always predict. Every lie is a direct assault upon the autonomy of those we lie to.” ― Sam Harris, LyingHe does not frame it in a moralistic way but as a logical conclusion that liberates both the liar and the recipient of the lie from many burdens and possible negative outcomes, while building a better relationship and trust.“Unlike statements of fact, which require no further work on our part, lies must be continually protected from collisions with reality.” ― Sam Harris, LyingAn excellent exploration of what is a way of life for some or an occasional failure for others; all of us have done it and have had others inflict it on us, making it very personal and useful topic that touches all of humanity. Everyday philosophy served as a very fulfilling read.“Honesty is a gift we can give to others. It is also a source of power and an engine of simplicity.” ― Sam Harris, Lying"
106,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4906386-chris,4,"Pretty solid. It's a short book, but well worth reading. It's concise and presents a compelling argument.Lying creates more problems than it is worth. What we are actually doing is investing in the illusion of avoiding complications.He also makes the point that this taints our relationships. If we cannot be fully open and honest (even including so called white lies), then are we being truly loving? We often think that protecting our friends and loved ones from the pain of the truth is the loving thing to do when, in actuality, telling unpleasant truths may inspire them to change, grow, and heal. More importantly, it releases the mental static necessary to maintain these untruths, leaving one free to invest that mental energy in being present. This is a subtle effect but an important one.There are arguments to be made, of course, but I generally agree.In fact, I was withholding something from someone close to me. It was an unpleasant fact about myself, that I wasn't comfortable sharing (lie of omission). I shared it and immediately felt better. Not only that, the person I shared it with felt closer to me, and, in return, opened up and shared some of their pain. Bonding us closer together. It was a beautiful thing, and I'm grateful that I read this book when I did. I will continue incorporating its principles in my life."
107,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2021933-cara,4,"This is a philosophical Kindle Short about lying. The argument is that, unless you're dealing with someone you never want to have any kind of relationship with (ex. psychopath, enemy in war)--and maybe not even then--lying does more harm than good. Even white lies meant to spare the other person's feelings or be polite cause damage to a relationship. He gives the example of ""Does this dress make me look fat?""--Instead of rushing to say ""no!"", consider the truth, which might be any of these:- That's an unflattering dress for you. You'd look better in a different cut.- I love you no matter what you look like.- You would feel a lot better about yourself if you dropped a few pounds.Any of these, if they're the truth and expressed kindly, would be more helpful in the long run than a lie of ""No, you look great!""It's a really interesting argument, and what he says makes a lot of sense. I try to avoid lying whenever possible, but I do sugar-coat and dissemble, and sometimes I white-lie to be ""nice."" I'm so bad at thinking on my feet, and my natural way of expressing things is so blunt! But I think he's right--it would be better to quit.This is the first thing I've read in quite some time that's actually made me think. Good stuff."

We live in a world now days where honesty is hardly appreciated, lying is a subconscience behavior of our daily lives and we use our lies as skills to communicate with others without knowing how destructive this might be for those who are around us and for ourselves in the first place, even though it's harder and sometimes less socially convenient for us to tell the truth, we should always try to be honest in our answers and discussions. because by not letting the truth out, thinking that it's better to avoid uncomfortable situations or hurtful comments, we are being selfish and misleading without knowing.""By lying, we deny others a view of the world as it is. Our dishonesty not only influences thechoices they make, it often determines the choices they can make—and in ways we cannot alwayspredict.

109,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41690792-muthuvel,3,"I happened to listen a podcast of Sam Harris interviewing Jordan Peterson on the question of 'what is truth'? They started with the simple question taking sense on the nature of reality and it took more than 2 hours for them to move on without succumbing to one another's argument. According to Jordan Peterson, truth is whatever the fact or beliefs that doesnt kill us which would makes us stronger - more like scientific anthrocentrism whereas Sam Harris took upon scientific realism that truth is independent of our existence, irrespective of the fact we got turned to ashes or not. The philosophy put forth by the neuroscientist here corresponds to realism but in a deep anthropocentric sense and maybe that's the reason people find it way too obvious.""How would your relationships change if you resolved never to lie again? What truths might suddenly come into view in your life? What kind of person would you become? And how might you change the people around you?"" Philosophy in a more personal sense would work out if implemented to the world, as individuals, it can lead to the betterment. I would consider this a decent self help book."

After reading this book this is what happens: you can't stop noticing all the times you tell little little white lies for your convenience. I was astounded how often I would fall into this trap and how unaware of it I was!Now, after reading this book I would immediately notice and either stop or try to recover from it.The key message of the book is that we, as a society, tend to believe white lies are ok, but they indeed have a very negative effect on our interactions and our personal integrity. Lying often exchanges short term benefits for long term troubles.A good idea expressed in the book is this: if you never lie there is nothing you have to remember, you need only this little rule. Do not lie. If you know you never lie, you never have to deal with it.The book discusses also edge cases in which lying may be necessary (e.g., dealing with a murderer). But the golden rule works in practice 99.9% of the times. DO NOT LIE. NEVER EVER AGAIN. It's very liberating!"

Harris seems more okay with big lies (government secrets: ""The need for state secrets is obvious."") than littler lies (parents who would rather not tell the kids the mom has MS).(2)This is a good toilet read; read it while you're working out a long brown one.(3) Just like Free Will, this will undoubtedly stir the pot, rock the boat, etc. Good for a nice friendly round table discussion with your friends.(4) The contents of this book cannot be reconciled with the contents of Free Will. If one lacks free will , how does one have the choice of telling the truth or not?!(5) Calling this a book (42 pages. Pages 43 to 95 = appendices) is a blatant misrepresentation of the product-- A LIE--and is therefore ethically unjustifiable."
112,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6085278-jean,4,"This topic matter is one that definitely needed our attention; full attention. I think that Harris did a great job of showing how a simple white lie could turn really ugly. In ordinary circumstances lying is never helpful and is totally unnecessary. It destroys trust in relationships. While I was motivated and inspired by his words, I did find a bit of repetition on the scant number of pages, when I wanted something new to sink my teeth into. He could have said so much more, but then it would have been a book instead of an e-booklet. For the low cost the message has enormous value."

However, the discomfort should not be exaggerated: You can be honest and kind, because your purpose in telling the truth is not to offend people: You simply want them to have the information you have, and would want to have if you were in their position. What truth feels likeThe year was 1987, but it might as well have been the Summer of Love: I was twenty, had hair down to my shoulders, and was dressed like an Indian rickshaw driver. For those charged with enforcing our nation's drug laws, it would have been only prudent to subject my luggage to special scrutiny. Happily, I had nothing to hide. ""Where are you coming from?"" the officer asked, glancing skeptically at my backpack. ""India, Nepal, Thailand..."" I said. ""Did you take any drugs while you were over there?"" As it happens, I had. The temptation to lie was obvious — why speak to a customs officer about my recent drug use? But there was no real reason not to tell the truth, apart from the risk that it would lead to an even more thorough search of my luggage (and perhaps of my person) than had already commenced. Yes,"" I said. The officer stopped searching my bag and looked up. ""Which drugs did you take? ""I smoked pot a few times... And I tried opium in India."" ""Opium?"" ""Yes."" ""Opium or heroin? ""It was opium."" 'You don't hear much about opium these days."" ""I know. It was the first time I'd ever tried it."" ""Are you carrying any drugs with you now?"" ""No."" The officer eyed me warily for a moment and then returned to searching my bag. Given the nature of our conversation, I reconciled myself to being there for a very long time. I was, therefore, as patient as a tree. Which was a good thing, because the officer was now examining my belongings as though any one item — a toothbrush, a book, a flashlight, a bit of nylon cord — might reveal the deepest secrets of the universe. ""What is opium like?"" he asked after a time. And I told him. In fact, over the next ten minutes, I told this lawman almost everything I knew about the use of mind-altering substances. Eventually he completed his search and closed my luggage. One thing was perfectly obvious at the end of our encounter: We both felt very good about it. What it is like being honest and what it is like being dishonestHonesty demands confidence and intelligence. It places you in difficult situations, just like lying does. But honesty takes you there more quickly. Lying often means delaying the difficult. While honesty means taking it on right away. Seems related to conscientiousness.For instance, say a friend asks you how you are feeling and makes clear she wants the real answer, not just the standard fine. It is not obvious which information you would want to have if you were in the other persons situation, and as Harris states so well at the beginning of his essay You simply want them to have the information you have, and would want to have if you were in their position.  To handle this well you need prudence and prudence comes from experience, experience which you amass much faster by practicing radical honesty and by building life experience.I guess honesty makes you look good because the good have less to hide, either because there is so little problematic about you, or because you are skilled enough to speak about the problematic and complex.

121,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62395861-kaitlyn-leaf,5,Another quick read but I felt this one was very relevant to me. I feel like people spend spend so much effort trying to white lie and portray their lives as different than they really are when I feel like we would all feel a lot more connected if we were honest about the struggles we were going through.

Rather than valuable insight from his own field (neuroscience), Harris sticks to surprisingly elementary basic philosophical constructs to explain that lying is best avoided. Necessary only for those who cannot think for themselves."

124,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"This is a bit longer than a magazine essay and in its length feels more like a journal article than a book. It covers a lot of ground and makes the point quite clearly.Harris is a consequentialist, something he does not argue for in this book but explained previously in The Moral Landscape. Consequentialism is a theory that maintains that the ethical value of an act is determined by its consequences. Consequentialism is often broken down into two main types: one in which the outcome of each specific act must be evaluated separately (as much as possible), and one in which general rules may be formulated based on the usual or probable outcomes of similar acts. Harris presents a clear example of the latter type in his wholesale rejection of lying.What is lying? It's a deliberate attempt to deceive others into believing something different than what we believe to be true. It may be an act of omission -- we can lie through what we don't say -- but this is a little more slippery, as Harris finds nothing offensive about the concept of privacy and furthermore is aware that if we resolved to communicate all the information we knew and correct every error we perceived we'd never have time to sleep. So Harris chose to focus on acts of commission. He gives a lot of attention to so-called ""white lies"" that are usually well-meaning attempts to spare others' feelings.Why does Harris say lying is undesirable? For a multitude of reasons. For one, it breaks down human relationships. It is wonderful to have friends who will tell you the truth, even when it is hard to hear, he says. When we hide our weaknesses or fail to critique someone who is asking for honest feedback, we are giving up opportunities to grow. This sort of stunting becomes offensive in principle: ""deciding how much (another) can know about himself seems the quintessence of arrogance,"" and as a result of keeping others ignorant of the truth, ""to lie is to infringe upon the freedom of those we care about."" For another reason, liars have to remember everything they've lied about. ""To agree to keep a secret,"" small as it may seem, ""is to assume a burden."" Due to a strange fact about human psychology, liars deprecate their ""victims"" so as to justify their own lying behavior to themselves, and thus liars become less trustful of other people even as those who have been lied to have more reason not to trust the liars. Lying thus makes everyone unhappier. When authorities lie, it causes mass confusion when people no longer know what information sources to trust, and this ruins public debate. For yet another reason, while liars have to remember everything they've lied about, people who are lied to cannot forget anything they've been lied to about. What psychologists call the ""illusory truth effect"" means that ""We seem to be predisposed to remember statements as true even after they have been disconfirmed."" A lie is forever, no matter how many times you try to take it back.To Harris, as a consequentialist, anything that harms the ability of humans to thrive is morally wrong. Therefore, lying is wrong.He does, briefly, admit that there might be some exceptions to the rule. ""If you think that it can ever be appropriate to injure or kill a person in self-defense, or in defense of another, it makes no sense to rule out lying in the same circumstances,"" he explains. It is permissible to lie in the unusual circumstance that ""we have judged the prospects of establishing a real relationship with this person to be nonexistent."" Even then, however, he suggests that the truth is often better than a lie. He provides a typical example of giving shelter to a child pursued by a murderer. If the murderer asks if you are sheltering the child, rather than saying ""no,"" you could say (in Harris's script), ""I wouldn't tell you even if I knew. And if you take another step, I'll put a bullet in your brain."" Something seems amiss here. Supplying a physical threat surely assumes the inability to develop a ""real relationship"" as much as lying assumes it, and degrades an existing relationship as much as lying degrades it. Furthermore, the one-liner is only available to people who do not stutter when facing a serial killer at their front door and happen to have a loaded pistol in their pocket. Elsewhere, in describing war, Harris said: ""The moment one begins dropping bombs, or destroying a country's infrastructure with cyber attacks, lying has become just another weapon in the arsenal."" If lying is a kind of weapon, then surely it is a useful weapon for the physically weak to fairly level the playing field against those who have initiated physical force against them. This wrinkle is not something he addresses.One other example sounds a bit askew. He writes that one possible result of honesty is that ""real problems in your life can be forced to the surface. Are you in an abusive relationship? A refusal to lie to others--How did you get that bruise?--might oblige you to come to grips with this situation very quickly."" It seems generally true that people in abusive or self-harming situations are better off telling the truth so they can get help. However, there are complicated psychological reasons why they may lie (by commission or omission) to protect their abusers, skate through a fearful moment, and maintain their dangerous situations. Faced with such an event, I would add more nuance to the consequentialist perspective and emphasize the ""lying is harmful"" while almost entirely dropping off the ""and therefore immoral."" In certain situations, judging an action to be ""morally wrong"" can be an effective way of bringing about a stop to that behavior. It can put a cork in selfishness, hubris, and so forth. By contrast, judging abuse victims to be committing moral wrong against themselves while they try to navigate their way out of a psychological prison does not help their situation, but only compounds their confusion. Part of the issue here is that Harris, throughout his book, depicts lies as having very short shelf-lives--their usefulness can begin deteriorating within seconds after the lie's cover is blown. Those of us who are concerned with long-term decision-making may read philosophy to learn how to live happier lives overall. Yet even those of us who consider ourselves long-term thinkers may experience certain moments -- confronting a serial killer at the front door, being stuck in an abusive relationship -- when we are trapped in short-term survival thinking. In those moments, we don't really care about the long-term prognosis of our lies of various colors. The long-term effects of our words may be objectively relevant and applicable, but we are not capable of analyzing them or caring about them. This oversight is a weakness in this short book.The book is nevertheless a good introduction to thinking about the question of lying. It makes a number of good points clearly and raises many worthwhile questions."

I believe the world would be a different place if everyone was completely honest, even with the small social lies we tell to spare the feelings of others. My mind has been dwelling on authenticity and the quandary of getting true personal critisism to become a better person, when everyone feels too awkward to give any meaningful feedback. Yet I don't want to go through life criticizing others with my personal opinions. Sam Harris provided interesting discussion on this issue without giving advice except that, in his opinion it is always better to tell the truth, come what may. "

130,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13315860-peter-colclasure,4,"A few years back I read Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs, where he quotes Steve Wozniak as saying ""I never lie. I haven't told a lie in years."" I remember reading that and thinking, how is that possible? How can you just not lie? So I decided to run an experiment and see how long I could go without saying anything that was dishonest, evasive, or misleading. It was harder than I thought it would be. The first step was self-awareness. In order to refrain from lying, I had to first be aware of it, and I wasn't always aware of it. I'd catch myself saying, ""Oh, there was a traffic jam,"" when I was five minutes late for work, only to realize halfway through my utterance that it was complete bullshit. I hadn't premeditated the lie, it was reflexive. It just came out. So the first thing I realized was how habitual white lies were for me. Not an everyday occurrence, but often enough. I can say that I never lied about anything significant, but I often bent the truth in my own interests as social lubricant, and the process was unconscious. For instance, I would regularly give people compliments that I only half believed because I wanted to be nice to them. I wouldn't describe myself as a dishonest person when I was younger, but in my teens and early 20s I had a tendency to embellish stories, for entertainment value, or brevity. And there was at least one occasion when I told a significant, consequential lie, to a man I cared about. I regret it to this day. Becoming a more honest person meant, for me, first getting in touch with the truth. In order to not lie, you have to actually think about what is true and what is false as you go through your day. You have to be honest with yourself about what you really feel. You can't just  mindlessly blurt out anything that's expedient, and that can be a tough habit to break.I still catch myself lying occasionally, but it's gotten to the point where it's once every couple of months, and the big difference is that now every time I say anything that isn't true I am 100% aware of it, like there's a spotlight on me.For instance, last October I was playing a solo show at a community college in the afternoon. The act going up on stage after me was a husband and wife duo that rapped in Arabic. They asked if I would stick around and watch them play. I said, ""I'd love to, but I have another gig downtown."" That was a lie. The other gig had been canceled. But I wanted to meet a friend for lunch. I'm working to eradicate behavior like this. Oh yeah, the book. I supposed I should talk about it since this is a book review. It's short. It's slightly dry but very thoughtful. Sam Harris takes a hardline stance on lying: don't do it ever. Don't tell your kids about Santa Claus. Don't throw surprise birthday parties. I think many readers would find this extreme, but he does a fine job of explaining, in detail, why he thinks these well-intentioned and admittedly benign behaviors could have unintended consequences. I disagree with him about Santa and surprise birthday parties, but I agree with pretty much everything else. Most people, myself included, are incapable of clearing the high moral bar that Harris sets for humanity. But I'm still glad the bar is there."
131,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"Lying (Kindle Single) by Sam Harris“Lying"" is the Kindle Single that makes the compelling case that society and our own lives would simplify and improve if we didn't lie. Neuroscientist, atheist icon and accomplished author Dr. Sam Harris provides yet another thought-provoking title. In this brief but eloquent essay, Harris convincingly establishes the virtues of not lying. This 145-KB book is composed of the following twelve chapters: 1. What is a Lie?, 2. The Mirror of Honesty, 3. Two Types of Lies, 4. White Lies, 5. Trust, 6. Faint Praise, 7. Secrets, 8. Lies in Extremis, 9. Mental Accounting, 10. Integrity, 11. Big Lies, and 12. Conclusion.Positives:1.	A great thinker who has mastered the ability to convey cogent thoughts in an accessible and memorable manner.2.	I always learn something new from Dr. Harris, always.3.	Always thought-provoking and compelling.4.	A trustworthy track record of high-quality work. 5.	Dissects the concept of lying with mastery. ""To lie is to intentionally mislead others when they expect honest communication"".6.	Clearly explains why people lie and the implications of such lies.7.	Clearly differentiates speaking truthfully from the held beliefs being true. Fabulous!8.	The main points of being truthful. Compelling.9.	Two types of lies: commission and omission. 10.	Great quotes, ""To lie is to infringe upon the freedom of those we care about"".11.	Interesting look at false encouragement.12.	A lesson learned with faint praise.13.	Interesting cases that help understand the points being made.14.	The importance of integrity.15.	Summarizes his essay with expertise.16.	Links worked fine.17.	Brief essay that is worth reading multiple times.Negatives:1.	My expectation are always high with Dr. Harris. So I must be truthful in saying that I was expecting more. As an example, I was hoping to get evidence from a scientific point of view. What does lying do to the brain for instance...2.	The idea of using evasive language instead of lying at times may work but even in extreme cases? Hmmm...3.	Dr. Harris espouses objective morality one that can be traced back to the brain but once again no evidence provided. I would have liked to have seen the link between our sense of morality and lying.4.	No charts or illustrations provided. 5.	Very few iconic quotes or intellectual homeruns that characterize Dr. Harris. The burden of living up to high expectations.In summary, I'm a big fan of Dr. Harris. He is one of my favorite thinkers and is able to say and write eloquently thoughts many of us have in common. His work is always thought-provoking and in this essay he provides strong arguments in support of his general thesis: that our lives would simplify and improve if we didn't lie. My only complaint is the lack of scientific depth, Dr. Harris relies mainly on his remarkable sense of logic and even that is persuasive enough on its own. An essay worth reading multiple times, I highly recommend it!"
132,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6108634-therese,3,"As part of my ""self-improvment/self-help"" reading kick, I read this very short book on lying by Sam Harris. It caught my attention because I've always prided myself on being an honest, open person, but a big part of his argument is that even lies of omission or white lies, told for the sake of kindness, are harmful and unethical. Thinking about it, I feel like I do that a lot trying to spare people's feelings, and Sam Harris argues that this kind of thing is hurtful, because by not being honest about negative things, you're depriving people of knowledge that could help them.One reason I think I'm so wary of saying critical things to people is that, partly as a result of being influenced by existentialism, I have a deep respect for other people's freedom to make their own choices and be their own authentic selves through those choices. As a friend, it's not my job to fix or improve or change or influence anyone - at best I think friends can help each other figure out who they really are and want to be and to become more true to themselves, by listening and asking questions and having conversations exploring those things. Conversely, it *is* my job to take responsibility for my own life choices and happiness, and part of that involves trying to be around people who affect my life in positive ways, and protecting myself from people who hurt me, by choosing not to be around them if I can help it.In the case of people whose behavior I sometimes don't like, because it's hurtful or self-destructive or some way distasteful to me, I feel like the best approach is most of the time positive reinforcement rather than being critical and calling them out on their bad behavior. So you give support and encouragement and praise when you see them doing something positive, and when the bad behavior happens you just don't give it any attention or communication at all, because the problem is that it's very easy from childhood on for people to learn that bad behavior can get them attention, and the negative attention feels better than no interaction at all. So negative attention always risks reinforcing the negative behavior.I can see Sam Harris's point though, about depriving people of helpful insights by refraining from criticism or negative comments ... but I think maybe a healthy balance is that if you value someone's role in your life as a friend or partner, yet you find their behavior is hurting you, the ethical approach is to give them at least a few chances to change by telling them honestly that they're being hurtful. If you've tried to communicate about it two or three times and the problems keep resurfacing, then you just have to let go and walk away and leave them to work out their issues at a safe distance ..."

134,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9533949-kimball,4,"A good little informative booklet. I wish it was longer. It reminds me of this neat article I read about stopping lying %100. If you're reading this review please read this article. Some of the comments are pretty funny/good too. I didn't agree with the author's opinion about surprise parties. I think those are fun and generally harmless.Something I wish the author would have addressed is that the person asking a question needs to own up the responsibility/gravity of the question/request they are asking. If a girl asks if she is fat in a dress. She should think ""Do I really want to hear the answer if it's yes?"" Or the author used the example of a dying person asking before going into operation, and the chances are slim that they will survive, ""Am I going to make it?"" Instead of dumping the emotional load on the person who already has the enormous task of being honest and telling the truth, why not depart from it and have the person who is asking the dang question be accountable for what he/she is asking? Why does the honest listener get the blame for being honest? The stupid question-asker should think about both possible answers to the question they want to know and ask themselves if they can handle both answers. This then distributes the honesty principle evenly between both parties.A simple solution to not lie is to just say ""I don't want to talk about it,"" or ""that's inappropriate."" That's it."

Our dishonesty not only influences the choices they make, it often determines the choices they can make—and in ways we cannot always predict. Every lie is a direct assault upon the autonomy of those we lie to.” ― Sam Harris, LyingHe does not frame it in a moralistic way but as a logical conclusion that liberates both the liar and the recipient of the lie from many burdens and possible negative outcomes, while building a better relationship and trust.“Unlike statements of fact, which require no further work on our part, lies must be continually protected from collisions with reality.” ― Sam Harris, LyingAn excellent exploration of what is a way of life for some or an occasional failure for others; all of us have done it and have had others inflict it on us, making it very personal and useful topic that touches all of humanity. Everyday philosophy served as a very fulfilling read.“Honesty is a gift we can give to others. It is also a source of power and an engine of simplicity.” ― Sam Harris, Lying"
136,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4906386-chris,4,"Pretty solid. It's a short book, but well worth reading. It's concise and presents a compelling argument.Lying creates more problems than it is worth. What we are actually doing is investing in the illusion of avoiding complications.He also makes the point that this taints our relationships. If we cannot be fully open and honest (even including so called white lies), then are we being truly loving? We often think that protecting our friends and loved ones from the pain of the truth is the loving thing to do when, in actuality, telling unpleasant truths may inspire them to change, grow, and heal. More importantly, it releases the mental static necessary to maintain these untruths, leaving one free to invest that mental energy in being present. This is a subtle effect but an important one.There are arguments to be made, of course, but I generally agree.In fact, I was withholding something from someone close to me. It was an unpleasant fact about myself, that I wasn't comfortable sharing (lie of omission). I shared it and immediately felt better. Not only that, the person I shared it with felt closer to me, and, in return, opened up and shared some of their pain. Bonding us closer together. It was a beautiful thing, and I'm grateful that I read this book when I did. I will continue incorporating its principles in my life."

The argument is that, unless you're dealing with someone you never want to have any kind of relationship with (ex. psychopath, enemy in war)--and maybe not even then--lying does more harm than good. Even white lies meant to spare the other person's feelings or be polite cause damage to a relationship. He gives the example of ""Does this dress make me look fat?""--Instead of rushing to say ""no!"", consider the truth, which might be any of these:- That's an unflattering dress for you. You'd look better in a different cut.- I love you no matter what you look like.- You would feel a lot better about yourself if you dropped a few pounds.Any of these, if they're the truth and expressed kindly, would be more helpful in the long run than a lie of ""No, you look great!""It's a really interesting argument, and what he says makes a lot of sense. I try to avoid lying whenever possible, but I do sugar-coat and dissemble, and sometimes I white-lie to be ""nice."" I'm so bad at thinking on my feet, and my natural way of expressing things is so blunt! But I think he's right--it would be better to quit.This is the first thing I've read in quite some time that's actually made me think. Good stuff."

We live in a world now days where honesty is hardly appreciated, lying is a subconscience behavior of our daily lives and we use our lies as skills to communicate with others without knowing how destructive this might be for those who are around us and for ourselves in the first place, even though it's harder and sometimes less socially convenient for us to tell the truth, we should always try to be honest in our answers and discussions. because by not letting the truth out, thinking that it's better to avoid uncomfortable situations or hurtful comments, we are being selfish and misleading without knowing.""By lying, we deny others a view of the world as it is.

They started with the simple question taking sense on the nature of reality and it took more than 2 hours for them to move on without succumbing to one another's argument. According to Jordan Peterson, truth is whatever the fact or beliefs that doesnt kill us which would makes us stronger - more like scientific anthrocentrism whereas Sam Harris took upon scientific realism that truth is independent of our existence, irrespective of the fact we got turned to ashes or not. The philosophy put forth by the neuroscientist here corresponds to realism but in a deep anthropocentric sense and maybe that's the reason people find it way too obvious.""How would your relationships change if you resolved never to lie again? What truths might suddenly come into view in your life? What kind of person would you become? And how might you change the people around you?""

After reading this book this is what happens: you can't stop noticing all the times you tell little little white lies for your convenience. I was astounded how often I would fall into this trap and how unaware of it I was!Now, after reading this book I would immediately notice and either stop or try to recover from it.The key message of the book is that we, as a society, tend to believe white lies are ok, but they indeed have a very negative effect on our interactions and our personal integrity. Lying often exchanges short term benefits for long term troubles.A good idea expressed in the book is this: if you never lie there is nothing you have to remember, you need only this little rule. Do not lie. If you know you never lie, you never have to deal with it.The book discusses also edge cases in which lying may be necessary (e.g., dealing with a murderer). But the golden rule works in practice 99.9% of the times. DO NOT LIE. NEVER EVER AGAIN. It's very liberating!"

If one lacks free will , how does one have the choice of telling the truth or not?!(5) Calling this a book (42 pages.

It destroys trust in relationships. While I was motivated and inspired by his words, I did find a bit of repetition on the scant number of pages, when I wanted something new to sink my teeth into. He could have said so much more, but then it would have been a book instead of an e-booklet. For the low cost the message has enormous value."

However, the discomfort should not be exaggerated: You can be honest and kind, because your purpose in telling the truth is not to offend people: You simply want them to have the information you have, and would want to have if you were in their position. What truth feels likeThe year was 1987, but it might as well have been the Summer of Love: I was twenty, had hair down to my shoulders, and was dressed like an Indian rickshaw driver. For those charged with enforcing our nation's drug laws, it would have been only prudent to subject my luggage to special scrutiny. Happily, I had nothing to hide. ""Where are you coming from?"" the officer asked, glancing skeptically at my backpack. ""India, Nepal, Thailand..."" I said. ""Did you take any drugs while you were over there?"" As it happens, I had. The temptation to lie was obvious — why speak to a customs officer about my recent drug use? But there was no real reason not to tell the truth, apart from the risk that it would lead to an even more thorough search of my luggage (and perhaps of my person) than had already commenced. Yes,"" I said. The officer stopped searching my bag and looked up. ""Which drugs did you take? ""I smoked pot a few times... And I tried opium in India."" ""Opium?"" ""Yes."" ""Opium or heroin? ""It was opium."" 'You don't hear much about opium these days."" ""I know. It was the first time I'd ever tried it."" ""Are you carrying any drugs with you now?"" ""No."" The officer eyed me warily for a moment and then returned to searching my bag. Given the nature of our conversation, I reconciled myself to being there for a very long time. I was, therefore, as patient as a tree. Which was a good thing, because the officer was now examining my belongings as though any one item — a toothbrush, a book, a flashlight, a bit of nylon cord — might reveal the deepest secrets of the universe. ""What is opium like?"" he asked after a time. And I told him. In fact, over the next ten minutes, I told this lawman almost everything I knew about the use of mind-altering substances. Eventually he completed his search and closed my luggage. One thing was perfectly obvious at the end of our encounter: We both felt very good about it. What it is like being honest and what it is like being dishonestHonesty demands confidence and intelligence. It places you in difficult situations, just like lying does. But honesty takes you there more quickly. Lying often means delaying the difficult. While honesty means taking it on right away. Seems related to conscientiousness.For instance, say a friend asks you how you are feeling and makes clear she wants the real answer, not just the standard fine. It is not obvious which information you would want to have if you were in the other persons situation, and as Harris states so well at the beginning of his essay You simply want them to have the information you have, and would want to have if you were in their position.  To handle this well you need prudence and prudence comes from experience, experience which you amass much faster by practicing radical honesty and by building life experience.I guess honesty makes you look good because the good have less to hide, either because there is so little problematic about you, or because you are skilled enough to speak about the problematic and complex.

Rather than valuable insight from his own field (neuroscience), Harris sticks to surprisingly elementary basic philosophical constructs to explain that lying is best avoided.

154,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"This is a bit longer than a magazine essay and in its length feels more like a journal article than a book. It covers a lot of ground and makes the point quite clearly.Harris is a consequentialist, something he does not argue for in this book but explained previously in The Moral Landscape. Consequentialism is a theory that maintains that the ethical value of an act is determined by its consequences. Consequentialism is often broken down into two main types: one in which the outcome of each specific act must be evaluated separately (as much as possible), and one in which general rules may be formulated based on the usual or probable outcomes of similar acts. Harris presents a clear example of the latter type in his wholesale rejection of lying.What is lying? It's a deliberate attempt to deceive others into believing something different than what we believe to be true. It may be an act of omission -- we can lie through what we don't say -- but this is a little more slippery, as Harris finds nothing offensive about the concept of privacy and furthermore is aware that if we resolved to communicate all the information we knew and correct every error we perceived we'd never have time to sleep. So Harris chose to focus on acts of commission. He gives a lot of attention to so-called ""white lies"" that are usually well-meaning attempts to spare others' feelings.Why does Harris say lying is undesirable? For a multitude of reasons. For one, it breaks down human relationships. It is wonderful to have friends who will tell you the truth, even when it is hard to hear, he says. When we hide our weaknesses or fail to critique someone who is asking for honest feedback, we are giving up opportunities to grow. This sort of stunting becomes offensive in principle: ""deciding how much (another) can know about himself seems the quintessence of arrogance,"" and as a result of keeping others ignorant of the truth, ""to lie is to infringe upon the freedom of those we care about."" For another reason, liars have to remember everything they've lied about. ""To agree to keep a secret,"" small as it may seem, ""is to assume a burden."" Due to a strange fact about human psychology, liars deprecate their ""victims"" so as to justify their own lying behavior to themselves, and thus liars become less trustful of other people even as those who have been lied to have more reason not to trust the liars. Lying thus makes everyone unhappier. When authorities lie, it causes mass confusion when people no longer know what information sources to trust, and this ruins public debate. For yet another reason, while liars have to remember everything they've lied about, people who are lied to cannot forget anything they've been lied to about. What psychologists call the ""illusory truth effect"" means that ""We seem to be predisposed to remember statements as true even after they have been disconfirmed."" A lie is forever, no matter how many times you try to take it back.To Harris, as a consequentialist, anything that harms the ability of humans to thrive is morally wrong. Therefore, lying is wrong.He does, briefly, admit that there might be some exceptions to the rule. ""If you think that it can ever be appropriate to injure or kill a person in self-defense, or in defense of another, it makes no sense to rule out lying in the same circumstances,"" he explains. It is permissible to lie in the unusual circumstance that ""we have judged the prospects of establishing a real relationship with this person to be nonexistent."" Even then, however, he suggests that the truth is often better than a lie. He provides a typical example of giving shelter to a child pursued by a murderer. If the murderer asks if you are sheltering the child, rather than saying ""no,"" you could say (in Harris's script), ""I wouldn't tell you even if I knew. And if you take another step, I'll put a bullet in your brain."" Something seems amiss here. Supplying a physical threat surely assumes the inability to develop a ""real relationship"" as much as lying assumes it, and degrades an existing relationship as much as lying degrades it. Furthermore, the one-liner is only available to people who do not stutter when facing a serial killer at their front door and happen to have a loaded pistol in their pocket. Elsewhere, in describing war, Harris said: ""The moment one begins dropping bombs, or destroying a country's infrastructure with cyber attacks, lying has become just another weapon in the arsenal."" If lying is a kind of weapon, then surely it is a useful weapon for the physically weak to fairly level the playing field against those who have initiated physical force against them. This wrinkle is not something he addresses.One other example sounds a bit askew. He writes that one possible result of honesty is that ""real problems in your life can be forced to the surface. Are you in an abusive relationship? A refusal to lie to others--How did you get that bruise?--might oblige you to come to grips with this situation very quickly."" It seems generally true that people in abusive or self-harming situations are better off telling the truth so they can get help. However, there are complicated psychological reasons why they may lie (by commission or omission) to protect their abusers, skate through a fearful moment, and maintain their dangerous situations. Faced with such an event, I would add more nuance to the consequentialist perspective and emphasize the ""lying is harmful"" while almost entirely dropping off the ""and therefore immoral."" In certain situations, judging an action to be ""morally wrong"" can be an effective way of bringing about a stop to that behavior. It can put a cork in selfishness, hubris, and so forth. By contrast, judging abuse victims to be committing moral wrong against themselves while they try to navigate their way out of a psychological prison does not help their situation, but only compounds their confusion. Part of the issue here is that Harris, throughout his book, depicts lies as having very short shelf-lives--their usefulness can begin deteriorating within seconds after the lie's cover is blown. Those of us who are concerned with long-term decision-making may read philosophy to learn how to live happier lives overall. Yet even those of us who consider ourselves long-term thinkers may experience certain moments -- confronting a serial killer at the front door, being stuck in an abusive relationship -- when we are trapped in short-term survival thinking. In those moments, we don't really care about the long-term prognosis of our lies of various colors. The long-term effects of our words may be objectively relevant and applicable, but we are not capable of analyzing them or caring about them. This oversight is a weakness in this short book.The book is nevertheless a good introduction to thinking about the question of lying. It makes a number of good points clearly and raises many worthwhile questions."

I believe the world would be a different place if everyone was completely honest, even with the small social lies we tell to spare the feelings of others. My mind has been dwelling on authenticity and the quandary of getting true personal critisism to become a better person, when everyone feels too awkward to give any meaningful feedback. Yet I don't want to go through life criticizing others with my personal opinions. Sam Harris provided interesting discussion on this issue without giving advice except that, in his opinion it is always better to tell the truth, come what may. "

I'm holding a big truth (not lying) which I want to tell sooner or later to my family, and I'm scared to death the hell that would loose when I tell it, reading this book made me realize I should go ahead nonetheless, other option I have is of white lie.

160,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13315860-peter-colclasure,4,"A few years back I read Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs, where he quotes Steve Wozniak as saying ""I never lie. I haven't told a lie in years."" I remember reading that and thinking, how is that possible? How can you just not lie? So I decided to run an experiment and see how long I could go without saying anything that was dishonest, evasive, or misleading. It was harder than I thought it would be. The first step was self-awareness. In order to refrain from lying, I had to first be aware of it, and I wasn't always aware of it. I'd catch myself saying, ""Oh, there was a traffic jam,"" when I was five minutes late for work, only to realize halfway through my utterance that it was complete bullshit. I hadn't premeditated the lie, it was reflexive. It just came out. So the first thing I realized was how habitual white lies were for me. Not an everyday occurrence, but often enough. I can say that I never lied about anything significant, but I often bent the truth in my own interests as social lubricant, and the process was unconscious. For instance, I would regularly give people compliments that I only half believed because I wanted to be nice to them. I wouldn't describe myself as a dishonest person when I was younger, but in my teens and early 20s I had a tendency to embellish stories, for entertainment value, or brevity. And there was at least one occasion when I told a significant, consequential lie, to a man I cared about. I regret it to this day. Becoming a more honest person meant, for me, first getting in touch with the truth. In order to not lie, you have to actually think about what is true and what is false as you go through your day. You have to be honest with yourself about what you really feel. You can't just  mindlessly blurt out anything that's expedient, and that can be a tough habit to break.I still catch myself lying occasionally, but it's gotten to the point where it's once every couple of months, and the big difference is that now every time I say anything that isn't true I am 100% aware of it, like there's a spotlight on me.For instance, last October I was playing a solo show at a community college in the afternoon. The act going up on stage after me was a husband and wife duo that rapped in Arabic. They asked if I would stick around and watch them play. I said, ""I'd love to, but I have another gig downtown."" That was a lie. The other gig had been canceled. But I wanted to meet a friend for lunch. I'm working to eradicate behavior like this. Oh yeah, the book. I supposed I should talk about it since this is a book review. It's short. It's slightly dry but very thoughtful. Sam Harris takes a hardline stance on lying: don't do it ever. Don't tell your kids about Santa Claus. Don't throw surprise birthday parties. I think many readers would find this extreme, but he does a fine job of explaining, in detail, why he thinks these well-intentioned and admittedly benign behaviors could have unintended consequences. I disagree with him about Santa and surprise birthday parties, but I agree with pretty much everything else. Most people, myself included, are incapable of clearing the high moral bar that Harris sets for humanity. But I'm still glad the bar is there."
161,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"Lying (Kindle Single) by Sam Harris“Lying"" is the Kindle Single that makes the compelling case that society and our own lives would simplify and improve if we didn't lie. Neuroscientist, atheist icon and accomplished author Dr. Sam Harris provides yet another thought-provoking title. In this brief but eloquent essay, Harris convincingly establishes the virtues of not lying. This 145-KB book is composed of the following twelve chapters: 1. What is a Lie?, 2. The Mirror of Honesty, 3. Two Types of Lies, 4. White Lies, 5. Trust, 6. Faint Praise, 7. Secrets, 8. Lies in Extremis, 9. Mental Accounting, 10. Integrity, 11. Big Lies, and 12. Conclusion.Positives:1.	A great thinker who has mastered the ability to convey cogent thoughts in an accessible and memorable manner.2.	I always learn something new from Dr. Harris, always.3.	Always thought-provoking and compelling.4.	A trustworthy track record of high-quality work. 5.	Dissects the concept of lying with mastery. ""To lie is to intentionally mislead others when they expect honest communication"".6.	Clearly explains why people lie and the implications of such lies.7.	Clearly differentiates speaking truthfully from the held beliefs being true. Fabulous!8.	The main points of being truthful. Compelling.9.	Two types of lies: commission and omission. 10.	Great quotes, ""To lie is to infringe upon the freedom of those we care about"".11.	Interesting look at false encouragement.12.	A lesson learned with faint praise.13.	Interesting cases that help understand the points being made.14.	The importance of integrity.15.	Summarizes his essay with expertise.16.	Links worked fine.17.	Brief essay that is worth reading multiple times.Negatives:1.	My expectation are always high with Dr. Harris. So I must be truthful in saying that I was expecting more. As an example, I was hoping to get evidence from a scientific point of view. What does lying do to the brain for instance...2.	The idea of using evasive language instead of lying at times may work but even in extreme cases? Hmmm...3.	Dr. Harris espouses objective morality one that can be traced back to the brain but once again no evidence provided. I would have liked to have seen the link between our sense of morality and lying.4.	No charts or illustrations provided. 5.	Very few iconic quotes or intellectual homeruns that characterize Dr. Harris. The burden of living up to high expectations.In summary, I'm a big fan of Dr. Harris. He is one of my favorite thinkers and is able to say and write eloquently thoughts many of us have in common. His work is always thought-provoking and in this essay he provides strong arguments in support of his general thesis: that our lives would simplify and improve if we didn't lie. My only complaint is the lack of scientific depth, Dr. Harris relies mainly on his remarkable sense of logic and even that is persuasive enough on its own. An essay worth reading multiple times, I highly recommend it!"
162,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6108634-therese,3,"As part of my ""self-improvment/self-help"" reading kick, I read this very short book on lying by Sam Harris. It caught my attention because I've always prided myself on being an honest, open person, but a big part of his argument is that even lies of omission or white lies, told for the sake of kindness, are harmful and unethical. Thinking about it, I feel like I do that a lot trying to spare people's feelings, and Sam Harris argues that this kind of thing is hurtful, because by not being honest about negative things, you're depriving people of knowledge that could help them.One reason I think I'm so wary of saying critical things to people is that, partly as a result of being influenced by existentialism, I have a deep respect for other people's freedom to make their own choices and be their own authentic selves through those choices. As a friend, it's not my job to fix or improve or change or influence anyone - at best I think friends can help each other figure out who they really are and want to be and to become more true to themselves, by listening and asking questions and having conversations exploring those things. Conversely, it *is* my job to take responsibility for my own life choices and happiness, and part of that involves trying to be around people who affect my life in positive ways, and protecting myself from people who hurt me, by choosing not to be around them if I can help it.In the case of people whose behavior I sometimes don't like, because it's hurtful or self-destructive or some way distasteful to me, I feel like the best approach is most of the time positive reinforcement rather than being critical and calling them out on their bad behavior. So you give support and encouragement and praise when you see them doing something positive, and when the bad behavior happens you just don't give it any attention or communication at all, because the problem is that it's very easy from childhood on for people to learn that bad behavior can get them attention, and the negative attention feels better than no interaction at all. So negative attention always risks reinforcing the negative behavior.I can see Sam Harris's point though, about depriving people of helpful insights by refraining from criticism or negative comments ... but I think maybe a healthy balance is that if you value someone's role in your life as a friend or partner, yet you find their behavior is hurting you, the ethical approach is to give them at least a few chances to change by telling them honestly that they're being hurtful. If you've tried to communicate about it two or three times and the problems keep resurfacing, then you just have to let go and walk away and leave them to work out their issues at a safe distance ..."

164,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9533949-kimball,4,"A good little informative booklet. I wish it was longer. It reminds me of this neat article I read about stopping lying %100. If you're reading this review please read this article. Some of the comments are pretty funny/good too. I didn't agree with the author's opinion about surprise parties. I think those are fun and generally harmless.Something I wish the author would have addressed is that the person asking a question needs to own up the responsibility/gravity of the question/request they are asking. If a girl asks if she is fat in a dress. She should think ""Do I really want to hear the answer if it's yes?"" Or the author used the example of a dying person asking before going into operation, and the chances are slim that they will survive, ""Am I going to make it?"" Instead of dumping the emotional load on the person who already has the enormous task of being honest and telling the truth, why not depart from it and have the person who is asking the dang question be accountable for what he/she is asking? Why does the honest listener get the blame for being honest? The stupid question-asker should think about both possible answers to the question they want to know and ask themselves if they can handle both answers. This then distributes the honesty principle evenly between both parties.A simple solution to not lie is to just say ""I don't want to talk about it,"" or ""that's inappropriate."" That's it."

Our dishonesty not only influences the choices they make, it often determines the choices they can make—and in ways we cannot always predict. Every lie is a direct assault upon the autonomy of those we lie to.” ― Sam Harris, LyingHe does not frame it in a moralistic way but as a logical conclusion that liberates both the liar and the recipient of the lie from many burdens and possible negative outcomes, while building a better relationship and trust.“Unlike statements of fact, which require no further work on our part, lies must be continually protected from collisions with reality.” ― Sam Harris, LyingAn excellent exploration of what is a way of life for some or an occasional failure for others; all of us have done it and have had others inflict it on us, making it very personal and useful topic that touches all of humanity. Everyday philosophy served as a very fulfilling read.“Honesty is a gift we can give to others. It is also a source of power and an engine of simplicity.” ― Sam Harris, Lying"
166,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4906386-chris,4,"Pretty solid. It's a short book, but well worth reading. It's concise and presents a compelling argument.Lying creates more problems than it is worth. What we are actually doing is investing in the illusion of avoiding complications.He also makes the point that this taints our relationships. If we cannot be fully open and honest (even including so called white lies), then are we being truly loving? We often think that protecting our friends and loved ones from the pain of the truth is the loving thing to do when, in actuality, telling unpleasant truths may inspire them to change, grow, and heal. More importantly, it releases the mental static necessary to maintain these untruths, leaving one free to invest that mental energy in being present. This is a subtle effect but an important one.There are arguments to be made, of course, but I generally agree.In fact, I was withholding something from someone close to me. It was an unpleasant fact about myself, that I wasn't comfortable sharing (lie of omission). I shared it and immediately felt better. Not only that, the person I shared it with felt closer to me, and, in return, opened up and shared some of their pain. Bonding us closer together. It was a beautiful thing, and I'm grateful that I read this book when I did. I will continue incorporating its principles in my life."

The argument is that, unless you're dealing with someone you never want to have any kind of relationship with (ex. psychopath, enemy in war)--and maybe not even then--lying does more harm than good. Even white lies meant to spare the other person's feelings or be polite cause damage to a relationship. He gives the example of ""Does this dress make me look fat?""--Instead of rushing to say ""no!"", consider the truth, which might be any of these:- That's an unflattering dress for you. You'd look better in a different cut.- I love you no matter what you look like.- You would feel a lot better about yourself if you dropped a few pounds.Any of these, if they're the truth and expressed kindly, would be more helpful in the long run than a lie of ""No, you look great!""It's a really interesting argument, and what he says makes a lot of sense. I try to avoid lying whenever possible, but I do sugar-coat and dissemble, and sometimes I white-lie to be ""nice.""

We live in a world now days where honesty is hardly appreciated, lying is a subconscience behavior of our daily lives and we use our lies as skills to communicate with others without knowing how destructive this might be for those who are around us and for ourselves in the first place, even though it's harder and sometimes less socially convenient for us to tell the truth, we should always try to be honest in our answers and discussions. because by not letting the truth out, thinking that it's better to avoid uncomfortable situations or hurtful comments, we are being selfish and misleading without knowing.""By lying, we deny others a view of the world as it is.

They started with the simple question taking sense on the nature of reality and it took more than 2 hours for them to move on without succumbing to one another's argument. According to Jordan Peterson, truth is whatever the fact or beliefs that doesnt kill us which would makes us stronger - more like scientific anthrocentrism whereas Sam Harris took upon scientific realism that truth is independent of our existence, irrespective of the fact we got turned to ashes or not. The philosophy put forth by the neuroscientist here corresponds to realism but in a deep anthropocentric sense and maybe that's the reason people find it way too obvious.""How would your relationships change if you resolved never to lie again? What truths might suddenly come into view in your life? What kind of person would you become? And how might you change the people around you?""

I was astounded how often I would fall into this trap and how unaware of it I was!Now, after reading this book I would immediately notice and either stop or try to recover from it.The key message of the book is that we, as a society, tend to believe white lies are ok, but they indeed have a very negative effect on our interactions and our personal integrity. Lying often exchanges short term benefits for long term troubles.A good idea expressed in the book is this: if you never lie there is nothing you have to remember, you need only this little rule. Do not lie. If you know you never lie, you never have to deal with it.The book discusses also edge cases in which lying may be necessary (e.g., dealing with a murderer).

It destroys trust in relationships. While I was motivated and inspired by his words, I did find a bit of repetition on the scant number of pages, when I wanted something new to sink my teeth into.

However, the discomfort should not be exaggerated: You can be honest and kind, because your purpose in telling the truth is not to offend people: You simply want them to have the information you have, and would want to have if you were in their position. What truth feels likeThe year was 1987, but it might as well have been the Summer of Love: I was twenty, had hair down to my shoulders, and was dressed like an Indian rickshaw driver. For those charged with enforcing our nation's drug laws, it would have been only prudent to subject my luggage to special scrutiny. Happily, I had nothing to hide. ""Where are you coming from?"" the officer asked, glancing skeptically at my backpack. ""India, Nepal, Thailand..."" I said. ""Did you take any drugs while you were over there?"" As it happens, I had. The temptation to lie was obvious — why speak to a customs officer about my recent drug use? But there was no real reason not to tell the truth, apart from the risk that it would lead to an even more thorough search of my luggage (and perhaps of my person) than had already commenced. Yes,"" I said. The officer stopped searching my bag and looked up. ""Which drugs did you take? ""I smoked pot a few times... And I tried opium in India."" ""Opium?"" ""Yes."" ""Opium or heroin? ""It was opium."" 'You don't hear much about opium these days."" ""I know. It was the first time I'd ever tried it."" ""Are you carrying any drugs with you now?"" ""No."" The officer eyed me warily for a moment and then returned to searching my bag. Given the nature of our conversation, I reconciled myself to being there for a very long time. I was, therefore, as patient as a tree. Which was a good thing, because the officer was now examining my belongings as though any one item — a toothbrush, a book, a flashlight, a bit of nylon cord — might reveal the deepest secrets of the universe. ""What is opium like?"" he asked after a time. And I told him. In fact, over the next ten minutes, I told this lawman almost everything I knew about the use of mind-altering substances. Eventually he completed his search and closed my luggage. One thing was perfectly obvious at the end of our encounter: We both felt very good about it. What it is like being honest and what it is like being dishonestHonesty demands confidence and intelligence. It places you in difficult situations, just like lying does. But honesty takes you there more quickly. Lying often means delaying the difficult. While honesty means taking it on right away. Seems related to conscientiousness.For instance, say a friend asks you how you are feeling and makes clear she wants the real answer, not just the standard fine. It is not obvious which information you would want to have if you were in the other persons situation, and as Harris states so well at the beginning of his essay You simply want them to have the information you have, and would want to have if you were in their position.  To handle this well you need prudence and prudence comes from experience, experience which you amass much faster by practicing radical honesty and by building life experience.I guess honesty makes you look good because the good have less to hide, either because there is so little problematic about you, or because you are skilled enough to speak about the problematic and complex.

Rather than valuable insight from his own field (neuroscience), Harris sticks to surprisingly elementary basic philosophical constructs to explain that lying is best avoided. Necessary only for those who cannot think for themselves."

184,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"This is a bit longer than a magazine essay and in its length feels more like a journal article than a book. It covers a lot of ground and makes the point quite clearly.Harris is a consequentialist, something he does not argue for in this book but explained previously in The Moral Landscape. Consequentialism is a theory that maintains that the ethical value of an act is determined by its consequences. Consequentialism is often broken down into two main types: one in which the outcome of each specific act must be evaluated separately (as much as possible), and one in which general rules may be formulated based on the usual or probable outcomes of similar acts. Harris presents a clear example of the latter type in his wholesale rejection of lying.What is lying? It's a deliberate attempt to deceive others into believing something different than what we believe to be true. It may be an act of omission -- we can lie through what we don't say -- but this is a little more slippery, as Harris finds nothing offensive about the concept of privacy and furthermore is aware that if we resolved to communicate all the information we knew and correct every error we perceived we'd never have time to sleep. So Harris chose to focus on acts of commission. He gives a lot of attention to so-called ""white lies"" that are usually well-meaning attempts to spare others' feelings.Why does Harris say lying is undesirable? For a multitude of reasons. For one, it breaks down human relationships. It is wonderful to have friends who will tell you the truth, even when it is hard to hear, he says. When we hide our weaknesses or fail to critique someone who is asking for honest feedback, we are giving up opportunities to grow. This sort of stunting becomes offensive in principle: ""deciding how much (another) can know about himself seems the quintessence of arrogance,"" and as a result of keeping others ignorant of the truth, ""to lie is to infringe upon the freedom of those we care about."" For another reason, liars have to remember everything they've lied about. ""To agree to keep a secret,"" small as it may seem, ""is to assume a burden."" Due to a strange fact about human psychology, liars deprecate their ""victims"" so as to justify their own lying behavior to themselves, and thus liars become less trustful of other people even as those who have been lied to have more reason not to trust the liars. Lying thus makes everyone unhappier. When authorities lie, it causes mass confusion when people no longer know what information sources to trust, and this ruins public debate. For yet another reason, while liars have to remember everything they've lied about, people who are lied to cannot forget anything they've been lied to about. What psychologists call the ""illusory truth effect"" means that ""We seem to be predisposed to remember statements as true even after they have been disconfirmed."" A lie is forever, no matter how many times you try to take it back.To Harris, as a consequentialist, anything that harms the ability of humans to thrive is morally wrong. Therefore, lying is wrong.He does, briefly, admit that there might be some exceptions to the rule. ""If you think that it can ever be appropriate to injure or kill a person in self-defense, or in defense of another, it makes no sense to rule out lying in the same circumstances,"" he explains. It is permissible to lie in the unusual circumstance that ""we have judged the prospects of establishing a real relationship with this person to be nonexistent."" Even then, however, he suggests that the truth is often better than a lie. He provides a typical example of giving shelter to a child pursued by a murderer. If the murderer asks if you are sheltering the child, rather than saying ""no,"" you could say (in Harris's script), ""I wouldn't tell you even if I knew. And if you take another step, I'll put a bullet in your brain."" Something seems amiss here. Supplying a physical threat surely assumes the inability to develop a ""real relationship"" as much as lying assumes it, and degrades an existing relationship as much as lying degrades it. Furthermore, the one-liner is only available to people who do not stutter when facing a serial killer at their front door and happen to have a loaded pistol in their pocket. Elsewhere, in describing war, Harris said: ""The moment one begins dropping bombs, or destroying a country's infrastructure with cyber attacks, lying has become just another weapon in the arsenal."" If lying is a kind of weapon, then surely it is a useful weapon for the physically weak to fairly level the playing field against those who have initiated physical force against them. This wrinkle is not something he addresses.One other example sounds a bit askew. He writes that one possible result of honesty is that ""real problems in your life can be forced to the surface. Are you in an abusive relationship? A refusal to lie to others--How did you get that bruise?--might oblige you to come to grips with this situation very quickly."" It seems generally true that people in abusive or self-harming situations are better off telling the truth so they can get help. However, there are complicated psychological reasons why they may lie (by commission or omission) to protect their abusers, skate through a fearful moment, and maintain their dangerous situations. Faced with such an event, I would add more nuance to the consequentialist perspective and emphasize the ""lying is harmful"" while almost entirely dropping off the ""and therefore immoral."" In certain situations, judging an action to be ""morally wrong"" can be an effective way of bringing about a stop to that behavior. It can put a cork in selfishness, hubris, and so forth. By contrast, judging abuse victims to be committing moral wrong against themselves while they try to navigate their way out of a psychological prison does not help their situation, but only compounds their confusion. Part of the issue here is that Harris, throughout his book, depicts lies as having very short shelf-lives--their usefulness can begin deteriorating within seconds after the lie's cover is blown. Those of us who are concerned with long-term decision-making may read philosophy to learn how to live happier lives overall. Yet even those of us who consider ourselves long-term thinkers may experience certain moments -- confronting a serial killer at the front door, being stuck in an abusive relationship -- when we are trapped in short-term survival thinking. In those moments, we don't really care about the long-term prognosis of our lies of various colors. The long-term effects of our words may be objectively relevant and applicable, but we are not capable of analyzing them or caring about them. This oversight is a weakness in this short book.The book is nevertheless a good introduction to thinking about the question of lying. It makes a number of good points clearly and raises many worthwhile questions."

I believe the world would be a different place if everyone was completely honest, even with the small social lies we tell to spare the feelings of others. My mind has been dwelling on authenticity and the quandary of getting true personal critisism to become a better person, when everyone feels too awkward to give any meaningful feedback. Yet I don't want to go through life criticizing others with my personal opinions. Sam Harris provided interesting discussion on this issue without giving advice except that, in his opinion it is always better to tell the truth, come what may. "

190,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13315860-peter-colclasure,4,"A few years back I read Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs, where he quotes Steve Wozniak as saying ""I never lie. I haven't told a lie in years."" I remember reading that and thinking, how is that possible? How can you just not lie? So I decided to run an experiment and see how long I could go without saying anything that was dishonest, evasive, or misleading. It was harder than I thought it would be. The first step was self-awareness. In order to refrain from lying, I had to first be aware of it, and I wasn't always aware of it. I'd catch myself saying, ""Oh, there was a traffic jam,"" when I was five minutes late for work, only to realize halfway through my utterance that it was complete bullshit. I hadn't premeditated the lie, it was reflexive. It just came out. So the first thing I realized was how habitual white lies were for me. Not an everyday occurrence, but often enough. I can say that I never lied about anything significant, but I often bent the truth in my own interests as social lubricant, and the process was unconscious. For instance, I would regularly give people compliments that I only half believed because I wanted to be nice to them. I wouldn't describe myself as a dishonest person when I was younger, but in my teens and early 20s I had a tendency to embellish stories, for entertainment value, or brevity. And there was at least one occasion when I told a significant, consequential lie, to a man I cared about. I regret it to this day. Becoming a more honest person meant, for me, first getting in touch with the truth. In order to not lie, you have to actually think about what is true and what is false as you go through your day. You have to be honest with yourself about what you really feel. You can't just  mindlessly blurt out anything that's expedient, and that can be a tough habit to break.I still catch myself lying occasionally, but it's gotten to the point where it's once every couple of months, and the big difference is that now every time I say anything that isn't true I am 100% aware of it, like there's a spotlight on me.For instance, last October I was playing a solo show at a community college in the afternoon. The act going up on stage after me was a husband and wife duo that rapped in Arabic. They asked if I would stick around and watch them play. I said, ""I'd love to, but I have another gig downtown."" That was a lie. The other gig had been canceled. But I wanted to meet a friend for lunch. I'm working to eradicate behavior like this. Oh yeah, the book. I supposed I should talk about it since this is a book review. It's short. It's slightly dry but very thoughtful. Sam Harris takes a hardline stance on lying: don't do it ever. Don't tell your kids about Santa Claus. Don't throw surprise birthday parties. I think many readers would find this extreme, but he does a fine job of explaining, in detail, why he thinks these well-intentioned and admittedly benign behaviors could have unintended consequences. I disagree with him about Santa and surprise birthday parties, but I agree with pretty much everything else. Most people, myself included, are incapable of clearing the high moral bar that Harris sets for humanity. But I'm still glad the bar is there."
191,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"Lying (Kindle Single) by Sam Harris“Lying"" is the Kindle Single that makes the compelling case that society and our own lives would simplify and improve if we didn't lie. Neuroscientist, atheist icon and accomplished author Dr. Sam Harris provides yet another thought-provoking title. In this brief but eloquent essay, Harris convincingly establishes the virtues of not lying. This 145-KB book is composed of the following twelve chapters: 1. What is a Lie?, 2. The Mirror of Honesty, 3. Two Types of Lies, 4. White Lies, 5. Trust, 6. Faint Praise, 7. Secrets, 8. Lies in Extremis, 9. Mental Accounting, 10. Integrity, 11. Big Lies, and 12. Conclusion.Positives:1.	A great thinker who has mastered the ability to convey cogent thoughts in an accessible and memorable manner.2.	I always learn something new from Dr. Harris, always.3.	Always thought-provoking and compelling.4.	A trustworthy track record of high-quality work. 5.	Dissects the concept of lying with mastery. ""To lie is to intentionally mislead others when they expect honest communication"".6.	Clearly explains why people lie and the implications of such lies.7.	Clearly differentiates speaking truthfully from the held beliefs being true. Fabulous!8.	The main points of being truthful. Compelling.9.	Two types of lies: commission and omission. 10.	Great quotes, ""To lie is to infringe upon the freedom of those we care about"".11.	Interesting look at false encouragement.12.	A lesson learned with faint praise.13.	Interesting cases that help understand the points being made.14.	The importance of integrity.15.	Summarizes his essay with expertise.16.	Links worked fine.17.	Brief essay that is worth reading multiple times.Negatives:1.	My expectation are always high with Dr. Harris. So I must be truthful in saying that I was expecting more. As an example, I was hoping to get evidence from a scientific point of view. What does lying do to the brain for instance...2.	The idea of using evasive language instead of lying at times may work but even in extreme cases? Hmmm...3.	Dr. Harris espouses objective morality one that can be traced back to the brain but once again no evidence provided. I would have liked to have seen the link between our sense of morality and lying.4.	No charts or illustrations provided. 5.	Very few iconic quotes or intellectual homeruns that characterize Dr. Harris. The burden of living up to high expectations.In summary, I'm a big fan of Dr. Harris. He is one of my favorite thinkers and is able to say and write eloquently thoughts many of us have in common. His work is always thought-provoking and in this essay he provides strong arguments in support of his general thesis: that our lives would simplify and improve if we didn't lie. My only complaint is the lack of scientific depth, Dr. Harris relies mainly on his remarkable sense of logic and even that is persuasive enough on its own. An essay worth reading multiple times, I highly recommend it!"
192,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6108634-therese,3,"As part of my ""self-improvment/self-help"" reading kick, I read this very short book on lying by Sam Harris. It caught my attention because I've always prided myself on being an honest, open person, but a big part of his argument is that even lies of omission or white lies, told for the sake of kindness, are harmful and unethical. Thinking about it, I feel like I do that a lot trying to spare people's feelings, and Sam Harris argues that this kind of thing is hurtful, because by not being honest about negative things, you're depriving people of knowledge that could help them.One reason I think I'm so wary of saying critical things to people is that, partly as a result of being influenced by existentialism, I have a deep respect for other people's freedom to make their own choices and be their own authentic selves through those choices. As a friend, it's not my job to fix or improve or change or influence anyone - at best I think friends can help each other figure out who they really are and want to be and to become more true to themselves, by listening and asking questions and having conversations exploring those things. Conversely, it *is* my job to take responsibility for my own life choices and happiness, and part of that involves trying to be around people who affect my life in positive ways, and protecting myself from people who hurt me, by choosing not to be around them if I can help it.In the case of people whose behavior I sometimes don't like, because it's hurtful or self-destructive or some way distasteful to me, I feel like the best approach is most of the time positive reinforcement rather than being critical and calling them out on their bad behavior. So you give support and encouragement and praise when you see them doing something positive, and when the bad behavior happens you just don't give it any attention or communication at all, because the problem is that it's very easy from childhood on for people to learn that bad behavior can get them attention, and the negative attention feels better than no interaction at all. So negative attention always risks reinforcing the negative behavior.I can see Sam Harris's point though, about depriving people of helpful insights by refraining from criticism or negative comments ... but I think maybe a healthy balance is that if you value someone's role in your life as a friend or partner, yet you find their behavior is hurting you, the ethical approach is to give them at least a few chances to change by telling them honestly that they're being hurtful. If you've tried to communicate about it two or three times and the problems keep resurfacing, then you just have to let go and walk away and leave them to work out their issues at a safe distance ..."

If you're reading this review please read this article. Some of the comments are pretty funny/good too. I didn't agree with the author's opinion about surprise parties. I think those are fun and generally harmless.Something I wish the author would have addressed is that the person asking a question needs to own up the responsibility/gravity of the question/request they are asking. If a girl asks if she is fat in a dress. She should think ""Do I really want to hear the answer if it's yes?"" Or the author used the example of a dying person asking before going into operation, and the chances are slim that they will survive, ""Am I going to make it?"" Instead of dumping the emotional load on the person who already has the enormous task of being honest and telling the truth, why not depart from it and have the person who is asking the dang question be accountable for what he/she is asking? Why does the honest listener get the blame for being honest? The stupid question-asker should think about both possible answers to the question they want to know and ask themselves if they can handle both answers. This then distributes the honesty principle evenly between both parties.A simple solution to not lie is to just say ""I don't want to talk about it,"" or ""that's inappropriate."" That's it."

Our dishonesty not only influences the choices they make, it often determines the choices they can make—and in ways we cannot always predict. Every lie is a direct assault upon the autonomy of those we lie to.” ― Sam Harris, LyingHe does not frame it in a moralistic way but as a logical conclusion that liberates both the liar and the recipient of the lie from many burdens and possible negative outcomes, while building a better relationship and trust.“Unlike statements of fact, which require no further work on our part, lies must be continually protected from collisions with reality.” ― Sam Harris, LyingAn excellent exploration of what is a way of life for some or an occasional failure for others; all of us have done it and have had others inflict it on us, making it very personal and useful topic that touches all of humanity. Everyday philosophy served as a very fulfilling read.“Honesty is a gift we can give to others. It is also a source of power and an engine of simplicity.” ― Sam Harris, Lying"
196,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4906386-chris,4,"Pretty solid. It's a short book, but well worth reading. It's concise and presents a compelling argument.Lying creates more problems than it is worth. What we are actually doing is investing in the illusion of avoiding complications.He also makes the point that this taints our relationships. If we cannot be fully open and honest (even including so called white lies), then are we being truly loving? We often think that protecting our friends and loved ones from the pain of the truth is the loving thing to do when, in actuality, telling unpleasant truths may inspire them to change, grow, and heal. More importantly, it releases the mental static necessary to maintain these untruths, leaving one free to invest that mental energy in being present. This is a subtle effect but an important one.There are arguments to be made, of course, but I generally agree.In fact, I was withholding something from someone close to me. It was an unpleasant fact about myself, that I wasn't comfortable sharing (lie of omission). I shared it and immediately felt better. Not only that, the person I shared it with felt closer to me, and, in return, opened up and shared some of their pain. Bonding us closer together. It was a beautiful thing, and I'm grateful that I read this book when I did. I will continue incorporating its principles in my life."

The argument is that, unless you're dealing with someone you never want to have any kind of relationship with (ex. psychopath, enemy in war)--and maybe not even then--lying does more harm than good. Even white lies meant to spare the other person's feelings or be polite cause damage to a relationship. He gives the example of ""Does this dress make me look fat?""--Instead of rushing to say ""no!"", consider the truth, which might be any of these:- That's an unflattering dress for you. You'd look better in a different cut.- I love you no matter what you look like.- You would feel a lot better about yourself if you dropped a few pounds.Any of these, if they're the truth and expressed kindly, would be more helpful in the long run than a lie of ""No, you look great!""It's a really interesting argument, and what he says makes a lot of sense. I try to avoid lying whenever possible, but I do sugar-coat and dissemble, and sometimes I white-lie to be ""nice.""

They started with the simple question taking sense on the nature of reality and it took more than 2 hours for them to move on without succumbing to one another's argument. According to Jordan Peterson, truth is whatever the fact or beliefs that doesnt kill us which would makes us stronger - more like scientific anthrocentrism whereas Sam Harris took upon scientific realism that truth is independent of our existence, irrespective of the fact we got turned to ashes or not. The philosophy put forth by the neuroscientist here corresponds to realism but in a deep anthropocentric sense and maybe that's the reason people find it way too obvious.""How would your relationships change if you resolved never to lie again? What truths might suddenly come into view in your life? What kind of person would you become? And how might you change the people around you?""

Lying often exchanges short term benefits for long term troubles.A good idea expressed in the book is this: if you never lie there is nothing you have to remember, you need only this little rule. Do not lie. If you know you never lie, you never have to deal with it.The book discusses also edge cases in which lying may be necessary (e.g., dealing with a murderer).

However, the discomfort should not be exaggerated: You can be honest and kind, because your purpose in telling the truth is not to offend people: You simply want them to have the information you have, and would want to have if you were in their position. What truth feels likeThe year was 1987, but it might as well have been the Summer of Love: I was twenty, had hair down to my shoulders, and was dressed like an Indian rickshaw driver. For those charged with enforcing our nation's drug laws, it would have been only prudent to subject my luggage to special scrutiny. Happily, I had nothing to hide. ""Where are you coming from?"" the officer asked, glancing skeptically at my backpack. ""India, Nepal, Thailand..."" I said. ""Did you take any drugs while you were over there?"" As it happens, I had. The temptation to lie was obvious — why speak to a customs officer about my recent drug use? But there was no real reason not to tell the truth, apart from the risk that it would lead to an even more thorough search of my luggage (and perhaps of my person) than had already commenced. Yes,"" I said. The officer stopped searching my bag and looked up. ""Which drugs did you take? ""I smoked pot a few times... And I tried opium in India."" ""Opium?"" ""Yes."" ""Opium or heroin? ""It was opium."" 'You don't hear much about opium these days."" ""I know. It was the first time I'd ever tried it."" ""Are you carrying any drugs with you now?"" ""No."" The officer eyed me warily for a moment and then returned to searching my bag. Given the nature of our conversation, I reconciled myself to being there for a very long time. I was, therefore, as patient as a tree. Which was a good thing, because the officer was now examining my belongings as though any one item — a toothbrush, a book, a flashlight, a bit of nylon cord — might reveal the deepest secrets of the universe. ""What is opium like?"" he asked after a time. And I told him. In fact, over the next ten minutes, I told this lawman almost everything I knew about the use of mind-altering substances. Eventually he completed his search and closed my luggage. One thing was perfectly obvious at the end of our encounter: We both felt very good about it. What it is like being honest and what it is like being dishonestHonesty demands confidence and intelligence. It places you in difficult situations, just like lying does. But honesty takes you there more quickly. Lying often means delaying the difficult. While honesty means taking it on right away. Seems related to conscientiousness.For instance, say a friend asks you how you are feeling and makes clear she wants the real answer, not just the standard fine. It is not obvious which information you would want to have if you were in the other persons situation, and as Harris states so well at the beginning of his essay You simply want them to have the information you have, and would want to have if you were in their position.  To handle this well you need prudence and prudence comes from experience, experience which you amass much faster by practicing radical honesty and by building life experience.I guess honesty makes you look good because the good have less to hide, either because there is so little problematic about you, or because you are skilled enough to speak about the problematic and complex.

214,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"This is a bit longer than a magazine essay and in its length feels more like a journal article than a book. It covers a lot of ground and makes the point quite clearly.Harris is a consequentialist, something he does not argue for in this book but explained previously in The Moral Landscape. Consequentialism is a theory that maintains that the ethical value of an act is determined by its consequences. Consequentialism is often broken down into two main types: one in which the outcome of each specific act must be evaluated separately (as much as possible), and one in which general rules may be formulated based on the usual or probable outcomes of similar acts. Harris presents a clear example of the latter type in his wholesale rejection of lying.What is lying? It's a deliberate attempt to deceive others into believing something different than what we believe to be true. It may be an act of omission -- we can lie through what we don't say -- but this is a little more slippery, as Harris finds nothing offensive about the concept of privacy and furthermore is aware that if we resolved to communicate all the information we knew and correct every error we perceived we'd never have time to sleep. So Harris chose to focus on acts of commission. He gives a lot of attention to so-called ""white lies"" that are usually well-meaning attempts to spare others' feelings.Why does Harris say lying is undesirable? For a multitude of reasons. For one, it breaks down human relationships. It is wonderful to have friends who will tell you the truth, even when it is hard to hear, he says. When we hide our weaknesses or fail to critique someone who is asking for honest feedback, we are giving up opportunities to grow. This sort of stunting becomes offensive in principle: ""deciding how much (another) can know about himself seems the quintessence of arrogance,"" and as a result of keeping others ignorant of the truth, ""to lie is to infringe upon the freedom of those we care about."" For another reason, liars have to remember everything they've lied about. ""To agree to keep a secret,"" small as it may seem, ""is to assume a burden."" Due to a strange fact about human psychology, liars deprecate their ""victims"" so as to justify their own lying behavior to themselves, and thus liars become less trustful of other people even as those who have been lied to have more reason not to trust the liars. Lying thus makes everyone unhappier. When authorities lie, it causes mass confusion when people no longer know what information sources to trust, and this ruins public debate. For yet another reason, while liars have to remember everything they've lied about, people who are lied to cannot forget anything they've been lied to about. What psychologists call the ""illusory truth effect"" means that ""We seem to be predisposed to remember statements as true even after they have been disconfirmed."" A lie is forever, no matter how many times you try to take it back.To Harris, as a consequentialist, anything that harms the ability of humans to thrive is morally wrong. Therefore, lying is wrong.He does, briefly, admit that there might be some exceptions to the rule. ""If you think that it can ever be appropriate to injure or kill a person in self-defense, or in defense of another, it makes no sense to rule out lying in the same circumstances,"" he explains. It is permissible to lie in the unusual circumstance that ""we have judged the prospects of establishing a real relationship with this person to be nonexistent."" Even then, however, he suggests that the truth is often better than a lie. He provides a typical example of giving shelter to a child pursued by a murderer. If the murderer asks if you are sheltering the child, rather than saying ""no,"" you could say (in Harris's script), ""I wouldn't tell you even if I knew. And if you take another step, I'll put a bullet in your brain."" Something seems amiss here. Supplying a physical threat surely assumes the inability to develop a ""real relationship"" as much as lying assumes it, and degrades an existing relationship as much as lying degrades it. Furthermore, the one-liner is only available to people who do not stutter when facing a serial killer at their front door and happen to have a loaded pistol in their pocket. Elsewhere, in describing war, Harris said: ""The moment one begins dropping bombs, or destroying a country's infrastructure with cyber attacks, lying has become just another weapon in the arsenal."" If lying is a kind of weapon, then surely it is a useful weapon for the physically weak to fairly level the playing field against those who have initiated physical force against them. This wrinkle is not something he addresses.One other example sounds a bit askew. He writes that one possible result of honesty is that ""real problems in your life can be forced to the surface. Are you in an abusive relationship? A refusal to lie to others--How did you get that bruise?--might oblige you to come to grips with this situation very quickly."" It seems generally true that people in abusive or self-harming situations are better off telling the truth so they can get help. However, there are complicated psychological reasons why they may lie (by commission or omission) to protect their abusers, skate through a fearful moment, and maintain their dangerous situations. Faced with such an event, I would add more nuance to the consequentialist perspective and emphasize the ""lying is harmful"" while almost entirely dropping off the ""and therefore immoral."" In certain situations, judging an action to be ""morally wrong"" can be an effective way of bringing about a stop to that behavior. It can put a cork in selfishness, hubris, and so forth. By contrast, judging abuse victims to be committing moral wrong against themselves while they try to navigate their way out of a psychological prison does not help their situation, but only compounds their confusion. Part of the issue here is that Harris, throughout his book, depicts lies as having very short shelf-lives--their usefulness can begin deteriorating within seconds after the lie's cover is blown. Those of us who are concerned with long-term decision-making may read philosophy to learn how to live happier lives overall. Yet even those of us who consider ourselves long-term thinkers may experience certain moments -- confronting a serial killer at the front door, being stuck in an abusive relationship -- when we are trapped in short-term survival thinking. In those moments, we don't really care about the long-term prognosis of our lies of various colors. The long-term effects of our words may be objectively relevant and applicable, but we are not capable of analyzing them or caring about them. This oversight is a weakness in this short book.The book is nevertheless a good introduction to thinking about the question of lying. It makes a number of good points clearly and raises many worthwhile questions."

I believe the world would be a different place if everyone was completely honest, even with the small social lies we tell to spare the feelings of others. My mind has been dwelling on authenticity and the quandary of getting true personal critisism to become a better person, when everyone feels too awkward to give any meaningful feedback. Yet I don't want to go through life criticizing others with my personal opinions. Sam Harris provided interesting discussion on this issue without giving advice except that, in his opinion it is always better to tell the truth, come what may. "

220,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13315860-peter-colclasure,4,"A few years back I read Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs, where he quotes Steve Wozniak as saying ""I never lie. I haven't told a lie in years."" I remember reading that and thinking, how is that possible? How can you just not lie? So I decided to run an experiment and see how long I could go without saying anything that was dishonest, evasive, or misleading. It was harder than I thought it would be. The first step was self-awareness. In order to refrain from lying, I had to first be aware of it, and I wasn't always aware of it. I'd catch myself saying, ""Oh, there was a traffic jam,"" when I was five minutes late for work, only to realize halfway through my utterance that it was complete bullshit. I hadn't premeditated the lie, it was reflexive. It just came out. So the first thing I realized was how habitual white lies were for me. Not an everyday occurrence, but often enough. I can say that I never lied about anything significant, but I often bent the truth in my own interests as social lubricant, and the process was unconscious. For instance, I would regularly give people compliments that I only half believed because I wanted to be nice to them. I wouldn't describe myself as a dishonest person when I was younger, but in my teens and early 20s I had a tendency to embellish stories, for entertainment value, or brevity. And there was at least one occasion when I told a significant, consequential lie, to a man I cared about. I regret it to this day. Becoming a more honest person meant, for me, first getting in touch with the truth. In order to not lie, you have to actually think about what is true and what is false as you go through your day. You have to be honest with yourself about what you really feel. You can't just  mindlessly blurt out anything that's expedient, and that can be a tough habit to break.I still catch myself lying occasionally, but it's gotten to the point where it's once every couple of months, and the big difference is that now every time I say anything that isn't true I am 100% aware of it, like there's a spotlight on me.For instance, last October I was playing a solo show at a community college in the afternoon. The act going up on stage after me was a husband and wife duo that rapped in Arabic. They asked if I would stick around and watch them play. I said, ""I'd love to, but I have another gig downtown."" That was a lie. The other gig had been canceled. But I wanted to meet a friend for lunch. I'm working to eradicate behavior like this. Oh yeah, the book. I supposed I should talk about it since this is a book review. It's short. It's slightly dry but very thoughtful. Sam Harris takes a hardline stance on lying: don't do it ever. Don't tell your kids about Santa Claus. Don't throw surprise birthday parties. I think many readers would find this extreme, but he does a fine job of explaining, in detail, why he thinks these well-intentioned and admittedly benign behaviors could have unintended consequences. I disagree with him about Santa and surprise birthday parties, but I agree with pretty much everything else. Most people, myself included, are incapable of clearing the high moral bar that Harris sets for humanity. But I'm still glad the bar is there."
221,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"Lying (Kindle Single) by Sam Harris“Lying"" is the Kindle Single that makes the compelling case that society and our own lives would simplify and improve if we didn't lie. Neuroscientist, atheist icon and accomplished author Dr. Sam Harris provides yet another thought-provoking title. In this brief but eloquent essay, Harris convincingly establishes the virtues of not lying. This 145-KB book is composed of the following twelve chapters: 1. What is a Lie?, 2. The Mirror of Honesty, 3. Two Types of Lies, 4. White Lies, 5. Trust, 6. Faint Praise, 7. Secrets, 8. Lies in Extremis, 9. Mental Accounting, 10. Integrity, 11. Big Lies, and 12. Conclusion.Positives:1.	A great thinker who has mastered the ability to convey cogent thoughts in an accessible and memorable manner.2.	I always learn something new from Dr. Harris, always.3.	Always thought-provoking and compelling.4.	A trustworthy track record of high-quality work. 5.	Dissects the concept of lying with mastery. ""To lie is to intentionally mislead others when they expect honest communication"".6.	Clearly explains why people lie and the implications of such lies.7.	Clearly differentiates speaking truthfully from the held beliefs being true. Fabulous!8.	The main points of being truthful. Compelling.9.	Two types of lies: commission and omission. 10.	Great quotes, ""To lie is to infringe upon the freedom of those we care about"".11.	Interesting look at false encouragement.12.	A lesson learned with faint praise.13.	Interesting cases that help understand the points being made.14.	The importance of integrity.15.	Summarizes his essay with expertise.16.	Links worked fine.17.	Brief essay that is worth reading multiple times.Negatives:1.	My expectation are always high with Dr. Harris. So I must be truthful in saying that I was expecting more. As an example, I was hoping to get evidence from a scientific point of view. What does lying do to the brain for instance...2.	The idea of using evasive language instead of lying at times may work but even in extreme cases? Hmmm...3.	Dr. Harris espouses objective morality one that can be traced back to the brain but once again no evidence provided. I would have liked to have seen the link between our sense of morality and lying.4.	No charts or illustrations provided. 5.	Very few iconic quotes or intellectual homeruns that characterize Dr. Harris. The burden of living up to high expectations.In summary, I'm a big fan of Dr. Harris. He is one of my favorite thinkers and is able to say and write eloquently thoughts many of us have in common. His work is always thought-provoking and in this essay he provides strong arguments in support of his general thesis: that our lives would simplify and improve if we didn't lie. My only complaint is the lack of scientific depth, Dr. Harris relies mainly on his remarkable sense of logic and even that is persuasive enough on its own. An essay worth reading multiple times, I highly recommend it!"
222,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6108634-therese,3,"As part of my ""self-improvment/self-help"" reading kick, I read this very short book on lying by Sam Harris. It caught my attention because I've always prided myself on being an honest, open person, but a big part of his argument is that even lies of omission or white lies, told for the sake of kindness, are harmful and unethical. Thinking about it, I feel like I do that a lot trying to spare people's feelings, and Sam Harris argues that this kind of thing is hurtful, because by not being honest about negative things, you're depriving people of knowledge that could help them.One reason I think I'm so wary of saying critical things to people is that, partly as a result of being influenced by existentialism, I have a deep respect for other people's freedom to make their own choices and be their own authentic selves through those choices. As a friend, it's not my job to fix or improve or change or influence anyone - at best I think friends can help each other figure out who they really are and want to be and to become more true to themselves, by listening and asking questions and having conversations exploring those things. Conversely, it *is* my job to take responsibility for my own life choices and happiness, and part of that involves trying to be around people who affect my life in positive ways, and protecting myself from people who hurt me, by choosing not to be around them if I can help it.In the case of people whose behavior I sometimes don't like, because it's hurtful or self-destructive or some way distasteful to me, I feel like the best approach is most of the time positive reinforcement rather than being critical and calling them out on their bad behavior. So you give support and encouragement and praise when you see them doing something positive, and when the bad behavior happens you just don't give it any attention or communication at all, because the problem is that it's very easy from childhood on for people to learn that bad behavior can get them attention, and the negative attention feels better than no interaction at all. So negative attention always risks reinforcing the negative behavior.I can see Sam Harris's point though, about depriving people of helpful insights by refraining from criticism or negative comments ... but I think maybe a healthy balance is that if you value someone's role in your life as a friend or partner, yet you find their behavior is hurting you, the ethical approach is to give them at least a few chances to change by telling them honestly that they're being hurtful. If you've tried to communicate about it two or three times and the problems keep resurfacing, then you just have to let go and walk away and leave them to work out their issues at a safe distance ..."

If you're reading this review please read this article. Some of the comments are pretty funny/good too. I didn't agree with the author's opinion about surprise parties. I think those are fun and generally harmless.Something I wish the author would have addressed is that the person asking a question needs to own up the responsibility/gravity of the question/request they are asking. If a girl asks if she is fat in a dress. She should think ""Do I really want to hear the answer if it's yes?"" Or the author used the example of a dying person asking before going into operation, and the chances are slim that they will survive, ""Am I going to make it?"" Instead of dumping the emotional load on the person who already has the enormous task of being honest and telling the truth, why not depart from it and have the person who is asking the dang question be accountable for what he/she is asking? Why does the honest listener get the blame for being honest? The stupid question-asker should think about both possible answers to the question they want to know and ask themselves if they can handle both answers. This then distributes the honesty principle evenly between both parties.A simple solution to not lie is to just say ""I don't want to talk about it,"" or ""that's inappropriate."" That's it."

Our dishonesty not only influences the choices they make, it often determines the choices they can make—and in ways we cannot always predict. Every lie is a direct assault upon the autonomy of those we lie to.” ― Sam Harris, LyingHe does not frame it in a moralistic way but as a logical conclusion that liberates both the liar and the recipient of the lie from many burdens and possible negative outcomes, while building a better relationship and trust.“Unlike statements of fact, which require no further work on our part, lies must be continually protected from collisions with reality.” ― Sam Harris, LyingAn excellent exploration of what is a way of life for some or an occasional failure for others; all of us have done it and have had others inflict it on us, making it very personal and useful topic that touches all of humanity. Everyday philosophy served as a very fulfilling read.“Honesty is a gift we can give to others. It is also a source of power and an engine of simplicity.” ― Sam Harris, Lying"
226,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4906386-chris,4,"Pretty solid. It's a short book, but well worth reading. It's concise and presents a compelling argument.Lying creates more problems than it is worth. What we are actually doing is investing in the illusion of avoiding complications.He also makes the point that this taints our relationships. If we cannot be fully open and honest (even including so called white lies), then are we being truly loving? We often think that protecting our friends and loved ones from the pain of the truth is the loving thing to do when, in actuality, telling unpleasant truths may inspire them to change, grow, and heal. More importantly, it releases the mental static necessary to maintain these untruths, leaving one free to invest that mental energy in being present. This is a subtle effect but an important one.There are arguments to be made, of course, but I generally agree.In fact, I was withholding something from someone close to me. It was an unpleasant fact about myself, that I wasn't comfortable sharing (lie of omission). I shared it and immediately felt better. Not only that, the person I shared it with felt closer to me, and, in return, opened up and shared some of their pain. Bonding us closer together. It was a beautiful thing, and I'm grateful that I read this book when I did. I will continue incorporating its principles in my life."

The argument is that, unless you're dealing with someone you never want to have any kind of relationship with (ex. psychopath, enemy in war)--and maybe not even then--lying does more harm than good. Even white lies meant to spare the other person's feelings or be polite cause damage to a relationship. He gives the example of ""Does this dress make me look fat?""--Instead of rushing to say ""no!"", consider the truth, which might be any of these:- That's an unflattering dress for you. You'd look better in a different cut.- I love you no matter what you look like.- You would feel a lot better about yourself if you dropped a few pounds.Any of these, if they're the truth and expressed kindly, would be more helpful in the long run than a lie of ""No, you look great!""It's a really interesting argument, and what he says makes a lot of sense. I try to avoid lying whenever possible, but I do sugar-coat and dissemble, and sometimes I white-lie to be ""nice.""

They started with the simple question taking sense on the nature of reality and it took more than 2 hours for them to move on without succumbing to one another's argument. According to Jordan Peterson, truth is whatever the fact or beliefs that doesnt kill us which would makes us stronger - more like scientific anthrocentrism whereas Sam Harris took upon scientific realism that truth is independent of our existence, irrespective of the fact we got turned to ashes or not. The philosophy put forth by the neuroscientist here corresponds to realism but in a deep anthropocentric sense and maybe that's the reason people find it way too obvious.""How would your relationships change if you resolved never to lie again? What truths might suddenly come into view in your life? What kind of person would you become? And how might you change the people around you?""

Lying often exchanges short term benefits for long term troubles.A good idea expressed in the book is this: if you never lie there is nothing you have to remember, you need only this little rule. Do not lie. If you know you never lie, you never have to deal with it.The book discusses also edge cases in which lying may be necessary (e.g., dealing with a murderer).

240,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56884005-kalle-nordenstorm,4,"2nd read and I bet I will read it againWhat he is sayingIn committing to be honest with everyone, we commit to avoiding a wide range of long- term problems, but at the cost of occasional, short-term discomfort. However, the discomfort should not be exaggerated: You can be honest and kind, because your purpose in telling the truth is not to offend people: You simply want them to have the information you have, and would want to have if you were in their position. What truth feels likeThe year was 1987, but it might as well have been the Summer of Love: I was twenty, had hair down to my shoulders, and was dressed like an Indian rickshaw driver. For those charged with enforcing our nation's drug laws, it would have been only prudent to subject my luggage to special scrutiny. Happily, I had nothing to hide. ""Where are you coming from?"" the officer asked, glancing skeptically at my backpack. ""India, Nepal, Thailand..."" I said. ""Did you take any drugs while you were over there?"" As it happens, I had. The temptation to lie was obvious — why speak to a customs officer about my recent drug use? But there was no real reason not to tell the truth, apart from the risk that it would lead to an even more thorough search of my luggage (and perhaps of my person) than had already commenced. Yes,"" I said. The officer stopped searching my bag and looked up. ""Which drugs did you take? ""I smoked pot a few times... And I tried opium in India."" ""Opium?"" ""Yes."" ""Opium or heroin? ""It was opium."" 'You don't hear much about opium these days."" ""I know. It was the first time I'd ever tried it."" ""Are you carrying any drugs with you now?"" ""No."" The officer eyed me warily for a moment and then returned to searching my bag. Given the nature of our conversation, I reconciled myself to being there for a very long time. I was, therefore, as patient as a tree. Which was a good thing, because the officer was now examining my belongings as though any one item — a toothbrush, a book, a flashlight, a bit of nylon cord — might reveal the deepest secrets of the universe. ""What is opium like?"" he asked after a time. And I told him. In fact, over the next ten minutes, I told this lawman almost everything I knew about the use of mind-altering substances. Eventually he completed his search and closed my luggage. One thing was perfectly obvious at the end of our encounter: We both felt very good about it. What it is like being honest and what it is like being dishonestHonesty demands confidence and intelligence. It places you in difficult situations, just like lying does. But honesty takes you there more quickly. Lying often means delaying the difficult. While honesty means taking it on right away. Seems related to conscientiousness.For instance, say a friend asks you how you are feeling and makes clear she wants the real answer, not just the standard fine. It is not obvious which information you would want to have if you were in the other persons situation, and as Harris states so well at the beginning of his essay You simply want them to have the information you have, and would want to have if you were in their position.  To handle this well you need prudence and prudence comes from experience, experience which you amass much faster by practicing radical honesty and by building life experience.I guess honesty makes you look good because the good have less to hide, either because there is so little problematic about you, or because you are skilled enough to speak about the problematic and complex.

Rather than valuable insight from his own field (neuroscience), Harris sticks to surprisingly elementary basic philosophical constructs to explain that lying is best avoided. Necessary only for those who cannot think for themselves."

244,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"This is a bit longer than a magazine essay and in its length feels more like a journal article than a book. It covers a lot of ground and makes the point quite clearly.Harris is a consequentialist, something he does not argue for in this book but explained previously in The Moral Landscape. Consequentialism is a theory that maintains that the ethical value of an act is determined by its consequences. Consequentialism is often broken down into two main types: one in which the outcome of each specific act must be evaluated separately (as much as possible), and one in which general rules may be formulated based on the usual or probable outcomes of similar acts. Harris presents a clear example of the latter type in his wholesale rejection of lying.What is lying? It's a deliberate attempt to deceive others into believing something different than what we believe to be true. It may be an act of omission -- we can lie through what we don't say -- but this is a little more slippery, as Harris finds nothing offensive about the concept of privacy and furthermore is aware that if we resolved to communicate all the information we knew and correct every error we perceived we'd never have time to sleep. So Harris chose to focus on acts of commission. He gives a lot of attention to so-called ""white lies"" that are usually well-meaning attempts to spare others' feelings.Why does Harris say lying is undesirable? For a multitude of reasons. For one, it breaks down human relationships. It is wonderful to have friends who will tell you the truth, even when it is hard to hear, he says. When we hide our weaknesses or fail to critique someone who is asking for honest feedback, we are giving up opportunities to grow. This sort of stunting becomes offensive in principle: ""deciding how much (another) can know about himself seems the quintessence of arrogance,"" and as a result of keeping others ignorant of the truth, ""to lie is to infringe upon the freedom of those we care about."" For another reason, liars have to remember everything they've lied about. ""To agree to keep a secret,"" small as it may seem, ""is to assume a burden."" Due to a strange fact about human psychology, liars deprecate their ""victims"" so as to justify their own lying behavior to themselves, and thus liars become less trustful of other people even as those who have been lied to have more reason not to trust the liars. Lying thus makes everyone unhappier. When authorities lie, it causes mass confusion when people no longer know what information sources to trust, and this ruins public debate. For yet another reason, while liars have to remember everything they've lied about, people who are lied to cannot forget anything they've been lied to about. What psychologists call the ""illusory truth effect"" means that ""We seem to be predisposed to remember statements as true even after they have been disconfirmed."" A lie is forever, no matter how many times you try to take it back.To Harris, as a consequentialist, anything that harms the ability of humans to thrive is morally wrong. Therefore, lying is wrong.He does, briefly, admit that there might be some exceptions to the rule. ""If you think that it can ever be appropriate to injure or kill a person in self-defense, or in defense of another, it makes no sense to rule out lying in the same circumstances,"" he explains. It is permissible to lie in the unusual circumstance that ""we have judged the prospects of establishing a real relationship with this person to be nonexistent."" Even then, however, he suggests that the truth is often better than a lie. He provides a typical example of giving shelter to a child pursued by a murderer. If the murderer asks if you are sheltering the child, rather than saying ""no,"" you could say (in Harris's script), ""I wouldn't tell you even if I knew. And if you take another step, I'll put a bullet in your brain."" Something seems amiss here. Supplying a physical threat surely assumes the inability to develop a ""real relationship"" as much as lying assumes it, and degrades an existing relationship as much as lying degrades it. Furthermore, the one-liner is only available to people who do not stutter when facing a serial killer at their front door and happen to have a loaded pistol in their pocket. Elsewhere, in describing war, Harris said: ""The moment one begins dropping bombs, or destroying a country's infrastructure with cyber attacks, lying has become just another weapon in the arsenal."" If lying is a kind of weapon, then surely it is a useful weapon for the physically weak to fairly level the playing field against those who have initiated physical force against them. This wrinkle is not something he addresses.One other example sounds a bit askew. He writes that one possible result of honesty is that ""real problems in your life can be forced to the surface. Are you in an abusive relationship? A refusal to lie to others--How did you get that bruise?--might oblige you to come to grips with this situation very quickly."" It seems generally true that people in abusive or self-harming situations are better off telling the truth so they can get help. However, there are complicated psychological reasons why they may lie (by commission or omission) to protect their abusers, skate through a fearful moment, and maintain their dangerous situations. Faced with such an event, I would add more nuance to the consequentialist perspective and emphasize the ""lying is harmful"" while almost entirely dropping off the ""and therefore immoral."" In certain situations, judging an action to be ""morally wrong"" can be an effective way of bringing about a stop to that behavior. It can put a cork in selfishness, hubris, and so forth. By contrast, judging abuse victims to be committing moral wrong against themselves while they try to navigate their way out of a psychological prison does not help their situation, but only compounds their confusion. Part of the issue here is that Harris, throughout his book, depicts lies as having very short shelf-lives--their usefulness can begin deteriorating within seconds after the lie's cover is blown. Those of us who are concerned with long-term decision-making may read philosophy to learn how to live happier lives overall. Yet even those of us who consider ourselves long-term thinkers may experience certain moments -- confronting a serial killer at the front door, being stuck in an abusive relationship -- when we are trapped in short-term survival thinking. In those moments, we don't really care about the long-term prognosis of our lies of various colors. The long-term effects of our words may be objectively relevant and applicable, but we are not capable of analyzing them or caring about them. This oversight is a weakness in this short book.The book is nevertheless a good introduction to thinking about the question of lying. It makes a number of good points clearly and raises many worthwhile questions."
245,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13927940-eva,5,"Much of this short book resonated deeply with me. I believe the world would be a different place if everyone was completely honest, even with the small social lies we tell to spare the feelings of others. My mind has been dwelling on authenticity and the quandary of getting true personal critisism to become a better person, when everyone feels too awkward to give any meaningful feedback. Yet I don't want to go through life criticizing others with my personal opinions. Sam Harris provided interesting discussion on this issue without giving advice except that, in his opinion it is always better to tell the truth, come what may. "

250,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13315860-peter-colclasure,4,"A few years back I read Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs, where he quotes Steve Wozniak as saying ""I never lie. I haven't told a lie in years."" I remember reading that and thinking, how is that possible? How can you just not lie? So I decided to run an experiment and see how long I could go without saying anything that was dishonest, evasive, or misleading. It was harder than I thought it would be. The first step was self-awareness. In order to refrain from lying, I had to first be aware of it, and I wasn't always aware of it. I'd catch myself saying, ""Oh, there was a traffic jam,"" when I was five minutes late for work, only to realize halfway through my utterance that it was complete bullshit. I hadn't premeditated the lie, it was reflexive. It just came out. So the first thing I realized was how habitual white lies were for me. Not an everyday occurrence, but often enough. I can say that I never lied about anything significant, but I often bent the truth in my own interests as social lubricant, and the process was unconscious. For instance, I would regularly give people compliments that I only half believed because I wanted to be nice to them. I wouldn't describe myself as a dishonest person when I was younger, but in my teens and early 20s I had a tendency to embellish stories, for entertainment value, or brevity. And there was at least one occasion when I told a significant, consequential lie, to a man I cared about. I regret it to this day. Becoming a more honest person meant, for me, first getting in touch with the truth. In order to not lie, you have to actually think about what is true and what is false as you go through your day. You have to be honest with yourself about what you really feel. You can't just  mindlessly blurt out anything that's expedient, and that can be a tough habit to break.I still catch myself lying occasionally, but it's gotten to the point where it's once every couple of months, and the big difference is that now every time I say anything that isn't true I am 100% aware of it, like there's a spotlight on me.For instance, last October I was playing a solo show at a community college in the afternoon. The act going up on stage after me was a husband and wife duo that rapped in Arabic. They asked if I would stick around and watch them play. I said, ""I'd love to, but I have another gig downtown."" That was a lie. The other gig had been canceled. But I wanted to meet a friend for lunch. I'm working to eradicate behavior like this. Oh yeah, the book. I supposed I should talk about it since this is a book review. It's short. It's slightly dry but very thoughtful. Sam Harris takes a hardline stance on lying: don't do it ever. Don't tell your kids about Santa Claus. Don't throw surprise birthday parties. I think many readers would find this extreme, but he does a fine job of explaining, in detail, why he thinks these well-intentioned and admittedly benign behaviors could have unintended consequences. I disagree with him about Santa and surprise birthday parties, but I agree with pretty much everything else. Most people, myself included, are incapable of clearing the high moral bar that Harris sets for humanity. But I'm still glad the bar is there."
251,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"Lying (Kindle Single) by Sam Harris“Lying"" is the Kindle Single that makes the compelling case that society and our own lives would simplify and improve if we didn't lie. Neuroscientist, atheist icon and accomplished author Dr. Sam Harris provides yet another thought-provoking title. In this brief but eloquent essay, Harris convincingly establishes the virtues of not lying. This 145-KB book is composed of the following twelve chapters: 1. What is a Lie?, 2. The Mirror of Honesty, 3. Two Types of Lies, 4. White Lies, 5. Trust, 6. Faint Praise, 7. Secrets, 8. Lies in Extremis, 9. Mental Accounting, 10. Integrity, 11. Big Lies, and 12. Conclusion.Positives:1.	A great thinker who has mastered the ability to convey cogent thoughts in an accessible and memorable manner.2.	I always learn something new from Dr. Harris, always.3.	Always thought-provoking and compelling.4.	A trustworthy track record of high-quality work. 5.	Dissects the concept of lying with mastery. ""To lie is to intentionally mislead others when they expect honest communication"".6.	Clearly explains why people lie and the implications of such lies.7.	Clearly differentiates speaking truthfully from the held beliefs being true. Fabulous!8.	The main points of being truthful. Compelling.9.	Two types of lies: commission and omission. 10.	Great quotes, ""To lie is to infringe upon the freedom of those we care about"".11.	Interesting look at false encouragement.12.	A lesson learned with faint praise.13.	Interesting cases that help understand the points being made.14.	The importance of integrity.15.	Summarizes his essay with expertise.16.	Links worked fine.17.	Brief essay that is worth reading multiple times.Negatives:1.	My expectation are always high with Dr. Harris. So I must be truthful in saying that I was expecting more. As an example, I was hoping to get evidence from a scientific point of view. What does lying do to the brain for instance...2.	The idea of using evasive language instead of lying at times may work but even in extreme cases? Hmmm...3.	Dr. Harris espouses objective morality one that can be traced back to the brain but once again no evidence provided. I would have liked to have seen the link between our sense of morality and lying.4.	No charts or illustrations provided. 5.	Very few iconic quotes or intellectual homeruns that characterize Dr. Harris. The burden of living up to high expectations.In summary, I'm a big fan of Dr. Harris. He is one of my favorite thinkers and is able to say and write eloquently thoughts many of us have in common. His work is always thought-provoking and in this essay he provides strong arguments in support of his general thesis: that our lives would simplify and improve if we didn't lie. My only complaint is the lack of scientific depth, Dr. Harris relies mainly on his remarkable sense of logic and even that is persuasive enough on its own. An essay worth reading multiple times, I highly recommend it!"
252,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6108634-therese,3,"As part of my ""self-improvment/self-help"" reading kick, I read this very short book on lying by Sam Harris. It caught my attention because I've always prided myself on being an honest, open person, but a big part of his argument is that even lies of omission or white lies, told for the sake of kindness, are harmful and unethical. Thinking about it, I feel like I do that a lot trying to spare people's feelings, and Sam Harris argues that this kind of thing is hurtful, because by not being honest about negative things, you're depriving people of knowledge that could help them.One reason I think I'm so wary of saying critical things to people is that, partly as a result of being influenced by existentialism, I have a deep respect for other people's freedom to make their own choices and be their own authentic selves through those choices. As a friend, it's not my job to fix or improve or change or influence anyone - at best I think friends can help each other figure out who they really are and want to be and to become more true to themselves, by listening and asking questions and having conversations exploring those things. Conversely, it *is* my job to take responsibility for my own life choices and happiness, and part of that involves trying to be around people who affect my life in positive ways, and protecting myself from people who hurt me, by choosing not to be around them if I can help it.In the case of people whose behavior I sometimes don't like, because it's hurtful or self-destructive or some way distasteful to me, I feel like the best approach is most of the time positive reinforcement rather than being critical and calling them out on their bad behavior. So you give support and encouragement and praise when you see them doing something positive, and when the bad behavior happens you just don't give it any attention or communication at all, because the problem is that it's very easy from childhood on for people to learn that bad behavior can get them attention, and the negative attention feels better than no interaction at all. So negative attention always risks reinforcing the negative behavior.I can see Sam Harris's point though, about depriving people of helpful insights by refraining from criticism or negative comments ... but I think maybe a healthy balance is that if you value someone's role in your life as a friend or partner, yet you find their behavior is hurting you, the ethical approach is to give them at least a few chances to change by telling them honestly that they're being hurtful. If you've tried to communicate about it two or three times and the problems keep resurfacing, then you just have to let go and walk away and leave them to work out their issues at a safe distance ..."

If you're reading this review please read this article. Some of the comments are pretty funny/good too. I didn't agree with the author's opinion about surprise parties. I think those are fun and generally harmless.Something I wish the author would have addressed is that the person asking a question needs to own up the responsibility/gravity of the question/request they are asking. If a girl asks if she is fat in a dress. She should think ""Do I really want to hear the answer if it's yes?"" Or the author used the example of a dying person asking before going into operation, and the chances are slim that they will survive, ""Am I going to make it?"" Instead of dumping the emotional load on the person who already has the enormous task of being honest and telling the truth, why not depart from it and have the person who is asking the dang question be accountable for what he/she is asking? Why does the honest listener get the blame for being honest? The stupid question-asker should think about both possible answers to the question they want to know and ask themselves if they can handle both answers. This then distributes the honesty principle evenly between both parties.A simple solution to not lie is to just say ""I don't want to talk about it,"" or ""that's inappropriate."" That's it."

Our dishonesty not only influences the choices they make, it often determines the choices they can make—and in ways we cannot always predict. Every lie is a direct assault upon the autonomy of those we lie to.” ― Sam Harris, LyingHe does not frame it in a moralistic way but as a logical conclusion that liberates both the liar and the recipient of the lie from many burdens and possible negative outcomes, while building a better relationship and trust.“Unlike statements of fact, which require no further work on our part, lies must be continually protected from collisions with reality.” ― Sam Harris, LyingAn excellent exploration of what is a way of life for some or an occasional failure for others; all of us have done it and have had others inflict it on us, making it very personal and useful topic that touches all of humanity. Everyday philosophy served as a very fulfilling read.“Honesty is a gift we can give to others. It is also a source of power and an engine of simplicity.” ― Sam Harris, Lying"
256,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4906386-chris,4,"Pretty solid. It's a short book, but well worth reading. It's concise and presents a compelling argument.Lying creates more problems than it is worth. What we are actually doing is investing in the illusion of avoiding complications.He also makes the point that this taints our relationships. If we cannot be fully open and honest (even including so called white lies), then are we being truly loving? We often think that protecting our friends and loved ones from the pain of the truth is the loving thing to do when, in actuality, telling unpleasant truths may inspire them to change, grow, and heal. More importantly, it releases the mental static necessary to maintain these untruths, leaving one free to invest that mental energy in being present. This is a subtle effect but an important one.There are arguments to be made, of course, but I generally agree.In fact, I was withholding something from someone close to me. It was an unpleasant fact about myself, that I wasn't comfortable sharing (lie of omission). I shared it and immediately felt better. Not only that, the person I shared it with felt closer to me, and, in return, opened up and shared some of their pain. Bonding us closer together. It was a beautiful thing, and I'm grateful that I read this book when I did. I will continue incorporating its principles in my life."

The argument is that, unless you're dealing with someone you never want to have any kind of relationship with (ex. psychopath, enemy in war)--and maybe not even then--lying does more harm than good. Even white lies meant to spare the other person's feelings or be polite cause damage to a relationship. He gives the example of ""Does this dress make me look fat?""--Instead of rushing to say ""no!"", consider the truth, which might be any of these:- That's an unflattering dress for you. You'd look better in a different cut.- I love you no matter what you look like.- You would feel a lot better about yourself if you dropped a few pounds.Any of these, if they're the truth and expressed kindly, would be more helpful in the long run than a lie of ""No, you look great!""It's a really interesting argument, and what he says makes a lot of sense. I try to avoid lying whenever possible, but I do sugar-coat and dissemble, and sometimes I white-lie to be ""nice.""

They started with the simple question taking sense on the nature of reality and it took more than 2 hours for them to move on without succumbing to one another's argument. According to Jordan Peterson, truth is whatever the fact or beliefs that doesnt kill us which would makes us stronger - more like scientific anthrocentrism whereas Sam Harris took upon scientific realism that truth is independent of our existence, irrespective of the fact we got turned to ashes or not. The philosophy put forth by the neuroscientist here corresponds to realism but in a deep anthropocentric sense and maybe that's the reason people find it way too obvious.""How would your relationships change if you resolved never to lie again? What truths might suddenly come into view in your life? What kind of person would you become? And how might you change the people around you?""

Lying often exchanges short term benefits for long term troubles.A good idea expressed in the book is this: if you never lie there is nothing you have to remember, you need only this little rule. Do not lie. If you know you never lie, you never have to deal with it.The book discusses also edge cases in which lying may be necessary (e.g., dealing with a murderer).

If one lacks free will , how does one have the choice of telling the truth or not?!(5) Calling this a book (42 pages.

I think that Harris did a great job of showing how a simple white lie could turn really ugly. In ordinary circumstances lying is never helpful and is totally unnecessary. It destroys trust in relationships. While I was motivated and inspired by his words, I did find a bit of repetition on the scant number of pages, when I wanted something new to sink my teeth into. He could have said so much more, but then it would have been a book instead of an e-booklet. For the low cost the message has enormous value."

However, the discomfort should not be exaggerated: You can be honest and kind, because your purpose in telling the truth is not to offend people: You simply want them to have the information you have, and would want to have if you were in their position. What truth feels likeThe year was 1987, but it might as well have been the Summer of Love: I was twenty, had hair down to my shoulders, and was dressed like an Indian rickshaw driver. For those charged with enforcing our nation's drug laws, it would have been only prudent to subject my luggage to special scrutiny. Happily, I had nothing to hide. ""Where are you coming from?"" the officer asked, glancing skeptically at my backpack. ""India, Nepal, Thailand..."" I said. ""Did you take any drugs while you were over there?"" As it happens, I had. The temptation to lie was obvious — why speak to a customs officer about my recent drug use? But there was no real reason not to tell the truth, apart from the risk that it would lead to an even more thorough search of my luggage (and perhaps of my person) than had already commenced. Yes,"" I said. The officer stopped searching my bag and looked up. ""Which drugs did you take? ""I smoked pot a few times... And I tried opium in India."" ""Opium?"" ""Yes."" ""Opium or heroin? ""It was opium."" 'You don't hear much about opium these days."" ""I know. It was the first time I'd ever tried it."" ""Are you carrying any drugs with you now?"" ""No."" The officer eyed me warily for a moment and then returned to searching my bag. Given the nature of our conversation, I reconciled myself to being there for a very long time. I was, therefore, as patient as a tree. Which was a good thing, because the officer was now examining my belongings as though any one item — a toothbrush, a book, a flashlight, a bit of nylon cord — might reveal the deepest secrets of the universe. ""What is opium like?"" he asked after a time. And I told him. In fact, over the next ten minutes, I told this lawman almost everything I knew about the use of mind-altering substances. Eventually he completed his search and closed my luggage. One thing was perfectly obvious at the end of our encounter: We both felt very good about it. What it is like being honest and what it is like being dishonestHonesty demands confidence and intelligence. It places you in difficult situations, just like lying does. But honesty takes you there more quickly. Lying often means delaying the difficult. While honesty means taking it on right away. Seems related to conscientiousness.For instance, say a friend asks you how you are feeling and makes clear she wants the real answer, not just the standard fine. It is not obvious which information you would want to have if you were in the other persons situation, and as Harris states so well at the beginning of his essay You simply want them to have the information you have, and would want to have if you were in their position.  To handle this well you need prudence and prudence comes from experience, experience which you amass much faster by practicing radical honesty and by building life experience.I guess honesty makes you look good because the good have less to hide, either because there is so little problematic about you, or because you are skilled enough to speak about the problematic and complex.

274,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"This is a bit longer than a magazine essay and in its length feels more like a journal article than a book. It covers a lot of ground and makes the point quite clearly.Harris is a consequentialist, something he does not argue for in this book but explained previously in The Moral Landscape. Consequentialism is a theory that maintains that the ethical value of an act is determined by its consequences. Consequentialism is often broken down into two main types: one in which the outcome of each specific act must be evaluated separately (as much as possible), and one in which general rules may be formulated based on the usual or probable outcomes of similar acts. Harris presents a clear example of the latter type in his wholesale rejection of lying.What is lying? It's a deliberate attempt to deceive others into believing something different than what we believe to be true. It may be an act of omission -- we can lie through what we don't say -- but this is a little more slippery, as Harris finds nothing offensive about the concept of privacy and furthermore is aware that if we resolved to communicate all the information we knew and correct every error we perceived we'd never have time to sleep. So Harris chose to focus on acts of commission. He gives a lot of attention to so-called ""white lies"" that are usually well-meaning attempts to spare others' feelings.Why does Harris say lying is undesirable? For a multitude of reasons. For one, it breaks down human relationships. It is wonderful to have friends who will tell you the truth, even when it is hard to hear, he says. When we hide our weaknesses or fail to critique someone who is asking for honest feedback, we are giving up opportunities to grow. This sort of stunting becomes offensive in principle: ""deciding how much (another) can know about himself seems the quintessence of arrogance,"" and as a result of keeping others ignorant of the truth, ""to lie is to infringe upon the freedom of those we care about."" For another reason, liars have to remember everything they've lied about. ""To agree to keep a secret,"" small as it may seem, ""is to assume a burden."" Due to a strange fact about human psychology, liars deprecate their ""victims"" so as to justify their own lying behavior to themselves, and thus liars become less trustful of other people even as those who have been lied to have more reason not to trust the liars. Lying thus makes everyone unhappier. When authorities lie, it causes mass confusion when people no longer know what information sources to trust, and this ruins public debate. For yet another reason, while liars have to remember everything they've lied about, people who are lied to cannot forget anything they've been lied to about. What psychologists call the ""illusory truth effect"" means that ""We seem to be predisposed to remember statements as true even after they have been disconfirmed."" A lie is forever, no matter how many times you try to take it back.To Harris, as a consequentialist, anything that harms the ability of humans to thrive is morally wrong. Therefore, lying is wrong.He does, briefly, admit that there might be some exceptions to the rule. ""If you think that it can ever be appropriate to injure or kill a person in self-defense, or in defense of another, it makes no sense to rule out lying in the same circumstances,"" he explains. It is permissible to lie in the unusual circumstance that ""we have judged the prospects of establishing a real relationship with this person to be nonexistent."" Even then, however, he suggests that the truth is often better than a lie. He provides a typical example of giving shelter to a child pursued by a murderer. If the murderer asks if you are sheltering the child, rather than saying ""no,"" you could say (in Harris's script), ""I wouldn't tell you even if I knew. And if you take another step, I'll put a bullet in your brain."" Something seems amiss here. Supplying a physical threat surely assumes the inability to develop a ""real relationship"" as much as lying assumes it, and degrades an existing relationship as much as lying degrades it. Furthermore, the one-liner is only available to people who do not stutter when facing a serial killer at their front door and happen to have a loaded pistol in their pocket. Elsewhere, in describing war, Harris said: ""The moment one begins dropping bombs, or destroying a country's infrastructure with cyber attacks, lying has become just another weapon in the arsenal."" If lying is a kind of weapon, then surely it is a useful weapon for the physically weak to fairly level the playing field against those who have initiated physical force against them. This wrinkle is not something he addresses.One other example sounds a bit askew. He writes that one possible result of honesty is that ""real problems in your life can be forced to the surface. Are you in an abusive relationship? A refusal to lie to others--How did you get that bruise?--might oblige you to come to grips with this situation very quickly."" It seems generally true that people in abusive or self-harming situations are better off telling the truth so they can get help. However, there are complicated psychological reasons why they may lie (by commission or omission) to protect their abusers, skate through a fearful moment, and maintain their dangerous situations. Faced with such an event, I would add more nuance to the consequentialist perspective and emphasize the ""lying is harmful"" while almost entirely dropping off the ""and therefore immoral."" In certain situations, judging an action to be ""morally wrong"" can be an effective way of bringing about a stop to that behavior. It can put a cork in selfishness, hubris, and so forth. By contrast, judging abuse victims to be committing moral wrong against themselves while they try to navigate their way out of a psychological prison does not help their situation, but only compounds their confusion. Part of the issue here is that Harris, throughout his book, depicts lies as having very short shelf-lives--their usefulness can begin deteriorating within seconds after the lie's cover is blown. Those of us who are concerned with long-term decision-making may read philosophy to learn how to live happier lives overall. Yet even those of us who consider ourselves long-term thinkers may experience certain moments -- confronting a serial killer at the front door, being stuck in an abusive relationship -- when we are trapped in short-term survival thinking. In those moments, we don't really care about the long-term prognosis of our lies of various colors. The long-term effects of our words may be objectively relevant and applicable, but we are not capable of analyzing them or caring about them. This oversight is a weakness in this short book.The book is nevertheless a good introduction to thinking about the question of lying. It makes a number of good points clearly and raises many worthwhile questions."

I believe the world would be a different place if everyone was completely honest, even with the small social lies we tell to spare the feelings of others. My mind has been dwelling on authenticity and the quandary of getting true personal critisism to become a better person, when everyone feels too awkward to give any meaningful feedback. Yet I don't want to go through life criticizing others with my personal opinions. Sam Harris provided interesting discussion on this issue without giving advice except that, in his opinion it is always better to tell the truth, come what may. "

280,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13315860-peter-colclasure,4,"A few years back I read Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs, where he quotes Steve Wozniak as saying ""I never lie. I haven't told a lie in years."" I remember reading that and thinking, how is that possible? How can you just not lie? So I decided to run an experiment and see how long I could go without saying anything that was dishonest, evasive, or misleading. It was harder than I thought it would be. The first step was self-awareness. In order to refrain from lying, I had to first be aware of it, and I wasn't always aware of it. I'd catch myself saying, ""Oh, there was a traffic jam,"" when I was five minutes late for work, only to realize halfway through my utterance that it was complete bullshit. I hadn't premeditated the lie, it was reflexive. It just came out. So the first thing I realized was how habitual white lies were for me. Not an everyday occurrence, but often enough. I can say that I never lied about anything significant, but I often bent the truth in my own interests as social lubricant, and the process was unconscious. For instance, I would regularly give people compliments that I only half believed because I wanted to be nice to them. I wouldn't describe myself as a dishonest person when I was younger, but in my teens and early 20s I had a tendency to embellish stories, for entertainment value, or brevity. And there was at least one occasion when I told a significant, consequential lie, to a man I cared about. I regret it to this day. Becoming a more honest person meant, for me, first getting in touch with the truth. In order to not lie, you have to actually think about what is true and what is false as you go through your day. You have to be honest with yourself about what you really feel. You can't just  mindlessly blurt out anything that's expedient, and that can be a tough habit to break.I still catch myself lying occasionally, but it's gotten to the point where it's once every couple of months, and the big difference is that now every time I say anything that isn't true I am 100% aware of it, like there's a spotlight on me.For instance, last October I was playing a solo show at a community college in the afternoon. The act going up on stage after me was a husband and wife duo that rapped in Arabic. They asked if I would stick around and watch them play. I said, ""I'd love to, but I have another gig downtown."" That was a lie. The other gig had been canceled. But I wanted to meet a friend for lunch. I'm working to eradicate behavior like this. Oh yeah, the book. I supposed I should talk about it since this is a book review. It's short. It's slightly dry but very thoughtful. Sam Harris takes a hardline stance on lying: don't do it ever. Don't tell your kids about Santa Claus. Don't throw surprise birthday parties. I think many readers would find this extreme, but he does a fine job of explaining, in detail, why he thinks these well-intentioned and admittedly benign behaviors could have unintended consequences. I disagree with him about Santa and surprise birthday parties, but I agree with pretty much everything else. Most people, myself included, are incapable of clearing the high moral bar that Harris sets for humanity. But I'm still glad the bar is there."

Neuroscientist, atheist icon and accomplished author Dr. Sam Harris provides yet another thought-provoking title. In this brief but eloquent essay, Harris convincingly establishes the virtues of not lying. This 145-KB book is composed of the following twelve chapters: 1. What is a Lie?, 2. The Mirror of Honesty, 3. Two Types of Lies, 4. White Lies, 5. Trust, 6. Faint Praise, 7. Secrets, 8. Lies in Extremis, 9. Mental Accounting, 10. Integrity, 11. Big Lies, and 12. Conclusion.Positives:1.	A great thinker who has mastered the ability to convey cogent thoughts in an accessible and memorable manner.2.	I always learn something new from Dr. Harris, always.3.	Always thought-provoking and compelling.4.	A trustworthy track record of high-quality work. 5.	Dissects the concept of lying with mastery. ""To lie is to intentionally mislead others when they expect honest communication"".6.	Clearly explains why people lie and the implications of such lies.7.	Clearly differentiates speaking truthfully from the held beliefs being true. Fabulous!8.	The main points of being truthful. Compelling.9.	Two types of lies: commission and omission. 10.	Great quotes, ""To lie is to infringe upon the freedom of those we care about"".11.	Interesting look at false encouragement.12.	A lesson learned with faint praise.13.	Interesting cases that help understand the points being made.14.	The importance of integrity.15.	Summarizes his essay with expertise.16.	Links worked fine.17.	Brief essay that is worth reading multiple times.Negatives:1.	My expectation are always high with Dr. Harris. So I must be truthful in saying that I was expecting more. As an example, I was hoping to get evidence from a scientific point of view. What does lying do to the brain for instance...2.	The idea of using evasive language instead of lying at times may work but even in extreme cases? Hmmm...3.	Dr. Harris espouses objective morality one that can be traced back to the brain but once again no evidence provided. I would have liked to have seen the link between our sense of morality and lying.4.	No charts or illustrations provided. 5.	Very few iconic quotes or intellectual homeruns that characterize Dr. Harris. The burden of living up to high expectations.In summary, I'm a big fan of Dr. Harris. He is one of my favorite thinkers and is able to say and write eloquently thoughts many of us have in common. His work is always thought-provoking and in this essay he provides strong arguments in support of his general thesis: that our lives would simplify and improve if we didn't lie. My only complaint is the lack of scientific depth, Dr. Harris relies mainly on his remarkable sense of logic and even that is persuasive enough on its own. An essay worth reading multiple times, I highly recommend it!"
282,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6108634-therese,3,"As part of my ""self-improvment/self-help"" reading kick, I read this very short book on lying by Sam Harris. It caught my attention because I've always prided myself on being an honest, open person, but a big part of his argument is that even lies of omission or white lies, told for the sake of kindness, are harmful and unethical. Thinking about it, I feel like I do that a lot trying to spare people's feelings, and Sam Harris argues that this kind of thing is hurtful, because by not being honest about negative things, you're depriving people of knowledge that could help them.One reason I think I'm so wary of saying critical things to people is that, partly as a result of being influenced by existentialism, I have a deep respect for other people's freedom to make their own choices and be their own authentic selves through those choices. As a friend, it's not my job to fix or improve or change or influence anyone - at best I think friends can help each other figure out who they really are and want to be and to become more true to themselves, by listening and asking questions and having conversations exploring those things. Conversely, it *is* my job to take responsibility for my own life choices and happiness, and part of that involves trying to be around people who affect my life in positive ways, and protecting myself from people who hurt me, by choosing not to be around them if I can help it.In the case of people whose behavior I sometimes don't like, because it's hurtful or self-destructive or some way distasteful to me, I feel like the best approach is most of the time positive reinforcement rather than being critical and calling them out on their bad behavior. So you give support and encouragement and praise when you see them doing something positive, and when the bad behavior happens you just don't give it any attention or communication at all, because the problem is that it's very easy from childhood on for people to learn that bad behavior can get them attention, and the negative attention feels better than no interaction at all. So negative attention always risks reinforcing the negative behavior.I can see Sam Harris's point though, about depriving people of helpful insights by refraining from criticism or negative comments ... but I think maybe a healthy balance is that if you value someone's role in your life as a friend or partner, yet you find their behavior is hurting you, the ethical approach is to give them at least a few chances to change by telling them honestly that they're being hurtful. If you've tried to communicate about it two or three times and the problems keep resurfacing, then you just have to let go and walk away and leave them to work out their issues at a safe distance ..."

284,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9533949-kimball,4,"A good little informative booklet. I wish it was longer. It reminds me of this neat article I read about stopping lying %100. If you're reading this review please read this article. Some of the comments are pretty funny/good too. I didn't agree with the author's opinion about surprise parties. I think those are fun and generally harmless.Something I wish the author would have addressed is that the person asking a question needs to own up the responsibility/gravity of the question/request they are asking. If a girl asks if she is fat in a dress. She should think ""Do I really want to hear the answer if it's yes?"" Or the author used the example of a dying person asking before going into operation, and the chances are slim that they will survive, ""Am I going to make it?"" Instead of dumping the emotional load on the person who already has the enormous task of being honest and telling the truth, why not depart from it and have the person who is asking the dang question be accountable for what he/she is asking? Why does the honest listener get the blame for being honest? The stupid question-asker should think about both possible answers to the question they want to know and ask themselves if they can handle both answers. This then distributes the honesty principle evenly between both parties.A simple solution to not lie is to just say ""I don't want to talk about it,"" or ""that's inappropriate."" That's it."

Our dishonesty not only influences the choices they make, it often determines the choices they can make—and in ways we cannot always predict. Every lie is a direct assault upon the autonomy of those we lie to.” ― Sam Harris, LyingHe does not frame it in a moralistic way but as a logical conclusion that liberates both the liar and the recipient of the lie from many burdens and possible negative outcomes, while building a better relationship and trust.“Unlike statements of fact, which require no further work on our part, lies must be continually protected from collisions with reality.” ― Sam Harris, LyingAn excellent exploration of what is a way of life for some or an occasional failure for others; all of us have done it and have had others inflict it on us, making it very personal and useful topic that touches all of humanity. Everyday philosophy served as a very fulfilling read.“Honesty is a gift we can give to others. It is also a source of power and an engine of simplicity.” ― Sam Harris, Lying"
286,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4906386-chris,4,"Pretty solid. It's a short book, but well worth reading. It's concise and presents a compelling argument.Lying creates more problems than it is worth. What we are actually doing is investing in the illusion of avoiding complications.He also makes the point that this taints our relationships. If we cannot be fully open and honest (even including so called white lies), then are we being truly loving? We often think that protecting our friends and loved ones from the pain of the truth is the loving thing to do when, in actuality, telling unpleasant truths may inspire them to change, grow, and heal. More importantly, it releases the mental static necessary to maintain these untruths, leaving one free to invest that mental energy in being present. This is a subtle effect but an important one.There are arguments to be made, of course, but I generally agree.In fact, I was withholding something from someone close to me. It was an unpleasant fact about myself, that I wasn't comfortable sharing (lie of omission). I shared it and immediately felt better. Not only that, the person I shared it with felt closer to me, and, in return, opened up and shared some of their pain. Bonding us closer together. It was a beautiful thing, and I'm grateful that I read this book when I did. I will continue incorporating its principles in my life."

The argument is that, unless you're dealing with someone you never want to have any kind of relationship with (ex. psychopath, enemy in war)--and maybe not even then--lying does more harm than good. Even white lies meant to spare the other person's feelings or be polite cause damage to a relationship. He gives the example of ""Does this dress make me look fat?""--Instead of rushing to say ""no!"", consider the truth, which might be any of these:- That's an unflattering dress for you. You'd look better in a different cut.- I love you no matter what you look like.- You would feel a lot better about yourself if you dropped a few pounds.Any of these, if they're the truth and expressed kindly, would be more helpful in the long run than a lie of ""No, you look great!""It's a really interesting argument, and what he says makes a lot of sense. I try to avoid lying whenever possible, but I do sugar-coat and dissemble, and sometimes I white-lie to be ""nice."" I'm so bad at thinking on my feet, and my natural way of expressing things is so blunt!

We live in a world now days where honesty is hardly appreciated, lying is a subconscience behavior of our daily lives and we use our lies as skills to communicate with others without knowing how destructive this might be for those who are around us and for ourselves in the first place, even though it's harder and sometimes less socially convenient for us to tell the truth, we should always try to be honest in our answers and discussions. because by not letting the truth out, thinking that it's better to avoid uncomfortable situations or hurtful comments, we are being selfish and misleading without knowing.""By lying, we deny others a view of the world as it is. Our dishonesty not only influences thechoices they make, it often determines the choices they can make—and in ways we cannot alwayspredict. Every lie is a direct assault upon the autonomy of those we lie to."""
289,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41690792-muthuvel,3,"I happened to listen a podcast of Sam Harris interviewing Jordan Peterson on the question of 'what is truth'? They started with the simple question taking sense on the nature of reality and it took more than 2 hours for them to move on without succumbing to one another's argument. According to Jordan Peterson, truth is whatever the fact or beliefs that doesnt kill us which would makes us stronger - more like scientific anthrocentrism whereas Sam Harris took upon scientific realism that truth is independent of our existence, irrespective of the fact we got turned to ashes or not. The philosophy put forth by the neuroscientist here corresponds to realism but in a deep anthropocentric sense and maybe that's the reason people find it way too obvious.""How would your relationships change if you resolved never to lie again? What truths might suddenly come into view in your life? What kind of person would you become? And how might you change the people around you?"" Philosophy in a more personal sense would work out if implemented to the world, as individuals, it can lead to the betterment. I would consider this a decent self help book."
290,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30063883-enrico-bertini,4,"Ok. After reading this book this is what happens: you can't stop noticing all the times you tell little little white lies for your convenience. I was astounded how often I would fall into this trap and how unaware of it I was!Now, after reading this book I would immediately notice and either stop or try to recover from it.The key message of the book is that we, as a society, tend to believe white lies are ok, but they indeed have a very negative effect on our interactions and our personal integrity. Lying often exchanges short term benefits for long term troubles.A good idea expressed in the book is this: if you never lie there is nothing you have to remember, you need only this little rule. Do not lie. If you know you never lie, you never have to deal with it.The book discusses also edge cases in which lying may be necessary (e.g., dealing with a murderer). But the golden rule works in practice 99.9% of the times. DO NOT LIE. NEVER EVER AGAIN. It's very liberating!"
291,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11138071-po-po,0,"(1) Wholly inconsistent. Harris seems more okay with big lies (government secrets: ""The need for state secrets is obvious."") than littler lies (parents who would rather not tell the kids the mom has MS).(2)This is a good toilet read; read it while you're working out a long brown one.(3) Just like Free Will, this will undoubtedly stir the pot, rock the boat, etc. Good for a nice friendly round table discussion with your friends.(4) The contents of this book cannot be reconciled with the contents of Free Will. If one lacks free will , how does one have the choice of telling the truth or not?!(5) Calling this a book (42 pages. Pages 43 to 95 = appendices) is a blatant misrepresentation of the product-- A LIE--and is therefore ethically unjustifiable."
292,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6085278-jean,4,"This topic matter is one that definitely needed our attention; full attention. I think that Harris did a great job of showing how a simple white lie could turn really ugly. In ordinary circumstances lying is never helpful and is totally unnecessary. It destroys trust in relationships. While I was motivated and inspired by his words, I did find a bit of repetition on the scant number of pages, when I wanted something new to sink my teeth into. He could have said so much more, but then it would have been a book instead of an e-booklet. For the low cost the message has enormous value."
293,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3502690-graeme-roberts,5,"This is an excellent essay. I think that I will reread it many times. Sam Harris influenced me enormously with the intelligence and humanity of his earlier book The End of Faith.Lying is sold as an Amazon Single, which is apparently a new way of packaging essays as though they are books."
294,1940051002,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1272349-neven,5,"A concise and convincing essay with a direct and clear message - don't lie ever again, starting now - articulated well enough to intercept most (if not all) objections. The key weapon in Harris' arsenal is the simple admission that few of us are ever in any situation where lying is necessary or beneficial, and yet we constantly make excuses to ourselves for our white lies. Harris' books have made me reconsider deeply held beliefs before, and this one may do it again."

It is short, to the point, at times funny, and teaches one of the greatest lessons we could all learn. Luckily, it is available all week as a free download for those who would like to read it.
