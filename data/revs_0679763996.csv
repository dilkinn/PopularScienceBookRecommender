0,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76515-jeremy,5,"Evolutionary Psychology is a dangerous field. In all of evolutionary science, there's a lot of temptation to endorse a just-so-story that happens to fit all your current data (or worse, ignore some of the data as noise). But this is Human evolution we are talking about and thus it becomes even more important that we A) get the story right B) understand how general trends apply to individual cases and C) don't draw think that science can dictate morality.Surprisingly, the book is best on point C, showing how science can inform some moral debates but not settle them. It's also good on point B, making the qualification several times, but perhaps not forcefully enough for it to really sink in for all readers. Point A is my biggest issue. The majority of the book was well argued, well documented, and likely right. The problem is that when the author is speculating, he tends not to tell you he is. The book might be a ""must read"" for everyone, but it's a ""must read carefully"".I especially loved the use of Darwin's life for examples and the comparisons to J.S. Mill and Samuel Smiles, all of three of whom published classic works in 1859."

Quotes:p 36 - ...while there are various reasons why it could make Darwinian sense for a woman to mate with more than one man (maybe the first man was infertile, for example) there comes a time when having more sex just isn't worth the trouble. Better to get some rest or grab a bite to eat. For a man, unless he's really on the brink of collapse or starvation, that time never comes. Each new partner offers a very real chance to get more genes into the next generation - a much more valuable prospect, in the Darwinian calculus, than a nap or a meal. As the evolutionary psychologists martin Daly and Margo Wilson have succinctly put it: for males ""there is always the possibility of doing better.""There is a sense in which a female can do better too, but it has to do with quality, not quantity. Giving birth to a child involves a huge commitment of time, not to mention energy and nature has put a low ceiling on how many such enterprises she can undertake. So each child, from her (genetic) point of view, is an extremely precious gene machine. Its ability to survive and then, in turn, produce its own young gene machines is of mammoth importance. It makes Darwinian sense, then, for a woman to be selective about the man who is going to help her build each gene machine. p 38 whatever the ancestral environment was like, it wasn't much like the environment we're in now. We aren't designed to stand on crowded subway platforms, or to live in suburbs next door to people we never talk to, or to get hired and fired, or to watch the evening news. This disjunction between the contexts of our design and our lives is probably responsible for much psychopathology, as well as much suffering of a less dramatic sort. "

It will clear many misunderstandings about what is meant by a Selfish Gene. In fact, the book has many explanations that would have been good for Dawkins to include in later editions of his book The Selfish Gene or write about later. Like Dawkins' book, The Moral Animal talks much about altruism and how it can be understood in the new Darwinian light (based on kin selection and reciprocal altruism). The book is surely disturbing and Wright doesn't shy away from taking ideas to their logical conclusions. Many things are counter intuitive, like for example how monogamy is (contrary to the popular belief) good for men more than women, since in the former many men will be without wives but no women without husbands. He argues that monogamy was probably adopted lately in order to maintain social stability. It is a highly intelligent and earnest book. There's a beautiful technique used here by trying to explain Darwin's life (which is described by most as ""saintly"") in light of Evolutionary Psychology which I enjoyed immensely, with Darwin being the moral animal. However, like any science, some things are still speculative and need to be verified by data as Wright always reminds us. Having said all this, I marveled at the first 300 pages or so of the book. It changed many of my views about Evolution which I took for granted. We want to think of ourselves as animals with an extra part controlling the animal. This is most certainly false. We are animals capable (but not efficient) of contemplating our being an animal. Our brains are battlefields between our nature and our nurture (unlike what ""anti-genetic determinists"" think about Evolutionary Psychology).What I liked less in this book were the parts about Utilitarianism and how we can overcome our genetic tendencies. I agree with many Utilitarian ideas which I read elsewhere, but I was somehow disappointed here after the amazing explanations of Evolutionary Psychology. This part needed further elaboration and treatment, and some ideas were left midway. However, it is a great introduction to the topic and I highly recommend it. The first 300 pages easily deserve a 5-star rating."

On the road from Gethsemane to Calvary I lost my way.
For some obscure reason when I read the last page of this book and put it down, the above quote from one of the Lewis television series sprang to mind. I had to recheck the internet to ensure that my memory was in fact correct.I lost my way and my mission in fact with this book The Moral Animal on page 128/464 and my positive thoughts gradually diminished as I began the slippery downward slide to the last page. I thought it was excellently written up to then. This book promised me everything I wanted in a book on evolution and Darwin has interested and intrigued me for years, leading me onto my current fascination with genetics.This was meant to show me the new science of evolutionary psychology but this didn’t prove to be the case.It is a study of men and women and relationships. It compares the Victorian culture with ours today that I thought would be worth reading but there are too many personal interpretations, the book is not linear and it meanders, well to me anyway, everywhere. I’m not too sure either that I agree with the author’s views on natural selection.As an example:The way natural selection has worked its will is to make some things seem “obvious” and “right” and “desirable” and others “absurd” and “wrong” and “abhorrent”. We should probe our common sense reactions to evolutionary theories carefully before concluding that common sense itself isn’t a cognitive distortion created by evolution.I’m sure that many individuals will view this work favourably but it’s not for me. I actually don’t like the writing style. My other problem is that I’ve already read a really good biography on Darwin and other excellent books on evolution, and I was hoping for something new here. If it is to be found within these pages, well obviously I’ve missed it. This is another case of the book looking the part, promising marvellous things, having excellent reviews and proving to be disappointing. I chose badly on this occasion."

I also had learned that the environment is also responsible for shaping a huge portion of our behavior. But I lacked the knowledge of the relationship between the two and I also didn't know the precise relation of the environment and the genes in forging our behavior. Now, thanx to this book, I do.It turns out that the evolution implants knobs in our brain, but how low or high these knobs are set to, is determined by the environment. It was a huge revelation for me.I also have been pondering the boundaries of morality. Is there any objective morality to which we can cling?Yes, now I know and it is utilitarianism. Our behavior is moral to the extent that they benefit the people and contribute the good of all. This is a touchstone with which we can hope to discern if an act is moral.The writing was exceptional, the structure and depth of the material were superb. I loved the book, and profoundly recommend it to anyone who aspires to reach a higher intellectual level."
6,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2160536-marvin,4,"So where does man get his morals from? Some people would say God. That assumes there is some absolute idea of virtue and morals handed to us from the almighty. Best evidence against this? The Bible. Read the first four books of the Old Testament, not just the ten commandments, and then tell me you would want to live in a society that allows you to sell your daughter into slavery and stone your spouse for adultery. Clearly our ideas of morality evolve and continues to evolve...for the better in my opinionPerhaps the question should be not where but how do we get morality and virtues. Sociology see social values as originating to unify people and protect themselves from their own savage natures. But if this is true why do people often choose an altruistic stance even when it goes against cultural edicts. Along comes the science of evolutionary psychology which states our morality is not from societal causes but our own genes. As genes originates physical changes, they also originate behaviors that help us survive through generations. The author illustrates, not just through human examples but other mammals, how certain moral behaviors have developed to insure survival, which in the sense of natural selection means to reproduce and leave lot of descendents. Not only are we genetically predisposed to behave in certain ways but we often go out of our way to deceive ourselves about this. Bye bye freewill. Evolutionary Psychology (EP) is the new kid on the block. While evolution is an established fact, EP is young enough that the author of this thought-provoking book is often left to speculation, and he freely admits to this. However there is a lot to digest and ponder in these pages. Much is controversial and not just to fundamentalist Christians. Some have accused EP as condoning sexism and even rape. Not so. While Wright clearly states natural selection is only interested in survival not morality, he also realizes that if we understand the reason we do what we do, the more we can use this information for our own betterment. I personally think EP is too much in its infant stage to accept wholeheartedly but I must say I'm impressed with this excellent introduction to EP. Certainly this healthy examination of morals and mankind is a better choice than blindly accepting ""God-dictated"" edicts that have justified persecution and suffering through the ages."
7,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/746649-tara-b,1,"Evolutionary psychology has been used far too much to excuse men for raping women and fucking up our society with wars and patriarchy. I refuse to respect it; I think it's working to excuse us for the things we should be able to rise above. Wright does fight the absolutists and say this science is not an excuse for how much we hurt each other, but if he is so enlightened, can't he see that he is at the same time validating a science that is increasingly and more aggresively being used as fuel for the anti-anti-rape movement? He is saying, ""I like this science and think it explains us,"" first and foremost. His fails to remember that simply calling it ""science"" attaches a term to it that, as history shows, leads people to use any of its findings for their own benefit, treating them inescapable laws. His one- and two-sentence scoldings about how we should rise above his ""science's"" findings fall short of undoing the damage for readers who will use this book for evil."
8,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/156533-rob,5,"First and foremost: an uncritical read of this book will leave you feeling cynical and a bit cheated. It ranks up there with E.O. Wilson's Sociobiology and Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene (though I'll admit that I know those two primarily by reputation, having read excerpts and not their entireties). It would be very easy to find yourself getting defensive about the material presented in here; especially if you believe humans to be some special exception among animals.Meanwhile, with a more critical approach, you'll find that you cannot get Robert Wright's text out of your head: it is insightful, intellectually rigorous, even-handed, and at times palpably funny. Plus, you will find that it informs a great many (all?) of the human discourse (verbal or otherwise) that you encounter daily -- how certain traits and behaviors came to be and the functions they serve.Don't ask about their intentions though; we need to remember that evolution is goal-less, after all. Put most succinctly:
We are built to be effective animals, not happy ones.
What Robert Wright sets out to do with The Moral Animal is to take Darwin's life and oeuvre (primarily The Origin of Species), frame them with two other important contemporary writings (John Stuart Mill's Utilitarianism and Samuel Smiles' Self-Help), and use that lens to execute a thorough analysis and discussion of Darwinism and evolution, how human civilizations evolved as a consequence of ""reciprocal altruism"", and capsulize all of this as the basis for what Wright calls evolutionary psychology. Wright's choice of style is an interesting one and reminds me vaguely of Hofstadter's Gödel, Escher, Bach: meticulous and technical scientific discussions of biology, genetics, and evolution are interspersed with nearly whimsical narratives that detail the life and times of Charles Darwin. For every page that cites Robert Trivers or Richard Dawkins, there is another that quotes Darwin's personal correspondence or illustrates the backdrop of Victorian society. Wright's is an interesting and compelling approach that makes that text very engaging and approachable. Which is not to suggest that the material is easy to follow; Wright does not shy away from getting denser and heavier as the work progresses -- there were many instances were I found that I needed to double-back over certain passages to ""get it"".Again, for as dense and technical as much of Wright's writing is, he throws himself whole-heartedly into the text and makes the material come to life. There is something strangely erotic about his in-depth scientific analysis of mate competition, cuckoldry, and evolutionary strategizing. There is something perversely amusing about his apples-to-oranges comparisons of Darwin and Freud. There is something appropriately voyeuristic about reading letters from Darwin to friends and seeing how they reflect elements of his own theories.In many ways, Wright's eloquent prose is currency for getting us through some very challenging material. As I've already discussed, there is the implicit challenge of reading technical literature (especially as a layperson). More so however, is the explicit challenge that Wright lays out early in the text: that we all carry a great deal of cultural baggage that sets us up to reject the logical conclusions posited by Darwinism and evolutionary psychology. Wright spends the first half of the text building up to the discussions that give the book its title. By the time we get to Part Three: Social Strife, it is no small wonder why Wright keeps circling back on the example of bluegill sunfish and the equilibrium between ""nest builders"" and ""mate poachers"". The animal kingdom seems to contain not a more succinct microcosm of industry versus opportunism, of cost/benefit economies and stability through constant adjustments in strategy.The cornerstone of the second half of The Moral Animal is reciprocal altruism, a theory introduced in the early 1970s by Robert Trivers. Wright gives reciprocal altruism the thorough treatment: he describes how it may (must?) have evolved, the benefits it bestows on an organism (or, more accurately, its genes), how reciprocal altruism gave rise to human societies and civilizations, and the feedback loop between society and biology (i.e., meme and gene) as mediated through the extremely complex manifestation of reciprocal altruism in human beings. At first glance, Wright's exposition may appear cynical and determinist: even ""on our best behavior"", we are just a product of our genes -- even agape presumes a pay-off in the form of a more ""loving"" and stable society for our offspring. Swing such a cynical evaluation around to the other end and you are using these postulates for justification of extramarital affairs, for rape and for genocide, or for whatever other Twinkie Defense you might conjecture. Wright is very conscious of this and tries to be very delicate and deliberate in his treatment of all this; he even goes so far as to label it ""postmodern morality"" and he summarily eviscerates these conclusions as damaging and naïve. (Perhaps he is so explicit about this because he wishes to avoid being damned in the same way as E.O. Wilson when he published Sociobiology.) Wright suggests that if anything ""separates"" humans from animals, it is self-reflection, the capacity that we have to evaluate our actions (and the actions of others) and consequently judge those actions. Wright asserts that even if the content of our judgments (and our abilities to make those judgments) are evolved tendencies, that we can on some level make choices about the ""rightness"" of a given action; that our memes (though he eschews that word) and genes interact and we express agency in our evolution.Of course, he also appears to caution us that there is a great deal of cultural transmission going on in human evolution right now and that meme transmission is fragile and tenuous even under the best conditions. Hyperbolic though it may sound, Wright appears to suggest that we are one catastrophic event away from being free agents in the game of evolution.Underlying all of this is the assertion that reciprocal altruism is a non-zero-sum game where each player (i.e., the genes that are making efforts through the organism to reproduce) functions as a kind of accountant of favors. Each organism is playing life and evolution as a game where sometimes the best move is to take a short-term loss, where sometimes the best move is to take a little more than what you're owed but not as much as you could exploit. In a way, this is a hopelessly romantic view of evolution -- that even despite the ubiquitously short half-life of any pleasure, that an organism might still ""choose"" a small short-term sacrifice for a greater long-term gain. In reading the entirety of Wright's argument however, it is certainly reasonable to assume that this is a pragmatic trait, that it's a complexly evolved response system for economies of scarcity -- that there is in fact nothing romantic about charity or sacrifice or romance or the outlaw exploiter. Mechanistically, we are all cogs in the perpetual motion machine of evolution's equilibrium. And as such, our morals (or lack thereof) are the motions of that machine balancing itself.I could see how some, perhaps many might find this thought is unsettling. With his re-telling of Darwin's tale, Wright illustrates a Copernicanian re-centering of humankind, its origins, and even its humanity. As mentioned above, it can be easy to carve out portions of this hypothesis and serve them in cynical isolation. Taken as a whole, it is a strong composite view of humankind's genetic and cultural make-up, the forces that drove us to where we are, and the agency we may express over our destiny."

10,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1449893-leslie,2,"This book is about 1/3 decent application of evolutionary theory, 1/3 stretching theory to cover subjects/behaviors that it might fit but there is no real evidence for (just logical reasoning), and 1/3 arm-waiving of barely thought-out evolutionary explanations. It also seems to be based largely on a few papers written in the '70s, constantly bringing up the same papers. Note the number of times the author mentions Trivers' papers. Additionally, the tone of the book (or train of thought of the writer) seemed to change a lot, which made for kind of awkward transitions when reading multiple sections in one sitting.On a side note, I did find the anecdotes about Darwin's life and relationships pretty interesting, and a funny choice for use as examples of evolution in social behavior.Even though I didn't particularly like much of this book, I hope people that do read this can read it with a grain of salt and a little thought: it can make for some good discussions if you read it with someone else."
11,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13168655-jen-catembung,5,"When Christopher Ryan (author of Sex at Dawn), suggested another compelling book to read: The Moral Animal by Robert Wright, I was adamant enough that almost all my nagging personal questions about morality and discernment will be widely explained from an evolutionary and biological point of view.True as what most book reviews say, Robert explores the most fascinating, sometimes-controversial concepts that affects the way we make decisions in our lives. This is the reason why books like this is such a winner! Be open to dive deep into a rabbit hole discussion about religion, relationships, friendship, sex, love, status, self-esteem and our social networks.What people consider good and beneficial for them may merely be based from the principle of social conditioning. I personally feel that because of Wright’s clear and lucid way of explaining crucial matters, his writing has deeply changed my perspectives in some aspects of my life. This book is packed with immense knowledge about Evolutionary Psychology. The obvious premise, of course, that I agree with is when Wright presents that if anything separates animals from humans, it is self-reflection (the ability to evaluate our actions and the actions of others) and consequently judge those actions and morally act upon it. I need to listen to it again to pinpoint its flaws.A must read...but a must read with extra care! #themoralanimal #robertwright"

Morality, you could almost say, was designed to be misused by its own definition."" -- p. 344, The Moral AnimalNow if them ain't fightin' words, I don't know what is. This book started slow for me but after the first chapter or so it starts to rock. Wright does a clever bit here, using Darwin himself as a subject for explicating the processes of natural selection and evolutionary psychology. So like two books in one, the biography being a freebie. Plus Wright's an engaging and witty writer; there are deep considerations throughout the book and a genuine laugh every few pages.Wright really wins, though, when he's at his most thoughtfully provocative. In a freak example of truth in advertising, the back cover declares: ""...this book compels us to rethink our most basic moral assumptions, with lasting implications for our public policy as well as for our intimate daily actions."" That's no hyperbole. Pretty much wherever you stand on the atheist-agnostic-believer spectrum, the rug's yanked out from under you. (This goes for you too, nihilists.) One of Wright's main assertions, boiled way down, is that everything we believe in our deepest heart of hearts, the moral code we claim to live by and whatever we're dead certain is our Core Truth, is just a trick of natural selection; a device to further evolution's aims. And he's really damned convincing.Whether you buy Wright's arguments or not, I submit it's a worthy exercise to try standing outside our own biases; to submit our beliefs to the skeptical scrutiny we apply to others' opposing beliefs; to question our behaviors and motives as witheringly as we would our most outrageous opponent's. It's brutal. Damn near impossible. Like trying to park your brain outside your skull and leave it there, watching. Reading The Moral Animal, I felt as though a gauntlet had been thrown. The challenge inherent here -- as I'm choosing to take it -- is to strip away all I take as self-evident, plus all the rationalization and corner-cutting and anything even remotely conveniently self-serving, and see what I can make of what's left. If you like this kind of angel-wrasslin', this book's for you.(4.5 stars)"

15,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2250921-michael,4,"Here's the problem with evolutionary psychology: its style of reasoning is all what I believe the brainy types call ex post facto. That is, practitioners take a look at features or patterns of human behavior today, then ponder about why that kind of activity might have been advantageous in ""the evolutionary environment,"" back when we were out there gathering and scavenging and occasionally trying to take down one of our fellow large mammals. Explanations tend to be extremely tidy, and awfully difficult to test.For all that, many of the ideas of evolutionary psychology seem to have a startling degree of explanatory power. Probably the best-known example regards the widely cross-cultural sexual behavior of men and women. Men's brains, or bodies, or genes, ""want"" them to sleep with essentially any woman who moves, we are told, because this is in the best interest of pushing his genetic material forward. Women's brains, on the other hand, ""want"" them to snag and secure a mate who is likely to stick around and help gather food, run off predators, and do the dishes. Since these were successful reproductive strategies back in the day, the logic goes, more humans who embodied these characteristics survived to spawn the next generation.Suspiciously neat and tidy? You bet! Able to explain a nearly universal observation about human behavior in a logical and intuitively attractive fashion? Absolutely! A tricky business, this evolutionary psychology.The Human ConditionRobert Wright's 1994 synopsis of what was at the time still a relatively new academic discipline is beautifully written, balancing provocative arguments with careful reasoning and considerable erudition. He covers, for instance, the pros and cons of polygamy, and polygamy emerges seeming like a pretty reasonable option. The human drive to seek status, our frequent tendency to discount and reject strangers, and our peculiar habit of developing friendships are all traced to the possible genetic advantage that they would confer in the long eons of prehistory.Some readers might be disconcerted by evolutionary psychology's apparent reduction of all human motivation and morality to pure biological self-interest. But this is hardly a new concept. Hobbes blew my mind all the way back in college, after all, with a vigorous argument that whatsoever is the object of any man's appetite or desire, that is it which he for his part calleth good; and the object of his hate and aversion, evil; and of his contempt, vile and inconsiderable. Oh, and he wrote that in 1651. I bet he wasn't the first cynic to come down the path, either.But Wright's look at the human condition is less of a bummer than it could be, anyway. What saves us -- or could save us -- is the mechanism of ""love,"" a genetic tic that confers a reproductive advantage by aiding the survival of the offspring and close relatives of those who possess it. Because kin groups united by love in the evolutionary environment tended to succeed at the expense of every-primate-for-itself kin groups, we have inherited the capacity to feel fond and protective of each other. Now, living in (basically) the post-evolutionary environment, we can more or less choose to extend our capacity of love to people who don't share our genetic material -- friends, a community, a nation, even a stranger on the other side of the world. Ultimately, Wright's prescription for the human condition is much the same of that in Ozzie in his epic rock anthem Crazy Train: ""Maybe it's not too late to learn how to love and forget how to hate.""There is also some business about whether we possess free will or are just the expressions of a mechanistic brain chemistry. The answer, if I read it right, is that we are probably mechanistic, but it's important not to act like you think so.The Darwinian ConditionThe Moral Animal applies each of its... findings? insights? speculations? ...to the case study of a single human being. That human: Charles Darwin. So, a chapter about the evolutionary psychology of courtship will be followed by a chapter about Darwin's courtship, and how it did or didn't seem to embody evolutionary psychological principles. This structure is pretty weird, to say the least, but in practice it is not nearly as clunky as you might expect. The case-study aspect is actually kind of interesting, and Darwin left a massive-enough paper trail that there's plenty of documentary evidence of his thinking. Plus, the continuous weaving of the modern perspective with Darwin's own development of his ideas points out areas where he anticipated ideas that wouldn't be fully developed for more than a century, where he went off on tangents that have since been discredited, and where he seems to have been afraid to tread.My only complaint about this book is that it is seventeen years old. It is written very much as a dispatch from a new and exciting area of science, and I am sure that much has happened in the interim. Are Wright's ideas now passé? Have they been bolstered and supplemented by lots of exciting new research? I dunno. Meanwhile, a few details he cites in support of his arguments, in particular relating to modern hunter-gather societies and to neurochemistry, are so out of date that even a casual reader dude like myself can flag them. I imagine that someone has written a newer synthesis of the field. I just hope that they wrote it half as gracefully and entertainingly as Wright wrote The Moral Animal."

It was thought-provoking, well-written, and even applicable to life. Though I was uncomfortable with some of the broad generalizations on gender and sex and his flippant dismissal of feminist claims about the social fluidity of gender. Seems to me that more recent research (i.e. Cordelia Fine et al) have debunked some of the studies he relies on (like the famous fruit fly reproduction study). I would love to see Wright respond to those criticisms. I suspect that neither side is totally right on this. That yes, men and women are wired differently, but no, not as different as Wright believes. "

It might sound cute on paper to analyze Darwin’s life through the lens of evolutionary psychology, but in practice it’s distracting, cumbersome and time consuming. The book could have been half as long and many times better if the reader wasn’t forced to learn about the color of Darwin’s socks. Still, the good parts of the text are fantastic."

In fact, I think all kinds of moral philosophy and psychology are fine. I have no bones to pick with any of the foregoing. My problem is with Mr. Wright and his style and his manner of thinking and his manner of research. There are science journalists, like Mr. Wright, who are satisfied and contented with presenting the results of their research and not going beyond the confines of the conclusions reached by the scientists for whom they speak. Writers who understand the dangers and difficulties of stretching what has been found to be true. There is, however, for many writers, a great temptation to try to please the greatest possible number of readers and thereby increase whatever their success might otherwise have been. And then, in a rather different vein, there are writers who themselves are only comfortable if they are able to present a message in tune with their own personal values and aspirations, regardless of whether those values or aspirations are consistent with what is actually the case.Mr. Wright appears to me to be one of the latter. A writer who personally needs to be the presenter of what he believes to be appropriately positive thoughts and opinions. Which is a shame. Mr. Wright is obviously an intelligent and perceptive person. He has no real need to cast himself as one of the more inanely optimistic science journalists of today. To an extent he does create the impression of wanting to be a nineteenth century Pollyanna, someone always able to draw sunshine conclusions from November data. In other words, Mr. Wright appears to go beyond his facts, and thereby loses substantially. Of course, there are many readers willing quite happily to pay for such interpretations. Probably more than are only satisfied with restrained and obviously sensible conclusions. But whether the problem is that of Mr. Wright alone, or of he and his editor, the final result in this book is to create and sustain the impression that Mr. Wright is willing to trim his sails to the wind whatever the weather may be.For those who wish no more from their science journalism than they receive Sunday morning in the pews of a happiness church, this is an appropriate work. For any wanting more, or for those having distinct standards to which they wish their science reading to comply, this book will be disappointing. The subject of the book is fascinating and always appropriate. That subject will have to wait for a different expositor for readers who want a soberly accurate treatment. "
20,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/318324-kurt,4,"Probably my favorite quote from this book comes from the chapter in which the author discusses whether or not we are truly moral animals. He concludes that we are almost:We are potentially moral animals -- which is more than any other animal can say -- but we aren't naturally moral animals. To be moral animals, we must realize how thoroughly we aren't.The Moral Animal is a very thought-provoking and interesting book. It answers, but mostly it just attempts to answer, so many questions about why humans are the way we are, mostly from an evolutionary or genetic standpoint. It outlines the entire life of Charles Darwin in the process and compares events and examples from his life story that illustrate the points made by the author. I enjoyed everything about this book. I feel much enlightened and educated about the psychology of the human animal and I have a deeper respect and appreciation for ""the reluctant Mr. Darwin."""

22,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5874435-manu,5,"The last book I read in 2016 was ""This Explains Everything: Deep, Beautiful, and Elegant Theories of How the World Works"" where leading thinkers share their favourite deep and elegant theory. An overwhelming number of them cited Darwin's theory of natural selection, and though I have not been asked, I'd say rightly so. As someone rightly pointed out, the beauty and elegance is when one theory explains a lot of diverse phenomena, and is almost a gift that keeps on giving.Robert Wright uses Darwin's theory to explain exactly what the book's title says - why we are the way we are, using Darwin's own life to illustrate several facets of classic human behaviour. I have thus far viewed the brain as a product of evolution, and feelings and emotions as a vague result of biochemistry triggered by the environment and the brain. My views have been shaped by some excellent and diverse books - Sapiens, Scarcity, Finite and Infinite Games - to name a significant few. This book, in many ways, is an amalgamation of the best insights that those have to offer. But the brilliance of the book is in how it goes beyond, and draws the connection between mental organs and behaviour in the modern world. The book throws light on the various behaviours we exhibit in our day to day life, many of which have their origins in the hunter-gatherer stage of our species and before. In fact, we even share some traits with our nearest relatives- chimpanzees and bonobos. Almost all facets of our life are addressed - relationship with parents, siblings, spouse, and society in general, politics, sex, friendship, religion etc. There are some fascinating insights. How (and why) males are concerned with sexual infidelity while females focus on emotional infidelity, how natural selection works behind the scenes by shaping feelings and not making us conscious of the logic, on how happiness is not really the topmost agenda in the gene's scheme of things, (that explains the friction!) the nature and cause of our biases, how we balance the two forces - reciprocal altruism and status hierarchy - that seem like opposites, the self being an organ of impression management (quoting Jerome Barkow) and so on. But of all this, my favourite is the nuanced and fantastically lucid discussion on free will and determinism. I have, for years, been absolutely convinced about the former, but this book has given me some excellent perspectives on how determinism need not have anything to do with divinity, but everything to do with biological aspects - a combination of genes and environment. That ""delusion of free will"" could be an adaptation hidden from us by design. And finally, on how because of of all this, we aren't really moral animals, but only potentially moral. Indeed, I now feel that the purpose of our species, and each of us individually, is to rise above evolution. And this book helps you do just that- it works like a mirror, and then some, by making us reflect on the real reason behind why behave the way we do. The answers are not always kind."

But reading it in 2013, after Sperm Wars and Sex at Dawn and Mothers and Others and epigenetics and everything by Sapolsky, it's hard not to feel frustrated by everything that’s missing or incomplete or even wrong — but such is Science. We’ve learned much in the last 20 years, and Wright is directly responsible for much of that... so I offer a sincere and humble thank-you. With reservations.If you’ve been paying attention you already know most of what's in here, and more. So read it as you would The Origin of Species: for historical perspective, for the pleasure of flashing back to a time when this knowledge was new.If you’re new to this material, proceed with caution. Wright fails to draw a clear distinction between pre- and post-agricultural societies, forgetting that the latter is a recent but drastic aberration from our evolutionary roots. This taints some of his assumptions and arguments about family life and morality. Understandably so, but still, there is much newer knowledge out there: you might want to start with newer material such as the ones in the first paragraph."

I guess, I am not too kin of evolutionary psychology, which has a perfect excuse for just about any amoral behavior, as well as a vaguely noble explanation for all the positive traits. The spiritual being in me inclines to believe, that we have moral standards because a part of us, that tiny, yet undiscovered by the science particle of the SOUL, is connected by the source of knowledge and infinity far greater than we can ever imagine? while being caught in the physical realm. May be I should try to listen to the audio-book once again, because, honestly, I skipped a few chapters, finding them somewhat boring and repeating what had already been explained.

26,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14012525-martti,4,Middle piece is a weird meta-analysis of Darwin through his own theory of natural selection. And the author kinda wanders around a lot which might leave the reader wondering where the focus might be. But there are several great parts to be read again. Like the further explnation of Dawkins' Selfish Gene and other interesting conclusions from evolutionary psychology. I just wish there was more focus on this aspect and less detours.
27,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8338351-judith,4,"Not quite what I expected but in a way so much more.I am interested in the genetic underpinnings of our moral codes. I know that there are evolutionary reasons that we think killing is wrong, that we believe it's best to treat others as we'd like to be treated. This kind of code is in the genes. It doesn't come from a religious book, although many religions would like to take the credit. In this book Wright explains ""evolutionary psychology"" in an interesting way. He offers theories on why it is in our best interest to behave certain ways. To be more specific, that would be why it is in the best interests of our bloodlines to behave in certain ways during the dawn of humankind. After all, humans have not changed a whole lot in thousands of years, so we need to look at what was necessary for survival of the species back in hunter-gatherer days.And thus we learn about the differences between the way males and females approach sex, the law of reciprocal altruism and how it extends past the immediate family, the role of social status in our actions, why we lie and deceive even ourselves. What makes this investigation even more interesting is that each topic is then applied to a human example: Charles Darwin. Darwin, as many know, was well known for his modesty and empathy, and for having a warm, loving personality. He was also plagued with frequent illnesses and depression. His life is well-documented, which provides a good basis for an evaluation of the man in relation to his psychological behaviors. Darwin figured out some evolutionary morality behaviors early on. Others were left for over 100 years to be picked up by other scientists.While I loved this book I found one aspect of it a little disturbing. I may have read it wrong, of course. I understood the chapters on ethics to suggest that essentially when a person is born into a certain culture he learns that culture's ethics. I do believe that, to an extent, this is true. But while I believe self-serving criminals find it easier to rob and steal than do those who had a more compassionate upbringing, I also believe that these criminals do know that what they are doing is ""wrong"" - not just illegal, but wrong. And I believe that certain behaviors are considered ""wrong"" in all cultures. There will always be psychopaths but apart from them humankind does appear to share some basic moral codes. And we get them in our genes.Nothing, of course, is all that simple. There is a lot of room for maneuver within ""human nature"". "
28,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/146594-m-j,4,"I finished Robert Wright's ""The Moral Animal: Why We Are The Way We Are"" yesterday, a look into the human mind through the perspective of evolutionary psychology. Wright is a deterministic Darwinist and firmly believes that the concept of free-will unfettered by the bounds of our species' evolutionary history is an illusion. Not just what we do and the forms of our social organizations have a root in the genes that were successful, but even elements as intangible and essential to our being as our perception of reality.The argument is compelling in parts--in the early chapters I was swept up in the writing, devouring each page--but the writing bogs down in points that left me with a sense of the density of the 500-page book. It would also be accurate to describe it as two different books built on a central theme of evolutionary psychology and tied together by the author's own telling of Darwin's life.The first three-quarters of the book is about the impact of evolution on our psychology. This is where the book shines. It examines the behaviour of the human animal--it's social and sexual structure, it's tendencies, it's common elements across cultures--and what advantage such tendencies had in order to thrive and conquer over the genetic code of those without such tendencies. Though he writes with an air of authority, not every argument is convincing--he is looking at the end result and trying to work backwards afterall--but there is more than a sense of its possibility.The last part of the book is a philosophical tract. If our genetic selfishness is so ingrained as to alter our self-perceptions, does it mean that we are destined to be slaves to an animal side of our nature? No. He argues we can overcome our own self-serving bias . This section, though necessary, was overly long and I didn't get a sense that the author was fully convinced, perhaps spending too much time with his own sense of environmental and genetic determinism to believe that society at large could move beyond being a moral animal to being just moral.Conclusion: Moderately Recommended. While it does not feel like a breezy read--I keep coming back to the word dense--it's definitely worth the time (especially for the early sections)."
29,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,4,"I liked this take on the selfish gene, namely the author's presentation of the new Darwinian paradigm and his speculations on human (im)morality through tidbits from Darwin's biography. On the other hand, too much attention was paid to the Victorian morality and the book left me wanting a deeper analysis of the contemporary trends. Overall, this was an interesting and entertaining read. I didn't find it captivating, though, and my first thought was to give it 3 stars. What made me opt for 4 stars were the following two remarks:«No doctrine heightens one's consciousness of hidden selfishness more acutely than the new Darwinian paradigm. If you understand the doctrine, buy the doctrine, and apply the doctrine, you will spend your life in deep suspicion of your motives.»«Some people worry that the new Darwinian paradigm will strip their lives of all nobility. If love of children is just defense of our DNA, if helping a friend is just payment for services rendered, if compassion for the downtrodden is just bargain-hunting — then what is there to be proud of? One answer is: Darwin-like behavior. Go above and beyond the call of a smoothly functioning conscience; help those who aren't likely to help you in return, and do so when nobody's watching. This is one way to be a truly moral animal. Now, in the light of the new paradigm, we can see how hard this is, how right Samuel Smiles was to say that the good life is a battle against ""moral ignorance, selfishness, and vice""; these are indeed the enemies, and they are tenacious by design.»"
30,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3558148-bob-pearson,4,"Evolutionary psychology speculates widely (some say wildly) about the origins of human behavior. It has come under fire on the grounds that its presumptions are assumptions not facts since much of its logic is based on what is not observable: the development of the human mind before history. The immense spectrum of human behavior makes it impossible to draw unquestionable links in many cases. Moreover, some evolutionary psychologists have tried to explain male dominance and even rape on the controlling power of genes. All that said, Robin Wright gives us an intriguing argument that accepts the selfishness of early humans as the trigger to actual unselfishness through interactions of mutual benefit among humans that also provide increased prestige and influence to the players. His approach outflanks the obstacle posed by previous narratives that insisted on confrontation between prehistoric human development and more modern societal development. Wright goes so far as to posit that ""brotherly love"" need have no religious inspiration but is a natural evolution of human behavior in groups. Hard to grasp sometimes and easy to criticize in places, his approach nevertheless offers an optimistic view of human development that might be worth serious attention. "

I only started to fully appreciate this book after I realized it was not a science book for non-scientist, but rather a philosophy book for non-philosophers.The author coherently ties together through an overriding narrative on our human psychology and moral development. While I've listened to most of the more recent books on the same topic from various authors (Dawkins, Diamond, Pinker, Gazzaniga, Wilson,Kahneman, and Ridley) available on Audible, none of them tied together the story as well as this book and make you feel the philosophical implications of the theory of evolutionary psychology.The book is dated (copyright 1994) but not out of date. Most of the stories told in the book I've heard versions of them in the more recent books. That's not a fault of the book. It's just that I read this book (in 2012) after having read the other books.I enjoyed this book so much that after listening I started listening to his other book, ""Nonzero"".Warning: this book has the ability to make you reassess you place in the universe and become more interested in philosophy.

I had been reading a lot about genes, evolution, etc. and was really curios about evolutionary psychology when I started to read this. Unfortunately Wright's book was very unfocused. He uses Darwin's personal life and story as a sort of thread holding the book toghether, which might sound great if you like evolution and Darwin. Unfortunately it mostly seems like he used Darwin's fame and speculated about his personal life to further his own ideas, which feels a bit cheap. Thus with this foundation he unsmoothly mixes stories about how Christian Darwin's wife was with unconvincing theories about the evolutionary background of rape. (To be clear I do think there's very possibly some evolutionary background to rape, but his account is very one sided basically claiming that a Victorian society was really nice for the ladies because less rape in the upper class or something. It didn't cut it for me.)There are plenty of interesting evolutionary psychology books in the world unfortunately this was not one of them. "

Spicing up the book is a parallel thread that supports its evolutionary psychology conclusions with examples from Darwin's own personal life.

However, if you've comfortable with the subtleties of the term ""selfish"" in ""The Selfish Gene"" you will find the first half repetitive and the second half overly hand-wavy, vague and unconvincing. Final recommendation: Go ahead if you'd like a quick intro to evolution and its effects on our minds. Expect to be tickled by arguments, but ultimately unconvinced of anything."

What really sets this book apart is that the author uses Darwin's life -- his bio to explain Evolutionary Psychology to explain why we do what we do.

41,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"Wright describes the perspectives of evolutionary biologists over a hundred years, from Darwin to the late 20th century, who research human behavior. From an American reader's perspective (Wright is also American), this discourse seemed to be ""pre-9/11,"" and indeed (upon my check of the front pages) it was published in 1994. Reading it in 2020 feels already like a mini time-warp. It's tricky to pinpoint exactly why it doesn't get at 21st century concerns. Partly, it's because the first 150 pages focus on monogamy, reproduction, and marriage in a way that seems like an indirect, coded response to what was then an American national debate over same-sex marriage, a response that somehow managed simultaneously to avoid the acknowledgment that gay people exist. (Wright worked for the New Republic, which was at that time edited by a gay man who was politically conservative, and talking about the gays without really quite involving the gays is how I've always understood that magazine.) And partly, it seems old because it is old. It was published a quarter-century ago, and the science is already a bit dated. Written at the moment just before the Big Bang of cell phones and Internet transformed American culture, the book's discussion of social behavior and our concern with social status is missing our usual contemporary reference points. Thus the Economist's blurb on the paperback — ""destined to become a classic"" — may have been a bit premature, in my view. Not entirely the fault of the book, but more the fault of the year 1994: a reflection on how rapidly the world, and our understanding of it, is changing.The first and longest part is about sex between men and women, in which Wright argues that monogamy is unnatural. (The word ""homosexual"" only appears twice in this part, and then only to describe ""mistaken homosexual courtship"" among frogs and ""periodic homosexual behavior"" among bonobos that is supposedly ""a way of saying, 'Let's be friends.'"") The second part is about reciprocal altruism. The third part is about how we use these behaviors to negotiate our social status. The fourth part is about how this awareness can result in ""a self-consciousness so acute, and a cynicism so deep, that ironic detachment from the whole human enterprise may provide the only relief,"" raising the question of whether ""the word moral can be anything but a joke."" There is a paradox at the heart of the question of whether humans are basically good: ""To be moral animals, we must realize how thoroughly we aren't."" To me, this echoes a critique of the logical inconsistency in the idea of God's omnibenevolence — to be good is to spot errors and continually self-improve, which you can't do if you're already perfect. Yes, humans are inherently moral, in the sense that we are motivated (both consciously and unconsciously) to continually adjust our behavior. The part that is conscious is arguably, by definition, not natural. Its content transcends its natural origin.It's a clear, easily readable introduction to the scientific concept that traits evolve because they benefit survival and reproduction. The book describes how, for a social species like humans, altruistic behavior can evolve (because altruistic acts support the group's survival while enhancing the altruistic individual's reputation within the group). I may have picked this book up as an undergraduate or even as a high school student; it is underlined, apparently by a student who may have been me. It may still serve people who want this introductory material. If you're already clear on this concept, you may want a more scientifically up-to-date book with a more specific thesis."
42,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1579132-christopher,3,"Fascinating and dense. Wright discusses how an evolutionary model can explain human instincts and behavior. Importantly, he doesn't dictate that our behavior isn't changeable, nor that evolutionary results dictate what our moral code should be.My favorite parts were applying these general rules to Darwin's own biography. Darwin was extremely moral and kind. I also very much enjoyed the last quarter, where he discusses J.S. Mill's utilitarianism as the author's moral philosophy of choice. It was fun, because ""Origin of the Species"" and Mill's ""On Liberty"" were both published in 1859.In the first half, Wright thoroughly examines humanity's sexual instincts. For biology, this makes sense, as all biology is understood through reproductive behavior. Although the author did emphasize the fallacy of mixing the ""is"" for the ""ought"", he also characterized his book as a quasi-self-help. The ought comes through with the last quarter discussing Mill, but the first third needed more ""is"". Case in point, humans (both sexes, but men more) instinctively cheat on their spouses, and there was an evolutionary advantage to doing so. He fails to convince that this isn't an ""ought"", by never quite giving adequate description of how a successful monogamous marriage works, given our evolutionary instincts.I really loved his discussion of human hierarchy. All tribes and cultures exhibit this tendency. It is the cause of so much human strife, competition, wars, and destruction. But it also motivates us with ambition and creativity. We are also adept at figuring out our pecking order. Better to learn it through a signal, than taking the costly route to duking it out to verify it. Our yearn to be on top, is also easy to describe evolutionary. The male who was on top, mated with the most females, thus sending those ambitious genes forward.One last fascinating story. Some squirrels, upon seeing a predator, will yelp and freeze up, causing the predator to hear him, catch him, and eat him. How could this be evolutionary advantageous? Because their siblings (who share a huge amount of the same genes), will be preserved by the sacrificial yelper. Thus, those genes are repeated along. Evolution doesn't care about individuals, it only cares about one thing: repeating genes. This type of sacrificial response, explains why we are more willing to sacrifice ourselves, the closer the kin. The further away they are related, the less our genes will be in common, the lower our willingness to sacrifice ourselves. Not that this process is consciously driven; genes don't think.Again, the book was interesting and dense. The second half stronger than the first half. I'd be really interested to see where the science has lead since his writing it in the early 1990's."
43,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54518540-cam-lidstone,4,"Robert Wright's The Moral Animal was one of the much-talked-about books on evolutionary psychology in the 1990s along with Ridley's The Red Queen and The Origins of Virtue, Pinker's How the Mind Works, and Tooby and Cosmides' The Adapted Mind.The book comprehensively and accessibly lays out an understanding of the evolution of human's moral sentiments. Wright's a clear writer who manages to convey the importance of Darwin and his theory of natural selection while maintaining an irreverence and wit. I wasn't fully on board with Wright's conceit: alternating between explanations of evolutionary logic and brief snippets of Darwin's life (explained through the lens of evolutionary psychology). The case studies are too anecdotal and there are better Darwin biographies elsewhere. Wright excels when he communicates and recognises the importance of the work of the eminent evolutionary biologists George C Williams, William D Hamilton, Robert Trivers, and John Maynard Smith.Their collective work, which was popularised in the mid-70s via Dawkins' The Selfish Gene and E.O. Wilson's Sociobiology, sets the foundation of a scientific understanding of the human condition. Their key insights help explain five key relationships: males and females (unequal levels of parental investment and thus differing sexual strategies); parents and their children and siblings with each other (parental-offspring conflict); friends and acquaintances (reciprocal altruism); and people's relationship with themselves (self-deception). I recommend this book to people who know the basics of evolution but you can skip the chapters on Darwin. If you are completely new to the evolution, the best entry points are insteaed probably Dawkins and Gould."

He thought: This is what I should feel all the time for everyone.…""—Graham Greene, The Power and the GloryThe moment I started reading about evolutionary psychology, it was a massive revelation for me. It was the beginning of an understanding of a field, that would have spared me much relief from the pain, confusion, and guilt that stemmed from my many quirks as a human being. It provided for the first time, a reason why, I was the way I was. As a computer programmer, it showed me how I had been programmed: evolution, and revealed the programmer: natural selection.This is in essence, an instruction manual for oneself. It attempts to explain our behaviors, motivations, and personality in the realm of our extremely subjective, anthropocentric world, and in doing so, it becomes clear just how strong the case for evolutionary psychology is. As illuminating as it is, it is also a harsh manual. Many will claim that it deromanticizes much of what is noble, and beautiful about human nature, but it does more to demystify, and explain. These new findings can be demoralizing, and difficult to accept, but it is the truth. This is something that Charles Darwin himself was well aware of, and tactfully left out in ""The Origin of Species,"" and simply suggested (towards the end of the book,) a Darwinian view of human psychology in the future, “light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.”Why was it such a revelation? On a personal level, it provided explanations about my heartbreaks, relationships, and love. It was also the first time I realized there was a solid science to understanding people. Almost everything we do revolves around other people, and I had stumbled on a blueprint of their character.“Lasting love is something a person has to decide to experience. Lifelong monogamous devotion is just not natural—not for women even, and emphatically not for men. It requires what, for lack of a better term, we can call an act of will. . . . This isn't to say that a young man can't hope to be seized by love. . . . But whether the sheer fury of a man's feelings accurately gauges their likely endurance is another question. The ardor will surely fade, sooner or later, and the marriage will then live or die on respect, practical compatibility, simple affection, and (these days, especially) determination. With the help of these things, something worthy of the label 'love' can last until death. But it will be a different kind of love from the kind that began the marriage. Will it be a richer love, a deeper love, a more spiritual love? Opinions vary. But it's certainly a more impressive love.”Evolutionary psychology has a long way ahead of itself, but it is the beginning of an understanding of the human mind. It has much potential for practical applications, and could one day provide law makers with a firm logical base when making decisions. Perhaps one day, it could lead to a scientific basis for morality. So far, for most of human history, moral philosophers have discussed morality with only an intuitive understanding of human nature, which is to say, the ""how:"" our behaviors, and motivations. Intuition may feel right, but it is hardly scientific. Now, unsuppressed by divine authority, we have an academic field that describes the ""why"" of human nature, and how can anyone claim ideals on how to act, before we realize our limitations as human beings?"

It explains nearly every human emotion and behaviour, the human institutions, morality, society and social status, our biases, why they are beneficial for us. The important point which the author states, is that if you know about your biological programming, you can eventually overcome it, understand yourself, others and social situations better and therefore make better decisions.It has revealed for me some ugly (by romantic or humanist standarts) truths about friendships, family and romantic relationships, but in the end it is a relief, to know the ""why"". "
52,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43622620-jessica,2,"I found the author's presentation of his case generally comprehensible, though perhaps unnecessarily long-winded, with a tendency to digress too far (IMO) into his examples (mostly drawn from Darwin's life).(I apologize in advance to any readers in the know, if my understanding of logical fallacies is imperfect...)He may be accurate in his conclusions. However, now I need to go read more on the topic, because his understanding of the new Darwinism seems to be based mostly on the work of two researchers, which seems a bit narrow to support his conclusions. (Does that constitute some form of formal- or informal- fallacy?)I don't entirely disagree with his conclusions (about human nature). And it's not the notion that we can't help what evolution has handed to us, that offends me; it's the author's solution to this seeming lack of control. In the final third of the book, I think he too readily dismisses unconscious evolutionary 'decision-making' as a basis for a moral code. I wouldn't use it as a basis for a moral code, either. But his reaction against it smacks of panic.I can think of a couple of possible explanations for this:1- He knows that if he doesn't take a position strongly against evolutionary biology as a basis for a moral code, people will assume he is for it.2- He has a personal horror of his own conclusions, and is consequently trying to smooth them over with an alternative (mainly the philosophy of utilitarianism, which seems to assume that there is (a) no moral difference between your family and anyone else, or (b) that it is not possible to be moral without an imposed morality (that includes utilitarianism)).Isn't there anyone knowledgeable on this subject, who simply presents the facts without assigning a value judgement to them??Also, the author apparently cannot tell the difference between logical and reasonable. That is, he extrapolates from the evidence he presents us with to what he thinks is a logical conclusion, but to an absurd degree (which is not reasonable). He seems to think that, since we are under the influence of our evolutionary past, we can't naturally be reasonable at all. Isn't that a form of reductio ad absurdum (sp?)?The ability to reason is part of what makes us human! (Or, if you will, it is part of what differentiates us from other bipeds.) So is the concept of a middle ground- i.e., it's not either all one conclusion or all one other. (Oh God- false dilemma! Argh!)Stopped with 36 pages left to go, because I couldn't bring myself to finish it. The text is way too biased, and not in favor of humanity as he understands it."
53,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57956231-ailith-twinning,1,"Would have been better if it had just been a biography of Darwin, I really felt his admiration while reading those parts and enjoyed the vicarious experience of his feeling. I'm not qualified to critique Evolutionary Psychology - so I won't. The obviously nuts stuff speaks for itself, and those actually in the field do a decent job kicking the authors of that crap in the ass. Now, if only they could manage to get economists banned from writing in the field at all. And, for a philosophical critique, turn to (good) feminist and anti-racist authors. Also Post-Modernist critique which is more a philosophy of why some practitioners apply the scientific method wrongly than the popular conversation about some anti-science theory. This critique applies at least triply for economists skimming the field (to mix metaphors). But what really irked me was the closing stuff -- One of the less common interpretations of Utilitarianism gets, not only acknowledged, but endorsed, only for Wright to then use some seriously half-assed moral conservatism to defend perverting the philosophy into a compromise between its worst interpretations (The USSR, Third Reich, British Empire, and American Empire as various examples) and its actual implications (frankly, Socialism). So you get some kind of messy Meritocracy, right after you (correctly) point out that ""Merit"" is a question wrongly put. It's certainly my personal position that leads to it, but the wretched attempt to justify a torturous prison state (""make the world safe for blame"", as the saying goes) was just the final straw for me, and sufficiently direct to render even the most generous interpretation a fully unacceptable argument. And, if the philosophy is not something the book may be justly judged as a whole for - then why is it there? More to the point, it should not be there, if the purpose is not precisely to frame what came before. So, the explicitly philosophical section is the last straw before generosity must end, and the book fall under the strain of its shitty philosophy -- or its just another bit of bad thoughts in a long chain of (disjointed) bad thoughts, interspersed with some admirably genuine gushing about an idol (Darwin)."
54,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1098316-jamie,3,"Using the writings of Charles Darwin to deliver its human morality principles, I felt by the end of this book that I had learnt more about the great man than I had about myself. One problem with this book is that by centering on life in the 19th century, its themes were often not as relevant to society today. For instance, it may be advantageous for women to play a little harder to get in the game of love, but this is unlikely to have a significant implication towards social status today. Another example, families are unlikely to favor a child simply because they have a greater chance of moving up in socioeconomic circles. I further disagreed with the premise that each person has no free will, we may all inherit a certain instinct, but an instinct does not define our actions in their entirety. Some underlying truths in this book are thought provoking. Man is not intended to be monogomous, but such cultural norms likely maintain social cohesion by allowing a more equal pairing of men and women. We are rarely content with the present and constantly focused on status signals and self aggrandizement, hence, our morals are essentially innate feelings driven by selfish goals, which require constant self-reflection and scepticism to control. This is also a singificant reason why all major religious have the same central themes, which have been considered necessary to guide our innate morals towards the promotion of social harmony.Charles Darwin said this in 1882, and to me it is the key message I will take out of the book: ""As man advances in civilisation, and small tribes are united to larger communities, the simplest reason would tell each individual that he ought to extend his social instincts and sympathies to all the members of the same nation, though personally unkown to him. This point being once reached, there is only an aftifical barrier to prevent his sympathies extending to the men of all nations and races."" Humanity will continue to evolve and our success is dependent on the ability to empathize with all life on this planet.  "
55,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5817744-emma-b,3,"I'm about 100 pages in, and the material is quite fascinating. The book basically links every single trait of humanity back to an adaptation in the ancestral environment.I just wish he'd stop personifying natural selection.Correction, deifying.That kinda defeats the purpose of science.-------------Upon finishing the book, my final opinion is that it was decent, but not fantastic. His deification of the process of natural selection trailed off, much to my relief. The book itself consisted mostly of references and quotes to previous studies, with little interjection by the author, but it was nice to have all that data in one place and in a logical order. The concept of reciprocal altruism, by which humans develop societies, relationships, and most of our higher emotions, was quite interesting, even if a bit common-sensical. It was explained, if perhaps to death, very well, and was easy to understand.The chapters concerning Darwin himself I found to be less than interesting. Many times, the author decided to stray far into the depths of biography, leading us through the childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and finally death of Charles Darwin himself. These chapters were sprinkled with psychological notes with either no apparent relevance or no apparent basis. I found myself leafing quickly through them, hoping to skip past the psych profile of a long-dead man and return to the science.The final chapter, I believe, had no real reason to exist, or at least not to be as long as it was. It was the conclusion, a summation and review of the ideas covered in the book, which didn't number very many, and it made up about 1/5th of the whole book's length. It seemed simply unnecessary. A nice, ten-page abstract and a 'how this info could be used' section I think would have been a much nicer way to end the book.All in all, it was alright, though not nearly as educational as I'd hoped. I've walked away with some new vocab and a basal understanding of this branch of psychology though, which means it wasn't a waste."
56,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17983541-sam,2,"I thought there were some interesting ideas in this book (particularly the suggestion that awareness of the evolutionary roots of behaviour can guide morality by making us conscious of biases and types of reactions that are ill-suited to modern industrial life), but for me there was also one significant flaw: Going by this book, it seems that Wright thinks natural selection shaped humankind predominantly by acting on men. His discussion of women in evolution relates mostly to the Madonna-whore dichotomy, and an odd diversion in which he argues that polygamy should be embraced by feminists because it means more women can choose to marry a high-status man, getting more resources as one of several wives than they might as the single wife of a lower status man. Even when discussing issues unrelated to sex, our male ancestors apparently were the key to evolutionary changes. For example, on p285: 'Feelings of enmity, of grievance, of righteous indignation - of collective enmity and grievance and righteous indignation - probably have their deepest roots in ancient conflicts within bands of humans and pre-humans. In particular: in conflicts among coalitions of males for status.' (What, because female humans and pre-humans never felt group loyalty or righteous indignation?). Another example: in the index, there are 12 topics listed under 'male parental investment,' whereas 'female parental investment' isn't even listed (there is, however, an entry for 'feminism - sexual symmetry as doctrine of'). Based on the assumption that natural selection operates on ALL members of a species, I can't help but doubt the accuracy of at least some of Wright's ideas, given that he seems so focused on only half of the ancestral pool."
57,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51128101-amanda,3,"First of all, I fully acknowledge that this book was outside of my comfort zone as a reader. I do enjoy nonfiction and even the occasional scientific book, but those “sciencey” books are usually about the non-human natural world. Astronomy, for instance, or botany. Furthermore, I have something of a background in sociology, so reading a book that favors biological rather than social explanations for human behavior was a bit difficult for me. That said, I found Wright’s book to be a good primer on evolutionary psychology. As a total newcomer to the field, I never felt completely out of my depth. A bit skeptical from time to time, but not nearly as much as I expected. I think Wright does a good job, not only of conveying the information, but of making it understandable as well. To be entirely fair, I can’t say how accurate the information or its usage is because, as I said, I’m a novice here. My biggest issue was probably Wright’s tactic of anthropomorphizing natural selection: it “wants” this, it designed us to do that. I see how this could be a valid explanatory tactic, but it just ended up making me have to reread and rethink. Something else, more a personal gripe than anything else, is that, when the book talks about sexual attraction/relationships/etc., it’s exclusively heterosexual. As a lesbian, I found myself wondering throughout the book, “But what about the queers?” In the FAQ section at the back of my copy, Wright acknowledges the subject, but mostly brushes it off, essentially saying, “It doesn’t really matter how natural it is; some people are gay and, morally, I think that should be the end of the discussion.” And, like, that’s great, dude. But that’s not what I asked. Overall, I found the book pretty much understandable, but just not that engrossing. "
58,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,1,"Confused book. It seems to be a blend of something called evolutionary psychology, a biography of Charles Darwin and an argument for returning to Victorian morals. As such the book is often slow and confused. These three strands are interweaved and frankly, become uninteresting as the book goes along. The writing is often repetitive, saying the same things about natural selection over and over for example. The analysis is not great either…the author touts something called evolutionary psychology which he doesn’t convince me exists. I think of psychology as being culture and social related…evolution is entirely biological…yes, we have feeling, but they’re shaped by chemistry and biology. How we view these feelings is psychology which, outside of neurology is a social construct. I found the biography of Darwin distracting and detracting…if I wanted to read a biography of Darwin, there are full length better books out there. Lastly, if I wanted to read about why we should return to Victorian morals, there are better arguments and books which focus on the society not biology. In short, I wanted to read a book about the science of evolutionary psychology not a political polemic or a biography. The latter wasn’t even convincingly argued and so I’m not just disappointed, I’m disgusted I spent money on this book. So, I give this a 1. It fails in every respect. It can’t even convince me that evolutionary psychology is a thing and the rest of the book is just filler and a waste of the reader’s time. "
59,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"This is the most fluent, starting from scratch book on the subject of evolution I have read. There is no presupposition of prior knowledge. And the author makes good use of popular notions of the Darwinian theory to throw light on understandings that are wrong, answer those common questions most of us have in mind and explain the real meaning of evolution.Unlike Dawkins' books which are turgid at times because of too many examples from the behaviours of species of various kind (most of those species that non-experts have never heard of) , Wright mostly uses the life of Darwin himself to make many points. This appears odd for a theory that explicitly warns against the use of specifics, the approach works. It also helps that evolution is explained more from the viewpoint of where humanity has reached today than any other notions.Some of the conclusions are outrageous, particularly when they give genetic inevitability to morally/socially reprehensible behaviour. Equally, many conclusions - like in Freudian theories that the author so vehemently criticises - seem to be derived from highly glib, flimsily proven verbal/logical ""must be/could be"" rationales. Perhaps these things are inevitable without the quantified edifices of physical sciences, but they also prove to be the reasons behind relatively less acceptance of almost all the finer points of evolutionary theories."
60,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3558148-bob-pearson,4,"Evolutionary psychology speculates widely (some say wildly) about the origins of human behavior. It has come under fire on the grounds that its presumptions are assumptions not facts since much of its logic is based on what is not observable: the development of the human mind before history. The immense spectrum of human behavior makes it impossible to draw unquestionable links in many cases. Moreover, some evolutionary psychologists have tried to explain male dominance and even rape on the controlling power of genes. All that said, Robin Wright gives us an intriguing argument that accepts the selfishness of early humans as the trigger to actual unselfishness through interactions of mutual benefit among humans that also provide increased prestige and influence to the players. His approach outflanks the obstacle posed by previous narratives that insisted on confrontation between prehistoric human development and more modern societal development. Wright goes so far as to posit that ""brotherly love"" need have no religious inspiration but is a natural evolution of human behavior in groups. Hard to grasp sometimes and easy to criticize in places, his approach nevertheless offers an optimistic view of human development that might be worth serious attention. "

I only started to fully appreciate this book after I realized it was not a science book for non-scientist, but rather a philosophy book for non-philosophers.The author coherently ties together through an overriding narrative on our human psychology and moral development. While I've listened to most of the more recent books on the same topic from various authors (Dawkins, Diamond, Pinker, Gazzaniga, Wilson,Kahneman, and Ridley) available on Audible, none of them tied together the story as well as this book and make you feel the philosophical implications of the theory of evolutionary psychology.The book is dated (copyright 1994) but not out of date. Most of the stories told in the book I've heard versions of them in the more recent books. That's not a fault of the book. It's just that I read this book (in 2012) after having read the other books.I enjoyed this book so much that after listening I started listening to his other book, ""Nonzero"".Warning: this book has the ability to make you reassess you place in the universe and become more interested in philosophy.

I had been reading a lot about genes, evolution, etc. and was really curios about evolutionary psychology when I started to read this. Unfortunately Wright's book was very unfocused. He uses Darwin's personal life and story as a sort of thread holding the book toghether, which might sound great if you like evolution and Darwin. Unfortunately it mostly seems like he used Darwin's fame and speculated about his personal life to further his own ideas, which feels a bit cheap. Thus with this foundation he unsmoothly mixes stories about how Christian Darwin's wife was with unconvincing theories about the evolutionary background of rape. (To be clear I do think there's very possibly some evolutionary background to rape, but his account is very one sided basically claiming that a Victorian society was really nice for the ladies because less rape in the upper class or something. It didn't cut it for me.)There are plenty of interesting evolutionary psychology books in the world unfortunately this was not one of them. "

However, if you've comfortable with the subtleties of the term ""selfish"" in ""The Selfish Gene"" you will find the first half repetitive and the second half overly hand-wavy, vague and unconvincing. Final recommendation: Go ahead if you'd like a quick intro to evolution and its effects on our minds. Expect to be tickled by arguments, but ultimately unconvinced of anything."

What really sets this book apart is that the author uses Darwin's life -- his bio to explain Evolutionary Psychology to explain why we do what we do.

71,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"Wright describes the perspectives of evolutionary biologists over a hundred years, from Darwin to the late 20th century, who research human behavior. From an American reader's perspective (Wright is also American), this discourse seemed to be ""pre-9/11,"" and indeed (upon my check of the front pages) it was published in 1994. Reading it in 2020 feels already like a mini time-warp. It's tricky to pinpoint exactly why it doesn't get at 21st century concerns. Partly, it's because the first 150 pages focus on monogamy, reproduction, and marriage in a way that seems like an indirect, coded response to what was then an American national debate over same-sex marriage, a response that somehow managed simultaneously to avoid the acknowledgment that gay people exist. (Wright worked for the New Republic, which was at that time edited by a gay man who was politically conservative, and talking about the gays without really quite involving the gays is how I've always understood that magazine.) And partly, it seems old because it is old. It was published a quarter-century ago, and the science is already a bit dated. Written at the moment just before the Big Bang of cell phones and Internet transformed American culture, the book's discussion of social behavior and our concern with social status is missing our usual contemporary reference points. Thus the Economist's blurb on the paperback — ""destined to become a classic"" — may have been a bit premature, in my view. Not entirely the fault of the book, but more the fault of the year 1994: a reflection on how rapidly the world, and our understanding of it, is changing.The first and longest part is about sex between men and women, in which Wright argues that monogamy is unnatural. (The word ""homosexual"" only appears twice in this part, and then only to describe ""mistaken homosexual courtship"" among frogs and ""periodic homosexual behavior"" among bonobos that is supposedly ""a way of saying, 'Let's be friends.'"") The second part is about reciprocal altruism. The third part is about how we use these behaviors to negotiate our social status. The fourth part is about how this awareness can result in ""a self-consciousness so acute, and a cynicism so deep, that ironic detachment from the whole human enterprise may provide the only relief,"" raising the question of whether ""the word moral can be anything but a joke."" There is a paradox at the heart of the question of whether humans are basically good: ""To be moral animals, we must realize how thoroughly we aren't."" To me, this echoes a critique of the logical inconsistency in the idea of God's omnibenevolence — to be good is to spot errors and continually self-improve, which you can't do if you're already perfect. Yes, humans are inherently moral, in the sense that we are motivated (both consciously and unconsciously) to continually adjust our behavior. The part that is conscious is arguably, by definition, not natural. Its content transcends its natural origin.It's a clear, easily readable introduction to the scientific concept that traits evolve because they benefit survival and reproduction. The book describes how, for a social species like humans, altruistic behavior can evolve (because altruistic acts support the group's survival while enhancing the altruistic individual's reputation within the group). I may have picked this book up as an undergraduate or even as a high school student; it is underlined, apparently by a student who may have been me. It may still serve people who want this introductory material. If you're already clear on this concept, you may want a more scientifically up-to-date book with a more specific thesis."
72,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1579132-christopher,3,"Fascinating and dense. Wright discusses how an evolutionary model can explain human instincts and behavior. Importantly, he doesn't dictate that our behavior isn't changeable, nor that evolutionary results dictate what our moral code should be.My favorite parts were applying these general rules to Darwin's own biography. Darwin was extremely moral and kind. I also very much enjoyed the last quarter, where he discusses J.S. Mill's utilitarianism as the author's moral philosophy of choice. It was fun, because ""Origin of the Species"" and Mill's ""On Liberty"" were both published in 1859.In the first half, Wright thoroughly examines humanity's sexual instincts. For biology, this makes sense, as all biology is understood through reproductive behavior. Although the author did emphasize the fallacy of mixing the ""is"" for the ""ought"", he also characterized his book as a quasi-self-help. The ought comes through with the last quarter discussing Mill, but the first third needed more ""is"". Case in point, humans (both sexes, but men more) instinctively cheat on their spouses, and there was an evolutionary advantage to doing so. He fails to convince that this isn't an ""ought"", by never quite giving adequate description of how a successful monogamous marriage works, given our evolutionary instincts.I really loved his discussion of human hierarchy. All tribes and cultures exhibit this tendency. It is the cause of so much human strife, competition, wars, and destruction. But it also motivates us with ambition and creativity. We are also adept at figuring out our pecking order. Better to learn it through a signal, than taking the costly route to duking it out to verify it. Our yearn to be on top, is also easy to describe evolutionary. The male who was on top, mated with the most females, thus sending those ambitious genes forward.One last fascinating story. Some squirrels, upon seeing a predator, will yelp and freeze up, causing the predator to hear him, catch him, and eat him. How could this be evolutionary advantageous? Because their siblings (who share a huge amount of the same genes), will be preserved by the sacrificial yelper. Thus, those genes are repeated along. Evolution doesn't care about individuals, it only cares about one thing: repeating genes. This type of sacrificial response, explains why we are more willing to sacrifice ourselves, the closer the kin. The further away they are related, the less our genes will be in common, the lower our willingness to sacrifice ourselves. Not that this process is consciously driven; genes don't think.Again, the book was interesting and dense. The second half stronger than the first half.

73,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54518540-cam-lidstone,4,"Robert Wright's The Moral Animal was one of the much-talked-about books on evolutionary psychology in the 1990s along with Ridley's The Red Queen and The Origins of Virtue, Pinker's How the Mind Works, and Tooby and Cosmides' The Adapted Mind.The book comprehensively and accessibly lays out an understanding of the evolution of human's moral sentiments. Wright's a clear writer who manages to convey the importance of Darwin and his theory of natural selection while maintaining an irreverence and wit. I wasn't fully on board with Wright's conceit: alternating between explanations of evolutionary logic and brief snippets of Darwin's life (explained through the lens of evolutionary psychology). The case studies are too anecdotal and there are better Darwin biographies elsewhere. Wright excels when he communicates and recognises the importance of the work of the eminent evolutionary biologists George C Williams, William D Hamilton, Robert Trivers, and John Maynard Smith.Their collective work, which was popularised in the mid-70s via Dawkins' The Selfish Gene and E.O. Wilson's Sociobiology, sets the foundation of a scientific understanding of the human condition. Their key insights help explain five key relationships: males and females (unequal levels of parental investment and thus differing sexual strategies); parents and their children and siblings with each other (parental-offspring conflict); friends and acquaintances (reciprocal altruism); and people's relationship with themselves (self-deception). I recommend this book to people who know the basics of evolution but you can skip the chapters on Darwin. If you are completely new to the evolution, the best entry points are insteaed probably Dawkins and Gould."

But it was illumating even if 25 years old. I got my questions answered: why are siblings so different from one another? why do people choose to have no children? Why do people commit suicide? Why do people commit infanticide? Why do soldiers die for their country? What about homosexuals? I was totally captivated by the topic of behavioral genetics .... which before this book I was unaware that the topic existed! So now I'm off to read about that specific part of our human makeup!

He thought: This is what I should feel all the time for everyone.…""—Graham Greene, The Power and the GloryThe moment I started reading about evolutionary psychology, it was a massive revelation for me. It was the beginning of an understanding of a field, that would have spared me much relief from the pain, confusion, and guilt that stemmed from my many quirks as a human being. It provided for the first time, a reason why, I was the way I was. As a computer programmer, it showed me how I had been programmed: evolution, and revealed the programmer: natural selection.This is in essence, an instruction manual for oneself. It attempts to explain our behaviors, motivations, and personality in the realm of our extremely subjective, anthropocentric world, and in doing so, it becomes clear just how strong the case for evolutionary psychology is. As illuminating as it is, it is also a harsh manual. Many will claim that it deromanticizes much of what is noble, and beautiful about human nature, but it does more to demystify, and explain. These new findings can be demoralizing, and difficult to accept, but it is the truth. This is something that Charles Darwin himself was well aware of, and tactfully left out in ""The Origin of Species,"" and simply suggested (towards the end of the book,) a Darwinian view of human psychology in the future, “light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.”Why was it such a revelation? On a personal level, it provided explanations about my heartbreaks, relationships, and love. It was also the first time I realized there was a solid science to understanding people. Almost everything we do revolves around other people, and I had stumbled on a blueprint of their character.“Lasting love is something a person has to decide to experience. Lifelong monogamous devotion is just not natural—not for women even, and emphatically not for men. It requires what, for lack of a better term, we can call an act of will. . . . This isn't to say that a young man can't hope to be seized by love. . . . But whether the sheer fury of a man's feelings accurately gauges their likely endurance is another question. The ardor will surely fade, sooner or later, and the marriage will then live or die on respect, practical compatibility, simple affection, and (these days, especially) determination. With the help of these things, something worthy of the label 'love' can last until death. But it will be a different kind of love from the kind that began the marriage. Will it be a richer love, a deeper love, a more spiritual love? Opinions vary. But it's certainly a more impressive love.”Evolutionary psychology has a long way ahead of itself, but it is the beginning of an understanding of the human mind. It has much potential for practical applications, and could one day provide law makers with a firm logical base when making decisions. Perhaps one day, it could lead to a scientific basis for morality. So far, for most of human history, moral philosophers have discussed morality with only an intuitive understanding of human nature, which is to say, the ""how:"" our behaviors, and motivations. Intuition may feel right, but it is hardly scientific. Now, unsuppressed by divine authority, we have an academic field that describes the ""why"" of human nature, and how can anyone claim ideals on how to act, before we realize our limitations as human beings?"

It explains nearly every human emotion and behaviour, the human institutions, morality, society and social status, our biases, why they are beneficial for us. The important point which the author states, is that if you know about your biological programming, you can eventually overcome it, understand yourself, others and social situations better and therefore make better decisions.It has revealed for me some ugly (by romantic or humanist standarts) truths about friendships, family and romantic relationships, but in the end it is a relief, to know the ""why"". "
82,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43622620-jessica,2,"I found the author's presentation of his case generally comprehensible, though perhaps unnecessarily long-winded, with a tendency to digress too far (IMO) into his examples (mostly drawn from Darwin's life).(I apologize in advance to any readers in the know, if my understanding of logical fallacies is imperfect...)He may be accurate in his conclusions. However, now I need to go read more on the topic, because his understanding of the new Darwinism seems to be based mostly on the work of two researchers, which seems a bit narrow to support his conclusions. (Does that constitute some form of formal- or informal- fallacy?)I don't entirely disagree with his conclusions (about human nature). And it's not the notion that we can't help what evolution has handed to us, that offends me; it's the author's solution to this seeming lack of control. In the final third of the book, I think he too readily dismisses unconscious evolutionary 'decision-making' as a basis for a moral code. I wouldn't use it as a basis for a moral code, either. But his reaction against it smacks of panic.I can think of a couple of possible explanations for this:1- He knows that if he doesn't take a position strongly against evolutionary biology as a basis for a moral code, people will assume he is for it.2- He has a personal horror of his own conclusions, and is consequently trying to smooth them over with an alternative (mainly the philosophy of utilitarianism, which seems to assume that there is (a) no moral difference between your family and anyone else, or (b) that it is not possible to be moral without an imposed morality (that includes utilitarianism)).Isn't there anyone knowledgeable on this subject, who simply presents the facts without assigning a value judgement to them??Also, the author apparently cannot tell the difference between logical and reasonable. That is, he extrapolates from the evidence he presents us with to what he thinks is a logical conclusion, but to an absurd degree (which is not reasonable). He seems to think that, since we are under the influence of our evolutionary past, we can't naturally be reasonable at all. Isn't that a form of reductio ad absurdum (sp?)?The ability to reason is part of what makes us human! (Or, if you will, it is part of what differentiates us from other bipeds.) So is the concept of a middle ground- i.e., it's not either all one conclusion or all one other. (Oh God- false dilemma! Argh!)Stopped with 36 pages left to go, because I couldn't bring myself to finish it. The text is way too biased, and not in favor of humanity as he understands it."
83,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57956231-ailith-twinning,1,"Would have been better if it had just been a biography of Darwin, I really felt his admiration while reading those parts and enjoyed the vicarious experience of his feeling. I'm not qualified to critique Evolutionary Psychology - so I won't. The obviously nuts stuff speaks for itself, and those actually in the field do a decent job kicking the authors of that crap in the ass. Now, if only they could manage to get economists banned from writing in the field at all. And, for a philosophical critique, turn to (good) feminist and anti-racist authors. Also Post-Modernist critique which is more a philosophy of why some practitioners apply the scientific method wrongly than the popular conversation about some anti-science theory. This critique applies at least triply for economists skimming the field (to mix metaphors). But what really irked me was the closing stuff -- One of the less common interpretations of Utilitarianism gets, not only acknowledged, but endorsed, only for Wright to then use some seriously half-assed moral conservatism to defend perverting the philosophy into a compromise between its worst interpretations (The USSR, Third Reich, British Empire, and American Empire as various examples) and its actual implications (frankly, Socialism). So you get some kind of messy Meritocracy, right after you (correctly) point out that ""Merit"" is a question wrongly put. It's certainly my personal position that leads to it, but the wretched attempt to justify a torturous prison state (""make the world safe for blame"", as the saying goes) was just the final straw for me, and sufficiently direct to render even the most generous interpretation a fully unacceptable argument. And, if the philosophy is not something the book may be justly judged as a whole for - then why is it there? More to the point, it should not be there, if the purpose is not precisely to frame what came before. So, the explicitly philosophical section is the last straw before generosity must end, and the book fall under the strain of its shitty philosophy -- or its just another bit of bad thoughts in a long chain of (disjointed) bad thoughts, interspersed with some admirably genuine gushing about an idol (Darwin)."
84,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1098316-jamie,3,"Using the writings of Charles Darwin to deliver its human morality principles, I felt by the end of this book that I had learnt more about the great man than I had about myself. One problem with this book is that by centering on life in the 19th century, its themes were often not as relevant to society today. For instance, it may be advantageous for women to play a little harder to get in the game of love, but this is unlikely to have a significant implication towards social status today. Another example, families are unlikely to favor a child simply because they have a greater chance of moving up in socioeconomic circles. I further disagreed with the premise that each person has no free will, we may all inherit a certain instinct, but an instinct does not define our actions in their entirety. Some underlying truths in this book are thought provoking. Man is not intended to be monogomous, but such cultural norms likely maintain social cohesion by allowing a more equal pairing of men and women. We are rarely content with the present and constantly focused on status signals and self aggrandizement, hence, our morals are essentially innate feelings driven by selfish goals, which require constant self-reflection and scepticism to control. This is also a singificant reason why all major religious have the same central themes, which have been considered necessary to guide our innate morals towards the promotion of social harmony.Charles Darwin said this in 1882, and to me it is the key message I will take out of the book: ""As man advances in civilisation, and small tribes are united to larger communities, the simplest reason would tell each individual that he ought to extend his social instincts and sympathies to all the members of the same nation, though personally unkown to him. This point being once reached, there is only an aftifical barrier to prevent his sympathies extending to the men of all nations and races."" Humanity will continue to evolve and our success is dependent on the ability to empathize with all life on this planet.  "
85,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5817744-emma-b,3,"I'm about 100 pages in, and the material is quite fascinating. The book basically links every single trait of humanity back to an adaptation in the ancestral environment.I just wish he'd stop personifying natural selection.Correction, deifying.That kinda defeats the purpose of science.-------------Upon finishing the book, my final opinion is that it was decent, but not fantastic. His deification of the process of natural selection trailed off, much to my relief. The book itself consisted mostly of references and quotes to previous studies, with little interjection by the author, but it was nice to have all that data in one place and in a logical order. The concept of reciprocal altruism, by which humans develop societies, relationships, and most of our higher emotions, was quite interesting, even if a bit common-sensical. It was explained, if perhaps to death, very well, and was easy to understand.The chapters concerning Darwin himself I found to be less than interesting. Many times, the author decided to stray far into the depths of biography, leading us through the childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and finally death of Charles Darwin himself. These chapters were sprinkled with psychological notes with either no apparent relevance or no apparent basis. I found myself leafing quickly through them, hoping to skip past the psych profile of a long-dead man and return to the science.The final chapter, I believe, had no real reason to exist, or at least not to be as long as it was. It was the conclusion, a summation and review of the ideas covered in the book, which didn't number very many, and it made up about 1/5th of the whole book's length. It seemed simply unnecessary. A nice, ten-page abstract and a 'how this info could be used' section I think would have been a much nicer way to end the book.All in all, it was alright, though not nearly as educational as I'd hoped. I've walked away with some new vocab and a basal understanding of this branch of psychology though, which means it wasn't a waste."
86,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17983541-sam,2,"I thought there were some interesting ideas in this book (particularly the suggestion that awareness of the evolutionary roots of behaviour can guide morality by making us conscious of biases and types of reactions that are ill-suited to modern industrial life), but for me there was also one significant flaw: Going by this book, it seems that Wright thinks natural selection shaped humankind predominantly by acting on men. His discussion of women in evolution relates mostly to the Madonna-whore dichotomy, and an odd diversion in which he argues that polygamy should be embraced by feminists because it means more women can choose to marry a high-status man, getting more resources as one of several wives than they might as the single wife of a lower status man. Even when discussing issues unrelated to sex, our male ancestors apparently were the key to evolutionary changes. For example, on p285: 'Feelings of enmity, of grievance, of righteous indignation - of collective enmity and grievance and righteous indignation - probably have their deepest roots in ancient conflicts within bands of humans and pre-humans. In particular: in conflicts among coalitions of males for status.' (What, because female humans and pre-humans never felt group loyalty or righteous indignation?). Another example: in the index, there are 12 topics listed under 'male parental investment,' whereas 'female parental investment' isn't even listed (there is, however, an entry for 'feminism - sexual symmetry as doctrine of'). Based on the assumption that natural selection operates on ALL members of a species, I can't help but doubt the accuracy of at least some of Wright's ideas, given that he seems so focused on only half of the ancestral pool."
87,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51128101-amanda,3,"First of all, I fully acknowledge that this book was outside of my comfort zone as a reader. I do enjoy nonfiction and even the occasional scientific book, but those “sciencey” books are usually about the non-human natural world. Astronomy, for instance, or botany. Furthermore, I have something of a background in sociology, so reading a book that favors biological rather than social explanations for human behavior was a bit difficult for me. That said, I found Wright’s book to be a good primer on evolutionary psychology. As a total newcomer to the field, I never felt completely out of my depth. A bit skeptical from time to time, but not nearly as much as I expected. I think Wright does a good job, not only of conveying the information, but of making it understandable as well. To be entirely fair, I can’t say how accurate the information or its usage is because, as I said, I’m a novice here. My biggest issue was probably Wright’s tactic of anthropomorphizing natural selection: it “wants” this, it designed us to do that. I see how this could be a valid explanatory tactic, but it just ended up making me have to reread and rethink. Something else, more a personal gripe than anything else, is that, when the book talks about sexual attraction/relationships/etc., it’s exclusively heterosexual. As a lesbian, I found myself wondering throughout the book, “But what about the queers?” In the FAQ section at the back of my copy, Wright acknowledges the subject, but mostly brushes it off, essentially saying, “It doesn’t really matter how natural it is; some people are gay and, morally, I think that should be the end of the discussion.” And, like, that’s great, dude. But that’s not what I asked. Overall, I found the book pretty much understandable, but just not that engrossing. "
88,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,1,"Confused book. It seems to be a blend of something called evolutionary psychology, a biography of Charles Darwin and an argument for returning to Victorian morals. As such the book is often slow and confused. These three strands are interweaved and frankly, become uninteresting as the book goes along. The writing is often repetitive, saying the same things about natural selection over and over for example. The analysis is not great either…the author touts something called evolutionary psychology which he doesn’t convince me exists. I think of psychology as being culture and social related…evolution is entirely biological…yes, we have feeling, but they’re shaped by chemistry and biology. How we view these feelings is psychology which, outside of neurology is a social construct. I found the biography of Darwin distracting and detracting…if I wanted to read a biography of Darwin, there are full length better books out there. Lastly, if I wanted to read about why we should return to Victorian morals, there are better arguments and books which focus on the society not biology. In short, I wanted to read a book about the science of evolutionary psychology not a political polemic or a biography. The latter wasn’t even convincingly argued and so I’m not just disappointed, I’m disgusted I spent money on this book. So, I give this a 1. It fails in every respect. It can’t even convince me that evolutionary psychology is a thing and the rest of the book is just filler and a waste of the reader’s time. "
89,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"This is the most fluent, starting from scratch book on the subject of evolution I have read. There is no presupposition of prior knowledge. And the author makes good use of popular notions of the Darwinian theory to throw light on understandings that are wrong, answer those common questions most of us have in mind and explain the real meaning of evolution.Unlike Dawkins' books which are turgid at times because of too many examples from the behaviours of species of various kind (most of those species that non-experts have never heard of) , Wright mostly uses the life of Darwin himself to make many points. This appears odd for a theory that explicitly warns against the use of specifics, the approach works. It also helps that evolution is explained more from the viewpoint of where humanity has reached today than any other notions.Some of the conclusions are outrageous, particularly when they give genetic inevitability to morally/socially reprehensible behaviour. Equally, many conclusions - like in Freudian theories that the author so vehemently criticises - seem to be derived from highly glib, flimsily proven verbal/logical ""must be/could be"" rationales. Perhaps these things are inevitable without the quantified edifices of physical sciences, but they also prove to be the reasons behind relatively less acceptance of almost all the finer points of evolutionary theories."
90,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3558148-bob-pearson,4,"Evolutionary psychology speculates widely (some say wildly) about the origins of human behavior. It has come under fire on the grounds that its presumptions are assumptions not facts since much of its logic is based on what is not observable: the development of the human mind before history. The immense spectrum of human behavior makes it impossible to draw unquestionable links in many cases. Moreover, some evolutionary psychologists have tried to explain male dominance and even rape on the controlling power of genes. All that said, Robin Wright gives us an intriguing argument that accepts the selfishness of early humans as the trigger to actual unselfishness through interactions of mutual benefit among humans that also provide increased prestige and influence to the players. His approach outflanks the obstacle posed by previous narratives that insisted on confrontation between prehistoric human development and more modern societal development. Wright goes so far as to posit that ""brotherly love"" need have no religious inspiration but is a natural evolution of human behavior in groups. Hard to grasp sometimes and easy to criticize in places, his approach nevertheless offers an optimistic view of human development that might be worth serious attention. "

I only started to fully appreciate this book after I realized it was not a science book for non-scientist, but rather a philosophy book for non-philosophers.The author coherently ties together through an overriding narrative on our human psychology and moral development. While I've listened to most of the more recent books on the same topic from various authors (Dawkins, Diamond, Pinker, Gazzaniga, Wilson,Kahneman, and Ridley) available on Audible, none of them tied together the story as well as this book and make you feel the philosophical implications of the theory of evolutionary psychology.The book is dated (copyright 1994) but not out of date. Most of the stories told in the book I've heard versions of them in the more recent books. That's not a fault of the book. It's just that I read this book (in 2012) after having read the other books.I enjoyed this book so much that after listening I started listening to his other book, ""Nonzero"".Warning: this book has the ability to make you reassess you place in the universe and become more interested in philosophy.

I had been reading a lot about genes, evolution, etc. and was really curios about evolutionary psychology when I started to read this. Unfortunately Wright's book was very unfocused. He uses Darwin's personal life and story as a sort of thread holding the book toghether, which might sound great if you like evolution and Darwin. Unfortunately it mostly seems like he used Darwin's fame and speculated about his personal life to further his own ideas, which feels a bit cheap. Thus with this foundation he unsmoothly mixes stories about how Christian Darwin's wife was with unconvincing theories about the evolutionary background of rape. (To be clear I do think there's very possibly some evolutionary background to rape, but his account is very one sided basically claiming that a Victorian society was really nice for the ladies because less rape in the upper class or something. It didn't cut it for me.)There are plenty of interesting evolutionary psychology books in the world unfortunately this was not one of them. "

However, if you've comfortable with the subtleties of the term ""selfish"" in ""The Selfish Gene"" you will find the first half repetitive and the second half overly hand-wavy, vague and unconvincing.

What really sets this book apart is that the author uses Darwin's life -- his bio to explain Evolutionary Psychology to explain why we do what we do.

From an American reader's perspective (Wright is also American), this discourse seemed to be ""pre-9/11,"" and indeed (upon my check of the front pages) it was published in 1994. Reading it in 2020 feels already like a mini time-warp. It's tricky to pinpoint exactly why it doesn't get at 21st century concerns. Partly, it's because the first 150 pages focus on monogamy, reproduction, and marriage in a way that seems like an indirect, coded response to what was then an American national debate over same-sex marriage, a response that somehow managed simultaneously to avoid the acknowledgment that gay people exist. (Wright worked for the New Republic, which was at that time edited by a gay man who was politically conservative, and talking about the gays without really quite involving the gays is how I've always understood that magazine.) And partly, it seems old because it is old. It was published a quarter-century ago, and the science is already a bit dated. Written at the moment just before the Big Bang of cell phones and Internet transformed American culture, the book's discussion of social behavior and our concern with social status is missing our usual contemporary reference points. Thus the Economist's blurb on the paperback — ""destined to become a classic"" — may have been a bit premature, in my view. Not entirely the fault of the book, but more the fault of the year 1994: a reflection on how rapidly the world, and our understanding of it, is changing.The first and longest part is about sex between men and women, in which Wright argues that monogamy is unnatural. (The word ""homosexual"" only appears twice in this part, and then only to describe ""mistaken homosexual courtship"" among frogs and ""periodic homosexual behavior"" among bonobos that is supposedly ""a way of saying, 'Let's be friends.'"") The second part is about reciprocal altruism. The third part is about how we use these behaviors to negotiate our social status. The fourth part is about how this awareness can result in ""a self-consciousness so acute, and a cynicism so deep, that ironic detachment from the whole human enterprise may provide the only relief,"" raising the question of whether ""the word moral can be anything but a joke."" There is a paradox at the heart of the question of whether humans are basically good: ""To be moral animals, we must realize how thoroughly we aren't."" To me, this echoes a critique of the logical inconsistency in the idea of God's omnibenevolence — to be good is to spot errors and continually self-improve, which you can't do if you're already perfect. Yes, humans are inherently moral, in the sense that we are motivated (both consciously and unconsciously) to continually adjust our behavior. The part that is conscious is arguably, by definition, not natural. Its content transcends its natural origin.It's a clear, easily readable introduction to the scientific concept that traits evolve because they benefit survival and reproduction. The book describes how, for a social species like humans, altruistic behavior can evolve (because altruistic acts support the group's survival while enhancing the altruistic individual's reputation within the group). I may have picked this book up as an undergraduate or even as a high school student; it is underlined, apparently by a student who may have been me. It may still serve people who want this introductory material. If you're already clear on this concept, you may want a more scientifically up-to-date book with a more specific thesis."
102,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1579132-christopher,3,"Fascinating and dense. Wright discusses how an evolutionary model can explain human instincts and behavior. Importantly, he doesn't dictate that our behavior isn't changeable, nor that evolutionary results dictate what our moral code should be.My favorite parts were applying these general rules to Darwin's own biography. Darwin was extremely moral and kind. I also very much enjoyed the last quarter, where he discusses J.S. Mill's utilitarianism as the author's moral philosophy of choice. It was fun, because ""Origin of the Species"" and Mill's ""On Liberty"" were both published in 1859.In the first half, Wright thoroughly examines humanity's sexual instincts. For biology, this makes sense, as all biology is understood through reproductive behavior. Although the author did emphasize the fallacy of mixing the ""is"" for the ""ought"", he also characterized his book as a quasi-self-help. The ought comes through with the last quarter discussing Mill, but the first third needed more ""is"". Case in point, humans (both sexes, but men more) instinctively cheat on their spouses, and there was an evolutionary advantage to doing so. He fails to convince that this isn't an ""ought"", by never quite giving adequate description of how a successful monogamous marriage works, given our evolutionary instincts.I really loved his discussion of human hierarchy. All tribes and cultures exhibit this tendency. It is the cause of so much human strife, competition, wars, and destruction. But it also motivates us with ambition and creativity. We are also adept at figuring out our pecking order. Better to learn it through a signal, than taking the costly route to duking it out to verify it. Our yearn to be on top, is also easy to describe evolutionary. The male who was on top, mated with the most females, thus sending those ambitious genes forward.One last fascinating story. Some squirrels, upon seeing a predator, will yelp and freeze up, causing the predator to hear him, catch him, and eat him. How could this be evolutionary advantageous? Because their siblings (who share a huge amount of the same genes), will be preserved by the sacrificial yelper. Thus, those genes are repeated along. Evolution doesn't care about individuals, it only cares about one thing: repeating genes. This type of sacrificial response, explains why we are more willing to sacrifice ourselves, the closer the kin. The further away they are related, the less our genes will be in common, the lower our willingness to sacrifice ourselves. Not that this process is consciously driven; genes don't think.Again, the book was interesting and dense. The second half stronger than the first half. I'd be really interested to see where the science has lead since his writing it in the early 1990's."
103,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54518540-cam-lidstone,4,"Robert Wright's The Moral Animal was one of the much-talked-about books on evolutionary psychology in the 1990s along with Ridley's The Red Queen and The Origins of Virtue, Pinker's How the Mind Works, and Tooby and Cosmides' The Adapted Mind.The book comprehensively and accessibly lays out an understanding of the evolution of human's moral sentiments. Wright's a clear writer who manages to convey the importance of Darwin and his theory of natural selection while maintaining an irreverence and wit. I wasn't fully on board with Wright's conceit: alternating between explanations of evolutionary logic and brief snippets of Darwin's life (explained through the lens of evolutionary psychology). The case studies are too anecdotal and there are better Darwin biographies elsewhere. Wright excels when he communicates and recognises the importance of the work of the eminent evolutionary biologists George C Williams, William D Hamilton, Robert Trivers, and John Maynard Smith.Their collective work, which was popularised in the mid-70s via Dawkins' The Selfish Gene and E.O. Wilson's Sociobiology, sets the foundation of a scientific understanding of the human condition. Their key insights help explain five key relationships: males and females (unequal levels of parental investment and thus differing sexual strategies); parents and their children and siblings with each other (parental-offspring conflict); friends and acquaintances (reciprocal altruism); and people's relationship with themselves (self-deception). I recommend this book to people who know the basics of evolution but you can skip the chapters on Darwin. If you are completely new to the evolution, the best entry points are insteaed probably Dawkins and Gould."

Why do people commit infanticide? Why do soldiers die for their country? What about homosexuals? I was totally captivated by the topic of behavioral genetics .... which before this book I was unaware that the topic existed! So now I'm off to read about that specific part of our human makeup!

He thought: This is what I should feel all the time for everyone.…""—Graham Greene, The Power and the GloryThe moment I started reading about evolutionary psychology, it was a massive revelation for me. It was the beginning of an understanding of a field, that would have spared me much relief from the pain, confusion, and guilt that stemmed from my many quirks as a human being. It provided for the first time, a reason why, I was the way I was. As a computer programmer, it showed me how I had been programmed: evolution, and revealed the programmer: natural selection.This is in essence, an instruction manual for oneself. It attempts to explain our behaviors, motivations, and personality in the realm of our extremely subjective, anthropocentric world, and in doing so, it becomes clear just how strong the case for evolutionary psychology is. As illuminating as it is, it is also a harsh manual. Many will claim that it deromanticizes much of what is noble, and beautiful about human nature, but it does more to demystify, and explain. These new findings can be demoralizing, and difficult to accept, but it is the truth. This is something that Charles Darwin himself was well aware of, and tactfully left out in ""The Origin of Species,"" and simply suggested (towards the end of the book,) a Darwinian view of human psychology in the future, “light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.”Why was it such a revelation? On a personal level, it provided explanations about my heartbreaks, relationships, and love. It was also the first time I realized there was a solid science to understanding people. Almost everything we do revolves around other people, and I had stumbled on a blueprint of their character.“Lasting love is something a person has to decide to experience. Lifelong monogamous devotion is just not natural—not for women even, and emphatically not for men. It requires what, for lack of a better term, we can call an act of will. . . . This isn't to say that a young man can't hope to be seized by love. . . . But whether the sheer fury of a man's feelings accurately gauges their likely endurance is another question. The ardor will surely fade, sooner or later, and the marriage will then live or die on respect, practical compatibility, simple affection, and (these days, especially) determination. With the help of these things, something worthy of the label 'love' can last until death. But it will be a different kind of love from the kind that began the marriage. Will it be a richer love, a deeper love, a more spiritual love? Opinions vary. But it's certainly a more impressive love.”Evolutionary psychology has a long way ahead of itself, but it is the beginning of an understanding of the human mind. It has much potential for practical applications, and could one day provide law makers with a firm logical base when making decisions. Perhaps one day, it could lead to a scientific basis for morality. So far, for most of human history, moral philosophers have discussed morality with only an intuitive understanding of human nature, which is to say, the ""how:"" our behaviors, and motivations. Intuition may feel right, but it is hardly scientific. Now, unsuppressed by divine authority, we have an academic field that describes the ""why"" of human nature, and how can anyone claim ideals on how to act, before we realize our limitations as human beings?"

It explains nearly every human emotion and behaviour, the human institutions, morality, society and social status, our biases, why they are beneficial for us. The important point which the author states, is that if you know about your biological programming, you can eventually overcome it, understand yourself, others and social situations better and therefore make better decisions.It has revealed for me some ugly (by romantic or humanist standarts) truths about friendships, family and romantic relationships, but in the end it is a relief, to know the ""why"". "
112,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43622620-jessica,2,"I found the author's presentation of his case generally comprehensible, though perhaps unnecessarily long-winded, with a tendency to digress too far (IMO) into his examples (mostly drawn from Darwin's life).(I apologize in advance to any readers in the know, if my understanding of logical fallacies is imperfect...)He may be accurate in his conclusions. However, now I need to go read more on the topic, because his understanding of the new Darwinism seems to be based mostly on the work of two researchers, which seems a bit narrow to support his conclusions. (Does that constitute some form of formal- or informal- fallacy?)I don't entirely disagree with his conclusions (about human nature). And it's not the notion that we can't help what evolution has handed to us, that offends me; it's the author's solution to this seeming lack of control. In the final third of the book, I think he too readily dismisses unconscious evolutionary 'decision-making' as a basis for a moral code. I wouldn't use it as a basis for a moral code, either. But his reaction against it smacks of panic.I can think of a couple of possible explanations for this:1- He knows that if he doesn't take a position strongly against evolutionary biology as a basis for a moral code, people will assume he is for it.2- He has a personal horror of his own conclusions, and is consequently trying to smooth them over with an alternative (mainly the philosophy of utilitarianism, which seems to assume that there is (a) no moral difference between your family and anyone else, or (b) that it is not possible to be moral without an imposed morality (that includes utilitarianism)).Isn't there anyone knowledgeable on this subject, who simply presents the facts without assigning a value judgement to them??Also, the author apparently cannot tell the difference between logical and reasonable. That is, he extrapolates from the evidence he presents us with to what he thinks is a logical conclusion, but to an absurd degree (which is not reasonable). He seems to think that, since we are under the influence of our evolutionary past, we can't naturally be reasonable at all. Isn't that a form of reductio ad absurdum (sp?)?The ability to reason is part of what makes us human! (Or, if you will, it is part of what differentiates us from other bipeds.) So is the concept of a middle ground- i.e., it's not either all one conclusion or all one other. (Oh God- false dilemma! Argh!)Stopped with 36 pages left to go, because I couldn't bring myself to finish it. The text is way too biased, and not in favor of humanity as he understands it."
113,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57956231-ailith-twinning,1,"Would have been better if it had just been a biography of Darwin, I really felt his admiration while reading those parts and enjoyed the vicarious experience of his feeling. I'm not qualified to critique Evolutionary Psychology - so I won't. The obviously nuts stuff speaks for itself, and those actually in the field do a decent job kicking the authors of that crap in the ass. Now, if only they could manage to get economists banned from writing in the field at all. And, for a philosophical critique, turn to (good) feminist and anti-racist authors. Also Post-Modernist critique which is more a philosophy of why some practitioners apply the scientific method wrongly than the popular conversation about some anti-science theory. This critique applies at least triply for economists skimming the field (to mix metaphors). But what really irked me was the closing stuff -- One of the less common interpretations of Utilitarianism gets, not only acknowledged, but endorsed, only for Wright to then use some seriously half-assed moral conservatism to defend perverting the philosophy into a compromise between its worst interpretations (The USSR, Third Reich, British Empire, and American Empire as various examples) and its actual implications (frankly, Socialism). So you get some kind of messy Meritocracy, right after you (correctly) point out that ""Merit"" is a question wrongly put. It's certainly my personal position that leads to it, but the wretched attempt to justify a torturous prison state (""make the world safe for blame"", as the saying goes) was just the final straw for me, and sufficiently direct to render even the most generous interpretation a fully unacceptable argument. And, if the philosophy is not something the book may be justly judged as a whole for - then why is it there? More to the point, it should not be there, if the purpose is not precisely to frame what came before. So, the explicitly philosophical section is the last straw before generosity must end, and the book fall under the strain of its shitty philosophy -- or its just another bit of bad thoughts in a long chain of (disjointed) bad thoughts, interspersed with some admirably genuine gushing about an idol (Darwin)."
114,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1098316-jamie,3,"Using the writings of Charles Darwin to deliver its human morality principles, I felt by the end of this book that I had learnt more about the great man than I had about myself. One problem with this book is that by centering on life in the 19th century, its themes were often not as relevant to society today. For instance, it may be advantageous for women to play a little harder to get in the game of love, but this is unlikely to have a significant implication towards social status today. Another example, families are unlikely to favor a child simply because they have a greater chance of moving up in socioeconomic circles. I further disagreed with the premise that each person has no free will, we may all inherit a certain instinct, but an instinct does not define our actions in their entirety. Some underlying truths in this book are thought provoking. Man is not intended to be monogomous, but such cultural norms likely maintain social cohesion by allowing a more equal pairing of men and women. We are rarely content with the present and constantly focused on status signals and self aggrandizement, hence, our morals are essentially innate feelings driven by selfish goals, which require constant self-reflection and scepticism to control. This is also a singificant reason why all major religious have the same central themes, which have been considered necessary to guide our innate morals towards the promotion of social harmony.Charles Darwin said this in 1882, and to me it is the key message I will take out of the book: ""As man advances in civilisation, and small tribes are united to larger communities, the simplest reason would tell each individual that he ought to extend his social instincts and sympathies to all the members of the same nation, though personally unkown to him. This point being once reached, there is only an aftifical barrier to prevent his sympathies extending to the men of all nations and races."" Humanity will continue to evolve and our success is dependent on the ability to empathize with all life on this planet.  "
115,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5817744-emma-b,3,"I'm about 100 pages in, and the material is quite fascinating. The book basically links every single trait of humanity back to an adaptation in the ancestral environment.I just wish he'd stop personifying natural selection.Correction, deifying.That kinda defeats the purpose of science.-------------Upon finishing the book, my final opinion is that it was decent, but not fantastic. His deification of the process of natural selection trailed off, much to my relief. The book itself consisted mostly of references and quotes to previous studies, with little interjection by the author, but it was nice to have all that data in one place and in a logical order. The concept of reciprocal altruism, by which humans develop societies, relationships, and most of our higher emotions, was quite interesting, even if a bit common-sensical. It was explained, if perhaps to death, very well, and was easy to understand.The chapters concerning Darwin himself I found to be less than interesting. Many times, the author decided to stray far into the depths of biography, leading us through the childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and finally death of Charles Darwin himself. These chapters were sprinkled with psychological notes with either no apparent relevance or no apparent basis. I found myself leafing quickly through them, hoping to skip past the psych profile of a long-dead man and return to the science.The final chapter, I believe, had no real reason to exist, or at least not to be as long as it was. It was the conclusion, a summation and review of the ideas covered in the book, which didn't number very many, and it made up about 1/5th of the whole book's length. It seemed simply unnecessary. A nice, ten-page abstract and a 'how this info could be used' section I think would have been a much nicer way to end the book.All in all, it was alright, though not nearly as educational as I'd hoped. I've walked away with some new vocab and a basal understanding of this branch of psychology though, which means it wasn't a waste."
116,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17983541-sam,2,"I thought there were some interesting ideas in this book (particularly the suggestion that awareness of the evolutionary roots of behaviour can guide morality by making us conscious of biases and types of reactions that are ill-suited to modern industrial life), but for me there was also one significant flaw: Going by this book, it seems that Wright thinks natural selection shaped humankind predominantly by acting on men. His discussion of women in evolution relates mostly to the Madonna-whore dichotomy, and an odd diversion in which he argues that polygamy should be embraced by feminists because it means more women can choose to marry a high-status man, getting more resources as one of several wives than they might as the single wife of a lower status man. Even when discussing issues unrelated to sex, our male ancestors apparently were the key to evolutionary changes. For example, on p285: 'Feelings of enmity, of grievance, of righteous indignation - of collective enmity and grievance and righteous indignation - probably have their deepest roots in ancient conflicts within bands of humans and pre-humans. In particular: in conflicts among coalitions of males for status.' (What, because female humans and pre-humans never felt group loyalty or righteous indignation?). Another example: in the index, there are 12 topics listed under 'male parental investment,' whereas 'female parental investment' isn't even listed (there is, however, an entry for 'feminism - sexual symmetry as doctrine of'). Based on the assumption that natural selection operates on ALL members of a species, I can't help but doubt the accuracy of at least some of Wright's ideas, given that he seems so focused on only half of the ancestral pool."
117,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51128101-amanda,3,"First of all, I fully acknowledge that this book was outside of my comfort zone as a reader. I do enjoy nonfiction and even the occasional scientific book, but those “sciencey” books are usually about the non-human natural world. Astronomy, for instance, or botany. Furthermore, I have something of a background in sociology, so reading a book that favors biological rather than social explanations for human behavior was a bit difficult for me. That said, I found Wright’s book to be a good primer on evolutionary psychology. As a total newcomer to the field, I never felt completely out of my depth. A bit skeptical from time to time, but not nearly as much as I expected. I think Wright does a good job, not only of conveying the information, but of making it understandable as well. To be entirely fair, I can’t say how accurate the information or its usage is because, as I said, I’m a novice here. My biggest issue was probably Wright’s tactic of anthropomorphizing natural selection: it “wants” this, it designed us to do that. I see how this could be a valid explanatory tactic, but it just ended up making me have to reread and rethink. Something else, more a personal gripe than anything else, is that, when the book talks about sexual attraction/relationships/etc., it’s exclusively heterosexual. As a lesbian, I found myself wondering throughout the book, “But what about the queers?” In the FAQ section at the back of my copy, Wright acknowledges the subject, but mostly brushes it off, essentially saying, “It doesn’t really matter how natural it is; some people are gay and, morally, I think that should be the end of the discussion.” And, like, that’s great, dude. But that’s not what I asked. Overall, I found the book pretty much understandable, but just not that engrossing. "

It seems to be a blend of something called evolutionary psychology, a biography of Charles Darwin and an argument for returning to Victorian morals. As such the book is often slow and confused. These three strands are interweaved and frankly, become uninteresting as the book goes along. The writing is often repetitive, saying the same things about natural selection over and over for example. The analysis is not great either…the author touts something called evolutionary psychology which he doesn’t convince me exists. I think of psychology as being culture and social related…evolution is entirely biological…yes, we have feeling, but they’re shaped by chemistry and biology. How we view these feelings is psychology which, outside of neurology is a social construct. I found the biography of Darwin distracting and detracting…if I wanted to read a biography of Darwin, there are full length better books out there. Lastly, if I wanted to read about why we should return to Victorian morals, there are better arguments and books which focus on the society not biology. In short, I wanted to read a book about the science of evolutionary psychology not a political polemic or a biography. The latter wasn’t even convincingly argued and so I’m not just disappointed, I’m disgusted I spent money on this book. So, I give this a 1. It fails in every respect. It can’t even convince me that evolutionary psychology is a thing and the rest of the book is just filler and a waste of the reader’s time. "
119,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"This is the most fluent, starting from scratch book on the subject of evolution I have read. There is no presupposition of prior knowledge. And the author makes good use of popular notions of the Darwinian theory to throw light on understandings that are wrong, answer those common questions most of us have in mind and explain the real meaning of evolution.Unlike Dawkins' books which are turgid at times because of too many examples from the behaviours of species of various kind (most of those species that non-experts have never heard of) , Wright mostly uses the life of Darwin himself to make many points. This appears odd for a theory that explicitly warns against the use of specifics, the approach works. It also helps that evolution is explained more from the viewpoint of where humanity has reached today than any other notions.Some of the conclusions are outrageous, particularly when they give genetic inevitability to morally/socially reprehensible behaviour. Equally, many conclusions - like in Freudian theories that the author so vehemently criticises - seem to be derived from highly glib, flimsily proven verbal/logical ""must be/could be"" rationales. Perhaps these things are inevitable without the quantified edifices of physical sciences, but they also prove to be the reasons behind relatively less acceptance of almost all the finer points of evolutionary theories."
120,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3558148-bob-pearson,4,"Evolutionary psychology speculates widely (some say wildly) about the origins of human behavior. It has come under fire on the grounds that its presumptions are assumptions not facts since much of its logic is based on what is not observable: the development of the human mind before history. The immense spectrum of human behavior makes it impossible to draw unquestionable links in many cases. Moreover, some evolutionary psychologists have tried to explain male dominance and even rape on the controlling power of genes. All that said, Robin Wright gives us an intriguing argument that accepts the selfishness of early humans as the trigger to actual unselfishness through interactions of mutual benefit among humans that also provide increased prestige and influence to the players. His approach outflanks the obstacle posed by previous narratives that insisted on confrontation between prehistoric human development and more modern societal development. Wright goes so far as to posit that ""brotherly love"" need have no religious inspiration but is a natural evolution of human behavior in groups. Hard to grasp sometimes and easy to criticize in places, his approach nevertheless offers an optimistic view of human development that might be worth serious attention. "

I only started to fully appreciate this book after I realized it was not a science book for non-scientist, but rather a philosophy book for non-philosophers.The author coherently ties together through an overriding narrative on our human psychology and moral development. While I've listened to most of the more recent books on the same topic from various authors (Dawkins, Diamond, Pinker, Gazzaniga, Wilson,Kahneman, and Ridley) available on Audible, none of them tied together the story as well as this book and make you feel the philosophical implications of the theory of evolutionary psychology.The book is dated (copyright 1994) but not out of date. Most of the stories told in the book I've heard versions of them in the more recent books. That's not a fault of the book. It's just that I read this book (in 2012) after having read the other books.I enjoyed this book so much that after listening I started listening to his other book, ""Nonzero"".Warning: this book has the ability to make you reassess you place in the universe and become more interested in philosophy.

I had been reading a lot about genes, evolution, etc. and was really curios about evolutionary psychology when I started to read this. Unfortunately Wright's book was very unfocused. He uses Darwin's personal life and story as a sort of thread holding the book toghether, which might sound great if you like evolution and Darwin. Unfortunately it mostly seems like he used Darwin's fame and speculated about his personal life to further his own ideas, which feels a bit cheap. Thus with this foundation he unsmoothly mixes stories about how Christian Darwin's wife was with unconvincing theories about the evolutionary background of rape. (To be clear I do think there's very possibly some evolutionary background to rape, but his account is very one sided basically claiming that a Victorian society was really nice for the ladies because less rape in the upper class or something. It didn't cut it for me.)There are plenty of interesting evolutionary psychology books in the world unfortunately this was not one of them. "

However, if you've comfortable with the subtleties of the term ""selfish"" in ""The Selfish Gene"" you will find the first half repetitive and the second half overly hand-wavy, vague and unconvincing.

124,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7278262-sher,4,"Book deserves a strong 4.5 or 5, though for me much was repetition-- because I have already read 5 books on Darwin and his theory of evolution -- including Origin of Species, his journals ,studies of the Galapagos finches, and also a massive two volume tome about his life in work. What really sets this book apart is that the author uses Darwin's life -- his bio to explain Evolutionary Psychology to explain why we do what we do. I found the chapters about religion most interesting as the author contrasts Jesus and Buddha and sages in general and analyzes their teachings based on Evolutionary Psychology. As the NY Times says -- amazingly original thinking here."

131,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"Wright describes the perspectives of evolutionary biologists over a hundred years, from Darwin to the late 20th century, who research human behavior. From an American reader's perspective (Wright is also American), this discourse seemed to be ""pre-9/11,"" and indeed (upon my check of the front pages) it was published in 1994. Reading it in 2020 feels already like a mini time-warp. It's tricky to pinpoint exactly why it doesn't get at 21st century concerns. Partly, it's because the first 150 pages focus on monogamy, reproduction, and marriage in a way that seems like an indirect, coded response to what was then an American national debate over same-sex marriage, a response that somehow managed simultaneously to avoid the acknowledgment that gay people exist. (Wright worked for the New Republic, which was at that time edited by a gay man who was politically conservative, and talking about the gays without really quite involving the gays is how I've always understood that magazine.) And partly, it seems old because it is old. It was published a quarter-century ago, and the science is already a bit dated. Written at the moment just before the Big Bang of cell phones and Internet transformed American culture, the book's discussion of social behavior and our concern with social status is missing our usual contemporary reference points. Thus the Economist's blurb on the paperback — ""destined to become a classic"" — may have been a bit premature, in my view. Not entirely the fault of the book, but more the fault of the year 1994: a reflection on how rapidly the world, and our understanding of it, is changing.The first and longest part is about sex between men and women, in which Wright argues that monogamy is unnatural. (The word ""homosexual"" only appears twice in this part, and then only to describe ""mistaken homosexual courtship"" among frogs and ""periodic homosexual behavior"" among bonobos that is supposedly ""a way of saying, 'Let's be friends.'"") The second part is about reciprocal altruism. The third part is about how we use these behaviors to negotiate our social status. The fourth part is about how this awareness can result in ""a self-consciousness so acute, and a cynicism so deep, that ironic detachment from the whole human enterprise may provide the only relief,"" raising the question of whether ""the word moral can be anything but a joke."" There is a paradox at the heart of the question of whether humans are basically good: ""To be moral animals, we must realize how thoroughly we aren't."" To me, this echoes a critique of the logical inconsistency in the idea of God's omnibenevolence — to be good is to spot errors and continually self-improve, which you can't do if you're already perfect. Yes, humans are inherently moral, in the sense that we are motivated (both consciously and unconsciously) to continually adjust our behavior. The part that is conscious is arguably, by definition, not natural. Its content transcends its natural origin.It's a clear, easily readable introduction to the scientific concept that traits evolve because they benefit survival and reproduction. The book describes how, for a social species like humans, altruistic behavior can evolve (because altruistic acts support the group's survival while enhancing the altruistic individual's reputation within the group). I may have picked this book up as an undergraduate or even as a high school student; it is underlined, apparently by a student who may have been me. It may still serve people who want this introductory material. If you're already clear on this concept, you may want a more scientifically up-to-date book with a more specific thesis."
132,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1579132-christopher,3,"Fascinating and dense. Wright discusses how an evolutionary model can explain human instincts and behavior. Importantly, he doesn't dictate that our behavior isn't changeable, nor that evolutionary results dictate what our moral code should be.My favorite parts were applying these general rules to Darwin's own biography. Darwin was extremely moral and kind. I also very much enjoyed the last quarter, where he discusses J.S. Mill's utilitarianism as the author's moral philosophy of choice. It was fun, because ""Origin of the Species"" and Mill's ""On Liberty"" were both published in 1859.In the first half, Wright thoroughly examines humanity's sexual instincts. For biology, this makes sense, as all biology is understood through reproductive behavior. Although the author did emphasize the fallacy of mixing the ""is"" for the ""ought"", he also characterized his book as a quasi-self-help. The ought comes through with the last quarter discussing Mill, but the first third needed more ""is"". Case in point, humans (both sexes, but men more) instinctively cheat on their spouses, and there was an evolutionary advantage to doing so. He fails to convince that this isn't an ""ought"", by never quite giving adequate description of how a successful monogamous marriage works, given our evolutionary instincts.I really loved his discussion of human hierarchy. All tribes and cultures exhibit this tendency. It is the cause of so much human strife, competition, wars, and destruction. But it also motivates us with ambition and creativity. We are also adept at figuring out our pecking order. Better to learn it through a signal, than taking the costly route to duking it out to verify it. Our yearn to be on top, is also easy to describe evolutionary. The male who was on top, mated with the most females, thus sending those ambitious genes forward.One last fascinating story. Some squirrels, upon seeing a predator, will yelp and freeze up, causing the predator to hear him, catch him, and eat him. How could this be evolutionary advantageous? Because their siblings (who share a huge amount of the same genes), will be preserved by the sacrificial yelper. Thus, those genes are repeated along. Evolution doesn't care about individuals, it only cares about one thing: repeating genes. This type of sacrificial response, explains why we are more willing to sacrifice ourselves, the closer the kin. The further away they are related, the less our genes will be in common, the lower our willingness to sacrifice ourselves. Not that this process is consciously driven; genes don't think.Again, the book was interesting and dense. The second half stronger than the first half. I'd be really interested to see where the science has lead since his writing it in the early 1990's."
133,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54518540-cam-lidstone,4,"Robert Wright's The Moral Animal was one of the much-talked-about books on evolutionary psychology in the 1990s along with Ridley's The Red Queen and The Origins of Virtue, Pinker's How the Mind Works, and Tooby and Cosmides' The Adapted Mind.The book comprehensively and accessibly lays out an understanding of the evolution of human's moral sentiments. Wright's a clear writer who manages to convey the importance of Darwin and his theory of natural selection while maintaining an irreverence and wit. I wasn't fully on board with Wright's conceit: alternating between explanations of evolutionary logic and brief snippets of Darwin's life (explained through the lens of evolutionary psychology). The case studies are too anecdotal and there are better Darwin biographies elsewhere. Wright excels when he communicates and recognises the importance of the work of the eminent evolutionary biologists George C Williams, William D Hamilton, Robert Trivers, and John Maynard Smith.Their collective work, which was popularised in the mid-70s via Dawkins' The Selfish Gene and E.O. Wilson's Sociobiology, sets the foundation of a scientific understanding of the human condition. Their key insights help explain five key relationships: males and females (unequal levels of parental investment and thus differing sexual strategies); parents and their children and siblings with each other (parental-offspring conflict); friends and acquaintances (reciprocal altruism); and people's relationship with themselves (self-deception). I recommend this book to people who know the basics of evolution but you can skip the chapters on Darwin. If you are completely new to the evolution, the best entry points are insteaed probably Dawkins and Gould."

He thought: This is what I should feel all the time for everyone.…""—Graham Greene, The Power and the GloryThe moment I started reading about evolutionary psychology, it was a massive revelation for me. It was the beginning of an understanding of a field, that would have spared me much relief from the pain, confusion, and guilt that stemmed from my many quirks as a human being. It provided for the first time, a reason why, I was the way I was. As a computer programmer, it showed me how I had been programmed: evolution, and revealed the programmer: natural selection.This is in essence, an instruction manual for oneself. It attempts to explain our behaviors, motivations, and personality in the realm of our extremely subjective, anthropocentric world, and in doing so, it becomes clear just how strong the case for evolutionary psychology is. As illuminating as it is, it is also a harsh manual. Many will claim that it deromanticizes much of what is noble, and beautiful about human nature, but it does more to demystify, and explain. These new findings can be demoralizing, and difficult to accept, but it is the truth. This is something that Charles Darwin himself was well aware of, and tactfully left out in ""The Origin of Species,"" and simply suggested (towards the end of the book,) a Darwinian view of human psychology in the future, “light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.”Why was it such a revelation? On a personal level, it provided explanations about my heartbreaks, relationships, and love. It was also the first time I realized there was a solid science to understanding people. Almost everything we do revolves around other people, and I had stumbled on a blueprint of their character.“Lasting love is something a person has to decide to experience. Lifelong monogamous devotion is just not natural—not for women even, and emphatically not for men. It requires what, for lack of a better term, we can call an act of will. . . . This isn't to say that a young man can't hope to be seized by love. . . . But whether the sheer fury of a man's feelings accurately gauges their likely endurance is another question. The ardor will surely fade, sooner or later, and the marriage will then live or die on respect, practical compatibility, simple affection, and (these days, especially) determination. With the help of these things, something worthy of the label 'love' can last until death. But it will be a different kind of love from the kind that began the marriage. Will it be a richer love, a deeper love, a more spiritual love? Opinions vary. But it's certainly a more impressive love.”Evolutionary psychology has a long way ahead of itself, but it is the beginning of an understanding of the human mind. It has much potential for practical applications, and could one day provide law makers with a firm logical base when making decisions. Perhaps one day, it could lead to a scientific basis for morality. So far, for most of human history, moral philosophers have discussed morality with only an intuitive understanding of human nature, which is to say, the ""how:"" our behaviors, and motivations. Intuition may feel right, but it is hardly scientific. Now, unsuppressed by divine authority, we have an academic field that describes the ""why"" of human nature, and how can anyone claim ideals on how to act, before we realize our limitations as human beings?"

It explains nearly every human emotion and behaviour, the human institutions, morality, society and social status, our biases, why they are beneficial for us. The important point which the author states, is that if you know about your biological programming, you can eventually overcome it, understand yourself, others and social situations better and therefore make better decisions.It has revealed for me some ugly (by romantic or humanist standarts) truths about friendships, family and romantic relationships, but in the end it is a relief, to know the ""why"". "
142,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43622620-jessica,2,"I found the author's presentation of his case generally comprehensible, though perhaps unnecessarily long-winded, with a tendency to digress too far (IMO) into his examples (mostly drawn from Darwin's life).(I apologize in advance to any readers in the know, if my understanding of logical fallacies is imperfect...)He may be accurate in his conclusions. However, now I need to go read more on the topic, because his understanding of the new Darwinism seems to be based mostly on the work of two researchers, which seems a bit narrow to support his conclusions. (Does that constitute some form of formal- or informal- fallacy?)I don't entirely disagree with his conclusions (about human nature). And it's not the notion that we can't help what evolution has handed to us, that offends me; it's the author's solution to this seeming lack of control. In the final third of the book, I think he too readily dismisses unconscious evolutionary 'decision-making' as a basis for a moral code. I wouldn't use it as a basis for a moral code, either. But his reaction against it smacks of panic.I can think of a couple of possible explanations for this:1- He knows that if he doesn't take a position strongly against evolutionary biology as a basis for a moral code, people will assume he is for it.2- He has a personal horror of his own conclusions, and is consequently trying to smooth them over with an alternative (mainly the philosophy of utilitarianism, which seems to assume that there is (a) no moral difference between your family and anyone else, or (b) that it is not possible to be moral without an imposed morality (that includes utilitarianism)).Isn't there anyone knowledgeable on this subject, who simply presents the facts without assigning a value judgement to them??Also, the author apparently cannot tell the difference between logical and reasonable. That is, he extrapolates from the evidence he presents us with to what he thinks is a logical conclusion, but to an absurd degree (which is not reasonable). He seems to think that, since we are under the influence of our evolutionary past, we can't naturally be reasonable at all. Isn't that a form of reductio ad absurdum (sp?)?The ability to reason is part of what makes us human! (Or, if you will, it is part of what differentiates us from other bipeds.) So is the concept of a middle ground- i.e., it's not either all one conclusion or all one other. (Oh God- false dilemma! Argh!)Stopped with 36 pages left to go, because I couldn't bring myself to finish it. The text is way too biased, and not in favor of humanity as he understands it."
143,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57956231-ailith-twinning,1,"Would have been better if it had just been a biography of Darwin, I really felt his admiration while reading those parts and enjoyed the vicarious experience of his feeling. I'm not qualified to critique Evolutionary Psychology - so I won't. The obviously nuts stuff speaks for itself, and those actually in the field do a decent job kicking the authors of that crap in the ass. Now, if only they could manage to get economists banned from writing in the field at all. And, for a philosophical critique, turn to (good) feminist and anti-racist authors. Also Post-Modernist critique which is more a philosophy of why some practitioners apply the scientific method wrongly than the popular conversation about some anti-science theory. This critique applies at least triply for economists skimming the field (to mix metaphors). But what really irked me was the closing stuff -- One of the less common interpretations of Utilitarianism gets, not only acknowledged, but endorsed, only for Wright to then use some seriously half-assed moral conservatism to defend perverting the philosophy into a compromise between its worst interpretations (The USSR, Third Reich, British Empire, and American Empire as various examples) and its actual implications (frankly, Socialism). So you get some kind of messy Meritocracy, right after you (correctly) point out that ""Merit"" is a question wrongly put. It's certainly my personal position that leads to it, but the wretched attempt to justify a torturous prison state (""make the world safe for blame"", as the saying goes) was just the final straw for me, and sufficiently direct to render even the most generous interpretation a fully unacceptable argument. And, if the philosophy is not something the book may be justly judged as a whole for - then why is it there? More to the point, it should not be there, if the purpose is not precisely to frame what came before. So, the explicitly philosophical section is the last straw before generosity must end, and the book fall under the strain of its shitty philosophy -- or its just another bit of bad thoughts in a long chain of (disjointed) bad thoughts, interspersed with some admirably genuine gushing about an idol (Darwin)."
144,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1098316-jamie,3,"Using the writings of Charles Darwin to deliver its human morality principles, I felt by the end of this book that I had learnt more about the great man than I had about myself. One problem with this book is that by centering on life in the 19th century, its themes were often not as relevant to society today. For instance, it may be advantageous for women to play a little harder to get in the game of love, but this is unlikely to have a significant implication towards social status today. Another example, families are unlikely to favor a child simply because they have a greater chance of moving up in socioeconomic circles. I further disagreed with the premise that each person has no free will, we may all inherit a certain instinct, but an instinct does not define our actions in their entirety. Some underlying truths in this book are thought provoking. Man is not intended to be monogomous, but such cultural norms likely maintain social cohesion by allowing a more equal pairing of men and women. We are rarely content with the present and constantly focused on status signals and self aggrandizement, hence, our morals are essentially innate feelings driven by selfish goals, which require constant self-reflection and scepticism to control. This is also a singificant reason why all major religious have the same central themes, which have been considered necessary to guide our innate morals towards the promotion of social harmony.Charles Darwin said this in 1882, and to me it is the key message I will take out of the book: ""As man advances in civilisation, and small tribes are united to larger communities, the simplest reason would tell each individual that he ought to extend his social instincts and sympathies to all the members of the same nation, though personally unkown to him. This point being once reached, there is only an aftifical barrier to prevent his sympathies extending to the men of all nations and races."" Humanity will continue to evolve and our success is dependent on the ability to empathize with all life on this planet.  "

The book basically links every single trait of humanity back to an adaptation in the ancestral environment.I just wish he'd stop personifying natural selection.Correction, deifying.That kinda defeats the purpose of science.-------------Upon finishing the book, my final opinion is that it was decent, but not fantastic. His deification of the process of natural selection trailed off, much to my relief. The book itself consisted mostly of references and quotes to previous studies, with little interjection by the author, but it was nice to have all that data in one place and in a logical order. The concept of reciprocal altruism, by which humans develop societies, relationships, and most of our higher emotions, was quite interesting, even if a bit common-sensical. It was explained, if perhaps to death, very well, and was easy to understand.The chapters concerning Darwin himself I found to be less than interesting. Many times, the author decided to stray far into the depths of biography, leading us through the childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and finally death of Charles Darwin himself. These chapters were sprinkled with psychological notes with either no apparent relevance or no apparent basis. I found myself leafing quickly through them, hoping to skip past the psych profile of a long-dead man and return to the science.The final chapter, I believe, had no real reason to exist, or at least not to be as long as it was. It was the conclusion, a summation and review of the ideas covered in the book, which didn't number very many, and it made up about 1/5th of the whole book's length. It seemed simply unnecessary. A nice, ten-page abstract and a 'how this info could be used' section I think would have been a much nicer way to end the book.All in all, it was alright, though not nearly as educational as I'd hoped. I've walked away with some new vocab and a basal understanding of this branch of psychology though, which means it wasn't a waste."
146,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17983541-sam,2,"I thought there were some interesting ideas in this book (particularly the suggestion that awareness of the evolutionary roots of behaviour can guide morality by making us conscious of biases and types of reactions that are ill-suited to modern industrial life), but for me there was also one significant flaw: Going by this book, it seems that Wright thinks natural selection shaped humankind predominantly by acting on men. His discussion of women in evolution relates mostly to the Madonna-whore dichotomy, and an odd diversion in which he argues that polygamy should be embraced by feminists because it means more women can choose to marry a high-status man, getting more resources as one of several wives than they might as the single wife of a lower status man. Even when discussing issues unrelated to sex, our male ancestors apparently were the key to evolutionary changes. For example, on p285: 'Feelings of enmity, of grievance, of righteous indignation - of collective enmity and grievance and righteous indignation - probably have their deepest roots in ancient conflicts within bands of humans and pre-humans. In particular: in conflicts among coalitions of males for status.' (What, because female humans and pre-humans never felt group loyalty or righteous indignation?). Another example: in the index, there are 12 topics listed under 'male parental investment,' whereas 'female parental investment' isn't even listed (there is, however, an entry for 'feminism - sexual symmetry as doctrine of'). Based on the assumption that natural selection operates on ALL members of a species, I can't help but doubt the accuracy of at least some of Wright's ideas, given that he seems so focused on only half of the ancestral pool."
147,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51128101-amanda,3,"First of all, I fully acknowledge that this book was outside of my comfort zone as a reader. I do enjoy nonfiction and even the occasional scientific book, but those “sciencey” books are usually about the non-human natural world. Astronomy, for instance, or botany. Furthermore, I have something of a background in sociology, so reading a book that favors biological rather than social explanations for human behavior was a bit difficult for me. That said, I found Wright’s book to be a good primer on evolutionary psychology. As a total newcomer to the field, I never felt completely out of my depth. A bit skeptical from time to time, but not nearly as much as I expected. I think Wright does a good job, not only of conveying the information, but of making it understandable as well. To be entirely fair, I can’t say how accurate the information or its usage is because, as I said, I’m a novice here. My biggest issue was probably Wright’s tactic of anthropomorphizing natural selection: it “wants” this, it designed us to do that. I see how this could be a valid explanatory tactic, but it just ended up making me have to reread and rethink. Something else, more a personal gripe than anything else, is that, when the book talks about sexual attraction/relationships/etc., it’s exclusively heterosexual. As a lesbian, I found myself wondering throughout the book, “But what about the queers?” In the FAQ section at the back of my copy, Wright acknowledges the subject, but mostly brushes it off, essentially saying, “It doesn’t really matter how natural it is; some people are gay and, morally, I think that should be the end of the discussion.” And, like, that’s great, dude. But that’s not what I asked. Overall, I found the book pretty much understandable, but just not that engrossing. "
148,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,1,"Confused book. It seems to be a blend of something called evolutionary psychology, a biography of Charles Darwin and an argument for returning to Victorian morals. As such the book is often slow and confused. These three strands are interweaved and frankly, become uninteresting as the book goes along. The writing is often repetitive, saying the same things about natural selection over and over for example. The analysis is not great either…the author touts something called evolutionary psychology which he doesn’t convince me exists. I think of psychology as being culture and social related…evolution is entirely biological…yes, we have feeling, but they’re shaped by chemistry and biology. How we view these feelings is psychology which, outside of neurology is a social construct. I found the biography of Darwin distracting and detracting…if I wanted to read a biography of Darwin, there are full length better books out there. Lastly, if I wanted to read about why we should return to Victorian morals, there are better arguments and books which focus on the society not biology. In short, I wanted to read a book about the science of evolutionary psychology not a political polemic or a biography. The latter wasn’t even convincingly argued and so I’m not just disappointed, I’m disgusted I spent money on this book. So, I give this a 1. It fails in every respect. It can’t even convince me that evolutionary psychology is a thing and the rest of the book is just filler and a waste of the reader’s time. "
149,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"This is the most fluent, starting from scratch book on the subject of evolution I have read. There is no presupposition of prior knowledge. And the author makes good use of popular notions of the Darwinian theory to throw light on understandings that are wrong, answer those common questions most of us have in mind and explain the real meaning of evolution.Unlike Dawkins' books which are turgid at times because of too many examples from the behaviours of species of various kind (most of those species that non-experts have never heard of) , Wright mostly uses the life of Darwin himself to make many points. This appears odd for a theory that explicitly warns against the use of specifics, the approach works. It also helps that evolution is explained more from the viewpoint of where humanity has reached today than any other notions.Some of the conclusions are outrageous, particularly when they give genetic inevitability to morally/socially reprehensible behaviour. Equally, many conclusions - like in Freudian theories that the author so vehemently criticises - seem to be derived from highly glib, flimsily proven verbal/logical ""must be/could be"" rationales. Perhaps these things are inevitable without the quantified edifices of physical sciences, but they also prove to be the reasons behind relatively less acceptance of almost all the finer points of evolutionary theories."
150,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3558148-bob-pearson,4,"Evolutionary psychology speculates widely (some say wildly) about the origins of human behavior. It has come under fire on the grounds that its presumptions are assumptions not facts since much of its logic is based on what is not observable: the development of the human mind before history. The immense spectrum of human behavior makes it impossible to draw unquestionable links in many cases. Moreover, some evolutionary psychologists have tried to explain male dominance and even rape on the controlling power of genes. All that said, Robin Wright gives us an intriguing argument that accepts the selfishness of early humans as the trigger to actual unselfishness through interactions of mutual benefit among humans that also provide increased prestige and influence to the players. His approach outflanks the obstacle posed by previous narratives that insisted on confrontation between prehistoric human development and more modern societal development. Wright goes so far as to posit that ""brotherly love"" need have no religious inspiration but is a natural evolution of human behavior in groups. Hard to grasp sometimes and easy to criticize in places, his approach nevertheless offers an optimistic view of human development that might be worth serious attention. "

I only started to fully appreciate this book after I realized it was not a science book for non-scientist, but rather a philosophy book for non-philosophers.The author coherently ties together through an overriding narrative on our human psychology and moral development. While I've listened to most of the more recent books on the same topic from various authors (Dawkins, Diamond, Pinker, Gazzaniga, Wilson,Kahneman, and Ridley) available on Audible, none of them tied together the story as well as this book and make you feel the philosophical implications of the theory of evolutionary psychology.The book is dated (copyright 1994) but not out of date. Most of the stories told in the book I've heard versions of them in the more recent books. That's not a fault of the book. It's just that I read this book (in 2012) after having read the other books.I enjoyed this book so much that after listening I started listening to his other book, ""Nonzero"".Warning: this book has the ability to make you reassess you place in the universe and become more interested in philosophy.

I had been reading a lot about genes, evolution, etc. and was really curios about evolutionary psychology when I started to read this. Unfortunately Wright's book was very unfocused. He uses Darwin's personal life and story as a sort of thread holding the book toghether, which might sound great if you like evolution and Darwin. Unfortunately it mostly seems like he used Darwin's fame and speculated about his personal life to further his own ideas, which feels a bit cheap. Thus with this foundation he unsmoothly mixes stories about how Christian Darwin's wife was with unconvincing theories about the evolutionary background of rape. (To be clear I do think there's very possibly some evolutionary background to rape, but his account is very one sided basically claiming that a Victorian society was really nice for the ladies because less rape in the upper class or something. It didn't cut it for me.)There are plenty of interesting evolutionary psychology books in the world unfortunately this was not one of them. "

Spicing up the book is a parallel thread that supports its evolutionary psychology conclusions with examples from Darwin's own personal life.

However, if you've comfortable with the subtleties of the term ""selfish"" in ""The Selfish Gene"" you will find the first half repetitive and the second half overly hand-wavy, vague and unconvincing. Final recommendation: Go ahead if you'd like a quick intro to evolution and its effects on our minds. Expect to be tickled by arguments, but ultimately unconvinced of anything."

What really sets this book apart is that the author uses Darwin's life -- his bio to explain Evolutionary Psychology to explain why we do what we do. I found the chapters about religion most interesting as the author contrasts Jesus and Buddha and sages in general and analyzes their teachings based on Evolutionary Psychology. As the NY Times says -- amazingly original thinking here."

161,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"Wright describes the perspectives of evolutionary biologists over a hundred years, from Darwin to the late 20th century, who research human behavior. From an American reader's perspective (Wright is also American), this discourse seemed to be ""pre-9/11,"" and indeed (upon my check of the front pages) it was published in 1994. Reading it in 2020 feels already like a mini time-warp. It's tricky to pinpoint exactly why it doesn't get at 21st century concerns. Partly, it's because the first 150 pages focus on monogamy, reproduction, and marriage in a way that seems like an indirect, coded response to what was then an American national debate over same-sex marriage, a response that somehow managed simultaneously to avoid the acknowledgment that gay people exist. (Wright worked for the New Republic, which was at that time edited by a gay man who was politically conservative, and talking about the gays without really quite involving the gays is how I've always understood that magazine.) And partly, it seems old because it is old. It was published a quarter-century ago, and the science is already a bit dated. Written at the moment just before the Big Bang of cell phones and Internet transformed American culture, the book's discussion of social behavior and our concern with social status is missing our usual contemporary reference points. Thus the Economist's blurb on the paperback — ""destined to become a classic"" — may have been a bit premature, in my view. Not entirely the fault of the book, but more the fault of the year 1994: a reflection on how rapidly the world, and our understanding of it, is changing.The first and longest part is about sex between men and women, in which Wright argues that monogamy is unnatural. (The word ""homosexual"" only appears twice in this part, and then only to describe ""mistaken homosexual courtship"" among frogs and ""periodic homosexual behavior"" among bonobos that is supposedly ""a way of saying, 'Let's be friends.'"") The second part is about reciprocal altruism. The third part is about how we use these behaviors to negotiate our social status. The fourth part is about how this awareness can result in ""a self-consciousness so acute, and a cynicism so deep, that ironic detachment from the whole human enterprise may provide the only relief,"" raising the question of whether ""the word moral can be anything but a joke."" There is a paradox at the heart of the question of whether humans are basically good: ""To be moral animals, we must realize how thoroughly we aren't."" To me, this echoes a critique of the logical inconsistency in the idea of God's omnibenevolence — to be good is to spot errors and continually self-improve, which you can't do if you're already perfect. Yes, humans are inherently moral, in the sense that we are motivated (both consciously and unconsciously) to continually adjust our behavior. The part that is conscious is arguably, by definition, not natural. Its content transcends its natural origin.It's a clear, easily readable introduction to the scientific concept that traits evolve because they benefit survival and reproduction. The book describes how, for a social species like humans, altruistic behavior can evolve (because altruistic acts support the group's survival while enhancing the altruistic individual's reputation within the group). I may have picked this book up as an undergraduate or even as a high school student; it is underlined, apparently by a student who may have been me. It may still serve people who want this introductory material. If you're already clear on this concept, you may want a more scientifically up-to-date book with a more specific thesis."
162,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1579132-christopher,3,"Fascinating and dense. Wright discusses how an evolutionary model can explain human instincts and behavior. Importantly, he doesn't dictate that our behavior isn't changeable, nor that evolutionary results dictate what our moral code should be.My favorite parts were applying these general rules to Darwin's own biography. Darwin was extremely moral and kind. I also very much enjoyed the last quarter, where he discusses J.S. Mill's utilitarianism as the author's moral philosophy of choice. It was fun, because ""Origin of the Species"" and Mill's ""On Liberty"" were both published in 1859.In the first half, Wright thoroughly examines humanity's sexual instincts. For biology, this makes sense, as all biology is understood through reproductive behavior. Although the author did emphasize the fallacy of mixing the ""is"" for the ""ought"", he also characterized his book as a quasi-self-help. The ought comes through with the last quarter discussing Mill, but the first third needed more ""is"". Case in point, humans (both sexes, but men more) instinctively cheat on their spouses, and there was an evolutionary advantage to doing so. He fails to convince that this isn't an ""ought"", by never quite giving adequate description of how a successful monogamous marriage works, given our evolutionary instincts.I really loved his discussion of human hierarchy. All tribes and cultures exhibit this tendency. It is the cause of so much human strife, competition, wars, and destruction. But it also motivates us with ambition and creativity. We are also adept at figuring out our pecking order. Better to learn it through a signal, than taking the costly route to duking it out to verify it. Our yearn to be on top, is also easy to describe evolutionary. The male who was on top, mated with the most females, thus sending those ambitious genes forward.One last fascinating story. Some squirrels, upon seeing a predator, will yelp and freeze up, causing the predator to hear him, catch him, and eat him. How could this be evolutionary advantageous? Because their siblings (who share a huge amount of the same genes), will be preserved by the sacrificial yelper. Thus, those genes are repeated along. Evolution doesn't care about individuals, it only cares about one thing: repeating genes. This type of sacrificial response, explains why we are more willing to sacrifice ourselves, the closer the kin. The further away they are related, the less our genes will be in common, the lower our willingness to sacrifice ourselves. Not that this process is consciously driven; genes don't think.Again, the book was interesting and dense. The second half stronger than the first half. I'd be really interested to see where the science has lead since his writing it in the early 1990's."
163,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54518540-cam-lidstone,4,"Robert Wright's The Moral Animal was one of the much-talked-about books on evolutionary psychology in the 1990s along with Ridley's The Red Queen and The Origins of Virtue, Pinker's How the Mind Works, and Tooby and Cosmides' The Adapted Mind.The book comprehensively and accessibly lays out an understanding of the evolution of human's moral sentiments. Wright's a clear writer who manages to convey the importance of Darwin and his theory of natural selection while maintaining an irreverence and wit. I wasn't fully on board with Wright's conceit: alternating between explanations of evolutionary logic and brief snippets of Darwin's life (explained through the lens of evolutionary psychology). The case studies are too anecdotal and there are better Darwin biographies elsewhere. Wright excels when he communicates and recognises the importance of the work of the eminent evolutionary biologists George C Williams, William D Hamilton, Robert Trivers, and John Maynard Smith.Their collective work, which was popularised in the mid-70s via Dawkins' The Selfish Gene and E.O. Wilson's Sociobiology, sets the foundation of a scientific understanding of the human condition. Their key insights help explain five key relationships: males and females (unequal levels of parental investment and thus differing sexual strategies); parents and their children and siblings with each other (parental-offspring conflict); friends and acquaintances (reciprocal altruism); and people's relationship with themselves (self-deception). I recommend this book to people who know the basics of evolution but you can skip the chapters on Darwin. If you are completely new to the evolution, the best entry points are insteaed probably Dawkins and Gould."

He thought: This is what I should feel all the time for everyone.…""—Graham Greene, The Power and the GloryThe moment I started reading about evolutionary psychology, it was a massive revelation for me. It was the beginning of an understanding of a field, that would have spared me much relief from the pain, confusion, and guilt that stemmed from my many quirks as a human being. It provided for the first time, a reason why, I was the way I was. As a computer programmer, it showed me how I had been programmed: evolution, and revealed the programmer: natural selection.This is in essence, an instruction manual for oneself. It attempts to explain our behaviors, motivations, and personality in the realm of our extremely subjective, anthropocentric world, and in doing so, it becomes clear just how strong the case for evolutionary psychology is. As illuminating as it is, it is also a harsh manual. Many will claim that it deromanticizes much of what is noble, and beautiful about human nature, but it does more to demystify, and explain. These new findings can be demoralizing, and difficult to accept, but it is the truth. This is something that Charles Darwin himself was well aware of, and tactfully left out in ""The Origin of Species,"" and simply suggested (towards the end of the book,) a Darwinian view of human psychology in the future, “light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.”Why was it such a revelation? On a personal level, it provided explanations about my heartbreaks, relationships, and love. It was also the first time I realized there was a solid science to understanding people. Almost everything we do revolves around other people, and I had stumbled on a blueprint of their character.“Lasting love is something a person has to decide to experience. Lifelong monogamous devotion is just not natural—not for women even, and emphatically not for men. It requires what, for lack of a better term, we can call an act of will. . . . This isn't to say that a young man can't hope to be seized by love. . . . But whether the sheer fury of a man's feelings accurately gauges their likely endurance is another question. The ardor will surely fade, sooner or later, and the marriage will then live or die on respect, practical compatibility, simple affection, and (these days, especially) determination. With the help of these things, something worthy of the label 'love' can last until death. But it will be a different kind of love from the kind that began the marriage. Will it be a richer love, a deeper love, a more spiritual love? Opinions vary. But it's certainly a more impressive love.”Evolutionary psychology has a long way ahead of itself, but it is the beginning of an understanding of the human mind. It has much potential for practical applications, and could one day provide law makers with a firm logical base when making decisions. Perhaps one day, it could lead to a scientific basis for morality. So far, for most of human history, moral philosophers have discussed morality with only an intuitive understanding of human nature, which is to say, the ""how:"" our behaviors, and motivations. Intuition may feel right, but it is hardly scientific. Now, unsuppressed by divine authority, we have an academic field that describes the ""why"" of human nature, and how can anyone claim ideals on how to act, before we realize our limitations as human beings?"

It explains nearly every human emotion and behaviour, the human institutions, morality, society and social status, our biases, why they are beneficial for us. The important point which the author states, is that if you know about your biological programming, you can eventually overcome it, understand yourself, others and social situations better and therefore make better decisions.It has revealed for me some ugly (by romantic or humanist standarts) truths about friendships, family and romantic relationships, but in the end it is a relief, to know the ""why"". "
172,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43622620-jessica,2,"I found the author's presentation of his case generally comprehensible, though perhaps unnecessarily long-winded, with a tendency to digress too far (IMO) into his examples (mostly drawn from Darwin's life).(I apologize in advance to any readers in the know, if my understanding of logical fallacies is imperfect...)He may be accurate in his conclusions. However, now I need to go read more on the topic, because his understanding of the new Darwinism seems to be based mostly on the work of two researchers, which seems a bit narrow to support his conclusions. (Does that constitute some form of formal- or informal- fallacy?)I don't entirely disagree with his conclusions (about human nature). And it's not the notion that we can't help what evolution has handed to us, that offends me; it's the author's solution to this seeming lack of control. In the final third of the book, I think he too readily dismisses unconscious evolutionary 'decision-making' as a basis for a moral code. I wouldn't use it as a basis for a moral code, either. But his reaction against it smacks of panic.I can think of a couple of possible explanations for this:1- He knows that if he doesn't take a position strongly against evolutionary biology as a basis for a moral code, people will assume he is for it.2- He has a personal horror of his own conclusions, and is consequently trying to smooth them over with an alternative (mainly the philosophy of utilitarianism, which seems to assume that there is (a) no moral difference between your family and anyone else, or (b) that it is not possible to be moral without an imposed morality (that includes utilitarianism)).Isn't there anyone knowledgeable on this subject, who simply presents the facts without assigning a value judgement to them??Also, the author apparently cannot tell the difference between logical and reasonable. That is, he extrapolates from the evidence he presents us with to what he thinks is a logical conclusion, but to an absurd degree (which is not reasonable). He seems to think that, since we are under the influence of our evolutionary past, we can't naturally be reasonable at all. Isn't that a form of reductio ad absurdum (sp?)?The ability to reason is part of what makes us human! (Or, if you will, it is part of what differentiates us from other bipeds.) So is the concept of a middle ground- i.e., it's not either all one conclusion or all one other. (Oh God- false dilemma! Argh!)Stopped with 36 pages left to go, because I couldn't bring myself to finish it. The text is way too biased, and not in favor of humanity as he understands it."
173,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57956231-ailith-twinning,1,"Would have been better if it had just been a biography of Darwin, I really felt his admiration while reading those parts and enjoyed the vicarious experience of his feeling. I'm not qualified to critique Evolutionary Psychology - so I won't. The obviously nuts stuff speaks for itself, and those actually in the field do a decent job kicking the authors of that crap in the ass. Now, if only they could manage to get economists banned from writing in the field at all. And, for a philosophical critique, turn to (good) feminist and anti-racist authors. Also Post-Modernist critique which is more a philosophy of why some practitioners apply the scientific method wrongly than the popular conversation about some anti-science theory. This critique applies at least triply for economists skimming the field (to mix metaphors). But what really irked me was the closing stuff -- One of the less common interpretations of Utilitarianism gets, not only acknowledged, but endorsed, only for Wright to then use some seriously half-assed moral conservatism to defend perverting the philosophy into a compromise between its worst interpretations (The USSR, Third Reich, British Empire, and American Empire as various examples) and its actual implications (frankly, Socialism). So you get some kind of messy Meritocracy, right after you (correctly) point out that ""Merit"" is a question wrongly put. It's certainly my personal position that leads to it, but the wretched attempt to justify a torturous prison state (""make the world safe for blame"", as the saying goes) was just the final straw for me, and sufficiently direct to render even the most generous interpretation a fully unacceptable argument. And, if the philosophy is not something the book may be justly judged as a whole for - then why is it there? More to the point, it should not be there, if the purpose is not precisely to frame what came before. So, the explicitly philosophical section is the last straw before generosity must end, and the book fall under the strain of its shitty philosophy -- or its just another bit of bad thoughts in a long chain of (disjointed) bad thoughts, interspersed with some admirably genuine gushing about an idol (Darwin)."
174,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1098316-jamie,3,"Using the writings of Charles Darwin to deliver its human morality principles, I felt by the end of this book that I had learnt more about the great man than I had about myself. One problem with this book is that by centering on life in the 19th century, its themes were often not as relevant to society today. For instance, it may be advantageous for women to play a little harder to get in the game of love, but this is unlikely to have a significant implication towards social status today. Another example, families are unlikely to favor a child simply because they have a greater chance of moving up in socioeconomic circles. I further disagreed with the premise that each person has no free will, we may all inherit a certain instinct, but an instinct does not define our actions in their entirety. Some underlying truths in this book are thought provoking. Man is not intended to be monogomous, but such cultural norms likely maintain social cohesion by allowing a more equal pairing of men and women. We are rarely content with the present and constantly focused on status signals and self aggrandizement, hence, our morals are essentially innate feelings driven by selfish goals, which require constant self-reflection and scepticism to control. This is also a singificant reason why all major religious have the same central themes, which have been considered necessary to guide our innate morals towards the promotion of social harmony.Charles Darwin said this in 1882, and to me it is the key message I will take out of the book: ""As man advances in civilisation, and small tribes are united to larger communities, the simplest reason would tell each individual that he ought to extend his social instincts and sympathies to all the members of the same nation, though personally unkown to him. This point being once reached, there is only an aftifical barrier to prevent his sympathies extending to the men of all nations and races."" Humanity will continue to evolve and our success is dependent on the ability to empathize with all life on this planet.  "
175,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5817744-emma-b,3,"I'm about 100 pages in, and the material is quite fascinating. The book basically links every single trait of humanity back to an adaptation in the ancestral environment.I just wish he'd stop personifying natural selection.Correction, deifying.That kinda defeats the purpose of science.-------------Upon finishing the book, my final opinion is that it was decent, but not fantastic. His deification of the process of natural selection trailed off, much to my relief. The book itself consisted mostly of references and quotes to previous studies, with little interjection by the author, but it was nice to have all that data in one place and in a logical order. The concept of reciprocal altruism, by which humans develop societies, relationships, and most of our higher emotions, was quite interesting, even if a bit common-sensical. It was explained, if perhaps to death, very well, and was easy to understand.The chapters concerning Darwin himself I found to be less than interesting. Many times, the author decided to stray far into the depths of biography, leading us through the childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and finally death of Charles Darwin himself. These chapters were sprinkled with psychological notes with either no apparent relevance or no apparent basis. I found myself leafing quickly through them, hoping to skip past the psych profile of a long-dead man and return to the science.The final chapter, I believe, had no real reason to exist, or at least not to be as long as it was. It was the conclusion, a summation and review of the ideas covered in the book, which didn't number very many, and it made up about 1/5th of the whole book's length. It seemed simply unnecessary. A nice, ten-page abstract and a 'how this info could be used' section I think would have been a much nicer way to end the book.All in all, it was alright, though not nearly as educational as I'd hoped. I've walked away with some new vocab and a basal understanding of this branch of psychology though, which means it wasn't a waste."
176,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17983541-sam,2,"I thought there were some interesting ideas in this book (particularly the suggestion that awareness of the evolutionary roots of behaviour can guide morality by making us conscious of biases and types of reactions that are ill-suited to modern industrial life), but for me there was also one significant flaw: Going by this book, it seems that Wright thinks natural selection shaped humankind predominantly by acting on men. His discussion of women in evolution relates mostly to the Madonna-whore dichotomy, and an odd diversion in which he argues that polygamy should be embraced by feminists because it means more women can choose to marry a high-status man, getting more resources as one of several wives than they might as the single wife of a lower status man. Even when discussing issues unrelated to sex, our male ancestors apparently were the key to evolutionary changes. For example, on p285: 'Feelings of enmity, of grievance, of righteous indignation - of collective enmity and grievance and righteous indignation - probably have their deepest roots in ancient conflicts within bands of humans and pre-humans. In particular: in conflicts among coalitions of males for status.' (What, because female humans and pre-humans never felt group loyalty or righteous indignation?). Another example: in the index, there are 12 topics listed under 'male parental investment,' whereas 'female parental investment' isn't even listed (there is, however, an entry for 'feminism - sexual symmetry as doctrine of'). Based on the assumption that natural selection operates on ALL members of a species, I can't help but doubt the accuracy of at least some of Wright's ideas, given that he seems so focused on only half of the ancestral pool."
177,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51128101-amanda,3,"First of all, I fully acknowledge that this book was outside of my comfort zone as a reader. I do enjoy nonfiction and even the occasional scientific book, but those “sciencey” books are usually about the non-human natural world. Astronomy, for instance, or botany. Furthermore, I have something of a background in sociology, so reading a book that favors biological rather than social explanations for human behavior was a bit difficult for me. That said, I found Wright’s book to be a good primer on evolutionary psychology. As a total newcomer to the field, I never felt completely out of my depth. A bit skeptical from time to time, but not nearly as much as I expected. I think Wright does a good job, not only of conveying the information, but of making it understandable as well. To be entirely fair, I can’t say how accurate the information or its usage is because, as I said, I’m a novice here. My biggest issue was probably Wright’s tactic of anthropomorphizing natural selection: it “wants” this, it designed us to do that. I see how this could be a valid explanatory tactic, but it just ended up making me have to reread and rethink. Something else, more a personal gripe than anything else, is that, when the book talks about sexual attraction/relationships/etc., it’s exclusively heterosexual. As a lesbian, I found myself wondering throughout the book, “But what about the queers?” In the FAQ section at the back of my copy, Wright acknowledges the subject, but mostly brushes it off, essentially saying, “It doesn’t really matter how natural it is; some people are gay and, morally, I think that should be the end of the discussion.” And, like, that’s great, dude. But that’s not what I asked. Overall, I found the book pretty much understandable, but just not that engrossing. "
178,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,1,"Confused book. It seems to be a blend of something called evolutionary psychology, a biography of Charles Darwin and an argument for returning to Victorian morals. As such the book is often slow and confused. These three strands are interweaved and frankly, become uninteresting as the book goes along. The writing is often repetitive, saying the same things about natural selection over and over for example. The analysis is not great either…the author touts something called evolutionary psychology which he doesn’t convince me exists. I think of psychology as being culture and social related…evolution is entirely biological…yes, we have feeling, but they’re shaped by chemistry and biology. How we view these feelings is psychology which, outside of neurology is a social construct. I found the biography of Darwin distracting and detracting…if I wanted to read a biography of Darwin, there are full length better books out there. Lastly, if I wanted to read about why we should return to Victorian morals, there are better arguments and books which focus on the society not biology. In short, I wanted to read a book about the science of evolutionary psychology not a political polemic or a biography. The latter wasn’t even convincingly argued and so I’m not just disappointed, I’m disgusted I spent money on this book. So, I give this a 1. It fails in every respect. It can’t even convince me that evolutionary psychology is a thing and the rest of the book is just filler and a waste of the reader’s time. "
179,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"This is the most fluent, starting from scratch book on the subject of evolution I have read. There is no presupposition of prior knowledge. And the author makes good use of popular notions of the Darwinian theory to throw light on understandings that are wrong, answer those common questions most of us have in mind and explain the real meaning of evolution.Unlike Dawkins' books which are turgid at times because of too many examples from the behaviours of species of various kind (most of those species that non-experts have never heard of) , Wright mostly uses the life of Darwin himself to make many points. This appears odd for a theory that explicitly warns against the use of specifics, the approach works. It also helps that evolution is explained more from the viewpoint of where humanity has reached today than any other notions.Some of the conclusions are outrageous, particularly when they give genetic inevitability to morally/socially reprehensible behaviour. Equally, many conclusions - like in Freudian theories that the author so vehemently criticises - seem to be derived from highly glib, flimsily proven verbal/logical ""must be/could be"" rationales. Perhaps these things are inevitable without the quantified edifices of physical sciences, but they also prove to be the reasons behind relatively less acceptance of almost all the finer points of evolutionary theories."
180,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3558148-bob-pearson,4,"Evolutionary psychology speculates widely (some say wildly) about the origins of human behavior. It has come under fire on the grounds that its presumptions are assumptions not facts since much of its logic is based on what is not observable: the development of the human mind before history. The immense spectrum of human behavior makes it impossible to draw unquestionable links in many cases. Moreover, some evolutionary psychologists have tried to explain male dominance and even rape on the controlling power of genes. All that said, Robin Wright gives us an intriguing argument that accepts the selfishness of early humans as the trigger to actual unselfishness through interactions of mutual benefit among humans that also provide increased prestige and influence to the players. His approach outflanks the obstacle posed by previous narratives that insisted on confrontation between prehistoric human development and more modern societal development. Wright goes so far as to posit that ""brotherly love"" need have no religious inspiration but is a natural evolution of human behavior in groups. Hard to grasp sometimes and easy to criticize in places, his approach nevertheless offers an optimistic view of human development that might be worth serious attention. "

I only started to fully appreciate this book after I realized it was not a science book for non-scientist, but rather a philosophy book for non-philosophers.The author coherently ties together through an overriding narrative on our human psychology and moral development. While I've listened to most of the more recent books on the same topic from various authors (Dawkins, Diamond, Pinker, Gazzaniga, Wilson,Kahneman, and Ridley) available on Audible, none of them tied together the story as well as this book and make you feel the philosophical implications of the theory of evolutionary psychology.The book is dated (copyright 1994) but not out of date. Most of the stories told in the book I've heard versions of them in the more recent books. That's not a fault of the book. It's just that I read this book (in 2012) after having read the other books.I enjoyed this book so much that after listening I started listening to his other book, ""Nonzero"".Warning: this book has the ability to make you reassess you place in the universe and become more interested in philosophy.

I had been reading a lot about genes, evolution, etc. and was really curios about evolutionary psychology when I started to read this. Unfortunately Wright's book was very unfocused. He uses Darwin's personal life and story as a sort of thread holding the book toghether, which might sound great if you like evolution and Darwin. Unfortunately it mostly seems like he used Darwin's fame and speculated about his personal life to further his own ideas, which feels a bit cheap. Thus with this foundation he unsmoothly mixes stories about how Christian Darwin's wife was with unconvincing theories about the evolutionary background of rape. (To be clear I do think there's very possibly some evolutionary background to rape, but his account is very one sided basically claiming that a Victorian society was really nice for the ladies because less rape in the upper class or something. It didn't cut it for me.)There are plenty of interesting evolutionary psychology books in the world unfortunately this was not one of them. "

However, if you've comfortable with the subtleties of the term ""selfish"" in ""The Selfish Gene"" you will find the first half repetitive and the second half overly hand-wavy, vague and unconvincing.

What really sets this book apart is that the author uses Darwin's life -- his bio to explain Evolutionary Psychology to explain why we do what we do.

191,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"Wright describes the perspectives of evolutionary biologists over a hundred years, from Darwin to the late 20th century, who research human behavior. From an American reader's perspective (Wright is also American), this discourse seemed to be ""pre-9/11,"" and indeed (upon my check of the front pages) it was published in 1994. Reading it in 2020 feels already like a mini time-warp. It's tricky to pinpoint exactly why it doesn't get at 21st century concerns. Partly, it's because the first 150 pages focus on monogamy, reproduction, and marriage in a way that seems like an indirect, coded response to what was then an American national debate over same-sex marriage, a response that somehow managed simultaneously to avoid the acknowledgment that gay people exist. (Wright worked for the New Republic, which was at that time edited by a gay man who was politically conservative, and talking about the gays without really quite involving the gays is how I've always understood that magazine.) And partly, it seems old because it is old. It was published a quarter-century ago, and the science is already a bit dated. Written at the moment just before the Big Bang of cell phones and Internet transformed American culture, the book's discussion of social behavior and our concern with social status is missing our usual contemporary reference points. Thus the Economist's blurb on the paperback — ""destined to become a classic"" — may have been a bit premature, in my view. Not entirely the fault of the book, but more the fault of the year 1994: a reflection on how rapidly the world, and our understanding of it, is changing.The first and longest part is about sex between men and women, in which Wright argues that monogamy is unnatural. (The word ""homosexual"" only appears twice in this part, and then only to describe ""mistaken homosexual courtship"" among frogs and ""periodic homosexual behavior"" among bonobos that is supposedly ""a way of saying, 'Let's be friends.'"") The second part is about reciprocal altruism. The third part is about how we use these behaviors to negotiate our social status. The fourth part is about how this awareness can result in ""a self-consciousness so acute, and a cynicism so deep, that ironic detachment from the whole human enterprise may provide the only relief,"" raising the question of whether ""the word moral can be anything but a joke."" There is a paradox at the heart of the question of whether humans are basically good: ""To be moral animals, we must realize how thoroughly we aren't."" To me, this echoes a critique of the logical inconsistency in the idea of God's omnibenevolence — to be good is to spot errors and continually self-improve, which you can't do if you're already perfect. Yes, humans are inherently moral, in the sense that we are motivated (both consciously and unconsciously) to continually adjust our behavior. The part that is conscious is arguably, by definition, not natural. Its content transcends its natural origin.It's a clear, easily readable introduction to the scientific concept that traits evolve because they benefit survival and reproduction. The book describes how, for a social species like humans, altruistic behavior can evolve (because altruistic acts support the group's survival while enhancing the altruistic individual's reputation within the group). I may have picked this book up as an undergraduate or even as a high school student; it is underlined, apparently by a student who may have been me. It may still serve people who want this introductory material. If you're already clear on this concept, you may want a more scientifically up-to-date book with a more specific thesis."
192,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1579132-christopher,3,"Fascinating and dense. Wright discusses how an evolutionary model can explain human instincts and behavior. Importantly, he doesn't dictate that our behavior isn't changeable, nor that evolutionary results dictate what our moral code should be.My favorite parts were applying these general rules to Darwin's own biography. Darwin was extremely moral and kind. I also very much enjoyed the last quarter, where he discusses J.S. Mill's utilitarianism as the author's moral philosophy of choice. It was fun, because ""Origin of the Species"" and Mill's ""On Liberty"" were both published in 1859.In the first half, Wright thoroughly examines humanity's sexual instincts. For biology, this makes sense, as all biology is understood through reproductive behavior. Although the author did emphasize the fallacy of mixing the ""is"" for the ""ought"", he also characterized his book as a quasi-self-help. The ought comes through with the last quarter discussing Mill, but the first third needed more ""is"". Case in point, humans (both sexes, but men more) instinctively cheat on their spouses, and there was an evolutionary advantage to doing so. He fails to convince that this isn't an ""ought"", by never quite giving adequate description of how a successful monogamous marriage works, given our evolutionary instincts.I really loved his discussion of human hierarchy. All tribes and cultures exhibit this tendency. It is the cause of so much human strife, competition, wars, and destruction. But it also motivates us with ambition and creativity. We are also adept at figuring out our pecking order. Better to learn it through a signal, than taking the costly route to duking it out to verify it. Our yearn to be on top, is also easy to describe evolutionary. The male who was on top, mated with the most females, thus sending those ambitious genes forward.One last fascinating story. Some squirrels, upon seeing a predator, will yelp and freeze up, causing the predator to hear him, catch him, and eat him. How could this be evolutionary advantageous? Because their siblings (who share a huge amount of the same genes), will be preserved by the sacrificial yelper. Thus, those genes are repeated along. Evolution doesn't care about individuals, it only cares about one thing: repeating genes. This type of sacrificial response, explains why we are more willing to sacrifice ourselves, the closer the kin. The further away they are related, the less our genes will be in common, the lower our willingness to sacrifice ourselves. Not that this process is consciously driven; genes don't think.Again, the book was interesting and dense. The second half stronger than the first half. I'd be really interested to see where the science has lead since his writing it in the early 1990's."
193,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54518540-cam-lidstone,4,"Robert Wright's The Moral Animal was one of the much-talked-about books on evolutionary psychology in the 1990s along with Ridley's The Red Queen and The Origins of Virtue, Pinker's How the Mind Works, and Tooby and Cosmides' The Adapted Mind.The book comprehensively and accessibly lays out an understanding of the evolution of human's moral sentiments. Wright's a clear writer who manages to convey the importance of Darwin and his theory of natural selection while maintaining an irreverence and wit. I wasn't fully on board with Wright's conceit: alternating between explanations of evolutionary logic and brief snippets of Darwin's life (explained through the lens of evolutionary psychology). The case studies are too anecdotal and there are better Darwin biographies elsewhere. Wright excels when he communicates and recognises the importance of the work of the eminent evolutionary biologists George C Williams, William D Hamilton, Robert Trivers, and John Maynard Smith.Their collective work, which was popularised in the mid-70s via Dawkins' The Selfish Gene and E.O. Wilson's Sociobiology, sets the foundation of a scientific understanding of the human condition. Their key insights help explain five key relationships: males and females (unequal levels of parental investment and thus differing sexual strategies); parents and their children and siblings with each other (parental-offspring conflict); friends and acquaintances (reciprocal altruism); and people's relationship with themselves (self-deception). I recommend this book to people who know the basics of evolution but you can skip the chapters on Darwin. If you are completely new to the evolution, the best entry points are insteaed probably Dawkins and Gould."

He thought: This is what I should feel all the time for everyone.…""—Graham Greene, The Power and the GloryThe moment I started reading about evolutionary psychology, it was a massive revelation for me. It was the beginning of an understanding of a field, that would have spared me much relief from the pain, confusion, and guilt that stemmed from my many quirks as a human being. It provided for the first time, a reason why, I was the way I was. As a computer programmer, it showed me how I had been programmed: evolution, and revealed the programmer: natural selection.This is in essence, an instruction manual for oneself. It attempts to explain our behaviors, motivations, and personality in the realm of our extremely subjective, anthropocentric world, and in doing so, it becomes clear just how strong the case for evolutionary psychology is. As illuminating as it is, it is also a harsh manual. Many will claim that it deromanticizes much of what is noble, and beautiful about human nature, but it does more to demystify, and explain. These new findings can be demoralizing, and difficult to accept, but it is the truth. This is something that Charles Darwin himself was well aware of, and tactfully left out in ""The Origin of Species,"" and simply suggested (towards the end of the book,) a Darwinian view of human psychology in the future, “light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.”Why was it such a revelation? On a personal level, it provided explanations about my heartbreaks, relationships, and love. It was also the first time I realized there was a solid science to understanding people. Almost everything we do revolves around other people, and I had stumbled on a blueprint of their character.“Lasting love is something a person has to decide to experience. Lifelong monogamous devotion is just not natural—not for women even, and emphatically not for men. It requires what, for lack of a better term, we can call an act of will. . . . This isn't to say that a young man can't hope to be seized by love. . . . But whether the sheer fury of a man's feelings accurately gauges their likely endurance is another question. The ardor will surely fade, sooner or later, and the marriage will then live or die on respect, practical compatibility, simple affection, and (these days, especially) determination. With the help of these things, something worthy of the label 'love' can last until death. But it will be a different kind of love from the kind that began the marriage. Will it be a richer love, a deeper love, a more spiritual love? Opinions vary. But it's certainly a more impressive love.”Evolutionary psychology has a long way ahead of itself, but it is the beginning of an understanding of the human mind. It has much potential for practical applications, and could one day provide law makers with a firm logical base when making decisions. Perhaps one day, it could lead to a scientific basis for morality. So far, for most of human history, moral philosophers have discussed morality with only an intuitive understanding of human nature, which is to say, the ""how:"" our behaviors, and motivations. Intuition may feel right, but it is hardly scientific. Now, unsuppressed by divine authority, we have an academic field that describes the ""why"" of human nature, and how can anyone claim ideals on how to act, before we realize our limitations as human beings?"

The important point which the author states, is that if you know about your biological programming, you can eventually overcome it, understand yourself, others and social situations better and therefore make better decisions.It has revealed for me some ugly (by romantic or humanist standarts) truths about friendships, family and romantic relationships, but in the end it is a relief, to know the ""why"".

202,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43622620-jessica,2,"I found the author's presentation of his case generally comprehensible, though perhaps unnecessarily long-winded, with a tendency to digress too far (IMO) into his examples (mostly drawn from Darwin's life).(I apologize in advance to any readers in the know, if my understanding of logical fallacies is imperfect...)He may be accurate in his conclusions. However, now I need to go read more on the topic, because his understanding of the new Darwinism seems to be based mostly on the work of two researchers, which seems a bit narrow to support his conclusions. (Does that constitute some form of formal- or informal- fallacy?)I don't entirely disagree with his conclusions (about human nature). And it's not the notion that we can't help what evolution has handed to us, that offends me; it's the author's solution to this seeming lack of control. In the final third of the book, I think he too readily dismisses unconscious evolutionary 'decision-making' as a basis for a moral code. I wouldn't use it as a basis for a moral code, either. But his reaction against it smacks of panic.I can think of a couple of possible explanations for this:1- He knows that if he doesn't take a position strongly against evolutionary biology as a basis for a moral code, people will assume he is for it.2- He has a personal horror of his own conclusions, and is consequently trying to smooth them over with an alternative (mainly the philosophy of utilitarianism, which seems to assume that there is (a) no moral difference between your family and anyone else, or (b) that it is not possible to be moral without an imposed morality (that includes utilitarianism)).Isn't there anyone knowledgeable on this subject, who simply presents the facts without assigning a value judgement to them??Also, the author apparently cannot tell the difference between logical and reasonable. That is, he extrapolates from the evidence he presents us with to what he thinks is a logical conclusion, but to an absurd degree (which is not reasonable). He seems to think that, since we are under the influence of our evolutionary past, we can't naturally be reasonable at all. Isn't that a form of reductio ad absurdum (sp?)?The ability to reason is part of what makes us human! (Or, if you will, it is part of what differentiates us from other bipeds.) So is the concept of a middle ground- i.e., it's not either all one conclusion or all one other. (Oh God- false dilemma!

203,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57956231-ailith-twinning,1,"Would have been better if it had just been a biography of Darwin, I really felt his admiration while reading those parts and enjoyed the vicarious experience of his feeling. I'm not qualified to critique Evolutionary Psychology - so I won't. The obviously nuts stuff speaks for itself, and those actually in the field do a decent job kicking the authors of that crap in the ass. Now, if only they could manage to get economists banned from writing in the field at all. And, for a philosophical critique, turn to (good) feminist and anti-racist authors. Also Post-Modernist critique which is more a philosophy of why some practitioners apply the scientific method wrongly than the popular conversation about some anti-science theory. This critique applies at least triply for economists skimming the field (to mix metaphors). But what really irked me was the closing stuff -- One of the less common interpretations of Utilitarianism gets, not only acknowledged, but endorsed, only for Wright to then use some seriously half-assed moral conservatism to defend perverting the philosophy into a compromise between its worst interpretations (The USSR, Third Reich, British Empire, and American Empire as various examples) and its actual implications (frankly, Socialism). So you get some kind of messy Meritocracy, right after you (correctly) point out that ""Merit"" is a question wrongly put. It's certainly my personal position that leads to it, but the wretched attempt to justify a torturous prison state (""make the world safe for blame"", as the saying goes) was just the final straw for me, and sufficiently direct to render even the most generous interpretation a fully unacceptable argument. And, if the philosophy is not something the book may be justly judged as a whole for - then why is it there? More to the point, it should not be there, if the purpose is not precisely to frame what came before. So, the explicitly philosophical section is the last straw before generosity must end, and the book fall under the strain of its shitty philosophy -- or its just another bit of bad thoughts in a long chain of (disjointed) bad thoughts, interspersed with some admirably genuine gushing about an idol (Darwin)."
204,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1098316-jamie,3,"Using the writings of Charles Darwin to deliver its human morality principles, I felt by the end of this book that I had learnt more about the great man than I had about myself. One problem with this book is that by centering on life in the 19th century, its themes were often not as relevant to society today. For instance, it may be advantageous for women to play a little harder to get in the game of love, but this is unlikely to have a significant implication towards social status today. Another example, families are unlikely to favor a child simply because they have a greater chance of moving up in socioeconomic circles. I further disagreed with the premise that each person has no free will, we may all inherit a certain instinct, but an instinct does not define our actions in their entirety. Some underlying truths in this book are thought provoking. Man is not intended to be monogomous, but such cultural norms likely maintain social cohesion by allowing a more equal pairing of men and women. We are rarely content with the present and constantly focused on status signals and self aggrandizement, hence, our morals are essentially innate feelings driven by selfish goals, which require constant self-reflection and scepticism to control. This is also a singificant reason why all major religious have the same central themes, which have been considered necessary to guide our innate morals towards the promotion of social harmony.Charles Darwin said this in 1882, and to me it is the key message I will take out of the book: ""As man advances in civilisation, and small tribes are united to larger communities, the simplest reason would tell each individual that he ought to extend his social instincts and sympathies to all the members of the same nation, though personally unkown to him. This point being once reached, there is only an aftifical barrier to prevent his sympathies extending to the men of all nations and races."" Humanity will continue to evolve and our success is dependent on the ability to empathize with all life on this planet.  "

The book itself consisted mostly of references and quotes to previous studies, with little interjection by the author, but it was nice to have all that data in one place and in a logical order. The concept of reciprocal altruism, by which humans develop societies, relationships, and most of our higher emotions, was quite interesting, even if a bit common-sensical. It was explained, if perhaps to death, very well, and was easy to understand.The chapters concerning Darwin himself I found to be less than interesting. Many times, the author decided to stray far into the depths of biography, leading us through the childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and finally death of Charles Darwin himself. These chapters were sprinkled with psychological notes with either no apparent relevance or no apparent basis. I found myself leafing quickly through them, hoping to skip past the psych profile of a long-dead man and return to the science.The final chapter, I believe, had no real reason to exist, or at least not to be as long as it was. It was the conclusion, a summation and review of the ideas covered in the book, which didn't number very many, and it made up about 1/5th of the whole book's length. It seemed simply unnecessary. A nice, ten-page abstract and a 'how this info could be used' section I think would have been a much nicer way to end the book.All in all, it was alright, though not nearly as educational as I'd hoped. I've walked away with some new vocab and a basal understanding of this branch of psychology though, which means it wasn't a waste."
206,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17983541-sam,2,"I thought there were some interesting ideas in this book (particularly the suggestion that awareness of the evolutionary roots of behaviour can guide morality by making us conscious of biases and types of reactions that are ill-suited to modern industrial life), but for me there was also one significant flaw: Going by this book, it seems that Wright thinks natural selection shaped humankind predominantly by acting on men. His discussion of women in evolution relates mostly to the Madonna-whore dichotomy, and an odd diversion in which he argues that polygamy should be embraced by feminists because it means more women can choose to marry a high-status man, getting more resources as one of several wives than they might as the single wife of a lower status man. Even when discussing issues unrelated to sex, our male ancestors apparently were the key to evolutionary changes. For example, on p285: 'Feelings of enmity, of grievance, of righteous indignation - of collective enmity and grievance and righteous indignation - probably have their deepest roots in ancient conflicts within bands of humans and pre-humans. In particular: in conflicts among coalitions of males for status.' (What, because female humans and pre-humans never felt group loyalty or righteous indignation?). Another example: in the index, there are 12 topics listed under 'male parental investment,' whereas 'female parental investment' isn't even listed (there is, however, an entry for 'feminism - sexual symmetry as doctrine of'). Based on the assumption that natural selection operates on ALL members of a species, I can't help but doubt the accuracy of at least some of Wright's ideas, given that he seems so focused on only half of the ancestral pool."
207,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51128101-amanda,3,"First of all, I fully acknowledge that this book was outside of my comfort zone as a reader. I do enjoy nonfiction and even the occasional scientific book, but those “sciencey” books are usually about the non-human natural world. Astronomy, for instance, or botany. Furthermore, I have something of a background in sociology, so reading a book that favors biological rather than social explanations for human behavior was a bit difficult for me. That said, I found Wright’s book to be a good primer on evolutionary psychology. As a total newcomer to the field, I never felt completely out of my depth. A bit skeptical from time to time, but not nearly as much as I expected. I think Wright does a good job, not only of conveying the information, but of making it understandable as well. To be entirely fair, I can’t say how accurate the information or its usage is because, as I said, I’m a novice here. My biggest issue was probably Wright’s tactic of anthropomorphizing natural selection: it “wants” this, it designed us to do that. I see how this could be a valid explanatory tactic, but it just ended up making me have to reread and rethink. Something else, more a personal gripe than anything else, is that, when the book talks about sexual attraction/relationships/etc., it’s exclusively heterosexual. As a lesbian, I found myself wondering throughout the book, “But what about the queers?” In the FAQ section at the back of my copy, Wright acknowledges the subject, but mostly brushes it off, essentially saying, “It doesn’t really matter how natural it is; some people are gay and, morally, I think that should be the end of the discussion.” And, like, that’s great, dude. But that’s not what I asked. Overall, I found the book pretty much understandable, but just not that engrossing. "
208,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,1,"Confused book. It seems to be a blend of something called evolutionary psychology, a biography of Charles Darwin and an argument for returning to Victorian morals. As such the book is often slow and confused. These three strands are interweaved and frankly, become uninteresting as the book goes along. The writing is often repetitive, saying the same things about natural selection over and over for example. The analysis is not great either…the author touts something called evolutionary psychology which he doesn’t convince me exists. I think of psychology as being culture and social related…evolution is entirely biological…yes, we have feeling, but they’re shaped by chemistry and biology. How we view these feelings is psychology which, outside of neurology is a social construct. I found the biography of Darwin distracting and detracting…if I wanted to read a biography of Darwin, there are full length better books out there. Lastly, if I wanted to read about why we should return to Victorian morals, there are better arguments and books which focus on the society not biology. In short, I wanted to read a book about the science of evolutionary psychology not a political polemic or a biography. The latter wasn’t even convincingly argued and so I’m not just disappointed, I’m disgusted I spent money on this book. So, I give this a 1. It fails in every respect. It can’t even convince me that evolutionary psychology is a thing and the rest of the book is just filler and a waste of the reader’s time. "
209,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"This is the most fluent, starting from scratch book on the subject of evolution I have read. There is no presupposition of prior knowledge. And the author makes good use of popular notions of the Darwinian theory to throw light on understandings that are wrong, answer those common questions most of us have in mind and explain the real meaning of evolution.Unlike Dawkins' books which are turgid at times because of too many examples from the behaviours of species of various kind (most of those species that non-experts have never heard of) , Wright mostly uses the life of Darwin himself to make many points. This appears odd for a theory that explicitly warns against the use of specifics, the approach works. It also helps that evolution is explained more from the viewpoint of where humanity has reached today than any other notions.Some of the conclusions are outrageous, particularly when they give genetic inevitability to morally/socially reprehensible behaviour. Equally, many conclusions - like in Freudian theories that the author so vehemently criticises - seem to be derived from highly glib, flimsily proven verbal/logical ""must be/could be"" rationales. Perhaps these things are inevitable without the quantified edifices of physical sciences, but they also prove to be the reasons behind relatively less acceptance of almost all the finer points of evolutionary theories."
210,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3558148-bob-pearson,4,"Evolutionary psychology speculates widely (some say wildly) about the origins of human behavior. It has come under fire on the grounds that its presumptions are assumptions not facts since much of its logic is based on what is not observable: the development of the human mind before history. The immense spectrum of human behavior makes it impossible to draw unquestionable links in many cases. Moreover, some evolutionary psychologists have tried to explain male dominance and even rape on the controlling power of genes. All that said, Robin Wright gives us an intriguing argument that accepts the selfishness of early humans as the trigger to actual unselfishness through interactions of mutual benefit among humans that also provide increased prestige and influence to the players. His approach outflanks the obstacle posed by previous narratives that insisted on confrontation between prehistoric human development and more modern societal development. Wright goes so far as to posit that ""brotherly love"" need have no religious inspiration but is a natural evolution of human behavior in groups. Hard to grasp sometimes and easy to criticize in places, his approach nevertheless offers an optimistic view of human development that might be worth serious attention. "

I only started to fully appreciate this book after I realized it was not a science book for non-scientist, but rather a philosophy book for non-philosophers.The author coherently ties together through an overriding narrative on our human psychology and moral development. While I've listened to most of the more recent books on the same topic from various authors (Dawkins, Diamond, Pinker, Gazzaniga, Wilson,Kahneman, and Ridley) available on Audible, none of them tied together the story as well as this book and make you feel the philosophical implications of the theory of evolutionary psychology.The book is dated (copyright 1994) but not out of date. Most of the stories told in the book I've heard versions of them in the more recent books. That's not a fault of the book. It's just that I read this book (in 2012) after having read the other books.I enjoyed this book so much that after listening I started listening to his other book, ""Nonzero"".Warning: this book has the ability to make you reassess you place in the universe and become more interested in philosophy.

I had been reading a lot about genes, evolution, etc. and was really curios about evolutionary psychology when I started to read this. Unfortunately Wright's book was very unfocused. He uses Darwin's personal life and story as a sort of thread holding the book toghether, which might sound great if you like evolution and Darwin. Unfortunately it mostly seems like he used Darwin's fame and speculated about his personal life to further his own ideas, which feels a bit cheap. Thus with this foundation he unsmoothly mixes stories about how Christian Darwin's wife was with unconvincing theories about the evolutionary background of rape. (To be clear I do think there's very possibly some evolutionary background to rape, but his account is very one sided basically claiming that a Victorian society was really nice for the ladies because less rape in the upper class or something. It didn't cut it for me.)There are plenty of interesting evolutionary psychology books in the world unfortunately this was not one of them. "

However, if you've comfortable with the subtleties of the term ""selfish"" in ""The Selfish Gene"" you will find the first half repetitive and the second half overly hand-wavy, vague and unconvincing.

What really sets this book apart is that the author uses Darwin's life -- his bio to explain Evolutionary Psychology to explain why we do what we do.

221,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"Wright describes the perspectives of evolutionary biologists over a hundred years, from Darwin to the late 20th century, who research human behavior. From an American reader's perspective (Wright is also American), this discourse seemed to be ""pre-9/11,"" and indeed (upon my check of the front pages) it was published in 1994. Reading it in 2020 feels already like a mini time-warp. It's tricky to pinpoint exactly why it doesn't get at 21st century concerns. Partly, it's because the first 150 pages focus on monogamy, reproduction, and marriage in a way that seems like an indirect, coded response to what was then an American national debate over same-sex marriage, a response that somehow managed simultaneously to avoid the acknowledgment that gay people exist. (Wright worked for the New Republic, which was at that time edited by a gay man who was politically conservative, and talking about the gays without really quite involving the gays is how I've always understood that magazine.) And partly, it seems old because it is old. It was published a quarter-century ago, and the science is already a bit dated. Written at the moment just before the Big Bang of cell phones and Internet transformed American culture, the book's discussion of social behavior and our concern with social status is missing our usual contemporary reference points. Thus the Economist's blurb on the paperback — ""destined to become a classic"" — may have been a bit premature, in my view. Not entirely the fault of the book, but more the fault of the year 1994: a reflection on how rapidly the world, and our understanding of it, is changing.The first and longest part is about sex between men and women, in which Wright argues that monogamy is unnatural. (The word ""homosexual"" only appears twice in this part, and then only to describe ""mistaken homosexual courtship"" among frogs and ""periodic homosexual behavior"" among bonobos that is supposedly ""a way of saying, 'Let's be friends.'"") The second part is about reciprocal altruism. The third part is about how we use these behaviors to negotiate our social status. The fourth part is about how this awareness can result in ""a self-consciousness so acute, and a cynicism so deep, that ironic detachment from the whole human enterprise may provide the only relief,"" raising the question of whether ""the word moral can be anything but a joke."" There is a paradox at the heart of the question of whether humans are basically good: ""To be moral animals, we must realize how thoroughly we aren't."" To me, this echoes a critique of the logical inconsistency in the idea of God's omnibenevolence — to be good is to spot errors and continually self-improve, which you can't do if you're already perfect. Yes, humans are inherently moral, in the sense that we are motivated (both consciously and unconsciously) to continually adjust our behavior. The part that is conscious is arguably, by definition, not natural. Its content transcends its natural origin.It's a clear, easily readable introduction to the scientific concept that traits evolve because they benefit survival and reproduction. The book describes how, for a social species like humans, altruistic behavior can evolve (because altruistic acts support the group's survival while enhancing the altruistic individual's reputation within the group). I may have picked this book up as an undergraduate or even as a high school student; it is underlined, apparently by a student who may have been me. It may still serve people who want this introductory material. If you're already clear on this concept, you may want a more scientifically up-to-date book with a more specific thesis."
222,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1579132-christopher,3,"Fascinating and dense. Wright discusses how an evolutionary model can explain human instincts and behavior. Importantly, he doesn't dictate that our behavior isn't changeable, nor that evolutionary results dictate what our moral code should be.My favorite parts were applying these general rules to Darwin's own biography. Darwin was extremely moral and kind. I also very much enjoyed the last quarter, where he discusses J.S. Mill's utilitarianism as the author's moral philosophy of choice. It was fun, because ""Origin of the Species"" and Mill's ""On Liberty"" were both published in 1859.In the first half, Wright thoroughly examines humanity's sexual instincts. For biology, this makes sense, as all biology is understood through reproductive behavior. Although the author did emphasize the fallacy of mixing the ""is"" for the ""ought"", he also characterized his book as a quasi-self-help. The ought comes through with the last quarter discussing Mill, but the first third needed more ""is"". Case in point, humans (both sexes, but men more) instinctively cheat on their spouses, and there was an evolutionary advantage to doing so. He fails to convince that this isn't an ""ought"", by never quite giving adequate description of how a successful monogamous marriage works, given our evolutionary instincts.I really loved his discussion of human hierarchy. All tribes and cultures exhibit this tendency. It is the cause of so much human strife, competition, wars, and destruction. But it also motivates us with ambition and creativity. We are also adept at figuring out our pecking order. Better to learn it through a signal, than taking the costly route to duking it out to verify it. Our yearn to be on top, is also easy to describe evolutionary. The male who was on top, mated with the most females, thus sending those ambitious genes forward.One last fascinating story. Some squirrels, upon seeing a predator, will yelp and freeze up, causing the predator to hear him, catch him, and eat him. How could this be evolutionary advantageous? Because their siblings (who share a huge amount of the same genes), will be preserved by the sacrificial yelper. Thus, those genes are repeated along. Evolution doesn't care about individuals, it only cares about one thing: repeating genes. This type of sacrificial response, explains why we are more willing to sacrifice ourselves, the closer the kin. The further away they are related, the less our genes will be in common, the lower our willingness to sacrifice ourselves. Not that this process is consciously driven; genes don't think.Again, the book was interesting and dense. The second half stronger than the first half. I'd be really interested to see where the science has lead since his writing it in the early 1990's."
223,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54518540-cam-lidstone,4,"Robert Wright's The Moral Animal was one of the much-talked-about books on evolutionary psychology in the 1990s along with Ridley's The Red Queen and The Origins of Virtue, Pinker's How the Mind Works, and Tooby and Cosmides' The Adapted Mind.The book comprehensively and accessibly lays out an understanding of the evolution of human's moral sentiments. Wright's a clear writer who manages to convey the importance of Darwin and his theory of natural selection while maintaining an irreverence and wit. I wasn't fully on board with Wright's conceit: alternating between explanations of evolutionary logic and brief snippets of Darwin's life (explained through the lens of evolutionary psychology). The case studies are too anecdotal and there are better Darwin biographies elsewhere. Wright excels when he communicates and recognises the importance of the work of the eminent evolutionary biologists George C Williams, William D Hamilton, Robert Trivers, and John Maynard Smith.Their collective work, which was popularised in the mid-70s via Dawkins' The Selfish Gene and E.O. Wilson's Sociobiology, sets the foundation of a scientific understanding of the human condition. Their key insights help explain five key relationships: males and females (unequal levels of parental investment and thus differing sexual strategies); parents and their children and siblings with each other (parental-offspring conflict); friends and acquaintances (reciprocal altruism); and people's relationship with themselves (self-deception). I recommend this book to people who know the basics of evolution but you can skip the chapters on Darwin. If you are completely new to the evolution, the best entry points are insteaed probably Dawkins and Gould."

He thought: This is what I should feel all the time for everyone.…""—Graham Greene, The Power and the GloryThe moment I started reading about evolutionary psychology, it was a massive revelation for me. It was the beginning of an understanding of a field, that would have spared me much relief from the pain, confusion, and guilt that stemmed from my many quirks as a human being. It provided for the first time, a reason why, I was the way I was. As a computer programmer, it showed me how I had been programmed: evolution, and revealed the programmer: natural selection.This is in essence, an instruction manual for oneself. It attempts to explain our behaviors, motivations, and personality in the realm of our extremely subjective, anthropocentric world, and in doing so, it becomes clear just how strong the case for evolutionary psychology is. As illuminating as it is, it is also a harsh manual. Many will claim that it deromanticizes much of what is noble, and beautiful about human nature, but it does more to demystify, and explain. These new findings can be demoralizing, and difficult to accept, but it is the truth. This is something that Charles Darwin himself was well aware of, and tactfully left out in ""The Origin of Species,"" and simply suggested (towards the end of the book,) a Darwinian view of human psychology in the future, “light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.”Why was it such a revelation? On a personal level, it provided explanations about my heartbreaks, relationships, and love. It was also the first time I realized there was a solid science to understanding people. Almost everything we do revolves around other people, and I had stumbled on a blueprint of their character.“Lasting love is something a person has to decide to experience. Lifelong monogamous devotion is just not natural—not for women even, and emphatically not for men. It requires what, for lack of a better term, we can call an act of will. . . . This isn't to say that a young man can't hope to be seized by love. . . . But whether the sheer fury of a man's feelings accurately gauges their likely endurance is another question. The ardor will surely fade, sooner or later, and the marriage will then live or die on respect, practical compatibility, simple affection, and (these days, especially) determination. With the help of these things, something worthy of the label 'love' can last until death. But it will be a different kind of love from the kind that began the marriage. Will it be a richer love, a deeper love, a more spiritual love? Opinions vary. But it's certainly a more impressive love.”Evolutionary psychology has a long way ahead of itself, but it is the beginning of an understanding of the human mind. It has much potential for practical applications, and could one day provide law makers with a firm logical base when making decisions. Perhaps one day, it could lead to a scientific basis for morality. So far, for most of human history, moral philosophers have discussed morality with only an intuitive understanding of human nature, which is to say, the ""how:"" our behaviors, and motivations. Intuition may feel right, but it is hardly scientific. Now, unsuppressed by divine authority, we have an academic field that describes the ""why"" of human nature, and how can anyone claim ideals on how to act, before we realize our limitations as human beings?"

However, now I need to go read more on the topic, because his understanding of the new Darwinism seems to be based mostly on the work of two researchers, which seems a bit narrow to support his conclusions. (Does that constitute some form of formal- or informal- fallacy?)I don't entirely disagree with his conclusions (about human nature). And it's not the notion that we can't help what evolution has handed to us, that offends me; it's the author's solution to this seeming lack of control. In the final third of the book, I think he too readily dismisses unconscious evolutionary 'decision-making' as a basis for a moral code. I wouldn't use it as a basis for a moral code, either. But his reaction against it smacks of panic.I can think of a couple of possible explanations for this:1- He knows that if he doesn't take a position strongly against evolutionary biology as a basis for a moral code, people will assume he is for it.2- He has a personal horror of his own conclusions, and is consequently trying to smooth them over with an alternative (mainly the philosophy of utilitarianism, which seems to assume that there is (a) no moral difference between your family and anyone else, or (b) that it is not possible to be moral without an imposed morality (that includes utilitarianism)).Isn't there anyone knowledgeable on this subject, who simply presents the facts without assigning a value judgement to them??Also, the author apparently cannot tell the difference between logical and reasonable. That is, he extrapolates from the evidence he presents us with to what he thinks is a logical conclusion, but to an absurd degree (which is not reasonable). He seems to think that, since we are under the influence of our evolutionary past, we can't naturally be reasonable at all. Isn't that a form of reductio ad absurdum (sp?)?The ability to reason is part of what makes us human! (Or, if you will, it is part of what differentiates us from other bipeds.) So is the concept of a middle ground- i.e., it's not either all one conclusion or all one other. (Oh God- false dilemma! Argh!)Stopped with 36 pages left to go, because I couldn't bring myself to finish it. The text is way too biased, and not in favor of humanity as he understands it."
233,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57956231-ailith-twinning,1,"Would have been better if it had just been a biography of Darwin, I really felt his admiration while reading those parts and enjoyed the vicarious experience of his feeling. I'm not qualified to critique Evolutionary Psychology - so I won't. The obviously nuts stuff speaks for itself, and those actually in the field do a decent job kicking the authors of that crap in the ass. Now, if only they could manage to get economists banned from writing in the field at all. And, for a philosophical critique, turn to (good) feminist and anti-racist authors. Also Post-Modernist critique which is more a philosophy of why some practitioners apply the scientific method wrongly than the popular conversation about some anti-science theory. This critique applies at least triply for economists skimming the field (to mix metaphors). But what really irked me was the closing stuff -- One of the less common interpretations of Utilitarianism gets, not only acknowledged, but endorsed, only for Wright to then use some seriously half-assed moral conservatism to defend perverting the philosophy into a compromise between its worst interpretations (The USSR, Third Reich, British Empire, and American Empire as various examples) and its actual implications (frankly, Socialism). So you get some kind of messy Meritocracy, right after you (correctly) point out that ""Merit"" is a question wrongly put. It's certainly my personal position that leads to it, but the wretched attempt to justify a torturous prison state (""make the world safe for blame"", as the saying goes) was just the final straw for me, and sufficiently direct to render even the most generous interpretation a fully unacceptable argument. And, if the philosophy is not something the book may be justly judged as a whole for - then why is it there? More to the point, it should not be there, if the purpose is not precisely to frame what came before. So, the explicitly philosophical section is the last straw before generosity must end, and the book fall under the strain of its shitty philosophy -- or its just another bit of bad thoughts in a long chain of (disjointed) bad thoughts, interspersed with some admirably genuine gushing about an idol (Darwin)."
234,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1098316-jamie,3,"Using the writings of Charles Darwin to deliver its human morality principles, I felt by the end of this book that I had learnt more about the great man than I had about myself. One problem with this book is that by centering on life in the 19th century, its themes were often not as relevant to society today. For instance, it may be advantageous for women to play a little harder to get in the game of love, but this is unlikely to have a significant implication towards social status today. Another example, families are unlikely to favor a child simply because they have a greater chance of moving up in socioeconomic circles. I further disagreed with the premise that each person has no free will, we may all inherit a certain instinct, but an instinct does not define our actions in their entirety. Some underlying truths in this book are thought provoking. Man is not intended to be monogomous, but such cultural norms likely maintain social cohesion by allowing a more equal pairing of men and women. We are rarely content with the present and constantly focused on status signals and self aggrandizement, hence, our morals are essentially innate feelings driven by selfish goals, which require constant self-reflection and scepticism to control. This is also a singificant reason why all major religious have the same central themes, which have been considered necessary to guide our innate morals towards the promotion of social harmony.Charles Darwin said this in 1882, and to me it is the key message I will take out of the book: ""As man advances in civilisation, and small tribes are united to larger communities, the simplest reason would tell each individual that he ought to extend his social instincts and sympathies to all the members of the same nation, though personally unkown to him. This point being once reached, there is only an aftifical barrier to prevent his sympathies extending to the men of all nations and races."" Humanity will continue to evolve and our success is dependent on the ability to empathize with all life on this planet.  "
235,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5817744-emma-b,3,"I'm about 100 pages in, and the material is quite fascinating. The book basically links every single trait of humanity back to an adaptation in the ancestral environment.I just wish he'd stop personifying natural selection.Correction, deifying.That kinda defeats the purpose of science.-------------Upon finishing the book, my final opinion is that it was decent, but not fantastic. His deification of the process of natural selection trailed off, much to my relief. The book itself consisted mostly of references and quotes to previous studies, with little interjection by the author, but it was nice to have all that data in one place and in a logical order. The concept of reciprocal altruism, by which humans develop societies, relationships, and most of our higher emotions, was quite interesting, even if a bit common-sensical. It was explained, if perhaps to death, very well, and was easy to understand.The chapters concerning Darwin himself I found to be less than interesting. Many times, the author decided to stray far into the depths of biography, leading us through the childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and finally death of Charles Darwin himself. These chapters were sprinkled with psychological notes with either no apparent relevance or no apparent basis. I found myself leafing quickly through them, hoping to skip past the psych profile of a long-dead man and return to the science.The final chapter, I believe, had no real reason to exist, or at least not to be as long as it was. It was the conclusion, a summation and review of the ideas covered in the book, which didn't number very many, and it made up about 1/5th of the whole book's length. It seemed simply unnecessary. A nice, ten-page abstract and a 'how this info could be used' section I think would have been a much nicer way to end the book.All in all, it was alright, though not nearly as educational as I'd hoped. I've walked away with some new vocab and a basal understanding of this branch of psychology though, which means it wasn't a waste."
236,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17983541-sam,2,"I thought there were some interesting ideas in this book (particularly the suggestion that awareness of the evolutionary roots of behaviour can guide morality by making us conscious of biases and types of reactions that are ill-suited to modern industrial life), but for me there was also one significant flaw: Going by this book, it seems that Wright thinks natural selection shaped humankind predominantly by acting on men. His discussion of women in evolution relates mostly to the Madonna-whore dichotomy, and an odd diversion in which he argues that polygamy should be embraced by feminists because it means more women can choose to marry a high-status man, getting more resources as one of several wives than they might as the single wife of a lower status man. Even when discussing issues unrelated to sex, our male ancestors apparently were the key to evolutionary changes. For example, on p285: 'Feelings of enmity, of grievance, of righteous indignation - of collective enmity and grievance and righteous indignation - probably have their deepest roots in ancient conflicts within bands of humans and pre-humans. In particular: in conflicts among coalitions of males for status.' (What, because female humans and pre-humans never felt group loyalty or righteous indignation?). Another example: in the index, there are 12 topics listed under 'male parental investment,' whereas 'female parental investment' isn't even listed (there is, however, an entry for 'feminism - sexual symmetry as doctrine of'). Based on the assumption that natural selection operates on ALL members of a species, I can't help but doubt the accuracy of at least some of Wright's ideas, given that he seems so focused on only half of the ancestral pool."
237,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51128101-amanda,3,"First of all, I fully acknowledge that this book was outside of my comfort zone as a reader. I do enjoy nonfiction and even the occasional scientific book, but those “sciencey” books are usually about the non-human natural world. Astronomy, for instance, or botany. Furthermore, I have something of a background in sociology, so reading a book that favors biological rather than social explanations for human behavior was a bit difficult for me. That said, I found Wright’s book to be a good primer on evolutionary psychology. As a total newcomer to the field, I never felt completely out of my depth. A bit skeptical from time to time, but not nearly as much as I expected. I think Wright does a good job, not only of conveying the information, but of making it understandable as well. To be entirely fair, I can’t say how accurate the information or its usage is because, as I said, I’m a novice here. My biggest issue was probably Wright’s tactic of anthropomorphizing natural selection: it “wants” this, it designed us to do that. I see how this could be a valid explanatory tactic, but it just ended up making me have to reread and rethink. Something else, more a personal gripe than anything else, is that, when the book talks about sexual attraction/relationships/etc., it’s exclusively heterosexual. As a lesbian, I found myself wondering throughout the book, “But what about the queers?” In the FAQ section at the back of my copy, Wright acknowledges the subject, but mostly brushes it off, essentially saying, “It doesn’t really matter how natural it is; some people are gay and, morally, I think that should be the end of the discussion.” And, like, that’s great, dude. But that’s not what I asked. Overall, I found the book pretty much understandable, but just not that engrossing. "
238,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,1,"Confused book. It seems to be a blend of something called evolutionary psychology, a biography of Charles Darwin and an argument for returning to Victorian morals. As such the book is often slow and confused. These three strands are interweaved and frankly, become uninteresting as the book goes along. The writing is often repetitive, saying the same things about natural selection over and over for example. The analysis is not great either…the author touts something called evolutionary psychology which he doesn’t convince me exists. I think of psychology as being culture and social related…evolution is entirely biological…yes, we have feeling, but they’re shaped by chemistry and biology. How we view these feelings is psychology which, outside of neurology is a social construct. I found the biography of Darwin distracting and detracting…if I wanted to read a biography of Darwin, there are full length better books out there. Lastly, if I wanted to read about why we should return to Victorian morals, there are better arguments and books which focus on the society not biology. In short, I wanted to read a book about the science of evolutionary psychology not a political polemic or a biography. The latter wasn’t even convincingly argued and so I’m not just disappointed, I’m disgusted I spent money on this book. So, I give this a 1. It fails in every respect. It can’t even convince me that evolutionary psychology is a thing and the rest of the book is just filler and a waste of the reader’s time. "
239,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"This is the most fluent, starting from scratch book on the subject of evolution I have read. There is no presupposition of prior knowledge. And the author makes good use of popular notions of the Darwinian theory to throw light on understandings that are wrong, answer those common questions most of us have in mind and explain the real meaning of evolution.Unlike Dawkins' books which are turgid at times because of too many examples from the behaviours of species of various kind (most of those species that non-experts have never heard of) , Wright mostly uses the life of Darwin himself to make many points. This appears odd for a theory that explicitly warns against the use of specifics, the approach works. It also helps that evolution is explained more from the viewpoint of where humanity has reached today than any other notions.Some of the conclusions are outrageous, particularly when they give genetic inevitability to morally/socially reprehensible behaviour. Equally, many conclusions - like in Freudian theories that the author so vehemently criticises - seem to be derived from highly glib, flimsily proven verbal/logical ""must be/could be"" rationales. Perhaps these things are inevitable without the quantified edifices of physical sciences, but they also prove to be the reasons behind relatively less acceptance of almost all the finer points of evolutionary theories."
240,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3558148-bob-pearson,4,"Evolutionary psychology speculates widely (some say wildly) about the origins of human behavior. It has come under fire on the grounds that its presumptions are assumptions not facts since much of its logic is based on what is not observable: the development of the human mind before history. The immense spectrum of human behavior makes it impossible to draw unquestionable links in many cases. Moreover, some evolutionary psychologists have tried to explain male dominance and even rape on the controlling power of genes. All that said, Robin Wright gives us an intriguing argument that accepts the selfishness of early humans as the trigger to actual unselfishness through interactions of mutual benefit among humans that also provide increased prestige and influence to the players. His approach outflanks the obstacle posed by previous narratives that insisted on confrontation between prehistoric human development and more modern societal development. Wright goes so far as to posit that ""brotherly love"" need have no religious inspiration but is a natural evolution of human behavior in groups. Hard to grasp sometimes and easy to criticize in places, his approach nevertheless offers an optimistic view of human development that might be worth serious attention. "
241,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,4,"The book is a Darwinian slant on Darwin the man and its new paradigm (evolutionary psychology). I only started to fully appreciate this book after I realized it was not a science book for non-scientist, but rather a philosophy book for non-philosophers.The author coherently ties together through an overriding narrative on our human psychology and moral development. While I've listened to most of the more recent books on the same topic from various authors (Dawkins, Diamond, Pinker, Gazzaniga, Wilson,Kahneman, and Ridley) available on Audible, none of them tied together the story as well as this book and make you feel the philosophical implications of the theory of evolutionary psychology.The book is dated (copyright 1994) but not out of date. Most of the stories told in the book I've heard versions of them in the more recent books. That's not a fault of the book. It's just that I read this book (in 2012) after having read the other books.I enjoyed this book so much that after listening I started listening to his other book, ""Nonzero"".Warning: this book has the ability to make you reassess you place in the universe and become more interested in philosophy.

I had been reading a lot about genes, evolution, etc. and was really curios about evolutionary psychology when I started to read this. Unfortunately Wright's book was very unfocused. He uses Darwin's personal life and story as a sort of thread holding the book toghether, which might sound great if you like evolution and Darwin. Unfortunately it mostly seems like he used Darwin's fame and speculated about his personal life to further his own ideas, which feels a bit cheap. Thus with this foundation he unsmoothly mixes stories about how Christian Darwin's wife was with unconvincing theories about the evolutionary background of rape. (To be clear I do think there's very possibly some evolutionary background to rape, but his account is very one sided basically claiming that a Victorian society was really nice for the ladies because less rape in the upper class or something. It didn't cut it for me.)There are plenty of interesting evolutionary psychology books in the world unfortunately this was not one of them. "

Spicing up the book is a parallel thread that supports its evolutionary psychology conclusions with examples from Darwin's own personal life.

However, if you've comfortable with the subtleties of the term ""selfish"" in ""The Selfish Gene"" you will find the first half repetitive and the second half overly hand-wavy, vague and unconvincing. Final recommendation: Go ahead if you'd like a quick intro to evolution and its effects on our minds. Expect to be tickled by arguments, but ultimately unconvinced of anything."

What really sets this book apart is that the author uses Darwin's life -- his bio to explain Evolutionary Psychology to explain why we do what we do. I found the chapters about religion most interesting as the author contrasts Jesus and Buddha and sages in general and analyzes their teachings based on Evolutionary Psychology.

251,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"Wright describes the perspectives of evolutionary biologists over a hundred years, from Darwin to the late 20th century, who research human behavior. From an American reader's perspective (Wright is also American), this discourse seemed to be ""pre-9/11,"" and indeed (upon my check of the front pages) it was published in 1994. Reading it in 2020 feels already like a mini time-warp. It's tricky to pinpoint exactly why it doesn't get at 21st century concerns. Partly, it's because the first 150 pages focus on monogamy, reproduction, and marriage in a way that seems like an indirect, coded response to what was then an American national debate over same-sex marriage, a response that somehow managed simultaneously to avoid the acknowledgment that gay people exist. (Wright worked for the New Republic, which was at that time edited by a gay man who was politically conservative, and talking about the gays without really quite involving the gays is how I've always understood that magazine.) And partly, it seems old because it is old. It was published a quarter-century ago, and the science is already a bit dated. Written at the moment just before the Big Bang of cell phones and Internet transformed American culture, the book's discussion of social behavior and our concern with social status is missing our usual contemporary reference points. Thus the Economist's blurb on the paperback — ""destined to become a classic"" — may have been a bit premature, in my view. Not entirely the fault of the book, but more the fault of the year 1994: a reflection on how rapidly the world, and our understanding of it, is changing.The first and longest part is about sex between men and women, in which Wright argues that monogamy is unnatural. (The word ""homosexual"" only appears twice in this part, and then only to describe ""mistaken homosexual courtship"" among frogs and ""periodic homosexual behavior"" among bonobos that is supposedly ""a way of saying, 'Let's be friends.'"") The second part is about reciprocal altruism. The third part is about how we use these behaviors to negotiate our social status. The fourth part is about how this awareness can result in ""a self-consciousness so acute, and a cynicism so deep, that ironic detachment from the whole human enterprise may provide the only relief,"" raising the question of whether ""the word moral can be anything but a joke."" There is a paradox at the heart of the question of whether humans are basically good: ""To be moral animals, we must realize how thoroughly we aren't."" To me, this echoes a critique of the logical inconsistency in the idea of God's omnibenevolence — to be good is to spot errors and continually self-improve, which you can't do if you're already perfect. Yes, humans are inherently moral, in the sense that we are motivated (both consciously and unconsciously) to continually adjust our behavior. The part that is conscious is arguably, by definition, not natural. Its content transcends its natural origin.It's a clear, easily readable introduction to the scientific concept that traits evolve because they benefit survival and reproduction. The book describes how, for a social species like humans, altruistic behavior can evolve (because altruistic acts support the group's survival while enhancing the altruistic individual's reputation within the group). I may have picked this book up as an undergraduate or even as a high school student; it is underlined, apparently by a student who may have been me. It may still serve people who want this introductory material. If you're already clear on this concept, you may want a more scientifically up-to-date book with a more specific thesis."
252,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1579132-christopher,3,"Fascinating and dense. Wright discusses how an evolutionary model can explain human instincts and behavior. Importantly, he doesn't dictate that our behavior isn't changeable, nor that evolutionary results dictate what our moral code should be.My favorite parts were applying these general rules to Darwin's own biography. Darwin was extremely moral and kind. I also very much enjoyed the last quarter, where he discusses J.S. Mill's utilitarianism as the author's moral philosophy of choice. It was fun, because ""Origin of the Species"" and Mill's ""On Liberty"" were both published in 1859.In the first half, Wright thoroughly examines humanity's sexual instincts. For biology, this makes sense, as all biology is understood through reproductive behavior. Although the author did emphasize the fallacy of mixing the ""is"" for the ""ought"", he also characterized his book as a quasi-self-help. The ought comes through with the last quarter discussing Mill, but the first third needed more ""is"". Case in point, humans (both sexes, but men more) instinctively cheat on their spouses, and there was an evolutionary advantage to doing so. He fails to convince that this isn't an ""ought"", by never quite giving adequate description of how a successful monogamous marriage works, given our evolutionary instincts.I really loved his discussion of human hierarchy. All tribes and cultures exhibit this tendency. It is the cause of so much human strife, competition, wars, and destruction. But it also motivates us with ambition and creativity. We are also adept at figuring out our pecking order. Better to learn it through a signal, than taking the costly route to duking it out to verify it. Our yearn to be on top, is also easy to describe evolutionary. The male who was on top, mated with the most females, thus sending those ambitious genes forward.One last fascinating story. Some squirrels, upon seeing a predator, will yelp and freeze up, causing the predator to hear him, catch him, and eat him. How could this be evolutionary advantageous? Because their siblings (who share a huge amount of the same genes), will be preserved by the sacrificial yelper. Thus, those genes are repeated along. Evolution doesn't care about individuals, it only cares about one thing: repeating genes. This type of sacrificial response, explains why we are more willing to sacrifice ourselves, the closer the kin. The further away they are related, the less our genes will be in common, the lower our willingness to sacrifice ourselves. Not that this process is consciously driven; genes don't think.Again, the book was interesting and dense. The second half stronger than the first half. I'd be really interested to see where the science has lead since his writing it in the early 1990's."
253,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54518540-cam-lidstone,4,"Robert Wright's The Moral Animal was one of the much-talked-about books on evolutionary psychology in the 1990s along with Ridley's The Red Queen and The Origins of Virtue, Pinker's How the Mind Works, and Tooby and Cosmides' The Adapted Mind.The book comprehensively and accessibly lays out an understanding of the evolution of human's moral sentiments. Wright's a clear writer who manages to convey the importance of Darwin and his theory of natural selection while maintaining an irreverence and wit. I wasn't fully on board with Wright's conceit: alternating between explanations of evolutionary logic and brief snippets of Darwin's life (explained through the lens of evolutionary psychology). The case studies are too anecdotal and there are better Darwin biographies elsewhere. Wright excels when he communicates and recognises the importance of the work of the eminent evolutionary biologists George C Williams, William D Hamilton, Robert Trivers, and John Maynard Smith.Their collective work, which was popularised in the mid-70s via Dawkins' The Selfish Gene and E.O. Wilson's Sociobiology, sets the foundation of a scientific understanding of the human condition. Their key insights help explain five key relationships: males and females (unequal levels of parental investment and thus differing sexual strategies); parents and their children and siblings with each other (parental-offspring conflict); friends and acquaintances (reciprocal altruism); and people's relationship with themselves (self-deception). I recommend this book to people who know the basics of evolution but you can skip the chapters on Darwin. If you are completely new to the evolution, the best entry points are insteaed probably Dawkins and Gould."

He thought: This is what I should feel all the time for everyone.…""—Graham Greene, The Power and the GloryThe moment I started reading about evolutionary psychology, it was a massive revelation for me. It was the beginning of an understanding of a field, that would have spared me much relief from the pain, confusion, and guilt that stemmed from my many quirks as a human being. It provided for the first time, a reason why, I was the way I was. As a computer programmer, it showed me how I had been programmed: evolution, and revealed the programmer: natural selection.This is in essence, an instruction manual for oneself. It attempts to explain our behaviors, motivations, and personality in the realm of our extremely subjective, anthropocentric world, and in doing so, it becomes clear just how strong the case for evolutionary psychology is. As illuminating as it is, it is also a harsh manual. Many will claim that it deromanticizes much of what is noble, and beautiful about human nature, but it does more to demystify, and explain. These new findings can be demoralizing, and difficult to accept, but it is the truth. This is something that Charles Darwin himself was well aware of, and tactfully left out in ""The Origin of Species,"" and simply suggested (towards the end of the book,) a Darwinian view of human psychology in the future, “light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.”Why was it such a revelation? On a personal level, it provided explanations about my heartbreaks, relationships, and love. It was also the first time I realized there was a solid science to understanding people. Almost everything we do revolves around other people, and I had stumbled on a blueprint of their character.“Lasting love is something a person has to decide to experience. Lifelong monogamous devotion is just not natural—not for women even, and emphatically not for men. It requires what, for lack of a better term, we can call an act of will. . . . This isn't to say that a young man can't hope to be seized by love. . . . But whether the sheer fury of a man's feelings accurately gauges their likely endurance is another question. The ardor will surely fade, sooner or later, and the marriage will then live or die on respect, practical compatibility, simple affection, and (these days, especially) determination. With the help of these things, something worthy of the label 'love' can last until death. But it will be a different kind of love from the kind that began the marriage. Will it be a richer love, a deeper love, a more spiritual love? Opinions vary. But it's certainly a more impressive love.”Evolutionary psychology has a long way ahead of itself, but it is the beginning of an understanding of the human mind. It has much potential for practical applications, and could one day provide law makers with a firm logical base when making decisions. Perhaps one day, it could lead to a scientific basis for morality. So far, for most of human history, moral philosophers have discussed morality with only an intuitive understanding of human nature, which is to say, the ""how:"" our behaviors, and motivations. Intuition may feel right, but it is hardly scientific. Now, unsuppressed by divine authority, we have an academic field that describes the ""why"" of human nature, and how can anyone claim ideals on how to act, before we realize our limitations as human beings?"
261,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51610838-igor-kanunnikov,5,"This book gives you a view on the naked human nature (it can be a very cynical but honest one), which can seem that we are all slaves of our selfish genes and in the end biological robots. It explains nearly every human emotion and behaviour, the human institutions, morality, society and social status, our biases, why they are beneficial for us. The important point which the author states, is that if you know about your biological programming, you can eventually overcome it, understand yourself, others and social situations better and therefore make better decisions.It has revealed for me some ugly (by romantic or humanist standarts) truths about friendships, family and romantic relationships, but in the end it is a relief, to know the ""why"". "
262,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43622620-jessica,2,"I found the author's presentation of his case generally comprehensible, though perhaps unnecessarily long-winded, with a tendency to digress too far (IMO) into his examples (mostly drawn from Darwin's life).(I apologize in advance to any readers in the know, if my understanding of logical fallacies is imperfect...)He may be accurate in his conclusions. However, now I need to go read more on the topic, because his understanding of the new Darwinism seems to be based mostly on the work of two researchers, which seems a bit narrow to support his conclusions. (Does that constitute some form of formal- or informal- fallacy?)I don't entirely disagree with his conclusions (about human nature). And it's not the notion that we can't help what evolution has handed to us, that offends me; it's the author's solution to this seeming lack of control. In the final third of the book, I think he too readily dismisses unconscious evolutionary 'decision-making' as a basis for a moral code. I wouldn't use it as a basis for a moral code, either. But his reaction against it smacks of panic.I can think of a couple of possible explanations for this:1- He knows that if he doesn't take a position strongly against evolutionary biology as a basis for a moral code, people will assume he is for it.2- He has a personal horror of his own conclusions, and is consequently trying to smooth them over with an alternative (mainly the philosophy of utilitarianism, which seems to assume that there is (a) no moral difference between your family and anyone else, or (b) that it is not possible to be moral without an imposed morality (that includes utilitarianism)).Isn't there anyone knowledgeable on this subject, who simply presents the facts without assigning a value judgement to them??Also, the author apparently cannot tell the difference between logical and reasonable. That is, he extrapolates from the evidence he presents us with to what he thinks is a logical conclusion, but to an absurd degree (which is not reasonable). He seems to think that, since we are under the influence of our evolutionary past, we can't naturally be reasonable at all. Isn't that a form of reductio ad absurdum (sp?)?The ability to reason is part of what makes us human! (Or, if you will, it is part of what differentiates us from other bipeds.) So is the concept of a middle ground- i.e., it's not either all one conclusion or all one other. (Oh God- false dilemma! Argh!)Stopped with 36 pages left to go, because I couldn't bring myself to finish it. The text is way too biased, and not in favor of humanity as he understands it."
263,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57956231-ailith-twinning,1,"Would have been better if it had just been a biography of Darwin, I really felt his admiration while reading those parts and enjoyed the vicarious experience of his feeling. I'm not qualified to critique Evolutionary Psychology - so I won't. The obviously nuts stuff speaks for itself, and those actually in the field do a decent job kicking the authors of that crap in the ass. Now, if only they could manage to get economists banned from writing in the field at all. And, for a philosophical critique, turn to (good) feminist and anti-racist authors. Also Post-Modernist critique which is more a philosophy of why some practitioners apply the scientific method wrongly than the popular conversation about some anti-science theory. This critique applies at least triply for economists skimming the field (to mix metaphors). But what really irked me was the closing stuff -- One of the less common interpretations of Utilitarianism gets, not only acknowledged, but endorsed, only for Wright to then use some seriously half-assed moral conservatism to defend perverting the philosophy into a compromise between its worst interpretations (The USSR, Third Reich, British Empire, and American Empire as various examples) and its actual implications (frankly, Socialism). So you get some kind of messy Meritocracy, right after you (correctly) point out that ""Merit"" is a question wrongly put. It's certainly my personal position that leads to it, but the wretched attempt to justify a torturous prison state (""make the world safe for blame"", as the saying goes) was just the final straw for me, and sufficiently direct to render even the most generous interpretation a fully unacceptable argument. And, if the philosophy is not something the book may be justly judged as a whole for - then why is it there? More to the point, it should not be there, if the purpose is not precisely to frame what came before. So, the explicitly philosophical section is the last straw before generosity must end, and the book fall under the strain of its shitty philosophy -- or its just another bit of bad thoughts in a long chain of (disjointed) bad thoughts, interspersed with some admirably genuine gushing about an idol (Darwin)."
264,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1098316-jamie,3,"Using the writings of Charles Darwin to deliver its human morality principles, I felt by the end of this book that I had learnt more about the great man than I had about myself. One problem with this book is that by centering on life in the 19th century, its themes were often not as relevant to society today. For instance, it may be advantageous for women to play a little harder to get in the game of love, but this is unlikely to have a significant implication towards social status today. Another example, families are unlikely to favor a child simply because they have a greater chance of moving up in socioeconomic circles. I further disagreed with the premise that each person has no free will, we may all inherit a certain instinct, but an instinct does not define our actions in their entirety. Some underlying truths in this book are thought provoking. Man is not intended to be monogomous, but such cultural norms likely maintain social cohesion by allowing a more equal pairing of men and women. We are rarely content with the present and constantly focused on status signals and self aggrandizement, hence, our morals are essentially innate feelings driven by selfish goals, which require constant self-reflection and scepticism to control. This is also a singificant reason why all major religious have the same central themes, which have been considered necessary to guide our innate morals towards the promotion of social harmony.Charles Darwin said this in 1882, and to me it is the key message I will take out of the book: ""As man advances in civilisation, and small tribes are united to larger communities, the simplest reason would tell each individual that he ought to extend his social instincts and sympathies to all the members of the same nation, though personally unkown to him. This point being once reached, there is only an aftifical barrier to prevent his sympathies extending to the men of all nations and races."" Humanity will continue to evolve and our success is dependent on the ability to empathize with all life on this planet.  "
265,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5817744-emma-b,3,"I'm about 100 pages in, and the material is quite fascinating. The book basically links every single trait of humanity back to an adaptation in the ancestral environment.I just wish he'd stop personifying natural selection.Correction, deifying.That kinda defeats the purpose of science.-------------Upon finishing the book, my final opinion is that it was decent, but not fantastic. His deification of the process of natural selection trailed off, much to my relief. The book itself consisted mostly of references and quotes to previous studies, with little interjection by the author, but it was nice to have all that data in one place and in a logical order. The concept of reciprocal altruism, by which humans develop societies, relationships, and most of our higher emotions, was quite interesting, even if a bit common-sensical. It was explained, if perhaps to death, very well, and was easy to understand.The chapters concerning Darwin himself I found to be less than interesting. Many times, the author decided to stray far into the depths of biography, leading us through the childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and finally death of Charles Darwin himself. These chapters were sprinkled with psychological notes with either no apparent relevance or no apparent basis. I found myself leafing quickly through them, hoping to skip past the psych profile of a long-dead man and return to the science.The final chapter, I believe, had no real reason to exist, or at least not to be as long as it was. It was the conclusion, a summation and review of the ideas covered in the book, which didn't number very many, and it made up about 1/5th of the whole book's length. It seemed simply unnecessary. A nice, ten-page abstract and a 'how this info could be used' section I think would have been a much nicer way to end the book.All in all, it was alright, though not nearly as educational as I'd hoped. I've walked away with some new vocab and a basal understanding of this branch of psychology though, which means it wasn't a waste."
266,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17983541-sam,2,"I thought there were some interesting ideas in this book (particularly the suggestion that awareness of the evolutionary roots of behaviour can guide morality by making us conscious of biases and types of reactions that are ill-suited to modern industrial life), but for me there was also one significant flaw: Going by this book, it seems that Wright thinks natural selection shaped humankind predominantly by acting on men. His discussion of women in evolution relates mostly to the Madonna-whore dichotomy, and an odd diversion in which he argues that polygamy should be embraced by feminists because it means more women can choose to marry a high-status man, getting more resources as one of several wives than they might as the single wife of a lower status man. Even when discussing issues unrelated to sex, our male ancestors apparently were the key to evolutionary changes. For example, on p285: 'Feelings of enmity, of grievance, of righteous indignation - of collective enmity and grievance and righteous indignation - probably have their deepest roots in ancient conflicts within bands of humans and pre-humans. In particular: in conflicts among coalitions of males for status.' (What, because female humans and pre-humans never felt group loyalty or righteous indignation?). Another example: in the index, there are 12 topics listed under 'male parental investment,' whereas 'female parental investment' isn't even listed (there is, however, an entry for 'feminism - sexual symmetry as doctrine of'). Based on the assumption that natural selection operates on ALL members of a species, I can't help but doubt the accuracy of at least some of Wright's ideas, given that he seems so focused on only half of the ancestral pool."
267,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51128101-amanda,3,"First of all, I fully acknowledge that this book was outside of my comfort zone as a reader. I do enjoy nonfiction and even the occasional scientific book, but those “sciencey” books are usually about the non-human natural world. Astronomy, for instance, or botany. Furthermore, I have something of a background in sociology, so reading a book that favors biological rather than social explanations for human behavior was a bit difficult for me. That said, I found Wright’s book to be a good primer on evolutionary psychology. As a total newcomer to the field, I never felt completely out of my depth. A bit skeptical from time to time, but not nearly as much as I expected. I think Wright does a good job, not only of conveying the information, but of making it understandable as well. To be entirely fair, I can’t say how accurate the information or its usage is because, as I said, I’m a novice here. My biggest issue was probably Wright’s tactic of anthropomorphizing natural selection: it “wants” this, it designed us to do that. I see how this could be a valid explanatory tactic, but it just ended up making me have to reread and rethink. Something else, more a personal gripe than anything else, is that, when the book talks about sexual attraction/relationships/etc., it’s exclusively heterosexual. As a lesbian, I found myself wondering throughout the book, “But what about the queers?” In the FAQ section at the back of my copy, Wright acknowledges the subject, but mostly brushes it off, essentially saying, “It doesn’t really matter how natural it is; some people are gay and, morally, I think that should be the end of the discussion.” And, like, that’s great, dude. But that’s not what I asked. Overall, I found the book pretty much understandable, but just not that engrossing. "
268,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,1,"Confused book. It seems to be a blend of something called evolutionary psychology, a biography of Charles Darwin and an argument for returning to Victorian morals. As such the book is often slow and confused. These three strands are interweaved and frankly, become uninteresting as the book goes along. The writing is often repetitive, saying the same things about natural selection over and over for example. The analysis is not great either…the author touts something called evolutionary psychology which he doesn’t convince me exists. I think of psychology as being culture and social related…evolution is entirely biological…yes, we have feeling, but they’re shaped by chemistry and biology. How we view these feelings is psychology which, outside of neurology is a social construct. I found the biography of Darwin distracting and detracting…if I wanted to read a biography of Darwin, there are full length better books out there. Lastly, if I wanted to read about why we should return to Victorian morals, there are better arguments and books which focus on the society not biology. In short, I wanted to read a book about the science of evolutionary psychology not a political polemic or a biography. The latter wasn’t even convincingly argued and so I’m not just disappointed, I’m disgusted I spent money on this book. So, I give this a 1. It fails in every respect. It can’t even convince me that evolutionary psychology is a thing and the rest of the book is just filler and a waste of the reader’s time. "
269,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"This is the most fluent, starting from scratch book on the subject of evolution I have read. There is no presupposition of prior knowledge. And the author makes good use of popular notions of the Darwinian theory to throw light on understandings that are wrong, answer those common questions most of us have in mind and explain the real meaning of evolution.Unlike Dawkins' books which are turgid at times because of too many examples from the behaviours of species of various kind (most of those species that non-experts have never heard of) , Wright mostly uses the life of Darwin himself to make many points. This appears odd for a theory that explicitly warns against the use of specifics, the approach works. It also helps that evolution is explained more from the viewpoint of where humanity has reached today than any other notions.Some of the conclusions are outrageous, particularly when they give genetic inevitability to morally/socially reprehensible behaviour. Equally, many conclusions - like in Freudian theories that the author so vehemently criticises - seem to be derived from highly glib, flimsily proven verbal/logical ""must be/could be"" rationales. Perhaps these things are inevitable without the quantified edifices of physical sciences, but they also prove to be the reasons behind relatively less acceptance of almost all the finer points of evolutionary theories."
270,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3558148-bob-pearson,4,"Evolutionary psychology speculates widely (some say wildly) about the origins of human behavior. It has come under fire on the grounds that its presumptions are assumptions not facts since much of its logic is based on what is not observable: the development of the human mind before history. The immense spectrum of human behavior makes it impossible to draw unquestionable links in many cases. Moreover, some evolutionary psychologists have tried to explain male dominance and even rape on the controlling power of genes. All that said, Robin Wright gives us an intriguing argument that accepts the selfishness of early humans as the trigger to actual unselfishness through interactions of mutual benefit among humans that also provide increased prestige and influence to the players. His approach outflanks the obstacle posed by previous narratives that insisted on confrontation between prehistoric human development and more modern societal development. Wright goes so far as to posit that ""brotherly love"" need have no religious inspiration but is a natural evolution of human behavior in groups. Hard to grasp sometimes and easy to criticize in places, his approach nevertheless offers an optimistic view of human development that might be worth serious attention. "
271,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,4,"The book is a Darwinian slant on Darwin the man and its new paradigm (evolutionary psychology). I only started to fully appreciate this book after I realized it was not a science book for non-scientist, but rather a philosophy book for non-philosophers.The author coherently ties together through an overriding narrative on our human psychology and moral development. While I've listened to most of the more recent books on the same topic from various authors (Dawkins, Diamond, Pinker, Gazzaniga, Wilson,Kahneman, and Ridley) available on Audible, none of them tied together the story as well as this book and make you feel the philosophical implications of the theory of evolutionary psychology.The book is dated (copyright 1994) but not out of date. Most of the stories told in the book I've heard versions of them in the more recent books. That's not a fault of the book. It's just that I read this book (in 2012) after having read the other books.I enjoyed this book so much that after listening I started listening to his other book, ""Nonzero"".Warning: this book has the ability to make you reassess you place in the universe and become more interested in philosophy.

I had been reading a lot about genes, evolution, etc. and was really curios about evolutionary psychology when I started to read this. Unfortunately Wright's book was very unfocused. He uses Darwin's personal life and story as a sort of thread holding the book toghether, which might sound great if you like evolution and Darwin. Unfortunately it mostly seems like he used Darwin's fame and speculated about his personal life to further his own ideas, which feels a bit cheap. Thus with this foundation he unsmoothly mixes stories about how Christian Darwin's wife was with unconvincing theories about the evolutionary background of rape. (To be clear I do think there's very possibly some evolutionary background to rape, but his account is very one sided basically claiming that a Victorian society was really nice for the ladies because less rape in the upper class or something. It didn't cut it for me.)There are plenty of interesting evolutionary psychology books in the world unfortunately this was not one of them. "

Spicing up the book is a parallel thread that supports its evolutionary psychology conclusions with examples from Darwin's own personal life.

However, if you've comfortable with the subtleties of the term ""selfish"" in ""The Selfish Gene"" you will find the first half repetitive and the second half overly hand-wavy, vague and unconvincing. Final recommendation: Go ahead if you'd like a quick intro to evolution and its effects on our minds. Expect to be tickled by arguments, but ultimately unconvinced of anything."

What really sets this book apart is that the author uses Darwin's life -- his bio to explain Evolutionary Psychology to explain why we do what we do. I found the chapters about religion most interesting as the author contrasts Jesus and Buddha and sages in general and analyzes their teachings based on Evolutionary Psychology. As the NY Times says -- amazingly original thinking here."

281,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"Wright describes the perspectives of evolutionary biologists over a hundred years, from Darwin to the late 20th century, who research human behavior. From an American reader's perspective (Wright is also American), this discourse seemed to be ""pre-9/11,"" and indeed (upon my check of the front pages) it was published in 1994. Reading it in 2020 feels already like a mini time-warp. It's tricky to pinpoint exactly why it doesn't get at 21st century concerns. Partly, it's because the first 150 pages focus on monogamy, reproduction, and marriage in a way that seems like an indirect, coded response to what was then an American national debate over same-sex marriage, a response that somehow managed simultaneously to avoid the acknowledgment that gay people exist. (Wright worked for the New Republic, which was at that time edited by a gay man who was politically conservative, and talking about the gays without really quite involving the gays is how I've always understood that magazine.) And partly, it seems old because it is old. It was published a quarter-century ago, and the science is already a bit dated. Written at the moment just before the Big Bang of cell phones and Internet transformed American culture, the book's discussion of social behavior and our concern with social status is missing our usual contemporary reference points. Thus the Economist's blurb on the paperback — ""destined to become a classic"" — may have been a bit premature, in my view. Not entirely the fault of the book, but more the fault of the year 1994: a reflection on how rapidly the world, and our understanding of it, is changing.The first and longest part is about sex between men and women, in which Wright argues that monogamy is unnatural. (The word ""homosexual"" only appears twice in this part, and then only to describe ""mistaken homosexual courtship"" among frogs and ""periodic homosexual behavior"" among bonobos that is supposedly ""a way of saying, 'Let's be friends.'"") The second part is about reciprocal altruism. The third part is about how we use these behaviors to negotiate our social status. The fourth part is about how this awareness can result in ""a self-consciousness so acute, and a cynicism so deep, that ironic detachment from the whole human enterprise may provide the only relief,"" raising the question of whether ""the word moral can be anything but a joke."" There is a paradox at the heart of the question of whether humans are basically good: ""To be moral animals, we must realize how thoroughly we aren't."" To me, this echoes a critique of the logical inconsistency in the idea of God's omnibenevolence — to be good is to spot errors and continually self-improve, which you can't do if you're already perfect. Yes, humans are inherently moral, in the sense that we are motivated (both consciously and unconsciously) to continually adjust our behavior. The part that is conscious is arguably, by definition, not natural. Its content transcends its natural origin.It's a clear, easily readable introduction to the scientific concept that traits evolve because they benefit survival and reproduction. The book describes how, for a social species like humans, altruistic behavior can evolve (because altruistic acts support the group's survival while enhancing the altruistic individual's reputation within the group). I may have picked this book up as an undergraduate or even as a high school student; it is underlined, apparently by a student who may have been me. It may still serve people who want this introductory material. If you're already clear on this concept, you may want a more scientifically up-to-date book with a more specific thesis."
282,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1579132-christopher,3,"Fascinating and dense. Wright discusses how an evolutionary model can explain human instincts and behavior. Importantly, he doesn't dictate that our behavior isn't changeable, nor that evolutionary results dictate what our moral code should be.My favorite parts were applying these general rules to Darwin's own biography. Darwin was extremely moral and kind. I also very much enjoyed the last quarter, where he discusses J.S. Mill's utilitarianism as the author's moral philosophy of choice. It was fun, because ""Origin of the Species"" and Mill's ""On Liberty"" were both published in 1859.In the first half, Wright thoroughly examines humanity's sexual instincts. For biology, this makes sense, as all biology is understood through reproductive behavior. Although the author did emphasize the fallacy of mixing the ""is"" for the ""ought"", he also characterized his book as a quasi-self-help. The ought comes through with the last quarter discussing Mill, but the first third needed more ""is"". Case in point, humans (both sexes, but men more) instinctively cheat on their spouses, and there was an evolutionary advantage to doing so. He fails to convince that this isn't an ""ought"", by never quite giving adequate description of how a successful monogamous marriage works, given our evolutionary instincts.I really loved his discussion of human hierarchy. All tribes and cultures exhibit this tendency. It is the cause of so much human strife, competition, wars, and destruction. But it also motivates us with ambition and creativity. We are also adept at figuring out our pecking order. Better to learn it through a signal, than taking the costly route to duking it out to verify it. Our yearn to be on top, is also easy to describe evolutionary. The male who was on top, mated with the most females, thus sending those ambitious genes forward.One last fascinating story. Some squirrels, upon seeing a predator, will yelp and freeze up, causing the predator to hear him, catch him, and eat him. How could this be evolutionary advantageous? Because their siblings (who share a huge amount of the same genes), will be preserved by the sacrificial yelper. Thus, those genes are repeated along. Evolution doesn't care about individuals, it only cares about one thing: repeating genes. This type of sacrificial response, explains why we are more willing to sacrifice ourselves, the closer the kin. The further away they are related, the less our genes will be in common, the lower our willingness to sacrifice ourselves. Not that this process is consciously driven; genes don't think.Again, the book was interesting and dense. The second half stronger than the first half. I'd be really interested to see where the science has lead since his writing it in the early 1990's."
283,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54518540-cam-lidstone,4,"Robert Wright's The Moral Animal was one of the much-talked-about books on evolutionary psychology in the 1990s along with Ridley's The Red Queen and The Origins of Virtue, Pinker's How the Mind Works, and Tooby and Cosmides' The Adapted Mind.The book comprehensively and accessibly lays out an understanding of the evolution of human's moral sentiments. Wright's a clear writer who manages to convey the importance of Darwin and his theory of natural selection while maintaining an irreverence and wit. I wasn't fully on board with Wright's conceit: alternating between explanations of evolutionary logic and brief snippets of Darwin's life (explained through the lens of evolutionary psychology). The case studies are too anecdotal and there are better Darwin biographies elsewhere. Wright excels when he communicates and recognises the importance of the work of the eminent evolutionary biologists George C Williams, William D Hamilton, Robert Trivers, and John Maynard Smith.Their collective work, which was popularised in the mid-70s via Dawkins' The Selfish Gene and E.O. Wilson's Sociobiology, sets the foundation of a scientific understanding of the human condition. Their key insights help explain five key relationships: males and females (unequal levels of parental investment and thus differing sexual strategies); parents and their children and siblings with each other (parental-offspring conflict); friends and acquaintances (reciprocal altruism); and people's relationship with themselves (self-deception). I recommend this book to people who know the basics of evolution but you can skip the chapters on Darwin. If you are completely new to the evolution, the best entry points are insteaed probably Dawkins and Gould."

289,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49530467-reem,2,"2.5/5The book could've been shorter, it had too many unnecessary details (I didn't ask for a Darwin Biography), i gradually lost interest the further i was in the book. But nonetheless, the Author has an engaging style of writing. There were some things i disagreed with mainly because it can simply be just outdated, given the fact that the book was published in the 90s. But there were fundamental ideas that i felt was biased to a period of time and the author failed to look at other older civilizations that contradict his thinking, one of which is human selfishness. P.S: I don't mind bringing up religion, i actually think it's useful and i practically enjoyed that chapter, but why quoting religious texts as a 'segway' to human thoughts and morality? i can 100% assure you religious aspired books wouldn't quote Darwin for aspirations of social morality. seemed like he was begging it.

As the liquid touched histongue he remembered his child, coming in out of the glare: the sullen unhappy knowledgeable face. He said, “Oh God, help her, Damn me, I deserve it, but let her live for ever.” This was the love heshould have felt for every soul in the world: all the fear and the wish to save concentrated unjustly on the one child. He began to weep; it was as if he had to watch her from the shore drown slowly because he had forgotten how to swim. He thought: This is what I should feel all the time for everyone.…""—Graham Greene, The Power and the GloryThe moment I started reading about evolutionary psychology, it was a massive revelation for me. It was the beginning of an understanding of a field, that would have spared me much relief from the pain, confusion, and guilt that stemmed from my many quirks as a human being. It provided for the first time, a reason why, I was the way I was. As a computer programmer, it showed me how I had been programmed: evolution, and revealed the programmer: natural selection.This is in essence, an instruction manual for oneself. It attempts to explain our behaviors, motivations, and personality in the realm of our extremely subjective, anthropocentric world, and in doing so, it becomes clear just how strong the case for evolutionary psychology is. As illuminating as it is, it is also a harsh manual. Many will claim that it deromanticizes much of what is noble, and beautiful about human nature, but it does more to demystify, and explain. These new findings can be demoralizing, and difficult to accept, but it is the truth. This is something that Charles Darwin himself was well aware of, and tactfully left out in ""The Origin of Species,"" and simply suggested (towards the end of the book,) a Darwinian view of human psychology in the future, “light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.”Why was it such a revelation? On a personal level, it provided explanations about my heartbreaks, relationships, and love. It was also the first time I realized there was a solid science to understanding people. Almost everything we do revolves around other people, and I had stumbled on a blueprint of their character.“Lasting love is something a person has to decide to experience. Lifelong monogamous devotion is just not natural—not for women even, and emphatically not for men. It requires what, for lack of a better term, we can call an act of will. . . . This isn't to say that a young man can't hope to be seized by love. . . . But whether the sheer fury of a man's feelings accurately gauges their likely endurance is another question. The ardor will surely fade, sooner or later, and the marriage will then live or die on respect, practical compatibility, simple affection, and (these days, especially) determination. With the help of these things, something worthy of the label 'love' can last until death. But it will be a different kind of love from the kind that began the marriage. Will it be a richer love, a deeper love, a more spiritual love? Opinions vary. But it's certainly a more impressive love.”Evolutionary psychology has a long way ahead of itself, but it is the beginning of an understanding of the human mind. It has much potential for practical applications, and could one day provide law makers with a firm logical base when making decisions. Perhaps one day, it could lead to a scientific basis for morality. So far, for most of human history, moral philosophers have discussed morality with only an intuitive understanding of human nature, which is to say, the ""how:"" our behaviors, and motivations. Intuition may feel right, but it is hardly scientific. Now, unsuppressed by divine authority, we have an academic field that describes the ""why"" of human nature, and how can anyone claim ideals on how to act, before we realize our limitations as human beings?"
291,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51610838-igor-kanunnikov,5,"This book gives you a view on the naked human nature (it can be a very cynical but honest one), which can seem that we are all slaves of our selfish genes and in the end biological robots. It explains nearly every human emotion and behaviour, the human institutions, morality, society and social status, our biases, why they are beneficial for us. The important point which the author states, is that if you know about your biological programming, you can eventually overcome it, understand yourself, others and social situations better and therefore make better decisions.It has revealed for me some ugly (by romantic or humanist standarts) truths about friendships, family and romantic relationships, but in the end it is a relief, to know the ""why"". "
292,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43622620-jessica,2,"I found the author's presentation of his case generally comprehensible, though perhaps unnecessarily long-winded, with a tendency to digress too far (IMO) into his examples (mostly drawn from Darwin's life).(I apologize in advance to any readers in the know, if my understanding of logical fallacies is imperfect...)He may be accurate in his conclusions. However, now I need to go read more on the topic, because his understanding of the new Darwinism seems to be based mostly on the work of two researchers, which seems a bit narrow to support his conclusions. (Does that constitute some form of formal- or informal- fallacy?)I don't entirely disagree with his conclusions (about human nature). And it's not the notion that we can't help what evolution has handed to us, that offends me; it's the author's solution to this seeming lack of control. In the final third of the book, I think he too readily dismisses unconscious evolutionary 'decision-making' as a basis for a moral code. I wouldn't use it as a basis for a moral code, either. But his reaction against it smacks of panic.I can think of a couple of possible explanations for this:1- He knows that if he doesn't take a position strongly against evolutionary biology as a basis for a moral code, people will assume he is for it.2- He has a personal horror of his own conclusions, and is consequently trying to smooth them over with an alternative (mainly the philosophy of utilitarianism, which seems to assume that there is (a) no moral difference between your family and anyone else, or (b) that it is not possible to be moral without an imposed morality (that includes utilitarianism)).Isn't there anyone knowledgeable on this subject, who simply presents the facts without assigning a value judgement to them??Also, the author apparently cannot tell the difference between logical and reasonable. That is, he extrapolates from the evidence he presents us with to what he thinks is a logical conclusion, but to an absurd degree (which is not reasonable). He seems to think that, since we are under the influence of our evolutionary past, we can't naturally be reasonable at all. Isn't that a form of reductio ad absurdum (sp?)?The ability to reason is part of what makes us human! (Or, if you will, it is part of what differentiates us from other bipeds.) So is the concept of a middle ground- i.e., it's not either all one conclusion or all one other. (Oh God- false dilemma! Argh!)Stopped with 36 pages left to go, because I couldn't bring myself to finish it. The text is way too biased, and not in favor of humanity as he understands it."
293,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57956231-ailith-twinning,1,"Would have been better if it had just been a biography of Darwin, I really felt his admiration while reading those parts and enjoyed the vicarious experience of his feeling. I'm not qualified to critique Evolutionary Psychology - so I won't. The obviously nuts stuff speaks for itself, and those actually in the field do a decent job kicking the authors of that crap in the ass. Now, if only they could manage to get economists banned from writing in the field at all. And, for a philosophical critique, turn to (good) feminist and anti-racist authors. Also Post-Modernist critique which is more a philosophy of why some practitioners apply the scientific method wrongly than the popular conversation about some anti-science theory. This critique applies at least triply for economists skimming the field (to mix metaphors). But what really irked me was the closing stuff -- One of the less common interpretations of Utilitarianism gets, not only acknowledged, but endorsed, only for Wright to then use some seriously half-assed moral conservatism to defend perverting the philosophy into a compromise between its worst interpretations (The USSR, Third Reich, British Empire, and American Empire as various examples) and its actual implications (frankly, Socialism). So you get some kind of messy Meritocracy, right after you (correctly) point out that ""Merit"" is a question wrongly put. It's certainly my personal position that leads to it, but the wretched attempt to justify a torturous prison state (""make the world safe for blame"", as the saying goes) was just the final straw for me, and sufficiently direct to render even the most generous interpretation a fully unacceptable argument. And, if the philosophy is not something the book may be justly judged as a whole for - then why is it there? More to the point, it should not be there, if the purpose is not precisely to frame what came before. So, the explicitly philosophical section is the last straw before generosity must end, and the book fall under the strain of its shitty philosophy -- or its just another bit of bad thoughts in a long chain of (disjointed) bad thoughts, interspersed with some admirably genuine gushing about an idol (Darwin)."
294,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1098316-jamie,3,"Using the writings of Charles Darwin to deliver its human morality principles, I felt by the end of this book that I had learnt more about the great man than I had about myself. One problem with this book is that by centering on life in the 19th century, its themes were often not as relevant to society today. For instance, it may be advantageous for women to play a little harder to get in the game of love, but this is unlikely to have a significant implication towards social status today. Another example, families are unlikely to favor a child simply because they have a greater chance of moving up in socioeconomic circles. I further disagreed with the premise that each person has no free will, we may all inherit a certain instinct, but an instinct does not define our actions in their entirety. Some underlying truths in this book are thought provoking. Man is not intended to be monogomous, but such cultural norms likely maintain social cohesion by allowing a more equal pairing of men and women. We are rarely content with the present and constantly focused on status signals and self aggrandizement, hence, our morals are essentially innate feelings driven by selfish goals, which require constant self-reflection and scepticism to control. This is also a singificant reason why all major religious have the same central themes, which have been considered necessary to guide our innate morals towards the promotion of social harmony.Charles Darwin said this in 1882, and to me it is the key message I will take out of the book: ""As man advances in civilisation, and small tribes are united to larger communities, the simplest reason would tell each individual that he ought to extend his social instincts and sympathies to all the members of the same nation, though personally unkown to him. This point being once reached, there is only an aftifical barrier to prevent his sympathies extending to the men of all nations and races."" Humanity will continue to evolve and our success is dependent on the ability to empathize with all life on this planet.  "
295,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5817744-emma-b,3,"I'm about 100 pages in, and the material is quite fascinating. The book basically links every single trait of humanity back to an adaptation in the ancestral environment.I just wish he'd stop personifying natural selection.Correction, deifying.That kinda defeats the purpose of science.-------------Upon finishing the book, my final opinion is that it was decent, but not fantastic. His deification of the process of natural selection trailed off, much to my relief. The book itself consisted mostly of references and quotes to previous studies, with little interjection by the author, but it was nice to have all that data in one place and in a logical order. The concept of reciprocal altruism, by which humans develop societies, relationships, and most of our higher emotions, was quite interesting, even if a bit common-sensical. It was explained, if perhaps to death, very well, and was easy to understand.The chapters concerning Darwin himself I found to be less than interesting. Many times, the author decided to stray far into the depths of biography, leading us through the childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and finally death of Charles Darwin himself. These chapters were sprinkled with psychological notes with either no apparent relevance or no apparent basis. I found myself leafing quickly through them, hoping to skip past the psych profile of a long-dead man and return to the science.The final chapter, I believe, had no real reason to exist, or at least not to be as long as it was. It was the conclusion, a summation and review of the ideas covered in the book, which didn't number very many, and it made up about 1/5th of the whole book's length. It seemed simply unnecessary. A nice, ten-page abstract and a 'how this info could be used' section I think would have been a much nicer way to end the book.All in all, it was alright, though not nearly as educational as I'd hoped. I've walked away with some new vocab and a basal understanding of this branch of psychology though, which means it wasn't a waste."
296,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17983541-sam,2,"I thought there were some interesting ideas in this book (particularly the suggestion that awareness of the evolutionary roots of behaviour can guide morality by making us conscious of biases and types of reactions that are ill-suited to modern industrial life), but for me there was also one significant flaw: Going by this book, it seems that Wright thinks natural selection shaped humankind predominantly by acting on men. His discussion of women in evolution relates mostly to the Madonna-whore dichotomy, and an odd diversion in which he argues that polygamy should be embraced by feminists because it means more women can choose to marry a high-status man, getting more resources as one of several wives than they might as the single wife of a lower status man. Even when discussing issues unrelated to sex, our male ancestors apparently were the key to evolutionary changes. For example, on p285: 'Feelings of enmity, of grievance, of righteous indignation - of collective enmity and grievance and righteous indignation - probably have their deepest roots in ancient conflicts within bands of humans and pre-humans. In particular: in conflicts among coalitions of males for status.' (What, because female humans and pre-humans never felt group loyalty or righteous indignation?). Another example: in the index, there are 12 topics listed under 'male parental investment,' whereas 'female parental investment' isn't even listed (there is, however, an entry for 'feminism - sexual symmetry as doctrine of'). Based on the assumption that natural selection operates on ALL members of a species, I can't help but doubt the accuracy of at least some of Wright's ideas, given that he seems so focused on only half of the ancestral pool."
297,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51128101-amanda,3,"First of all, I fully acknowledge that this book was outside of my comfort zone as a reader. I do enjoy nonfiction and even the occasional scientific book, but those “sciencey” books are usually about the non-human natural world. Astronomy, for instance, or botany. Furthermore, I have something of a background in sociology, so reading a book that favors biological rather than social explanations for human behavior was a bit difficult for me. That said, I found Wright’s book to be a good primer on evolutionary psychology. As a total newcomer to the field, I never felt completely out of my depth. A bit skeptical from time to time, but not nearly as much as I expected. I think Wright does a good job, not only of conveying the information, but of making it understandable as well. To be entirely fair, I can’t say how accurate the information or its usage is because, as I said, I’m a novice here. My biggest issue was probably Wright’s tactic of anthropomorphizing natural selection: it “wants” this, it designed us to do that. I see how this could be a valid explanatory tactic, but it just ended up making me have to reread and rethink. Something else, more a personal gripe than anything else, is that, when the book talks about sexual attraction/relationships/etc., it’s exclusively heterosexual. As a lesbian, I found myself wondering throughout the book, “But what about the queers?” In the FAQ section at the back of my copy, Wright acknowledges the subject, but mostly brushes it off, essentially saying, “It doesn’t really matter how natural it is; some people are gay and, morally, I think that should be the end of the discussion.” And, like, that’s great, dude. But that’s not what I asked. Overall, I found the book pretty much understandable, but just not that engrossing. "
298,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,1,"Confused book. It seems to be a blend of something called evolutionary psychology, a biography of Charles Darwin and an argument for returning to Victorian morals. As such the book is often slow and confused. These three strands are interweaved and frankly, become uninteresting as the book goes along. The writing is often repetitive, saying the same things about natural selection over and over for example. The analysis is not great either…the author touts something called evolutionary psychology which he doesn’t convince me exists. I think of psychology as being culture and social related…evolution is entirely biological…yes, we have feeling, but they’re shaped by chemistry and biology. How we view these feelings is psychology which, outside of neurology is a social construct. I found the biography of Darwin distracting and detracting…if I wanted to read a biography of Darwin, there are full length better books out there. Lastly, if I wanted to read about why we should return to Victorian morals, there are better arguments and books which focus on the society not biology. In short, I wanted to read a book about the science of evolutionary psychology not a political polemic or a biography. The latter wasn’t even convincingly argued and so I’m not just disappointed, I’m disgusted I spent money on this book. So, I give this a 1. It fails in every respect. It can’t even convince me that evolutionary psychology is a thing and the rest of the book is just filler and a waste of the reader’s time. "
299,0679763996,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"This is the most fluent, starting from scratch book on the subject of evolution I have read. There is no presupposition of prior knowledge. And the author makes good use of popular notions of the Darwinian theory to throw light on understandings that are wrong, answer those common questions most of us have in mind and explain the real meaning of evolution.Unlike Dawkins' books which are turgid at times because of too many examples from the behaviours of species of various kind (most of those species that non-experts have never heard of) , Wright mostly uses the life of Darwin himself to make many points. This appears odd for a theory that explicitly warns against the use of specifics, the approach works. It also helps that evolution is explained more from the viewpoint of where humanity has reached today than any other notions.Some of the conclusions are outrageous, particularly when they give genetic inevitability to morally/socially reprehensible behaviour. Equally, many conclusions - like in Freudian theories that the author so vehemently criticises - seem to be derived from highly glib, flimsily proven verbal/logical ""must be/could be"" rationales. Perhaps these things are inevitable without the quantified edifices of physical sciences, but they also prove to be the reasons behind relatively less acceptance of almost all the finer points of evolutionary theories."
