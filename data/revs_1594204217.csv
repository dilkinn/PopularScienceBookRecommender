0,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26259-jenne,0,"So as background, let me tell you a little bit about the day I started/gave up reading this book. I woke up in my tiny (494 sq ft) 1920s-era house in a walkable urban neighborhood. As I went outside to water my vegetable garden and take out the recycling, I saw my neighbor had returned my pie plate (I'd brought him the leftovers of my contribution to a pre-thanksgiving potluck) and also left me a mason jar of homemade spiked cider. Then I walked up the block to the coffee cart on the corner, where I got some organic pour-over coffee and homemade banana bread. By the time I got home, my taxi had arrived, so I loaded in my vintage 1970s carry-on that I got for a dollar at the Thursday Club rummage sale (a copy of McSweeney's Lucky Peach magazine in the side pocket) and went to the airport. I got on the plane, pulled out my iPad, and opened the eGalley of this book...which is all to say that 1) I am bougie as shit2) if anyone should be the proper audience for this book, it is meand 3) despite all that, by about page 8 all I wanted to say was: Shut up, Michael Pollan. Just. Shut. Up. *Disclaimer: I think Michael Pollan is great. I think slow food is great. I think local artisans and organic farms and healthy eating and sustainable everything and all of that is great. SO GREAT!! But I am tired of being told, okay? I GET IT. I was looking forward to a cool book about his experiences making pickles or whatever, not another rehash of the same old thing. People who don't know about this stuff already can just read The Omnivore's Dilemma. It's still in print."

Otherwise.... read on!1. Michael Pollan is a clever man, and a cheerful one.2. MP does a lot of research.3. MP is very wordy because he wants you to know the he is a clever man who does a lot of research and is a cheery chappy, not a depressive old so-and-so who edits his work down to the bone,4. MP is very well off and thinks his readers are too and live in areas where there are lots of organic farms and farmers' markets because that's where he shops and you should too.I got so bored reading this very worthy book that I started to note down nuggets of wisdom, or at least interesting stories. From just a day of that I deduced that it was one interesting bit for five pages of MP going on being clever showing his research and just what a convivial, family man he was etc. It would have been really good cut down but then it would have been a bit thin.I do not agree with his premise that it was cooking meat that gave us a supply of more, easy to get calories that enabled our brains to grow and for us to become the brilliant humans we are. There are plenty of societies which are either vegetarian or only have meat rarely and they have the same size brains as the rest of us. Hunter gatherers in all parts of the world are not noted for being particularly thick and having only walnut-sized brains in their heads. The development of civilization is another strand of our humanity all together.______________In the real world most of us do not have access to farms that will butcher whole organically-raised cows and sell us just a pound of mince at a reasonable price. Farmers' markets trade on their names and the glow that goes along with the idea that everything is locally grown and free from pesticides unlike factory farm stuff you get in the supermarket, or at least so they say, but they also buy in from other farms who specialise in supplying farmers' market traders and might not be so fussy. . When you are paying a lot of money for organic food in the supermarket have you ever stopped to think it doesn't matter how it was grown, it was transported in crates in an open truck up and down the highway, lots of fumes for the produce to breathe in? Or that the organic apples and other stored items had been gassed to make them ripen more slowly, that the refrigerated items might also have been gassed and fresh produce is often wrapped in bags that slow deterioration by changing the chemical consitutents in the gas, air, that surrounds them?It's your choice who you support, but bathing in the warm glow of doing the best for your family by eating only locally-produced, non-transported organic food is only for the very well off who have a nice country home. Then they can poison themselves by commuting to the city for work.Rather than concentrating on organic and local, maybe the easier to manage whole foods rather than processed would keep us healthier, after all that's what our poor immigrant or peasant families once ate. Whole foods, not much meat, that being a treat, home-cooked with no preservatives, lots of exercise in the open air, and sleep. It worked for them, it must have or we wouldn't be around. I know we are longer-lived now, but that is due more to the advances of medicine than it is to increase in nutrition from our wonderful preservative, sugar and fat based diet."
2,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,3,"Air elevates our food, in every sense, raises it from the earthbound subsistence of gruel to something so fundamentally transformed as to hint at human and even divine transcendence. Air lifts food up out of the the mud and so lifts us, dignifying both the food and its eaters. Surely it is no accident that Christ turned to bread to demonstrate his divinity; bread is partially inspired already, an everyday proof of the possibility of transcendence. Mmmmm-hmmmmm, sure, Michael Pollan. Doesn't this seem a little overwrought to you? A little... poetic? Listen, there are approximately a billion jillion food books out there. NOT COOKBOOKS. I'm not talking about cookbooks. I'm talking about ""Processed food is killing us!"" and ""Back to the earth!"" and""I gave up my lucrative investment banker job to live on a small farm and raise goats!"" and""My life has more meaning now that I raise chickens!"" and""Local food is the key to immortality!"" etc. etc. etc. I read about 40 of these pre-GR. Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life, Still Life With Chickens: Starting Over in a House by the Sea, Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal, etc. etc. etc. And I was a little burned out.This is a food book. Just like all those other 80 food books you've read. Perhaps you haven't read any food books. If this is your first food book, you will think it is AMAZING! You will be like, ""OMG! How did I not know all this stuff before!!!! I must spread the word and save humanity!""But if this is your 50th food book (like it is mine), you are going to be like, ""Uh-huh. I know all this already.""That's mainly Michael Pollan's problem. And it's his own fault. After all, he wrote The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals in 2006. He could be considered one of the leaders of this kind of ""food book"" trend, or at least a ""food book"" bigwig. But the problem is EVERYONE is writing food books now and I am just food-booked-out. Pollan is bringing nothing new to the table with this. LOLIs he a good writer?Yeah, he's a good writer. Funny, a bit wordy, dropping family anecdotes and braving all sorts of things to learn how to roast, cook, bake, and ferment his own food....VIETNAM AND BARBECUE The book is divided into four parts:1.) FIREA quarter of this book is about barbecue. Pollan goes out to learn how to do ""real BBQ"" and hog-roasts. Actually, I found this section to be the most interesting because it's the only section where Pollan kind of touches on gender roles and race relations. I love talking about gender roles and race relations! Every time Pollan was like, ""In ancient Greece, women and slaves did most of the everyday cooking, but when the occasion called for a ritual meal, whether to mark the beginning or conclusion of a military campaign, or the arrival of an honored guest, or a day otherwise made large by history, the men performed the honors. my ears would prick up. ""Tell me more about this!"" I would beg Pollan, only to have him start telling me all about a pit-master named Ed who thinks he's the second coming of BBQ, or something. Food is an area fraught with peril for feminists. My dear friend is a strong feminist, and she loves to cook. She is a wonderful cook. No one at work knows she can cook. She is afraid that if they find out she can cook, they will want her to bring stuff to work potlucks etc. She grew up watching girls in class bring everyone cookies, ya know what I'm saying? And she knows the men stay seated after a meeting while the females get up and clear the dishes. She doesn't clear the fucking dishes. If the men stay seated, she also stays seated.Hmmmmm, I totally admire her and relate to this. On the other hand, I think it's sad that her love of cooking is such a huge secret and something she feels she needs to hide. We still have a bit to go, I think, re: equality.Or when Pollan would start saying, ""It seems to me that authentic whole-hog barbecue is not something you ever want to pay someone to do by the hour. In fact, it's hard to imagine that this method of cooking, which demands so much more time than effort, would ever have taken root in a society where wage labor was the norm. The rhythms of barbecue are much better suited to the premodern economics of sharecropping or slavery. Such an economy, combined with the heat, helped make a certain slowness - as much as pork or wood smoke - a key ingredient in Southern cooking, and Southern culture more generally."" Wow, really? I want to talk about this more! But no, Pollan leaves that to talk about crackling or something. ""Food,"" Edge told me, ""is one of the ways the South is working through its race quandaries."" Or what about this, I loved this: ""Only two things in my experience have had the power to transcend race: Vietnam and barbecue.""What about when he talks about the raw food movement, ...humans don't do well on raw food: They can't maintain their body weight, and half of the women on a raw-food regimen stop menstruating. WOW. So fascinating. I have friends who are/have been raw foodists, and indeed, a lot of females got amenorrhea. Word up. Also, it gets complicated when/if you want to have children. Not only the amenorrhea! But whether to try and put kids on a raw food diet after they are weaned. But there is just ONE PARAGRAPH in the whole book about raw foodists.The other three sections are not even as interesting, and note that I'm saying ""interesting"" as Pollan is throwing me one sentence here, one sentence there, a paragraph over there. Sigh.2.) WATERPollan learns how to cook. Stews, soups, braises,... Pollan is taught by a Iranian woman named Samin.3.) AIRPollan learns how to bake bread from a bunch of different males.4.) EARTHPollan learns how to to make sauerkraut, kimchi, cheese, and beer. I love when he talks about cheese and sex....MAIN MESSAGES OF THE BOOK:1.) Cooking is what makes us human.2.) Bacteria are our friends....ME:Well, both my mother and father cooked. And baked. They both were excellent cooks and bakers. There was no ""women cook and bake, men don't"" thinking in our house. Both my mother and father prided themselves on their excellent meals.I was very lucky. We made almost everything from scratch. We lived in a house where dad or mom would frequently admonish: ""Walk softly - the bread's in the oven."" When I went over to a friend's house and saw them put a frozen pizza in the oven it was like o.O stepping into a different world for me. Same for my friends. When I invited them over after school for macaroni and cheese, I think they were expecting a neon-colored Kraft concoction, not for me to start mixing up a roux over the stove.As a result, I cook and bake. All my siblings (male and female) cook and bake. We think nothing of making homemade vegetable soup, homemade chili, homemade lasagna, we cook beans and rice, we whip up a roux or a sofrito/mirepoix. We bake bread. We bake cookies and pies. We make pizza from scratch (waiting patiently for the dough to rise). Homemade, from-scratch cinnamon rolls (heaven!!!). Quiche. I am blessed. Cooking/Baking is one of the best gifts my parents ever gave me.However - you CAN pull yourself up by your bootstraps. My friend who was from one of those ""frozen pizza, boxed dinner"" families really wanted to learn to cook. I started to teach her. She was a horrible cook. Horrible. LOL She moved away to get her own place and I was unable to see her as frequently. I thought that she'd give up trying to cook and bake and revert to her family's teaching of eating out and microwaving. I was WRONG. I'm telling you - now, years and years later, - she is an AMAZING cook and baker. She cooks and bakes for and with her boyfriend and friends all the time. She throws wonderful dinner parties. She really taught herself and through trial and error became a wonderful cook.That's what Pollan is doing here - going from someone who ate frozen ravioli to someone who spends the weekends chopping vegetables and making delicious stews, kimchi, and bread....Tl;dr - I liked this book. The best parts were when Pollan was talking about sex, gender, and race. That's probably just my preference, though. I also like when he talks about being Jewish, not keeping kosher, Christ and the Bible, and how bacteria may help with HIV and autism. This is very infrequent, though. Mostly he's talking about cooking, baking, chemistry, heat, etc. etc. The writing is good, if a little wordy at times. Overall, a worthwhile read.P.S. There are recipes in the back.ETA: May 11, 2015BAKING BREAD IS NOT DIFFICULT.Just yesterday I made two loaves of rye with caraway seeds by hand from scratch. Easy. Simple.This book makes it seem like making bread is complicated. Or that you need a ""baker tutor"" to show you how it's done, or something.Yes, it is easier if someone shows you the first time, but it isn't a big deal.If you are thinking about baking bread, or attempting to bake bread for the first time, just go for it! I'm here to tell you that it is not scary or difficult. *nod nod*"
3,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2418516-jessica,5,"This is less a review of the book and more a response to other people's critiques of 'Cooked'.Anyone who tells you that this book is simply a rehash of 'The Omnivore's Dilemma' never made it past the second page.Having read 'Second Nature', 'Botany of Desire', 'The Omnivore's Dilemma' and 'In Defense of Food' (in that order), 'Cooked' reads much less like he is treading old ground and more like he is building on previous themes. One could argue that 'In Defense of Food' and 'Food Rules' are both a little too close to 'Dilemma' and were perhaps capitalizing on the then trendy subject of food politics. But 'Cooked' certainly is not, instead it does exactly what the dust jacket tells you it is going to do, it invites you into Pollan's kitchen while he experiments with and muses on dinner.And as a woman and a feminist, I didn't find a single thing in the second chapter (which tackles gender stereotypes in the kitchen) remotely sexist or anti-feminist. If a reader finds anything he says about either the feminist movement or the need for someone in the household to return to the kitchen offensive, they are surely looking for a bone to pick and consequently are doing only a cursory reading.Right now if you plug Pollan's name into Google you come up with a lot of splashy headlines: 'Is Michael Pollan a Sexist Pig?' 'Why Does Michael Pollan Romanticize Dinner?' and 'Why Does Michael Pollan Think Cooking Is an Escape From Corporations?'. Most of these articles concede that 'Cooked' is really a good book, a fun read, maybe a little flawed, but essentially on the same side as the authors of the previously named articles. Then why the attention grabbing headlines? Perhaps because it is easier to tear apart something that is both good and popular in order to ride it's coat tails than come up with something new. Or perhaps it is becoming 'uncool' to like Michael Pollan as he and his views are gathering a mainstream following.'Cooked' is a good book, a fun read. It left me with the drive to get back in my garden, return to baking bread, maybe even take up cheese making. I learned a lot about the science of cooking. Pollan has a particular gift to take scientific material and translate it for the layman. The overly critical backlash against it should not keep anyone from picking it up and enjoying it."
4,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,4,"Michael Pollan, an author and journalist who writes about food, went on a three-year pilgrimage to learn about food associated with the four classical elements: fire, water, air, and earth. Along the way, Pollan consulted and cooked with masters in each field. In 'Cooked', Pollan shares culinary techniques he acquired, along with healthy doses of science, history, anthropology, and philosophy.Michael PollanPackaged, processed, and fast foods have taken a toll on our well-being because these edibles contain large amounts of sugar, fat, and salt - as well as preservatives that aren't natural to our diet. To remedy the situation, Pollan posits that we should cook more, and notes that 'cooking is one of the most interesting and worthwhile things we can do.'
Fire
One way to prepare food with fire is to roast meat over burning wood. Traditional barbecue pork is prepared like this, from whole hogs roasted in pits. Pollan consulted some of the most skilled pitmasters in North Carolina - including the barbecue expert Ed Mitchell - and learned that the pigs are slowly roasted over oak and hickory coals. When the hogs are done, assistants wearing heavy gloves pull the meat apart with their hands - a hot and laborious process. The pulled pork can the be served on plates or in sandwiches for a tasty meal. Of course the earliest humans didn't cook their food. The English writer Charles Lamb (1775-1834) claims that all meat was eaten raw until the art of roasting was accidently discovered by a hapless Chinese boy named Bo-bo. Bo-bo liked to play with fire, and one day, when Bo-bo was home alone, he burned down the family cottage....incinerating a litter of piglets. Bo-bo - and then his family - tasted the burnt piglets, whose skin had crisped to delicious 'cracklings' - and they were good. After this, whenever the family sow farrowed, the cottage burned down - a practice that soon spread to all the neighbors. Eventually, a smarter head figured out that pigs could be roasted on a spit, and humans discovered the art of cooking. The Scottish writer James Boswell (1740-1795) wrote that cooking is the 'defining human ability', the attribute that separates us from animals. Moreover, anthropologists postulate that cooking ALLOWED our proto-human ancestors to evolve into Homo sapiens because cooked food was easier to digest, and provided the large quantities of nutrients needed by our bigger brains. Of course fire can be used to cook many things, and Pollan was especially impressed with Chef Victor Arguinzoniz at the Asador Etxebarri Restaurant in Spain. Chef Victor prepares everything on a grill, including dessert. The chef is known for his juicy prawns, chorizo tartare, and even his butter - which is eaten without bread, like a fine cheese. So if you're ever in Axpe, Spain, you know where to go.Tasting Menu at Asador Etxebarri 
Water
Cooking with water became possible when humans developed the ability to craft pots. Pollan - who lives in California - needed help to hone his braising skills, so he recruited a local Iranian-American chef and cookbook author, Samin Nosrat. Samin has big personality and a storehouse of food knowledge that she's happy to share. Samin says great cooking is about the three P's - patience, presence, and practice. Michael Pollan and Samin NosratMost braises start with sautéed onions, which must be chopped fine and cooked slowly to get things started. In fact onions (and garlic) contribute to the safety of food, because they contain powerful antimicrobial compounds that protect us from dangerous bacteria. After the onions comes the meat, which is seasoned with at least 'three to five times as much salt as you think you need.' This brings out the intrinsic flavors of the meat, and improves its texture and appearance. Once the meat is seared, everything goes into a covered pot with vegetables, spices, and braising liquid - which can be almost anything: wine, stock, puree, juice, milk, beer, dashi, tap water, and more - depending on the recipe and its cultural reference. The food is then slowly cooked until the meat is tender and (hopefully) delicious. Pollan writes, 'the one pot meal brings the family together, unlike individual microwave meals.' Certain edibles - such as good stew - appeal to us because our 'tastes' have been selected by evolution for their survival value. The five 'flavors' human taste buds can detect are: sweetness - which directs us to sugar-rich foods that are good sources of energy; salty - because salt is an essential nutrient; bitter - so we don't eat toxic plants; sour - so we stay away from rotten food; and umami (the taste of savoriness) - so we'll consume nutritious proteins. The revulsion we feel to bitter and sour foods can be overcome, however, and many people develop an 'acquired taste' for things like tea, coffee, dark chocolate, kale, grapefruit, 'stinky cheeses', and so on. 
Air
Air, the element that 'puffs up' bread, helps convert wheat into usable energy. Pollan notes that he really loves good bread, and would rather eat a slice of fresh bread - with a rugged crust and a moist, tender, pocket-filled interior (called 'the crumb') - than a piece of cake. The gases in the crumb carry much of the 'roasty, yeasty, hazelnutty, and faintly alcoholic aroma' of the bread, which the author prefers to the smell of wine or coffee. To become a home baker, Pollan decided to learn to make sourdough bread, which begins with a 'starter' - a leavening agent made from a flour-water mixture fermented by yeast and bacteria. For sourdough starter, bakers do not add microbes (such as store bought yeast), but depend on yeasts and bacteria in the flour, water, and air. To perfect his starter Pollan consulted a number of bread experts, including Chad Robertson from San Francisco's Tartine Bakery - a bread guru renowned for his sourdough creations. Watching Chad shape his breads, Pollan saw a 'blur of fingers that looked like they were swaddling an endless row of infants at warp speed.' Pollan brought his starter to the Tartine Bakery in a Tupperware container, wanting to get some pointers on the care and feeding of the concoction - and hoping to secretly snag some microbes, because the bakery 'must be crawling with them.' 😊Sourdough starter Pollan also acquired flour milled from specially grown wheat, and - with much practice - made some very tasty loaves. It's important to use WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR - including the bran and germ - because this is where the vitamins and antioxidants are. Unfortunately for our ancestors, there was a historical preference for white flour, since it made bread that was sweeter and airier - but much less healthful. Because of this, the government requires nutrients to be put back into baked goods, which is why Wonder Bread and the like have a slew of artificial ingredients. A 'whole grain' renaissance began in the 1960s, and many of today's artisanal bakers have embraced whole grains, so - even if you don't bake - healthy breads are easy to find (even on supermarket shelves). Sourdough bread 
Earth
Bacteria and fungi are everywhere, just waiting to decompose things. While organisms are alive, their cells are protected by membranes or walls, but - as soon as living things die - bacteria and fungi start to break them down. This is a good thing, because it keeps the planet from being covered with dead plants and animals, poop, debris, trash, and so on. Bacteria are beneficial in many ways. In fact our bodies are largely composed of bacteria. Microbes in our gut are essential to life, since they maintain our intestinal wall, help us digest certain carbohydrates, crowd out harmful pathogens, produce antibiotic compounds, and activate the immune system. In the vagina, bacteria help maintain a pH low enough to resist pathogens. Moreover, bacteria evolve right along with us. For instance, Japanese people have specific microbes that help them digest seaweed. Microbes also ferment foodstuffs - that is, they produce chemical changes that preserve foods and change their flavor. Early humans (probably accidently) learned to ferment foods, and people have been doing it ever since. The earliest impetus for 'pickling' (a word that refers to ALL vegetable ferments, not just pickles) was preservation. Until there was a way to preserve food, humans could not advance from hunting and gathering to agriculture. Fermentation, along with smoking and drying, allowed farmers to survive the long months between harvests. As an additional bonus, fermentation creates useful molecules - like B vitamins, vitamin C, amino acids, and anti-cancer elements....AND breaks down chemical compounds that interfere with nutrient absorption. So fermentation has many advantages.On the downside, fermented foods are a culturally specific 'acquired taste', so fermented foods of other ethnic groups often strike us as 'rotten.' The list of items prepared via fermentation is impressive, and includes bread, coffee, pickles, sauerkraut, kimchi, beer, cheese, yogurt, soy sauce, kombucha, kefir, miso, natto, and more. Pollan acquired pickling recipes from 'fermentation revivalist' Sandor Katz, who teaches fermentation workshops around the country. Katz is a 'fermento', a group of dedicated brewers, cheese makers, picklers, and 'post-Pasteurians' - people who fight for the right to drink unpasteurized milk and eat unpasteurized cheeses. One of the country's foremost raw-cheese makers is a nun, Sister Noella Marcellino, who helped the author learn the art of cheese creation. Sister Noella, who has a Ph.D. in microbiology, has government permission to use her old wooden implements rather than the stainless steel instruments mandated by law.A VERY COMMON use of fermentation is the making of alcoholic beverages, which began at least 7,000 to 8,000 years ago. Wine, beer, or mead have been used in religious rituals for centuries, in the belief that 'intoxication' gives people access to the gods. Fermented drinks were beneficial to early humans because they were safer than water (since alcohol kills pathogens) and contain extra vitamins, minerals, and proteins. Pollan relates that his first experiment with wine-making occurred when he was ten years old, and intrigued by alchemy. (He'd already tried to convert a lump of coal into a diamond. 😎) The youthful Pollan gathered grapes, squashed them up in an orange juice container, screwed the lid on tightly, and put it on a table in the living room. He apparently didn't notice the container starting to bulge.....and came home with his parents one night to find the living room smelling of wine and completely splattered with purple stains. As an adult, Pollan and his son made beer - dubbed 'Pollan's Pale Ale' - which he says is quite drinkable. Since completing research for this book, some of Pollan's culinary routines have fallen by the wayside. However, he still spends Sunday afternoons preparing braises for the family; makes ale once in a while; bakes bread every couple of weeks; and roasts a pig on his lawn every year - a ritual enjoyed by family, friends, and neighbors. The book is long, and my review merely skims the top of what's inside - including tips for preparing a variety of foods and beverages. I enjoyed the narrative, though some of the philosophical musings are a bit overdone (IMO). Still, even if you're not a cook - or a foodie - there's a lot to enjoy here. You can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot...."
5,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3131238-judy,4,"The title, Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation, says it all. Pollan takes the reader on a food trek: a limited historical account, his own account of transformation into a better cook plus documentation of how processing has transformed the foods of the world. I hesitantly picked this book up, afraid that it would be dehydrated, monotonous detailing of the history of food. No bologna! that is not the case. Pollan dishes up a nicely seasoned balance of his own personal story, food industry chatter and history. My fear of the history being ladled on too heavy was unwarranted. Here are a few items that I savored:*The book is sliced into 4 sections: Fire (barbecue); Water (art of braising); Air (breadmaking -think, air bubbles in bread) and lastly, Earth (fermentation). I appreciated the additional focus of cooking coming from basic elements.*Personal stories, well-documented information, variety - The Ed Mitchell and Chad Robertson scoops were personal favorites. For each category (Fire, Water, Air & Earth), Pollan tried to line up a training session with an expert on whatever he was preparing.*Quality of writing - I don't know if just any author could have made this as tasty. Pollan does have the right credentials and skills to bring this account to a pleasant slow-simmer. Although, I enjoyed reading this book, I did find the sections I related to most, sizzled most for me. My tastebuds weren't tantalized as much by the last section involving fermentation because its not something I've tried before or had much interest in attempting. But overall, well-done and I have taken away a few tips to improve my own culinary skills. Not to mention, I now know that there is a 5th taste we can sense in addition to salty, sour, bitter and sweet...Four succulent stars****"
6,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"In Michael Pollan's latest book about food, he takes the reader on a personal journey as he learns first-hand about four different types of cooking. First, he takes a trip to the North Carolina, where he learns how to cook barbecue from a pit master. Pollan volunteers his time, and learns the subtleties of cooking a barbecue, and these subtleties are described in detail. Perhaps, a bit too much detail for my taste.Then Pollan describes the art of making sourdough bread. In great detail. One very interesting factoid is that one can live off of bread, but the nutrition in flour alone is insufficient to sustain life. Pollan describes the chemical reactions involved in the making of bread, and it is these chemical reactions that are necessary to generate sufficient nutrition for living.The book also goes into detail about fermented foods, especially cheese. He visits Mother Noella, the ""Cheese Nun"" who has a PhD in microbiology. She has used her understanding of chemistry, biology, and bacteria to perfect the making of cheese. A lot of evidence is cited, about the healthfulness of fermented foods. I found a new respect for fermented foods, and especially my favorite; pickles.I am a vegan, so the sections on barbecue and making cheese are not exactly enticements to try cooking or eating these foods. Nevertheless, Pollan manages to make it all interesting to me, as he brings the master cooks to life.There are no recipes in this book. While you cannot learn how to cook from this book, you can gain some insight into why cooking helps make us human. The book is an argument for taking the time to cook, instead of heating up pre-cooked dinners. Parts of the book wax poetic about the art of cooking, and about the people who have mastered the art of specialty cooking."
7,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1921076-katie,4,"I wanted to love this book so badly and there are definite 5-star parts to it, but there are also 1-star parts. Parts that I, admittedly, skimmed through. I suppose that is to be expected in a book covering so many topics. The book is divided into 4 parts - earth, air, fire, and water - and I while I understand and can see the appeal of this, I oftentimes felt that the connections were tenuous, at best. For example, there is an obvious connection between roasting a pig and fire. However, the inclusion of alcohol fermentation in the ""air"" section felt really obtuse. I get that yeast is in the air, but....it felt contrived.Part 1: Fire. OH MY GOD, if you can read these 100 pages and not want to go out and roast a pig in your backyard, or at the very least, drive down to the south for some authentic barbecue, then you should not read this book, because you don't love food. I loved the writing; I could almost taste and feel the barbecued pig while reading. Part 2: Water. Simple braises are my MO in the kitchen, but I never realized how much temperature and cooking times can alter the flavor of a simple miripoix (carrots, onion, celery). I loved the focus on flavors and how to bring those out with different techniques.Part 3: Air. I didn't love this chapter at all. In fact, I almost skipped the last 75 page of it completely, but I skimmed them. I don't eat bread, but I was fascinated by the focus on biology and what is going on when yeast combine with sugar and create those delicate little pockets of yeasty goodness. I worked at a bakery for years in high school, so that scent will always be with me.Part 4: Earth. This was all about fermentation. I own and have read The Art of Fermentation and Wild Fermentation, and I am a regular vegetable pickler. However, I am more inclined to do the quick vinegar pickle which I was reminded isn't ""real"" pickling. I was inspired to get some veggies at the store to begin some real adventures in fermenting. I was not, however inspired to start fermenting beer. I'll leave that to the experts because some things are better as mysteries.Overall, it was a good book, but much too long. I loved the biology and nerdy science parts; I think this is where Pollan's writing and attention to detail really excel. The history parts were interesting, and I read those sections with some interest. However, I found myself rolling my eyes and getting very annoyed during the far-too-long sections about philosophy/religion. Maybe that's just the scientist in me coming out."
8,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1053760-shelby-trains-flying-monkeys,3,"Michael Pollan is one of my very favorited people. This is not my favorite of his books- however, it's still a good book. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't gotten on one of my OCD sprees last year and read everything I could about food. So this book for me was going over old ground.I did like the BBQ (fire) chapters, except they made me hungry. I loved the Bread (air) chapters, except they made me hungry.I liked the brasing (water) chapters, they did make me hungry.The fermentation chapters (earth) were great but yep..hungry.Mr. Pollan is the reason that I started eating healthier and give alot more thought to what I put in my mouth. His writing is always easy to understand and very personal for me."
9,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,4,"I've now read all of Pollan's book and I think I could do a really good parody at this point. I'd just have to compare a cheese curd to a dionysian struggle between our innate longing for romance and order. Or something like that. This book was a lot of fun. It gave me a new perspective on food and cooking and I learned a lot. Sometimes I get annoyed at the fermentation zealots out there now or the bread dudes and I wonder if they don't need to be reminded sometimes that we're just talking about food. People have very strong feelings about some of this stuff. I believe in everything he says in here, but I get annoyed when people use food preparation as a weapon of judgement. Maybe Pollan should write about that next--how much ego and identity has taken hold in our food tribes. Today's paleo, gluten-free, bread purists, kombacha cults sometimes sound like the prophets of the old testament talking about their food laws. "
10,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5376228-greta-fisher,5," Another excellent and inspiring book by Michael Pollan. Every topic is heavily researched -apparently for the sheer joy of it- and Pollan's enthusiasm is highly infectious. I've got a 100% whole wheat sourdough started (rather than a mix of white & wh.w.) am determined to make my own kimchi and feel inspired to make homemade mozzarella again. As for home made beer, I have a hunch any batch would explode spectacularly in the Texas summer heat-in spite of AC-. A project for late fall perhaps. As I've already mentioned-this is a very inspiring book! "
11,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10665178-sara,5,"Not only was this book about transformations in cooking, it was a transformative book for me. After reading this book, I had an uncontrollable urge to bake bread (hello whole wheat hamburger buns!) and start fermenting my own cucumbers.I picked this up at the library because of the title. I had never read a book by Michael Pollan, I had no idea he was one of Time magazines most influential people of the year back in 2010. Now I can see why. He certainly influenced me.This is a well written book. Even if a person disagreed with him on matters of diet, he is a master of words and I hated having to put the book down. I'm sad it's over. I need more Michael Pollan!He discusses cooking with all the elements - Fire, Water, Air, Earth.Fire - BBQ. Authentic southern barbecue, made from the whole hog. Not much a BBQ fan myself, I was salivating reading through this section. It's not just about the joys of eating real food prepared slowly, it's also a social commentary with questions raised about the ethics of hog farms. It makes you think.Water - Stews, Soups, Braises. This section was interesting, but I didn't become inspired to learn to make soffritto. It did make me want to spend more time in the kitchen, though.Air - This was THE chapter. Bread. Bread made from wild yeast. I learned so much about sourdough starters and bacteria and yeast. I learned about wheat. I learned what we have done to our wheat. I learned how humans have evolved with wheat and the relationship we have to yeast. I just can't buy a processed bread product now. (I'm sure I'll eventually have to, but hopefully, not as much as I have been.)Earth - Fermentation. Alcohol. Pickling naturally, without vinegar. I had no idea how hip and trendy fermenting is right now. It sounds earthy and fun. Yes, I'm a little leery of the microbes, but I think I'll steer clear of corning my own beef or making my own sausages (which wasn't touched in this book, but it was discussed in another book I read). Wine. Beer. Cheese. I had to go eat olives with seeds and good cheese and drink wine after this section. I learned about bacteria in our gut and how different studies are showing some very interesting things about our evolution with alcohol and fermented foods.If I could, I'd change my entire diet right now. But I can't - some of this takes too much time, some of this costs too much money. And for some things, I just don't think I've the patience or the talent. But it started me thinking. I've discussed everything in this book with my husband every night with such enthusiasm he's laughing at me (in a good way!)I recommend this book to EVERYONE."
12,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17462314-renee-dechert,4,"I'm a fan of Michael Pollan, both because of his fine writing and the food politics he espouses. In _Cooked_, he turns his attention to the four elements of cooking -- fire, air, earth, and water- -- and gives the reader a new look into the western food culture. The book is not only food memoir but also a heavy dose of philosophy, literary studies, history, and anthropology as Pollan illustrates the tangled cultural web of the food we eat. At times, this gets a bit ponderous though the point is well taken: Food doesn't exist in a cultural vacuum even though grocery stores and McDonald's might occasionally make us think it does."
13,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36348070-brandice,3,"""Cooking puts several kinds of distance between the brutal facts of the matter (dead animals for dinner) and the dining room table set with crisp linens and polished silver.""Cooked was a book that for the most part, I found interesting. Pollan studies 4 classic elements: Fire, Water, Air, and Earth, and their impact on the creation of food and beverage. For me, the book read in descending order of interest: the fire and water chapters were better and kept my interest much more than air and earth. I took many more breaks in the second half. I am admittedly not an expert in the kitchen. I'm a novice at best, and it's not a high priority of mine to achieve expert level - I get by. I think opinions will vary re: which sections of the book are most engaging, just based on personal preferences. I also loveddd The Omnivore's Dilemma, and Cooked, while interesting enough, just wasn't on the same level. ""Each of the different methods I learned for turning the stuff of nature into tasty creations of culture implies a different way of engaging with the world, and some are more sympathetic than others."" If you are already a Pollan fan and/or beyond novice level in the kitchen, I'm more likely to recommend ""you"" check Cooked out. If you're just considering any Pollan novel, choosing The Omnivore's Dilemma is an excellent choice to start with."

15,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3954558-patrizia,3,"I wanted to like this book, I really did, but in fact, I loathed it for reasons I can't quite put my finger on. The best I'd been able to come up with was the thought that each individual sentence had too much Béarnaise sauce, which meant I could not read it in my preferred fashion -- which is basically to lock myself in a room for three days and read it straight through. At a certain point, the complexity of Pollan's sentences started to make my eyes glaze over. Of course, one could argue that Pollan did not intend this book to be read in three days straight, that he wanted it to be -- well -- savored. That perhaps my inability to appreciate this book owed more to my inadequacies as a reader than to Pollan's inadequacies as a writer.Nonetheless, when I finally finished the last intricately fashioned sentence in Cooked, I wanted to book the first flight to Oakland, hop on Bart, get off in Berkeley, hunt down Michael Pollan's house, show up in his kitchen, and bitch slap him.For one thing, the central conceit of the book -- four elements corresponding to four styles of food preparation -- felt contrived. Yes, yes -- definite connection between fire and bbq, but baking bread and air? That's reaching.I do totally agree with most of Pollan's conclusions about the relationship between food preparation and various dysfunctional elements in today's society, particularly the bits about the Insidious Microwave and how it splinters family dinners, which are the only times that most families have the opportunity to bond.I suppose if I were editing Pollan, I'd recommend tuning down the articulation several notches. Making his sentences simpler and more direct: SUBJECT-VERB-OBJECT (period.) SUBJECT-VERB-OBJECT (period.) Framing the long, intricate sentences in simpler verbiage, perhaps with a ratio of 5:1. I think it would make this book considerably more readable."
16,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16021747-nathaniel-moger,5,"This was an awesome read, and well worth the effort to borrow and devour.Michael Pollan took a lesson from his last book - that if you eat whatever you make with your own two hands, you will be healthy - and applied it. Here, he takes the four elements of fire, water, air, and earth, and cooks four types of food with those elements. For fire, he apprenticed himself with a Carolina barbecue pit master. In the water section, he learned to braise from an Iranian immigrant who worked at Chez Panisse. Then he learned to bake bread from the owner of Tartine as a way to understand how to cook with hot air, and lastly he learned to pickle veggies and brew beer as a way of using the bacterias in earth to transform food.At it's core, this book is an optimistic look at how cooking enriches not just our health, but our relationships with friends, loved ones, and strangers. There are parts of the book where he paints a scary picture of the food world we live in (in a rehashing of the basic principles of ""In Defense of Food""), like how KFC marketed buckets of chicken as a second-wave feminism solution to the division of labor in American households, or how most Southern barbecue joints are owned by white men that underpay black pit masters to do the heavy lifting. But this book focuses more on how cooking heals than on how the lack of it hurts. It's hard not to smile a little when he describes having his best conversations with his teenage son Isaac while chopping vegetables because teenagers hate having real, face-to-face conversations, or how they spent quality father-son time brewing beer because the illicitness of the activity piqued Isaac's interest. Highly Recommend."
17,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3990525-crystal-starr-light,3,"Bullet Review:I didn't like it as much as The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals. And that's really what it boils down to in a sentence. Since I rated TOD 4 stars, this gets 3 stars to differentiate (though it ranks better than the other 3 stars it's grouped with - damned rating systems!).Some general problems:+ The tenuous relationship each element has to the supposed cooking method. Fire = barbecue, for sure, but fire is also critical in boiling and, duh, baking. Pollan spends a lot of time and effort on sourdough bread in the baking section, but making the sourdough starter requires fermentation, which is under earth.+ I don't recall TOD being this wordy. The sentences here are SO LONG, and listening on audiobook meant, I would wait forever in the car for Pollan to get to the end of a sentence.+ Michael Pollan made a decent narrator, though LOL at some of his pronunciations. Coolinary for ""culinary""? LOL.+ I found myself drifting off numerous times as Pollan goes into great depths about fermentation and broiling and such. In fact, pretty much the entire Earth/Fermentation section was a bust for me (much like Hunting/Foraging was in TOD), which is a shame because BEER AND CHEESE PEEPS.As 3 star ratings go, this is a high 3 stars, but still, it wasn't as enjoyable or insightful as TOD. And it just makes me more upset (OKAY JEALOUS) that I don't have the time or skill to bake every other night or spend all of Sunday chopping onions as Pollan does."

The first chapters are a bit off-putting- a bit too much philosophy, but starting with the chapter ""Fire"" I had a difficult time putting the book down. Food is such a complex part of our life- we need it, it takes our precious time to prepare it, if we choose the wrong food it can make us fat and unhealthy and yet...Food preparation is a sensuous , zen-like necessary art. I'm not much of a meat eater, but Fire was something i wanted my husband to read. Water, Air and Earth made we want to try everything- except maybe cheese making- which I will leave to the more adventurous. I gained a new appreciation for the historical, biological, psychological, and sociological import of food. I have a new appreciation for sauerkraut and kimchi and pickles. I am reminded that we Americans are making vast waste lands of our bodies by over sanitizing and industrial processing of our food. I will continue to eat the yogurt of the country I am visiting.I am presently reading Alcohol and am happy to keep drinking it.I guess I lean toward books that make me understand my world and myself better. This is definitely one of my favorite oF the past year"
19,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,5,"I love literate science and cultural micro-histories. I also love and health, growing my own veggies and cooking healthy meals. So I’ve been a huge Pollan fan since 2006, when my sister-in-law brought me The Omnivore's Dilemma for Christmas. Pollan hits on all cylinders.He’s a cultural critic, but unlike most cultural critics, his lense is food, not literature or pop-culture TV. movies or music, which makes him unique. He’s a food writer that doesn’t obsess about creating Michelin 5-star ingredients and esoteric food prep techniques, or present Bitman-esque reams of minimalist recipes.  Instead, Pollan uses his bully-pulpit to dissect the negative impact that industrial food companies have had on the health of Westerners. And that impact’s been horrible:increases in obesity, diabetes, the risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, etc. He’s also scientific in his approach, citing research, but unlike many a science or pop-diet writers, refuses to take the easy, reductionist answer. He doesn’t focus on single-elements of a diet (like the Atkins ‘kill the carbs, eat meat’ nonsense). Not does he jump on the “superfoods” bandwagon, saying we should all eat kale (or whatever the superfood of the moment is) every day for breakfast, lunch and dinners. And he scoffs at things like the “paleo diet,” a marketing ploy that’s a quixotic tilting at wind turbines in the 21st century. In fact, he’s the only new agey type guru I know of who advises AGAINST taking dietary supplements, whether vitamins, minerals or extracted nutrients . To Pollan, the good nutrition is more than a sum of vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals. Instead, whole foods create a holistic system that exploits our evolutionary machinery for turning foodstuffs into health. Due to ancillary phytochemicals, minerals, etc, a real apple contains, your body extracts more useable vitamin C from it than it can from a vitamin C tablet. Which is why he advocates eating diets of real, whole foods for optimal health.  Cooked continues Pollan’s top-shelf bibliography. In it, he traces four ways that humans cook food: fire, water, air and earth.   He starts with fire, apprenticing himself to a big-talking North Carolina pitmaster. There, he notes the Homeric and biblical similarities our modern barbeques, especially communal pig roasts, to their ancient cousins. Both are open-air, male-centric, extroverted celebrations of a successful hunt. He then moves onto the element water, where he learns to braise meats and stews in closed, domestic vessels. This practice is introverted, hearth-bound and feminine, but responsible for our most tasty, cherished and economical of dishes.  After tackling the big-two, the books rambles into the truly interesting… at least for me, since I seldom visit these realms. For the element air, Pollan learns the skills of artisan breadmaking. It turns out that there’s more to making bread than dumping yeast into a flour dough. In fact, for master-bakers, it’s an obsession that has them bringing their sourdough “starters,” a living culture of yeast and bacteria which give sourdough bread its unique taste, with them to the movies so they can “feed” the starter on schedule. Obsessive, for sure, but the results a tasty, often peerless loaf.  And then Pollan takes you into earth, the world of fermented food products. Pollan makes clear that fermentation is controlled rot. Think cabbage. But not the store-bought variety, often desiccated cabbage soured with vinegar, but how they make kraut in the old world. Shred the cabbage, put it in an airtight pot and let the bacteria present on the cabbage itself rot the cabbage to produce sauerkraut. Pollan’s “teachers of rot” include a half-cracked HIV-positive prophet of ingesting live bacteria named Sandor Katz, to a Catholic nun with a PhD in biochemistry who makes a traditional smelly-as-unwashed-feet French cheese for her convent. Pollan finishes playing basement brewmaster, lending an appreciation to the complexities of fermenting alcohol.  As always with Pollan, Cooked left me amazed by the breadth and depth of his insights. He’ll quote Nietzche, a contemporary archaeologist, a down-home pitmaster and then a scientific study on the health benefits of a whole food diet within the same page. Odd bedfellows, but Pollan has the knack for making the disparate hang together. Like a good cultural critic, he connects readers to heretofore unrealized deep traditions that hide in plain sight. Like a good food writer, he focuses on the artful preparation of food and understanding it’s histories. And like a top-flight science/ health writer, he highlights evidenced-based strategies we all can use to live healthier lives.  A rare, page-turner of a non-fiction book. Four-and-a-half stars, rounded up to five.  "
20,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58567012-ann-marie,4,"I have a funny relationship with Michael Pollan's books. I never actually want to read them. I can think of nothing more tedious than to examine in fine detail the aspects of food and the eating of it the way he does. Yet, once I start reading I get so involved I cannot help but see myself, my family, my ancestors, the generations to follow me living in his narrative. This holds so true for ""Cooked."" I started cooking at the age of 6 or 7 , but was probably born interested in it in ways I now see as going beyond the girly, mommy-type games of family care. It has always been tied up in family history, science and competition for me. I won 2nd place in a Council wide, 2 county Girl Scout bake off when I was 10 years old, with only the second came I had ever baked! Go me! I lost to a girl 3 years older than me with the remarkable name of Paisley Woodside. So, anyway... I connected with most sections of Pollan's book, the parts about bread baking, cooking with water (braising), fermenting, but not the cooking with fire bits. In our family cooking with fire meant Daddy cremating a cut up fryer chicken on the grill until the skin was black, the inside was tough and he called it, for some unknown reason, pelican steak.  My mom made our bread every week, she pickled, canned and preserved anything edible that grew within a 5 mile range of our house, and although we never brewed beer, she did attempt sauerkraut once with my paternal grandfather's vintage Red Wing crock. It was a bust. The kraut may have been delicious, but nobody in our family liked sauerkraut then, although today I wouldn't eat a bratwurst without loads of it. Pollan really gets into the evolution and history, the whys of how these methods of cooking are so much a part of our genetic soul. The end of the book includes some of the recipes he learned in his journey toward understanding why cooking out food is so integral to our well being and survival.  We may once have been creatures that survived on a raw diet, but we are tens of thousands of years beyond those beings, with digestive systems that depend on cooking's role in breaking down our nourishment into a useable form."
21,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,4,"For readers familiar with Michael Pollan, his writing style will come as no surprise. It's true that this book goes into the specifics of four elements in cooking, but in each he spends considerable time on background and related topics. I'm not sure I should have listened to the audio because when it started to get repetitive I couldn't skim like I would in the print. I just had to take my time listening, which can be hard with a 3 mile commute, but I definitely learned some things. And man did this book make me hungry. It also made me want to go back to my baking projects like working through The Bread Baker's Apprentice: Mastering the Art of Extraordinary Bread and rejoining the Baking with Julia: Sift, Knead, Flute, Flour, And Savor... bake-along group. I do miss that intentional, multiple versions of a recipe until you get it right, process. I used to learn so much during that time.I was surprised that Michael Pollan wasn't more of a cook to start out with, considering that he tends to write almost entirely about food. At the same time, he was working with absolute experts on barbecue, bread baking, and fermentation (the pot-on-the-stove section was a bit of a stretch). He brings in information about anthropology, ethics, and public health. There is something for everyone.Despite my complaints of not being able to skim, I enjoyed the author's reading of his own work. He has a pleasant and interested voice, and this is clearly a subject that he is still interested in now, even after spending all this time on it. This will be a nice addition to our university library, because we have a wide spectrum of courses that touch on food. This will fit nicely within those ranges."
22,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7754291-peggy-bird,4,"Rarely does a book make me look at the world, my life or myself in a different way. This book, as several others by this author, does just that.In ""Cooked"" Pollen posits the theory that cooking not only allowed ancient humans to enlarge their diet as they changed from a hunter/gatherer society but to change the very humans themselves. By cooking, one way or the other, those ancestors managed to do part of the work of digestion outside their body so they, like our relatives the apes/monkeys don't have to spend hours every day chewing to get the nutrients they needed from their food.The way he attacks the issue is to divide cooking into fire, water, air and earth. To illustrate each one, he finds an expert to teach him about the way those elements work. He learns to barbecue, braise, bake and brew and relates the usually self-mocking ways he does it wrong before he learns to do it right.Along the way, he gives the reader a grounding in how each method of cooking has changed and what we have both lost and gained by the change. It's not a quick read but is surely is a good one. "
23,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9039058-darren,4,"Talk about hitting the nail squarely on the head, the publicity material for this thought-provoking book gets it right and sets the tone - more and more are we reading about/watching about food and cookery, it is easier and easier to get ingredients from anywhere in the world yet as a society we eat more and more processed foods and actually cook less. Reheating is not cooking.The author considers the paradox that society seems to be preferring to think about and consume the art of cooking instead of undertaking the exact-same exercise. At the same time ""we"" tend to increasingly worry about the origin of ingredients, welfare of animals in our food chain and obsess about our health and diet, whilst shovelling down more and more processed foods. The author's solution is easier said than done: get cooking. This hardback book with an impenetrable academic-sounding title lets you sit on the author's shoulder, looking on as he rediscovers the art and love of cooking by getting out and about, cooking with and using the basic elements of fire, water, air and the earth. Recipes not included.This is not a book that glorifies the celebrity chef world, it doesn't sit and lecture on the evils of factory-produced meals whilst talking up the world of small-scale artisan production. Instead it is a more back to basic, good and honest appreciation, drawing inspiration from many sources and possibly acting as a voyage of rediscovery along the way. It is not going to be a light read, despite it being written in a biography or diary style. It is text, text and more text. No action images of the author doing his stuff, no mouth-watering images, no scenic shots. For a first person book it is surprisingly ego-free too.If you are prepared to put the time in with this book you will probably come away a more inspired, interested and possibly active cook. The book effectively demands participation without being so uncouth as to actually demand it. Inspires would be an insipid word. It just ""does"" but short of seeing the book for yourself, sharing in the belief and participating in the process you might not fully appreciate the possible enormity of the changes that may follow. Of course, you might still prefer to sit on the couch, watch a ""cooking show"", consume the culinary dream and convince yourself that you are part of the cooking craze or culture, before eating your supermarket-produced ready meal.This book might be one of those lightbulb moments for you that can generate some life-changing moments. Or it might be something you consider is a waste of your money and abandon it in haste. There is probably no middle-ground and quite rightly so.Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation, written by Michael Pollan and published by Allen Lane. ISBN 9781846147500, 468 pages.

I would have laughed.Today, yawning- from tiredness not boredom, I put down ""Cooked"", a book so packed with entertaining information my brain felt like Creosote's stomach in the Monty Python sketch: Maitre D: Oh sir... it's only *wafer* thin.Mr Creosote: Look - I couldn't eat another thing. I'm absolutely stuffed. Bugger off.Maitre D: Oh sir, just... just *one*...Mr Creosote: Oh all right. Just one.EXPLODES!!!There is so much in this book it's a little hard to digest in one sitting (I was a pig). Thankfully it's thoroughly spiced with comic wit and sharp observations. I'll never forget the discussions with the nun about the erotic implications of disgust and cheese. Pollan obviously has a political agenda, but I never felt that I was being preached to. His personal anecdotes and gentle criticism of the more loony opinions of those he interviewed were warm and sympathetic and got me onside.The structure of this book is a bit contrived- It's more like having the Stephen Fry of food over as a dinner guest - the conversation flies all over the place - History, Culture, Homer, Organic Chemistry, Evolutionary Biology, Politics, Ethics, God, Drugs, Slavery.... you really never know where he's going to take you next and that's part of the joy of it. After a while he even pokes fun at the books conceit of being organised into Fire, Water, Air and Earth (The drunken beer chapter characters point out beer uses all 4).In the introduction he does apologize for perpetuating some stereotypes - and if he hadn't pointed this out I probably would have been a bit more critical of the western bias in this book... but it is what it is, and it certainly rambles over a lot of topics and gets its point across.One on the best non fictions I've read in a while - and a lot to think about."

He learns the art of cooking with fire from a North Carolina pit master, and of water from a Chez Panisse–trained cook who teaches him how to braise. He learns how air transforms flour and water to make bread, and how brewers, cheesemakers, and picklers harness the power of fungi and bacteria to ferment foods. In the process of chronicling his culinary education, Pollan furthers his case for why preparing food by traditional methods is key to improving the American food system."

That book casually tossed upon my table the relationship humans have with plants, and reciprocally the relationship they seem to have developed with us. It sounded vaguely alien-esque, so I went off into the void of two of my favorite reading genres: food and sci-fi. It was followed by a succession of other Pollan books through the years, each with the promise of keeping my foodie mind burbling with anticipation.When “Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation” first arrived on the shelves, I instantly bought it with intention to consume it over a few long weekends. As it so often happens, life got in the way and the hardcover with its tempting penne immersion image languished on my bed stand.Then a month or so ago my employer, The Michigan Land Use Institute, started a new initiative, “The Bob Russell Resilience Reading Project.” The project honors the memory of a community luminary and his gift to us of a carefully curated reading list he believed could help change the world. “Cooked” is the first book selected for the project.If you’ve read Pollan’s other books, this one arrives a bit off-camber. It’s not the same rip-out-the-heart, traditional food system skewering we’re used to. “Cooked” starts with a frank admission from Pollan: “Cooking has always been a part of my life, but more like the furniture than an object of scrutiny, much less a passion.” What he’s saying is that he’s made a career out of talking about food without ever understanding its true relationship personally.“Cooked” is a nationwide gustatory road-trip mapped out to right that wrong. While it lacks the ferocity of an Anthony Bourdain treatise, it has a similar effect in that it asks us to question the obvious while leaving us hungering for the forbidden fruit of our guilty pleasures.The book is organized around the four classical elements, fire, water, air, and earth. In its simplest form, “Cooked” uses each element as a classroom opportunity for Pollan to learn one classic—otherwise mundane—recipe at a time. To examine fire, he seeks out a southern barbecue master. Diving into water, he teams up with a former Chez Panisse chef. For air, he ventures into the ancient art of bread baking. And finally for earth, he seizes upon that mysterious organic process we call fermentation. These all reinforce the subtitle of the book, “A Natural History of Transformation.” “Cooked” seems more the work of a cultural anthropologist than that of the food systems activist we’ve known.FIRE:Greeks and Egyptians, Persians, and even medieval alchemists all had some interpretation of the four elements. Michael Pollan leads with fire and approaches it quite literally. We go with him as he gets in his car and drives to a little town in North Carolina known for its barbecue cookery. This unproven Yankee dons his neophyte hat and wades into a backwoods barbecue pit overseen by a 30-something man with barbecue in his blood named Samuel Jones.The section shows in detail the lessons Pollan will need to learn to understand this succulent American right of passage known as barbecue. It starts with a treatise on how our very species invented fire, and then cooking with it as a way to do nothing less than preserve and advance our DNA. Before the section ends, we find some iconic Pollan, regaling us with Freudian references: “Cooking with fire remains very much a competitive male preserve, and those of us who do it should probably count ourselves lucky Freud isn’t around to offer his analysis of exactly what it is we’re up to.”Pollan doesn’t leave classical Greek interpretations of fire alone either. He devotes pages to tales of Zeus and Prometheus and plots of revenge and retribution for betrayals of gods and mortals. “The Prometheus story becomes a myth of the origin of cooking, an account of how animal sacrifice evolved into a form of feasting, thanks to Prometheus’ daring reapportionment of the sacrificial animal to favor man.”The emphatic call to arms of fire is that it was born to cook meat.WATER:This second section starts with a chef’s most basic of tasks, chopping “veg” for a mirepoix. Pollan’s stop at this juncture is illustrative of the book’s mission. He realizes he’s been part of the problem, which thus far he’s been unwilling to admit in his other books. Recognizing that playing an active role in the preparation and “transformation” of food is the mea culpa that drives the narrative.“Today the typical American spends a mere twenty-seven minutes a day on food preparation, and another four minutes cleaning up. That’s less than half the time spent cooking and cleaning up in 1965, when I was a boy. Somewhat more than half of the evening meals an American eats today are still “cooked at home,” according to the market researchers.” Still, he’s far from taking it all on the chin himself:“The very same activity that many people regard as a form of drudgery has somehow been elevated to a popular spectator sport. When you consider that twenty-seven minutes is less time than it takes to watch a single episode of Top Chef or The New Food Network Star, you realize that there are now millions of people who spend more time watching food being cooked on television than they spend actually cooking it themselves.”Pollan’s work on water examines its important role in the transformation process. Extracting flavors and separating, then reconstituting, chemical compounds in food is critical to our expectations of taste. For this lesson he employs an upwardly reaching chef, Samin Nosrat, formerly of Chez Panisse fame. Pollan spent Sundays with Samin to learn the intricacies of the pot. The subtle combinations of flavors—this vegetable with that—or the order in which we add them to a soup or a braise provide telltale signals to our brain about a food’s cultural origins.The power of the chop (we’re talking veggies here) combines with water (or oil or other liquids) to create a myriad of flavors, all of which require tending. Pollan refers to this “drudgery” as the “antithesis” of what fire requires. “Indeed,” he continues, “The only time the grill man or pit master deploys a knife is at the very end of his show.”Water it seems was designed for the pot, and in the pot we find veg.AIR:This chapter focuses on part of a cooking tradition that is akin to religion. In fact some of the greatest books on bread-baking are still published by Jesuit brothers and priests. Pollan joins the ranks of millions of us in search of salvation from that perfect loaf because, he intimates, we’re either meant to be bakers, or we’re not.“I had baked one or two loaves years before with only middling results, and had concluded baking was probably not for me.” This conclusion is one I’ve heard espoused by many of my own friends. Even my wife, an otherwise accomplished cook, claims she’s had far too many catastrophes to make any further attempts at baking. So here’s something of his work that certainly speaks to all of us. One way to think about bread, he suggests, “is simply this: as an ingenious technology for improving the flavor, digestibility, and nutritional value of grass.” Pollan peeks behind the curtain of naturally fermented breads, too. He talks about the mysteries and vagaries of rising dough, of the care and feeding of a sourdough starter, and the downright bizarre rituals discussed by authors and bloggers about how wild yeasts and strains of bacteria find their way into mason jars hidden in the dark recesses of San Francisco apartments. Then Pollan incriminates himself as just another foodie-mortal powerless to the seductions of bread with this mouth-watering description of the finished product.“The best bread I ever tasted was a big country loaf shot through with holes the size of marbles and golf balls—easily more air than bread. It had a tough hide of a crust very nearly burned, but held inside a crumb so tender, moist, and glossy it made you think of custard. There was something sensual about the strong contrast between these two realms—outside and inside, hard and soft. The bread was so powerfully aromatic that, had I been alone, I would have been tempted to push my face into it.”Air explains to us the importance of the places in between, and the role we have as humans to manipulate that space to our own ends.EARTH:Michael Pollan doesn’t let this sensual loaf seduce him to distraction. He also looks towards other aspects of fermentation in the food system, reminding us that before refrigeration, canning, and chemicals, fermentation was the primary form of preserving food over long periods of time. He talks of Korean kimchi buried in the backyard, Russian kefir, yogurt, and of breadfruit aging in Fiji pits to eventual odiferous perfection as something resembling the scent of road kill after a week in the sun.Finally he covers something dear to many of my friends: the role of fermentation in making alcohol, and specifically beer. This, as it turns out, is another specialty of the religious. If you’ve ever had Belgian ale, you can thank a monk.Speaking of fermenting cultures he says, “It not only seems alive, it is alive. And most of this living takes place at a scale inaccessible to us without a microscope.” Earth is really about stuff that lives and breathes and changes food from one form into another. As humans we are sometimes the instigators, but mainly bystanders in a process that closely mimics the very way life is thought to have emerged from that primordial ooze.“Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation” is an eye-opening read, but it pries your lids up in a very different way than his previous books. Gone are the diatribes and stabs at American corporate agriculture that many of us grew to appreciate from him. That edge is replaced with a new foundation of self-discovery, one akin to the sense of wonder served up by children. It begs you to turn the page, grab some ingredients, and push upon the edges of your own food comfort zone.Michael Pollan is the author of seven books including: The Botany of Desire, In Defense of Food, An Omnivore’s Dilemma, A Place of My Own, Second Nature, Food Rules, and Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation. All these books are available at our local books stores throughout northwest Lower Michigan."
28,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5399361-kam,5,"Late last year I, along with my mother and father, took a blood test to check for any health issues that might have cropped up over the previous year, as well as to check up on pre-existing conditions. The latter was mostly for my parents, but it was also important that I get my blood tested to make sure I hadn't developed any conditions of my own. My tests from the year before last, when my mother started encouraging us to do this, had come back clean, and I was fully expecting these tests to come in clean, too.That was not the case. My sodium levels might have been within normal tolerances, and my sugar was a little high for comfort, but my cholesterol gave me great cause for alarm - my doctor told me that I had the cholesterol level of someone twice my age. I was given two choices: either start medication, or adjust my diet. I took the diet option without even thinking twice.Now, the word ""diet"" tends to imply that one is about to starve oneself in order to lose weight, but to my mind, that's not what ""diet"" means - and I think my doctor is rather proud that I do not define ""diet"" in that manner, either. ""Diet"" has, to me, never meant that I ought to go hungry, but simply that I alter what I consume to silence that hunger. So: less junk food, less soda (very much less soda, now), and far, far less fast food. All of these were easy decisions to make, especially when I started packing lunches instead of buying them - which, of course, meant home cooking.And it is home cooking - or cooking from scratch - that is the central focus of Michael Pollan's latest book, Cooked. Divided into four sections named after the four classical elements - Fire, Water, Air, and Earth - Pollan talks about his journey of learning how to cook, apprenticing himself to a Southern barbeque pit master; a Chez Panisse-trained former-student-turned-personal-cooking-instructor; a baker; and a cheese-maker, and learning from each of them various methods and traditions of cooking, while at the same time contemplating on where these methods fit in our lives, how they affect us, and what losing or continuing them might mean for humanity as a whole. The result is a fascinating sequence of anecdotes, interspersed with a great deal of science, history, and philosophy, all told in Pollan's eminently readable narrative style. Those who have read The Omnivore's Dilemma will, in all likelihood, be comparing it to Cooked, and will find a great many similarities between them - perhaps too many for some. The Introduction, in particular, will read very,very similar to the content of The Omnivore's Dilemma, and some readers have taken a set against Cooked for this similarity. I, for my part, do not take this against Pollan at all, since I've come to view Cooked as a natural extension of The Omnivore's Dilemma: an expansion, so to speak, of the ideas and philosophies Pollan expounded upon. In Omnivore's Dilemma he concludes that cooking one's own food, as well as taking great care to source ingredients from responsible growers and animal raisers, is one of the keys to a better life, and is in many ways the key to a healthier one. Cooked demonstrates, far beyond the four meals Pollan describes in The Omnivore's Dilemma, how to go about doing just that, as well as showing what humanity lost when it handed control of food production to corporations.As expected, it is in his anecdotes that Pollan truly shines. In the course of his various apprenticeships he explains a whole host of other aspects related to the type of cooking he is doing. For example in the section titled ""Fire"" he discusses the concept of barbecue from the perspective of Southern whole-hog barbecue, interweaving various bits of research and musings on the cooking style's politics (class, race and gender being some of the more interesting angles from which one may approach the concept of barbecue as a whole, and not just whole-hog) and history, all the while telling the story of his brief apprenticeship to pit master Ed Mitchell, and then his own subsequent attempt at doing whole-hog barbecue. He repeats this in his discussion of braising, baking, cheese-making, and beer-brewing, always ensuring to tackle the social, political, historical, and gender-related aspects of each method of cooking. What I found especially fun to read, mostly because it's related to my own interests, was the section on baking. I can do stovetop cooking, but I have something of a fear of spattering oil, so I don't do much of it if I can. Baking however - that is an entirely different story. There is something comforting and magical about combining a set of raw ingredients, putting it in an oven, and more or less leaving it there until the nose (and occasionally the eye, but more the nose) judges it the right time to pull out whatever has been cooking - and while waiting, nothing is more pleasurable than to catch up on my reading. Every year around December I bake chocolate-chip cookies as Christmas gifts for family members, and it is easy to read a chapter or two before smelling that delicious, mouthwatering scent of chocolate, butter, and vanilla and pausing a while to pull out the cooked batch to put in a new one, before settling down to read another chapter.Pollan, however, goes much further than simply making cookies - he bakes what I (and many other bakers) consider to be the ultimate baking accomplishment: bread. Though I come from a country and culture whose staple grain is rice, bread is still an important food item in the Philippines, and we do still eat quite a bit of it (mostly for breakfast and merienda - the Filipino equivalent of afternoon tea), so the idea of baking my own bread is incredibly appealing. Therefore, reading about Pollan's attempt to culture his own sourdough starter, and his discourse on bread of the past, present, and perhaps of the future, made for thoroughly enjoyable reading. And here is what I think is the most enjoyable aspect of this book, aside from Pollan's anecdotes and narrative style: the fact that all of this encourages the reader to try their hand at cooking for himself or herself. Pollan even includes the recipes in the book's appendix, though by the time the reader gets to them she or he is aware that a recipe is not a hard-and-fast rule when it comes to cooking - something Pollan learns throughout the course of the book. As I mentioned earlier, The Omnivore's Dilemma makes the case for home-cooking, but Cooked shows the reader how one may make that case - and cause - one's own. Pollan makes it clear that it is not going to be easy, that there will be many mistakes along the way, but they do give the reader hope that perhaps it is not as daunting as one assumes it to be (something Pollan specifically tackles in ""Water,"" the section dealing with the slow-braising of food). To be sure, Pollan has the advantage of access to some of the best people in their field, but he makes it clear that just because he has access to the experts does make him as good as they at their own specialty. That takes time and practice - and it is something Pollan himself recognizes, and encourages the reader to have in any future cooking endeavors.Overall, Cooked is, at its core, no different thematically from The Omnivore's Dilemma, but it should not be viewed as a rehash of that book - rather, one should approach it as an extension of what Pollan was trying to do in The Omnivore's Dilemma: that it is better to cook one's own food. The Omnivore's Dilemma explains the greater cultural and health-related reasons for home-cooking; Cooked emphasizes that but also adds a far more personal dimension. It will not be easy at first - Pollan's stories about his apprenticeships make this clear - but if one keeps at it, one is sure to reap the benefits of that time and patience, not only in better health or a clearer statement about (or against) the world, but also something that will bring great personal satisfaction - something to do, first and foremost, for oneself.

29,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78792-cat,4,"I enjoyed this book *so much*. Yes, it's grandiose (divided into the four primal elements--fire, water, air, earth) and sometimes simplistic (if you cook your own food, you are opting out of our corporate-consumerist culture? really? more on this later), but it's so much fun! First of all, it's fun to read about the experience of cooking, and Pollan is winningly self-deprecating and evocatively descriptive. Second of all, the fire, water, air, earth division really works in drawing attention to the psychological and cultural resonances of different types of cooking...this is especially powerful when Pollan talks about the perversity and morbidity of fermentation. Thirdly, Pollan is an incredibly articulate nerd, weaving together theories and facts from anthropology, anatomy, biology, psychology, literature, etc., into a compelling tapestry about how we make food and why these processes matter to us (symbolically as well as biologically). The section about fermentation, pickling, and microbiota is totally fascinating. I kept quoting factoids from this book to anyone who would listen, and I am eager to try out making my own sourdough starter from wild yeasts (perhaps a dangerous project in a household with a toddler and four cats in it, but ah, well...). If you'll forgive the inevitable gustatory metaphor, I gobbled this book up. So. Tasty.That being said, Pollan's claim (articulated at various points fairly directly in the text) that any of these leisure-time activities (undertaken here by a wealthy and successful freelance nonfiction writer living in the Bay Area) could be potent forms of rebellion against the industrial complex that creates so much of our food and uses marketing to instill a feeling of helplessness in the consumer...that seems problematic to me at best and willfully delusional at the worst. Yes, I personally consider it important in my household that I cook every day. Yes, we also use plenty of prepared food products, and I have absolutely no illusions that we are living off the grid. Because it's a familial and cultural tradition, because it's fun and tasty, because it will instill in my daughter (we hope!) a love of fruits and vegetables and grains that you can't get from processed cheddar bunnies (also a big hit with her), we embrace these food preparation rituals in our home. And I sometimes become obsessed with the idea of making something from scratch and making it correctly (like the semester when I baked bread almost every day). In other words, ""Michael Pollan--c'est moi!""But to imagine that to prepare food from ""scratch"" in your own home (with the help of professional chefs in Pollan's case!) is to opt out of a consumer system...is to mystify the consumer system you are participating in. Pollan is just pursuing his own consumer form of distinction. The recipe for authenticity here is investing time and money in training and ingredients, and time and money are in short supply for many segments of the population. Pollan never really addresses the political and economic trouble that other people don't have this much time...he just points out that people should think about cooking instead of watching TV, thus implicitly stigmatizing other social classes and groups for their priorities (and for their exhaustion as well!). Pollan is buying ingredients and preparing them with the rarefied knowledge to which his education, social class, professional status, etc., grant him access. This is not escaping a consumer system; it's claiming that you can tailor that system to fit your idealized view of yourself. It's individualism as rebellion, when in fact the corporate-consumer system relies on our sense of ourselves as individuals above all (who can demonstrate that individualism through which commodities we use.)This problem at the heart of Pollan's book made me think of a fellow scholar's current project, tracing the model of neoliberal citizenship through postwar nonfiction genres including the memoir and the New Journalism (I'm looking at you, Daniel Worden!). The Michael Pollan food book would bear out the hypothesis that certain nonfiction genres that fetishize individualism in a seemingly iconoclastic way actually pave the way for the acceptance of contemporary life as an increasingly market-driven arena for self-definition. Pollan's emphasis that the market's products should be better and more ethical (see his apt critique of commodity pork) is not a particularly radical departure from this agenda. Even as this book embraces a kind of bougie food authenticity that may indeed be just another consumer status symbol, Pollan celebrates the messy immersion in artistic/artisan production and the intimate connections with other people that can come through cooking. So even as neoliberal citizenship prizes the illusion of individualism in the global marketplace, there also is room within this consumerist culture to make meaning. And I don't doubt Pollan's sincerity on that at all.Pollan also makes the good point that enacting these processes of making our own food *does* undo (albeit temporarily) the alienation from the products of our labor endemic to capitalism (as Marx observed so many years ago). It demystifies processes that have become specialized, even arcane. I realized how much I accept the final product without understanding what gets us there (dude, I had *no idea* how cheese was made, and I'm not feeling so good about the definition of ""rennet""). Pollan does a wonderful job telling the story of those transformations, and it is for this story-telling that I most prize his work."
30,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50262924-dr-tobias-christian-fischer,4,"Cooking stands for healthy, natural and energy-efficient food intake. Our ancestors started cooking at some point because the addition of heat allowed them to get a lot more nutrients from a lot more natural foods. Unfortunately, we have moved further and further away from it since the global boom in convenience foods. The following still applies today: Those who cook at home with natural ingredients are by far the healthiest (Blinkist, 2020)."
31,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53971695-stijn-zanders,5,"A book that inspires, Pollan writes the book around the idea that cooking is much more than just preparing food. He does this by diving into the four elements: fire, water, air and earth. Especially the last two parts that go into the baking of sour dough bread and fermentation are invaluable!"
32,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,4,"""In Cooked, Michael Pollan explores the previously uncharted territory of his own kitchen. Here, he discovers the enduring power of the four classical elements—fire, water, air, and earth—to transform the stuff of nature into delicious things to eat and drink. Apprenticing himself to a succession of culinary masters, Pollan learns how to grill with fire, cook with liquid, bake bread, and ferment everything from cheese to beer.The effects of not cooking are similarly far reaching. Relying upon corporations to process our food means we consume large quantities of fat, sugar, and salt; disrupt an essential link to the natural world; and weaken our relationships with family and friends. In fact, Cooked argues, taking back control of cooking may be the single most important step anyone can take to help make the American food system healthier and more sustainable. Reclaiming cooking as an act of enjoyment and self-reliance, learning to perform the magic of these everyday transformations, opens the door to a more nourishing life.""I have to say that I appreciate an author who tells me that I am being subversive or rebellious if I cook. It’s one of the few forms of rebelliousness to which I wholeheartedly subscribe. Having read Salt Sugar Fat by Michael Moss last year, I been working diligently at eliminating processed foods from my diet—easier said than done! Especially when one is also attempting to go gluten-free. I have many happy memories of cooking on the farm where I grew up. We knew the cows that provided our milk, the chickens that laid our eggs and the cattle and pigs that provided each evening’s main course. Sometimes Mom would even mention them by name as she served up supper. I have been in quest of a real pork chop for some time now and think I have found a butcher shop that provides a product very, very close to my idealized memories. One of the things which struck me when I moved to the city was the lack of taste in the meat and vegetables purchased from the chain grocery stores. Carrots from a chain store are more like wood than like vegetables and tomatoes are hard and tasteless compared to those we grew in our garden (fertilized with well-aged, long composted animal manure).  The problem, for me at least, is one of time. I love to cook and bake—but I also work full time and enjoy a busy social life. Having read Cooked, I can see that I will start attempting to schedule more cooking time into my life—in the past, I have whiled away many happy hours stirring soup pots, checking on oven contents and poking at dough. It’s time to return that gentle form of rebellion to my life on a regular basis."

I have actually caught myself discussing this book at length with my foodie friends and family.

34,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8986610-chris,3,"This was a good book if you're interested in the anatomy of cooking. Michael Pollan is one of my favorite food writers and I always enjoy his books, this one as well. However, this was a little too in depth for me.Michael explores the four realms of cooking in this book, Fire, Water, Air and Earth. For Fire, he uses whole hog barbeque. For Water, he explores braising. For air, his example is baking bread. For Earth he uses fermentation. Basically, he breaks all of these cooking methods down to the smallest elements and builds on it.My final thought on this book is that it was interesting, but if your not really into cooking/food then this book may be too much for you."
35,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1063843-sarah-hauck,4,"In his latest book, Cooked, Michael Pollan serves up another bestseller that looks at the relationships between us and the food we eat. Struck by the realization that “the less cooking we were doing in our own lives, the more that food and its vicarious preparation transfixed us,” Pollan sets out to explore the art of cooking for himself.Cooked reads like a how-to book for the uninitiated in the kitchen while still providing plenty of more detailed analysis for seasoned cooks. Divided into chapters based on the four classical elements – Earth, Water, Air and Fire – Pollan personally explores the world of cooking where “the stuff of nature gets transformed into the things we eat and drink.”In each chapter, Pollan learns about a corresponding cooking style: in Fire, he gets grilling lessons from a North Carolina barbecue pit master; in Water, he masters braises; in Air, he experiments with bread baking as he seeks to perfect the perfect sourdough loaf; and finally, in Earth, he explores various types of fermentation including pickling, cheese making and home brewing.Along the way, each of his teachers – from “the cheese nun” with a Ph.D. in microbiology to the “most famous fermentor in America” – is whole-heartedly devoted to his or her craft and, in the end, getting a glimpse into their lives and work is half the fun of the book.I’ve been a Michael Pollan fan since I first cracked the spine of The Botany of Desire more than a decade ago, but even I’ll admit, there are a few points in the narrative where even the most devout reader’s eyes may start to glaze over… like when Pollan gets mired in the details of the “all-important Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis” microbe. But only briefly. Because along with straight-up cool science, he also mixes into his narrative a bit of history, art and literature along with a dash of religion (“bread… is an everyday proof of the possibility of transcendence” and sex for good measure (“a cheese that stinks – of manure, of sex – offers a relatively safe way for us to flirt with forbidden desires”).As in his previous books, Pollan extolls the ills (literally) of processed foods and cautions against our over-reliance on corporations, “whose ‘dead food’ is damaging our health and ‘homogenizing’ our experience.”When asked why we don’t spend more time preparing our own meals, apparently most people claim a lack of time. But Pollan points out that, “in the last decade or so, we’ve all found two hours a day to be on line outside of work.” So what gives?Another entire book could be devoted to answering that question, but Pollan doesn’t take on that job in Cooked. Instead, he argues that we would all do well to start getting reacquainted with our kitchens because “cooking is one of the most interesting and worthwhile things we humans do.”While it may be cheaper and easier to rely on others to provide for our basic needs, “to live that way comes at a price, not least to our sense of competence and independence.” We are so disconnected from the makers of our food, Pollan argues, that we stop thinking about what is actually in the food we eat or where it comes from, much less the labor, money or energy it took to get it onto our plate. Worst of all, we forget that “what presents itself to us in the marketplace as a product is in truth a web of relationships between people… and all the other species on which we still depend.” (Yes, even bacteria.)In the end, Cooked turns out to be a commentary on the way we live. It’s true, as in his past books, that Pollan is critical of capitalism, and in particular consumerism, as the downfall of democracy and independence in its most literal sense. The antidote (or part of it, anyway) that he offers up here is cooking. To cook, he says, is to reclaim a bit of independence, and perhaps a bit of pride as well. It’s what separates us from the rest of the natural world and, paradoxically, also what keeps us connected to it.It is also an invitation to modern society (that’s you and me) to reconnect with the world. It’s true that few of us have the luxury of spending hours in the kitchen making all of our meals from scratch, but even small culinary contributions help us to reconnect with the natural world around us. As Pollan himself admits, “The most important thing I learned … is how cooking implicates us in a whole web of social and ecological relationships: with plants and animals, with the soil, with farmers, with the microbes both inside and outside our bodies, and, of course, with the people our cooking nourishes and delights.” And he invites us “to alter, however slightly, the ratio between production and consumption” in our lives.This, he believes, can make a difference. After trying his hand at home brewing, Pollan says, “The beer in that bottle, I’m reminded as soon as I brew it myself, ultimately comes not from a factory, but from nature – from a field of barley snapping in the wind, from a hops vine clambering over a trellis, from a host of invisible microbes feasting on sugars.”So, if preparing our own home-cooked meals makes us think just a little bit more about the world around us and how, ultimately, we all depend on one another to survive, then certainly a little time with a knife and cutting board won’t hurt anyone.For novices in the kitchen – or first-time Pollan readers – Cooked is sure to whet your appetite. For the rest of us, it is the continuation of an ongoing commentary on food, nature and modern society that will not fail to satisfy."
36,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10987540-ben,3,"It's difficult to rate a book which was very enjoyable to read, but fraught with quirks of Pollan's writing style and ideology. I'll write this review as a ""compliment sandwich."" To begin: The chapters on Barbeque (Fire) and Bread (Air) were particularly strong and interesting. I enjoyed the attention he gave to food research at UC Davis, and was glad to see him visit some interesting operations in Yolo County.That being said...Pollan went on several rants only tenuously connected to his topics. Notably, his nostalgia for an agrarian/culinary past that, to use the phrase of Jello Biafra ""never existed."" Pollan seems oblivious to his own level of wealth and privelege. He emphasizes that he braises ""cheap"" pieces of meat. Has he compared the price of a brisket to chicken? bologna? a can of beans? He spends days at a time on breads, insisting that he can ""get writing done"" in between turns and rises. Not everyone is a freelance writer, buddy. Try making a braise and two sourdoughs a week working 9-5.My final criticism is his love of ""artisans"" while scoffing at anything remotely automated. The problem is that for artisans (of food and everything else) it's a labor of love. An independent baker selling high-end sourdough might be carrying on a food tradition or whatever, but the forklift operator, truck driver, QC specialist, etc. at the Wonder-bread plant he's so quick to dismiss have mentally and physically demanding jobs, with some security, benefits, and disposable income that the starving artist-baker lacks. Does Pollan really envision a bucolic future of nothing but cottage industries? Who would have the income to buy his books?The joke's on him, I took it out of the library.In conclusion- Pollan is an entertaining and gripping writer who has sought out some very interesting characters in the American foodscape. Parts of this book rehash ""Omnivore's Dilema,"" but hey. What can you do? If this were a bad book, I wouldn't have finished it. It's honestly good writing, somewhat choppy, and somewhat obsessive about certain details (raising dough) while ignoring others (Pollan's wealth, and location in the foodie Island of the Bay Area.)"
37,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/867628-catherine,3,"Where has our love gone, Michael? This is the fourth of your books that I've read, which is somewhat fitting, considering your obsession with that number. Second Nature: four seasons, Omnivore's Dilemma: four meals, Botany of Desire: four plants, and with this book four methods of food preparation. I was really excited about a new book from you, as I really enjoyed those three earlier books, despite your tendency to ramble and repeat. When an acquaintance told me how much she enjoyed this book (her first experience with you), I quickly recommended the others and offered to swap her OD for this one. And yet...somehow I just can't get into it. Maybe it's that you're again preaching your slow food message and I've already joined the choir. Maybe it's the current heat wave that makes the subject of cooking less appealing. Maybe it's my stack of novels and lighter non-fiction driving me to distraction. Whatever the cause(s), I'm going to return this copy to the owner (since I've had it for three or four weeks already) and track down a library copy later when cooking and, let's be honest...you, Michael, sound more appealing.Update: it took me almost 7 years, but I finally finished this book! This time, I started with the section on yeast breads, focusing on sourdough. I've experimented with sourdough a couple times since reading Sourdough (and started a new one after finishing the book), so I had more connection to Pollan's experiences than the previous sections. The final section, in which he discusses fermentation (of vegetables, cheese, and alcohol) was also really interesting, especially the American-born nun making traditional cheese in a French convent. For me, the second half of the book was much stronger. "
38,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793094-lisa,5,"Michael Pollan has written another book about food; this time he researches the history of cooking. He focuses on cooking using the classic elements of fire, water, air, and earth.The section on fire focuses almost exclusively on smoking pork, which is something I enjoy doing. For those of you that have never enjoyed barbeque or smoking, you might not connect with this section like I did. Smoked pork (and chicken) is so good, it is worth the effort to try to perfect your efforts! Take a look at my video on smoking Boston Butts: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U2--A...I have videos on smoking chicken, salmon filets, and ribs; smoked food is so good and it is fun to connect with nature to prepare food!In the section on cooking with water, Pollan uses a pot to slow cook various delicious dishes. He talked about the time and effort to cook slowly on the stovetop. I had to wonder why he didn't even try using a crockpot or slow cooker! Nonetheless, all of the food sounded really good!The section on air focused on making bread and I almost wanted to make a loaf myself, but then I remembered how addictive bread out of the oven tastes! It was very interesting!Lastly, Pollan focused on ""earth"" as an element of cooking. Any guess what that could be? I never would have guessed, but it is fermentation. This was my least favorite section because I don't drink, but it was interesting to listen to how Pollan made his own beer. There are many health benefits to eating foods like yogurt that use something like fermentation to grow the cultures. While I eat yogurt every day, I am too much of a wimp to eat the other foods Pollan highlighted.Of course, Pollan could not resist discussing how many people no longer cook--or they heat prepared food and call that cooking. I found all of that fascinating because I do not buy many prepared foods; however, I buy more than I thought!I listened to this audiobook while gardening and loved it! "
39,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,4,"“I found that, much like gardening, most cooking manages to be agreeably absorbing without being too demanding intellectually. It leaves plenty of mental space for daydreaming and reflection.” ― Michael Pollan, Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation In Cooked Michael Pollan stays close to his food roots. Similar in theme to: Omnivore's Dilema (Four Meals), In Defense of Food (Food Manifesto), Botany of Desire (Four Plants), Food Rules (Owner's Manual for Food), and Second Nature (Growing Food).Cooked is just another branch on the Phylogenetic food tree for the Pollan's Omnivore, me thinks. Unless, of course, Pollan is going to delve into the proper way to digest, poop, or compost your waste. And... he might just. I am neither a Pollan lover or hater. I've read a bunch of his stuff because it is fast and rather tasty. The problem with Pollan is reading too much of him. His books are a bit full of roughage and eventually too much of his raw idealism or fiber-rich localism gets to you. I think that is the problem with idealists and their genius (genus?). No one can quite live upto the expectations. There just isn't that many locally grown mushrooms, or farmer's markets, or grass-fed organic beef. But education about farming, feasting, and cooking gives us a better sense of both the idea and the real. As long as we are aware of the costs of the way we eat and the way we cook, we are better than we started. The probelm comes in when we believe ALL the hype. As long as you can remain pragmatic about food and Pollan, reading him is a good thing."

If there ever was a more tedious and odious exercise in navel gazing, I'd be impressed.I must confess I am baffled by this book. Who is the audience? Is it local foodies who are already converted? In which case, why on earth must the author keep telling us again and again and again how awesome cooking is? We get it, we're the choir, quit your preaching.Or perhaps the audience is the mass produced shrink-wrap microwave toting loner. In which case, hearing someone pontificate on and on and on about the joys of combining heat with edible things is also pointlessly preachy, and Mr Pollan does an abysmal sales job here.The problem is that Mr Pollan has completely and totally run out of things to say. As a result, this book is basically reworking the same sentence over and over again using different combinations of words. So to save the hapless potential victim from having to wade through a few hundred pages of tedium, I'd suggest instead spending the next hour rearranging any subset of these words into as many variations as you can:Heavenly, nature, cooking, is, god, primitive man, plants, aroma, animal sacrifice, producesHour over? You're welcome, I just saved you many more hours of your precious time. You can spend the remaining 5-6 you have left over from not reading this book staring blankly into space, it'll be more meaningful and more likely to result in food related insights."

That how to make bolonaise was a revelation to the author was more telling of him than other informational bits. I have a friend whose husband doesn't know how to turn on his oven. That said, I agree 100 percent with the author about the practice of making meals as being healthy and a good practice. I think he is a fine author and I look forward to his next book.

It was an enjoyable way to think about the complexity of a task which we used to do daily, but in which industrial societies have been eschewing."

So, when this book was published, I really looked forward to reading it. I love his ability to take the science and technical aspects of food and nutrition and make them fascinating.I thought that it was quite appropriate that I read this book during a holiday centered around cooking and eating: Thanksgiving. I love cooking for our family, and I try hard to share that love with our girls, teaching them the simple concepts that I know and showing them how easy it is for a parent who works out of the home to prepare a home-cooked meal using little to no prepared foods. This book really shows the genesis of human cooking and the emotional and primal urges behind what and how we cook. In four different parts (fire, water, air, and earth), he describes different ways we engage with food. I'm not sure what happened - I read the first three parts in the span of just one day, but then I was overwhelmed with other books that I needed to read (for my book club or because they were coming due), and this book was pushed to the side for over a month. Finally, I decided I needed to finish it (I'm sure it's coming due soon!) and I tackled the fourth part in one day. So, while it looks like I took my sweet time, I just had a big break in between.interesting quotes:""Once cooking allowed us to expand our cognitive capacity at the expense of our digestive capacity, there was no going back: Our big brains and tiny guts now depended on a diet of cooked food.""

45,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67444659-katie-hamilton,4,"""...cheese was not so much an invention as a discovery."" Yet another masterpiece by Pollan, Cooked is an anthropological, sociological, ethnographical, and humorous narrative just as engulfing as his others. Whether you are a professional chef or a lover of food, this book makes you hungry...for more. "
46,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65459284-paul,4,How is Brandon Sanderson considered a better writer by reviews than Michael Pollan?
47,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8561-yune,4,"Pollan has an easy, friendly, and persuasive writing style that managed to draw me away from another book I'd pre-ordered in two formats when Cooked happened to show up on the library hold shelf on the other book's release date.He's best when he's describing his own experiences or describing micro-science to a layman; I found him a little less convincing and slightly on the side of pretentious when he indulged in wide-scale anthropological musings or symbolism along the lines of the four elements he uses to organize this book: fire (barbecue), water (braises), air (bread), and earth (fermented foods, like sauerkraut and beer). I would've been totally fine with section headings with the food name.I was actually surprised to discover that he wasn't already an expert cook; one of his previous books, The Omnivore's Dilemma, had so incisively made the case for eating in a wholesome manner that I'd assumed he had mastered this skill. But this book is the story of his education in various culinary arenas, and as he manages gain tutelage under acclaimed pit masters and bakers, he--and I--became engrossed in his teachers' personal stories and the philosophies that brought them to the mastery of their crafts. (Or the philosophies that developed because of those crafts.)Thus you meet such interesting folks as the ""cheese nun,"" who managed to get the state health inspector to stand down in an otherwise shrill war about raw milk...by a scientific experiment:A nun's habit and a Ph.D. in microbiology--the abbey sent her to the University of Connecticut so that she might better be able to defend her cheese, both from pathogens and from public health authorities--are an unbeatable combination, and, so far at least, the FDA has thought better than to mess with Sister Noëlla, even as the agency has come down hard on many other raw-milk cheese makers.This lovely sly humor is on display several times, often parenthetically, such as when he describes a 300-year-old fermentation pit:The breadfruit in it had been reduced to a sour mush, but it was reported to be ""still in edible condition."" (You first.)It was interesting how each type of training received different treatment in Pollan's words. The whole pig barbecue ended up making me think more about the sweaty insanity of the chopping block afterward, while trying to feed thousands of hungry people; the year of weekly braising lessons felt prosaic, free of any sudden revelations, although Pollan admits to using what he learned here the most frequently afterward. His description of the bread-making process was utterly engrossing to me (a non-baker from a rice-centric culture), from how he coaxed the starter yeast to the shaping of the dough. His satisfaction rose almost palpably off the bread as he broke the crust of his efforts.And although he dips into scientific explanations whenever he sees fit, pointing out the chemical processes behind caramelization or the nutrients that separate whole wheat flour from white, he delves most deeply into the question of human interaction with internal bacteria: the gut microflora that actually does a lot of the work in keeping us healthy, and how hyper-sanitized environments and antibiotics can devastate this balance. Mary Roach also devotes some time to this in Gulp, and I anticipate a popular science book on the subject soon. Pollan himself doesn't subscribe to the ""kombucha will cure AIDS!"" line of ""let the bacteria grow wild and free!"" thinking, but he does make a strong case for eating less sterile food.Note: To his credit, Pollan does acknowledge head-on the gender imbalance that tends to accompany kitchen duties, without letting the discussion devour the book. In general I found him to be cognizant of the larger issues lying behind his personal quest, whether it be food industry lobbying power or cultural values, but touching upon them only gently.Quite a satisfying read, although I think it's best viewed more along memoirish lines than the sort of societal revolution hinted at in The Omnivore's Dilemma. And the ending was more powerful than those of many novels I've read."
48,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1020899-patty,3,"“Cooking is all about connection, I've learned, between us and other species, other times, other cultures (human and microbial both), but, most important, other people. Cooking is one of the more beautiful forms that human generosity takes; that much I sort of knew. But the very best cooking, I discovered, is also a form of intimacy.”This is the third book that I have read by Pollan. He started by writing about gardening and naturally moved on to food and cooking. I started with The Omnivore’s Dilemma and skipped the gardening books. (I really should go back to those – I like reading about gardening even though I don’t like gardening much.) All three of these books about food have been interesting and enlightening.When I did my review for The Omnivore’s Dilemma, I wrote, “For me this is what makes a good read. I get immersed in the book; I learn new things and for at least some of the time I am thinking about the book and author even when I am not reading the book.” That was true for this book as well. I listened to this and since it took more than thirteen hours, it was with me for a long time. I enjoyed thinking through Pollan’s theories about how the four elements reflect the four ways of cooking and meeting several chefs, bakers, cheesmakers and brewers. I will look at cooking a bit differently because of this book."
49,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/619524-jaysi,3,3.5 stars and only because I hold Pollen to a higher standard and liked his other books more. 
50,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/427611-karen-a,5,"This book has made me rethink many aspects of cooking. Especially how I cook. It is divided into 4 parts, fire, water, air, and earth all corresponding to specific methods of cooking. The fire portion was probably my least favorite and has made it even less likely that I will take up roasting a pig. And some of his comments about the pork industry, though brief, have made me pass up the pork section altogether at the grocery store. Enlightening are his observations about how we perceive the time it takes to cook and based on our perception that it is laborious and time consuming we have surrendered our meal preparation duties to large industry, an industry that has neither health nor quality at the core of its interests. And he counters that quick meal preparation is not so quick and the time it took him and his family to defrost and cook frozen meals he could easily have made a braise. Pollan also reveals what goes into a loaf of bread and how the baker’s pursuit of a light loaf full of air has caused a whole wheat industry to subvert the nutrition of the grain. My favorite part of this book however is the fourth and final part – earth which he dedicates to the art of fermenting. The whole concept of food decaying and then being turned into something not only particular to region and culture but actually good for the human gut is very intriguing and he does a great job of exploring what is going on with this process on a micro level. Also included in the portion of the book is cheese making. His works with the nun, Sister Noella, who makes cheese the old fashion way in large oak barrels contrary to FDA regulations and contrary to our own ideas of what will make the safest product to eat. But Sister Noella has done her homework (doctorate in microbiology) and can prove that the oak barrels produce a more stable product than the steel barrels used by the rest of the industry. While I wish Pollan would have put some of the same time and effort into the cheese portion of the book that he did for the pork roasting, he does do just enough where one will want to know more. In fact I think most of the book does and excellent job of whetting the appetite so to speak for a real discussion about our notions of convenience, health, taste, and how we cook. I really hope this fans the small flames for the trend to cook at home. It really is better in every way. "
51,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419307-rachel,2,"I thought I liked Michael Pollan's writing. Have I changed, or has he?This book had some good content, but Pollan's writing really got in the way. It read like the writing of someone who has gotten a little overconfident in the value of their interests and opinions to others, someone who loves their own writing a little too much, someone who was perhaps reluctant to seek the editing help they really needed.My problems with Pollan's writing are:1) He hammers his points home to the extent of sounding pedantic and condescending. Yes, cooking is the thing that separates us humans from animals, I get it. Now you're telling it to me another twenty times in twenty not-different-enough ways?2) Indulgent digression - between this and point #2, the book could have been cut down by about 100 pages into a much stronger, poignant book.3) Overwrought sentences and flimsy connections drawn between food and other things. Do the following excerpts not make you want to kind of throw up a little of the beautiful braise you just ate:""...it is the very allusiveness of cooked food that appeals to us, as indeed that same quality does in poetry or music or art. We gravitate toward complexity and metaphor, it seems, and putting fire to meat, or fermenting fruit and grain, gives us both: more sheer sensory information and, specifically, sensory information that, like metaphor, points away from the here and now. This sensory metaphor--this stands for that--is one of the most important transformations of nature wrought by cooking. And so a piece of crisped pigskin becomes a densely allusive poem of flavors...""""Elation, effervescence, elevation, levity, inspiration: air words all, alveolated with vowels, leavening the dough of everyday life.""Ick. And that's only one of several times he ""cleverly"" uses ""leaven."" We get it, Pollan. It's a bread word and you applied it to stuff that isn't bread.Just so tiresome, but I stuck with it because I liked the idea of the book, and some of the content was good. The discussion of bacterial flora did a good job of addressing a new topic in food and health, for example. But this might be the last Pollan book I read."
52,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,3,"I enjoy cooking and eating, but I don't read Michael Pollan's books – this is at least my third – for the food. If so, I would never have finished this. I am a vegetarian, and the first half of Cooked is about barbecue and braising – the smells of cooking pig flesh! – so not my favorite.I read Pollan's books for his curiosity. They are as much or more about the science of cooking and the philosophy of living. You have to be ready to geek out about everything that you come across. You need to be willing to stop and question all sorts of things: nutrition, chemistry, history, politics, gender.What was the single most important thing we could do as a family to improve our health and general well-being? And what would be a good way to better connect to my teenage son?.... Other questions were slightly more political in nature. For years I had been trying to determine (because I am often asked) what is the most important thing an ordinary person can do to help reform the American food system, to make it healthier and more sustainable? Another related question is, how can people living in a highly specialized consumer economy reduce their sense of dependence and achieve a greater degree of self-sufficiency? And then there were the more philosophical questions, the ones I’ve been chewing on since I first started writing books. How, in our everyday lives, can we acquire a deeper understanding of the natural world and our species’ peculiar role in it? (Kindle 96)Pollan goes straight to the horse's mouth to learn about food and cooking. Then he goes to another expert until he begins to work on his own. And he talks about his errors rather than dodging them. For Pollan, mistakes are an opportunity to learn, to understand. He is willing to throw out standard thinking. (Are antibiotics a good thing or not? What about pasteurization?) And, he takes us along for the ride.This is a lovely ride."
53,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14773738-julie,5,"This is another excellent offering by Michael Pollan who, since The Omnivore's Dilemma has become my favourite go-to person in all things food related. Admittedly, this was slightly less interesting to me than Pollan's Dilemma, but only because I've already experienced all the joys of being Cooked -- pun intended. For all those who have yet to experience the transformative power of being the master/mistress of one's own hearth, this is a must read. Twice.This is not a recipe book -- far from it, albeit Pollan does throw in a few handy recipes at the very end, based on the four elements he explores: fire, water, air and earth; in essence, the touchstone elements of our universe, and our humanity. This is more a book on the nature of cooking: the whys and wherefores of throwing that first chunk of meat over burning coals, and then of maybe tossing in a tuber or two for good measure. With this simple action, we defined our humanity, Pollan postulates, and it is this that made us stand taller than the apes, once and for all.He also dabbles in the mysticism of cooking, the art of alchemical transformation of both the eaten, and the eater. It is a magical read -- and unlike Pollan's Dilemma which left me never wanting to eat (industrial) food ever again, this book left me ravenous. It is an exceptional testament to why we should all engage in the action of feeding ourselves -- quite literally. The action of going to the market and buying packaged and frozen food-like substances is not cooking, and offers absolutely nothing to our nutritional intake, either chemically or spiritually, Pollan offers. Rather, we need to be closer than arm's length from the veggies and the meats we slide down our gullets: we need to understand how much nourishment actually lies in the act of preparation. Full stars."
54,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19059096-jill,4,"Usually I read Michael Pollan to feel distressed (but not awash), and ashamed (but not hopeless). But Cooked is Pollan at his most optimistic. While conscientious as always, he sets out in this book not to acquaint us with the grim facts of our world and its consumers’ decisions; rather, he illustrates the wonders of what we as individuals can do. And what we can do is, obviously: cook. Cook in informed, ambitious ways that link us to the ground, to plants and animals and microbes, to farmers and other producers, and to the people in our lives for whom we cook. This book is part of the antidote to the problems laid out in Omnivore’s Dilemma and In Defense of Food. It's structured “by element,” wherein Pollan discusses cooking with fire (such as in the barbecue pits of North Carolina), water (braises and pot-cooking), air (with bread-masters from all over) and earth (fermentation.) Fair warning: you find yourself fairly deep in the weeds of the chemical processes of the latter two topics – as other reviewers before me have found, these chapters are slower to get through than the first half.Cooked veers toward personal anecdotes, nutrition, chemistry, social history, mythology, and even psychology as necessary. Pollan delivers every discussion with the deftness and humility we expect from him. The writing’s great, the subjects are varied, and the tone is encouraging. Four solid stars."
55,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1706153-meghan,5,"Months after finishing this, I feel obligated to bump it up to 5 stars. The Pollanesqe pedantic tone that starts this book off is the only reason that my initial grade was a 4.5 for me, but even that can be kind of endearing... I very regularly felt like I was reading a book by my dad. However, each chapter drew me into a very dreamy, delighted state of reading. I love the path that weaves through research and literature, mixed with Pollan's interactions with fascinating expert cooks as well as his own cooking adventures. I was surprised, inspired, and impressed constantly. This is one book that I'm very happy to own, because even before I finished it I was tempted to refer back to previous chapters as a reference for some real life situation or another. It prompted me to talk about food with people a lot more, and I definitely feel inspired to branch out of my cooking comfort zone. For anyone why might appreciate some background or perspective on the practice of cooking, this is a fabulous choice.I was reading Ecotopia at the same time, a novel that complemented this one very well. Aaaand up next: Moyasimon: Tales of Agriculture, Volume 2, the world of microbes! ""Everything is everywhere."""
56,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4504899-becki-iverson,5,"As always, Michael Pollan's new book ""Cooked"" is an impeccably researched, beautifully written and hands-on journey through the four foundational methods of cooking. Stylistically, it is essentially a mash-up of the styles of his previous books into a snazzy new package - the four pillars of ""Botany of Desire,"" the hands on creation and eating in ""Omnivore's Dilemma,"" and the modern food science vs. traditional eats breakdown of ""In Defense of Food."" The result is glorious(although at very rare instances almost too brainy). Pollan is a deceptively excellent writer who is capable of making extraordinarily complex concepts and terms accessible to nearly anyone; thus, it is easy to forgive him when he goes a bit awry. I would have liked just a little more description of the work Pollan was doing himself on the cooking; more in depth interviews/apprenticeships, or more recipes. But either way, it's been a while since his last book, and it's good to see Pollan in print again."
57,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1386971-marieke,4,"I really enjoyed this. I have officially abandoned my Michael Pollan hater stance. I misunderstood him. I might even give Botany of Desire another chance.Now I will ramble:I'm a little jealous that he gets to write these glorified stunt books that are so appealingly nerdy.Now I'm going to start my starter...it's time to take my bread baking to the next level...I don't think I'll be roasting any whole pigs, though. However, listening to that part of the book did take me down memory lane to summer camp as a kid. Every summer we did ""Ham in a Pit,"" and we had to take turns in pairs overnight to keep watch. I don't remember what I actually thought of the resulting food, though. One last thought: germ is my copilot...this book made me really consider dirtiness and how we seem to be really screwing ourselves over. Oh well, we are evolutionary creatures and somehow we will adapt."
58,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2675284-mollie,4,"I finished listening to the audiobook yesterday and have been considering how to review it. I liked the author's way of encouraging the reader to establish a relationship with food based on ""meaning."" As well as his invitation to ""join the makers of the world.""I admired the breadth of his investigation, his knowledge base.The author reads the book. His inflections added meaning, deepened my relationship with the subject matter. Sometimes his calming voice induced drowsiness; after all, the book does not have a rousing plot.But today, I notice that I miss his soothing voice speaking to me of a recently discovered detail of food preparation. It is as if I now set one less place at my table."

To sample the barbecue in the South, or cheeses in France--oooh!The author uses stories to tell you how he learned about different kinds of foods and their origins. Actually very informative if you want to learn about whole foods and there is much science here. But the sciences in the context of relationships with real people who understand these foods. He hits most of the major types of food that we consume.This book would be an important read for someone who is basically only eating a standard American diet (SAD). It will open your eyes to new food horizons and could help you understand why eating real food makes you much happier and healthier."
60,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50262924-dr-tobias-christian-fischer,4,"Cooking stands for healthy, natural and energy-efficient food intake. Our ancestors started cooking at some point because the addition of heat allowed them to get a lot more nutrients from a lot more natural foods. Unfortunately, we have moved further and further away from it since the global boom in convenience foods. The following still applies today: Those who cook at home with natural ingredients are by far the healthiest (Blinkist, 2020)."
61,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53971695-stijn-zanders,5,"A book that inspires, Pollan writes the book around the idea that cooking is much more than just preparing food. He does this by diving into the four elements: fire, water, air and earth. Especially the last two parts that go into the baking of sour dough bread and fermentation are invaluable!"
62,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,4,"""In Cooked, Michael Pollan explores the previously uncharted territory of his own kitchen. Here, he discovers the enduring power of the four classical elements—fire, water, air, and earth—to transform the stuff of nature into delicious things to eat and drink. Apprenticing himself to a succession of culinary masters, Pollan learns how to grill with fire, cook with liquid, bake bread, and ferment everything from cheese to beer.The effects of not cooking are similarly far reaching. Relying upon corporations to process our food means we consume large quantities of fat, sugar, and salt; disrupt an essential link to the natural world; and weaken our relationships with family and friends. In fact, Cooked argues, taking back control of cooking may be the single most important step anyone can take to help make the American food system healthier and more sustainable. Reclaiming cooking as an act of enjoyment and self-reliance, learning to perform the magic of these everyday transformations, opens the door to a more nourishing life.""I have to say that I appreciate an author who tells me that I am being subversive or rebellious if I cook. It’s one of the few forms of rebelliousness to which I wholeheartedly subscribe. Having read Salt Sugar Fat by Michael Moss last year, I been working diligently at eliminating processed foods from my diet—easier said than done! Especially when one is also attempting to go gluten-free. I have many happy memories of cooking on the farm where I grew up. We knew the cows that provided our milk, the chickens that laid our eggs and the cattle and pigs that provided each evening’s main course. Sometimes Mom would even mention them by name as she served up supper. I have been in quest of a real pork chop for some time now and think I have found a butcher shop that provides a product very, very close to my idealized memories. One of the things which struck me when I moved to the city was the lack of taste in the meat and vegetables purchased from the chain grocery stores. Carrots from a chain store are more like wood than like vegetables and tomatoes are hard and tasteless compared to those we grew in our garden (fertilized with well-aged, long composted animal manure).  The problem, for me at least, is one of time. I love to cook and bake—but I also work full time and enjoy a busy social life. Having read Cooked, I can see that I will start attempting to schedule more cooking time into my life—in the past, I have whiled away many happy hours stirring soup pots, checking on oven contents and poking at dough. It’s time to return that gentle form of rebellion to my life on a regular basis."

As someone who cooks 90% of her meals from scratch this had my interest from the first chapter but I wondered how long it would last. After all, what was going to be ""news"" to me at this point. Well, it turns out...a lot!The book is filled with facts, anecdotes and hands on experiences of the author. Topics covered include real barbequing, braises, bread making and fermentation. I have actually caught myself discussing this book at length with my foodie friends and family. My husband was woken up a few times to hear a paragraph or two that struck a chord with me and I felt the need to discuss or share. He's been patient...but I wonder if it was so I could create the recipes at the back of the book. I will be on the lookout for a crock for some sauerkraut...my hubby's parents make this but now I have a stronger urge to try it out.Interesting, intellectual and inspiring!

64,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8986610-chris,3,"This was a good book if you're interested in the anatomy of cooking. Michael Pollan is one of my favorite food writers and I always enjoy his books, this one as well. However, this was a little too in depth for me.Michael explores the four realms of cooking in this book, Fire, Water, Air and Earth. For Fire, he uses whole hog barbeque. For Water, he explores braising. For air, his example is baking bread. For Earth he uses fermentation. Basically, he breaks all of these cooking methods down to the smallest elements and builds on it.My final thought on this book is that it was interesting, but if your not really into cooking/food then this book may be too much for you."
65,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1063843-sarah-hauck,4,"In his latest book, Cooked, Michael Pollan serves up another bestseller that looks at the relationships between us and the food we eat. Struck by the realization that “the less cooking we were doing in our own lives, the more that food and its vicarious preparation transfixed us,” Pollan sets out to explore the art of cooking for himself.Cooked reads like a how-to book for the uninitiated in the kitchen while still providing plenty of more detailed analysis for seasoned cooks. Divided into chapters based on the four classical elements – Earth, Water, Air and Fire – Pollan personally explores the world of cooking where “the stuff of nature gets transformed into the things we eat and drink.”In each chapter, Pollan learns about a corresponding cooking style: in Fire, he gets grilling lessons from a North Carolina barbecue pit master; in Water, he masters braises; in Air, he experiments with bread baking as he seeks to perfect the perfect sourdough loaf; and finally, in Earth, he explores various types of fermentation including pickling, cheese making and home brewing.Along the way, each of his teachers – from “the cheese nun” with a Ph.D. in microbiology to the “most famous fermentor in America” – is whole-heartedly devoted to his or her craft and, in the end, getting a glimpse into their lives and work is half the fun of the book.I’ve been a Michael Pollan fan since I first cracked the spine of The Botany of Desire more than a decade ago, but even I’ll admit, there are a few points in the narrative where even the most devout reader’s eyes may start to glaze over… like when Pollan gets mired in the details of the “all-important Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis” microbe. But only briefly. Because along with straight-up cool science, he also mixes into his narrative a bit of history, art and literature along with a dash of religion (“bread… is an everyday proof of the possibility of transcendence” and sex for good measure (“a cheese that stinks – of manure, of sex – offers a relatively safe way for us to flirt with forbidden desires”).As in his previous books, Pollan extolls the ills (literally) of processed foods and cautions against our over-reliance on corporations, “whose ‘dead food’ is damaging our health and ‘homogenizing’ our experience.”When asked why we don’t spend more time preparing our own meals, apparently most people claim a lack of time. But Pollan points out that, “in the last decade or so, we’ve all found two hours a day to be on line outside of work.” So what gives?Another entire book could be devoted to answering that question, but Pollan doesn’t take on that job in Cooked. Instead, he argues that we would all do well to start getting reacquainted with our kitchens because “cooking is one of the most interesting and worthwhile things we humans do.”While it may be cheaper and easier to rely on others to provide for our basic needs, “to live that way comes at a price, not least to our sense of competence and independence.” We are so disconnected from the makers of our food, Pollan argues, that we stop thinking about what is actually in the food we eat or where it comes from, much less the labor, money or energy it took to get it onto our plate. Worst of all, we forget that “what presents itself to us in the marketplace as a product is in truth a web of relationships between people… and all the other species on which we still depend.” (Yes, even bacteria.)In the end, Cooked turns out to be a commentary on the way we live. It’s true, as in his past books, that Pollan is critical of capitalism, and in particular consumerism, as the downfall of democracy and independence in its most literal sense. The antidote (or part of it, anyway) that he offers up here is cooking. To cook, he says, is to reclaim a bit of independence, and perhaps a bit of pride as well. It’s what separates us from the rest of the natural world and, paradoxically, also what keeps us connected to it.It is also an invitation to modern society (that’s you and me) to reconnect with the world. It’s true that few of us have the luxury of spending hours in the kitchen making all of our meals from scratch, but even small culinary contributions help us to reconnect with the natural world around us. As Pollan himself admits, “The most important thing I learned … is how cooking implicates us in a whole web of social and ecological relationships: with plants and animals, with the soil, with farmers, with the microbes both inside and outside our bodies, and, of course, with the people our cooking nourishes and delights.” And he invites us “to alter, however slightly, the ratio between production and consumption” in our lives.This, he believes, can make a difference. After trying his hand at home brewing, Pollan says, “The beer in that bottle, I’m reminded as soon as I brew it myself, ultimately comes not from a factory, but from nature – from a field of barley snapping in the wind, from a hops vine clambering over a trellis, from a host of invisible microbes feasting on sugars.”So, if preparing our own home-cooked meals makes us think just a little bit more about the world around us and how, ultimately, we all depend on one another to survive, then certainly a little time with a knife and cutting board won’t hurt anyone.For novices in the kitchen – or first-time Pollan readers – Cooked is sure to whet your appetite. For the rest of us, it is the continuation of an ongoing commentary on food, nature and modern society that will not fail to satisfy."
66,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10987540-ben,3,"It's difficult to rate a book which was very enjoyable to read, but fraught with quirks of Pollan's writing style and ideology. I'll write this review as a ""compliment sandwich."" To begin: The chapters on Barbeque (Fire) and Bread (Air) were particularly strong and interesting. I enjoyed the attention he gave to food research at UC Davis, and was glad to see him visit some interesting operations in Yolo County.That being said...Pollan went on several rants only tenuously connected to his topics. Notably, his nostalgia for an agrarian/culinary past that, to use the phrase of Jello Biafra ""never existed."" Pollan seems oblivious to his own level of wealth and privelege. He emphasizes that he braises ""cheap"" pieces of meat. Has he compared the price of a brisket to chicken? bologna? a can of beans? He spends days at a time on breads, insisting that he can ""get writing done"" in between turns and rises. Not everyone is a freelance writer, buddy. Try making a braise and two sourdoughs a week working 9-5.My final criticism is his love of ""artisans"" while scoffing at anything remotely automated. The problem is that for artisans (of food and everything else) it's a labor of love. An independent baker selling high-end sourdough might be carrying on a food tradition or whatever, but the forklift operator, truck driver, QC specialist, etc. at the Wonder-bread plant he's so quick to dismiss have mentally and physically demanding jobs, with some security, benefits, and disposable income that the starving artist-baker lacks. Does Pollan really envision a bucolic future of nothing but cottage industries? Who would have the income to buy his books?The joke's on him, I took it out of the library.In conclusion- Pollan is an entertaining and gripping writer who has sought out some very interesting characters in the American foodscape. Parts of this book rehash ""Omnivore's Dilema,"" but hey. What can you do? If this were a bad book, I wouldn't have finished it. It's honestly good writing, somewhat choppy, and somewhat obsessive about certain details (raising dough) while ignoring others (Pollan's wealth, and location in the foodie Island of the Bay Area.)"
67,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/867628-catherine,3,"Where has our love gone, Michael? This is the fourth of your books that I've read, which is somewhat fitting, considering your obsession with that number. Second Nature: four seasons, Omnivore's Dilemma: four meals, Botany of Desire: four plants, and with this book four methods of food preparation. I was really excited about a new book from you, as I really enjoyed those three earlier books, despite your tendency to ramble and repeat. When an acquaintance told me how much she enjoyed this book (her first experience with you), I quickly recommended the others and offered to swap her OD for this one. And yet...somehow I just can't get into it. Maybe it's that you're again preaching your slow food message and I've already joined the choir. Maybe it's the current heat wave that makes the subject of cooking less appealing. Maybe it's my stack of novels and lighter non-fiction driving me to distraction. Whatever the cause(s), I'm going to return this copy to the owner (since I've had it for three or four weeks already) and track down a library copy later when cooking and, let's be honest...you, Michael, sound more appealing.Update: it took me almost 7 years, but I finally finished this book! This time, I started with the section on yeast breads, focusing on sourdough. I've experimented with sourdough a couple times since reading Sourdough (and started a new one after finishing the book), so I had more connection to Pollan's experiences than the previous sections. The final section, in which he discusses fermentation (of vegetables, cheese, and alcohol) was also really interesting, especially the American-born nun making traditional cheese in a French convent. For me, the second half of the book was much stronger. "
68,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793094-lisa,5,"Michael Pollan has written another book about food; this time he researches the history of cooking. He focuses on cooking using the classic elements of fire, water, air, and earth.The section on fire focuses almost exclusively on smoking pork, which is something I enjoy doing. For those of you that have never enjoyed barbeque or smoking, you might not connect with this section like I did. Smoked pork (and chicken) is so good, it is worth the effort to try to perfect your efforts! Take a look at my video on smoking Boston Butts: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U2--A...I have videos on smoking chicken, salmon filets, and ribs; smoked food is so good and it is fun to connect with nature to prepare food!In the section on cooking with water, Pollan uses a pot to slow cook various delicious dishes. He talked about the time and effort to cook slowly on the stovetop. I had to wonder why he didn't even try using a crockpot or slow cooker! Nonetheless, all of the food sounded really good!The section on air focused on making bread and I almost wanted to make a loaf myself, but then I remembered how addictive bread out of the oven tastes! It was very interesting!Lastly, Pollan focused on ""earth"" as an element of cooking. Any guess what that could be? I never would have guessed, but it is fermentation. This was my least favorite section because I don't drink, but it was interesting to listen to how Pollan made his own beer. There are many health benefits to eating foods like yogurt that use something like fermentation to grow the cultures. While I eat yogurt every day, I am too much of a wimp to eat the other foods Pollan highlighted.Of course, Pollan could not resist discussing how many people no longer cook--or they heat prepared food and call that cooking. I found all of that fascinating because I do not buy many prepared foods; however, I buy more than I thought!I listened to this audiobook while gardening and loved it! "

It leaves plenty of mental space for daydreaming and reflection.” ― Michael Pollan, Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation In Cooked Michael Pollan stays close to his food roots. Similar in theme to: Omnivore's Dilema (Four Meals), In Defense of Food (Food Manifesto), Botany of Desire (Four Plants), Food Rules (Owner's Manual for Food), and Second Nature (Growing Food).Cooked is just another branch on the Phylogenetic food tree for the Pollan's Omnivore, me thinks. Unless, of course, Pollan is going to delve into the proper way to digest, poop, or compost your waste. And... he might just. I am neither a Pollan lover or hater. I've read a bunch of his stuff because it is fast and rather tasty. The problem with Pollan is reading too much of him. His books are a bit full of roughage and eventually too much of his raw idealism or fiber-rich localism gets to you. I think that is the problem with idealists and their genius (genus?). No one can quite live upto the expectations. There just isn't that many locally grown mushrooms, or farmer's markets, or grass-fed organic beef. But education about farming, feasting, and cooking gives us a better sense of both the idea and the real. As long as we are aware of the costs of the way we eat and the way we cook, we are better than we started. The probelm comes in when we believe ALL the hype. As long as you can remain pragmatic about food and Pollan, reading him is a good thing."

If there ever was a more tedious and odious exercise in navel gazing, I'd be impressed.I must confess I am baffled by this book. Who is the audience? Is it local foodies who are already converted? In which case, why on earth must the author keep telling us again and again and again how awesome cooking is? We get it, we're the choir, quit your preaching.Or perhaps the audience is the mass produced shrink-wrap microwave toting loner. In which case, hearing someone pontificate on and on and on about the joys of combining heat with edible things is also pointlessly preachy, and Mr Pollan does an abysmal sales job here.The problem is that Mr Pollan has completely and totally run out of things to say. As a result, this book is basically reworking the same sentence over and over again using different combinations of words. So to save the hapless potential victim from having to wade through a few hundred pages of tedium, I'd suggest instead spending the next hour rearranging any subset of these words into as many variations as you can:Heavenly, nature, cooking, is, god, primitive man, plants, aroma, animal sacrifice, producesHour over?

So, when this book was published, I really looked forward to reading it. I love his ability to take the science and technical aspects of food and nutrition and make them fascinating.I thought that it was quite appropriate that I read this book during a holiday centered around cooking and eating: Thanksgiving. I love cooking for our family, and I try hard to share that love with our girls, teaching them the simple concepts that I know and showing them how easy it is for a parent who works out of the home to prepare a home-cooked meal using little to no prepared foods. This book really shows the genesis of human cooking and the emotional and primal urges behind what and how we cook. In four different parts (fire, water, air, and earth), he describes different ways we engage with food. I'm not sure what happened - I read the first three parts in the span of just one day, but then I was overwhelmed with other books that I needed to read (for my book club or because they were coming due), and this book was pushed to the side for over a month. Finally, I decided I needed to finish it (I'm sure it's coming due soon!) and I tackled the fourth part in one day.

Yet another masterpiece by Pollan, Cooked is an anthropological, sociological, ethnographical, and humorous narrative just as engulfing as his others. Whether you are a professional chef or a lover of food, this book makes you hungry...for more. "
76,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65459284-paul,4,How is Brandon Sanderson considered a better writer by reviews than Michael Pollan?
77,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8561-yune,4,"Pollan has an easy, friendly, and persuasive writing style that managed to draw me away from another book I'd pre-ordered in two formats when Cooked happened to show up on the library hold shelf on the other book's release date.He's best when he's describing his own experiences or describing micro-science to a layman; I found him a little less convincing and slightly on the side of pretentious when he indulged in wide-scale anthropological musings or symbolism along the lines of the four elements he uses to organize this book: fire (barbecue), water (braises), air (bread), and earth (fermented foods, like sauerkraut and beer). I would've been totally fine with section headings with the food name.I was actually surprised to discover that he wasn't already an expert cook; one of his previous books, The Omnivore's Dilemma, had so incisively made the case for eating in a wholesome manner that I'd assumed he had mastered this skill. But this book is the story of his education in various culinary arenas, and as he manages gain tutelage under acclaimed pit masters and bakers, he--and I--became engrossed in his teachers' personal stories and the philosophies that brought them to the mastery of their crafts. (Or the philosophies that developed because of those crafts.)Thus you meet such interesting folks as the ""cheese nun,"" who managed to get the state health inspector to stand down in an otherwise shrill war about raw milk...by a scientific experiment:A nun's habit and a Ph.D. in microbiology--the abbey sent her to the University of Connecticut so that she might better be able to defend her cheese, both from pathogens and from public health authorities--are an unbeatable combination, and, so far at least, the FDA has thought better than to mess with Sister Noëlla, even as the agency has come down hard on many other raw-milk cheese makers.This lovely sly humor is on display several times, often parenthetically, such as when he describes a 300-year-old fermentation pit:The breadfruit in it had been reduced to a sour mush, but it was reported to be ""still in edible condition."" (You first.)It was interesting how each type of training received different treatment in Pollan's words. The whole pig barbecue ended up making me think more about the sweaty insanity of the chopping block afterward, while trying to feed thousands of hungry people; the year of weekly braising lessons felt prosaic, free of any sudden revelations, although Pollan admits to using what he learned here the most frequently afterward. His description of the bread-making process was utterly engrossing to me (a non-baker from a rice-centric culture), from how he coaxed the starter yeast to the shaping of the dough. His satisfaction rose almost palpably off the bread as he broke the crust of his efforts.And although he dips into scientific explanations whenever he sees fit, pointing out the chemical processes behind caramelization or the nutrients that separate whole wheat flour from white, he delves most deeply into the question of human interaction with internal bacteria: the gut microflora that actually does a lot of the work in keeping us healthy, and how hyper-sanitized environments and antibiotics can devastate this balance. Mary Roach also devotes some time to this in Gulp, and I anticipate a popular science book on the subject soon. Pollan himself doesn't subscribe to the ""kombucha will cure AIDS!"" line of ""let the bacteria grow wild and free!"" thinking, but he does make a strong case for eating less sterile food.Note: To his credit, Pollan does acknowledge head-on the gender imbalance that tends to accompany kitchen duties, without letting the discussion devour the book. In general I found him to be cognizant of the larger issues lying behind his personal quest, whether it be food industry lobbying power or cultural values, but touching upon them only gently.Quite a satisfying read, although I think it's best viewed more along memoirish lines than the sort of societal revolution hinted at in The Omnivore's Dilemma. And the ending was more powerful than those of many novels I've read."
78,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1020899-patty,3,"“Cooking is all about connection, I've learned, between us and other species, other times, other cultures (human and microbial both), but, most important, other people. Cooking is one of the more beautiful forms that human generosity takes; that much I sort of knew. But the very best cooking, I discovered, is also a form of intimacy.”This is the third book that I have read by Pollan. He started by writing about gardening and naturally moved on to food and cooking. I started with The Omnivore’s Dilemma and skipped the gardening books. (I really should go back to those – I like reading about gardening even though I don’t like gardening much.) All three of these books about food have been interesting and enlightening.When I did my review for The Omnivore’s Dilemma, I wrote, “For me this is what makes a good read. I get immersed in the book; I learn new things and for at least some of the time I am thinking about the book and author even when I am not reading the book.” That was true for this book as well. I listened to this and since it took more than thirteen hours, it was with me for a long time. I enjoyed thinking through Pollan’s theories about how the four elements reflect the four ways of cooking and meeting several chefs, bakers, cheesmakers and brewers. I will look at cooking a bit differently because of this book."
79,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/619524-jaysi,3,3.5 stars and only because I hold Pollen to a higher standard and liked his other books more. 
80,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/427611-karen-a,5,"This book has made me rethink many aspects of cooking. Especially how I cook. It is divided into 4 parts, fire, water, air, and earth all corresponding to specific methods of cooking. The fire portion was probably my least favorite and has made it even less likely that I will take up roasting a pig. And some of his comments about the pork industry, though brief, have made me pass up the pork section altogether at the grocery store. Enlightening are his observations about how we perceive the time it takes to cook and based on our perception that it is laborious and time consuming we have surrendered our meal preparation duties to large industry, an industry that has neither health nor quality at the core of its interests. And he counters that quick meal preparation is not so quick and the time it took him and his family to defrost and cook frozen meals he could easily have made a braise. Pollan also reveals what goes into a loaf of bread and how the baker’s pursuit of a light loaf full of air has caused a whole wheat industry to subvert the nutrition of the grain. My favorite part of this book however is the fourth and final part – earth which he dedicates to the art of fermenting. The whole concept of food decaying and then being turned into something not only particular to region and culture but actually good for the human gut is very intriguing and he does a great job of exploring what is going on with this process on a micro level. Also included in the portion of the book is cheese making. His works with the nun, Sister Noella, who makes cheese the old fashion way in large oak barrels contrary to FDA regulations and contrary to our own ideas of what will make the safest product to eat. But Sister Noella has done her homework (doctorate in microbiology) and can prove that the oak barrels produce a more stable product than the steel barrels used by the rest of the industry. While I wish Pollan would have put some of the same time and effort into the cheese portion of the book that he did for the pork roasting, he does do just enough where one will want to know more. In fact I think most of the book does and excellent job of whetting the appetite so to speak for a real discussion about our notions of convenience, health, taste, and how we cook. I really hope this fans the small flames for the trend to cook at home. It really is better in every way. "
81,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419307-rachel,2,"I thought I liked Michael Pollan's writing. Have I changed, or has he?This book had some good content, but Pollan's writing really got in the way. It read like the writing of someone who has gotten a little overconfident in the value of their interests and opinions to others, someone who loves their own writing a little too much, someone who was perhaps reluctant to seek the editing help they really needed.My problems with Pollan's writing are:1) He hammers his points home to the extent of sounding pedantic and condescending. Yes, cooking is the thing that separates us humans from animals, I get it. Now you're telling it to me another twenty times in twenty not-different-enough ways?2) Indulgent digression - between this and point #2, the book could have been cut down by about 100 pages into a much stronger, poignant book.3) Overwrought sentences and flimsy connections drawn between food and other things. Do the following excerpts not make you want to kind of throw up a little of the beautiful braise you just ate:""...it is the very allusiveness of cooked food that appeals to us, as indeed that same quality does in poetry or music or art. We gravitate toward complexity and metaphor, it seems, and putting fire to meat, or fermenting fruit and grain, gives us both: more sheer sensory information and, specifically, sensory information that, like metaphor, points away from the here and now. This sensory metaphor--this stands for that--is one of the most important transformations of nature wrought by cooking. And so a piece of crisped pigskin becomes a densely allusive poem of flavors...""""Elation, effervescence, elevation, levity, inspiration: air words all, alveolated with vowels, leavening the dough of everyday life.""Ick. And that's only one of several times he ""cleverly"" uses ""leaven."" We get it, Pollan. It's a bread word and you applied it to stuff that isn't bread.Just so tiresome, but I stuck with it because I liked the idea of the book, and some of the content was good. The discussion of bacterial flora did a good job of addressing a new topic in food and health, for example. But this might be the last Pollan book I read."
82,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,3,"I enjoy cooking and eating, but I don't read Michael Pollan's books – this is at least my third – for the food. If so, I would never have finished this. I am a vegetarian, and the first half of Cooked is about barbecue and braising – the smells of cooking pig flesh! – so not my favorite.I read Pollan's books for his curiosity. They are as much or more about the science of cooking and the philosophy of living. You have to be ready to geek out about everything that you come across. You need to be willing to stop and question all sorts of things: nutrition, chemistry, history, politics, gender.What was the single most important thing we could do as a family to improve our health and general well-being? And what would be a good way to better connect to my teenage son?.... Other questions were slightly more political in nature. For years I had been trying to determine (because I am often asked) what is the most important thing an ordinary person can do to help reform the American food system, to make it healthier and more sustainable? Another related question is, how can people living in a highly specialized consumer economy reduce their sense of dependence and achieve a greater degree of self-sufficiency? And then there were the more philosophical questions, the ones I’ve been chewing on since I first started writing books. How, in our everyday lives, can we acquire a deeper understanding of the natural world and our species’ peculiar role in it? (Kindle 96)Pollan goes straight to the horse's mouth to learn about food and cooking. Then he goes to another expert until he begins to work on his own. And he talks about his errors rather than dodging them. For Pollan, mistakes are an opportunity to learn, to understand. He is willing to throw out standard thinking. (Are antibiotics a good thing or not? What about pasteurization?) And, he takes us along for the ride.This is a lovely ride."
83,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14773738-julie,5,"This is another excellent offering by Michael Pollan who, since The Omnivore's Dilemma has become my favourite go-to person in all things food related. Admittedly, this was slightly less interesting to me than Pollan's Dilemma, but only because I've already experienced all the joys of being Cooked -- pun intended. For all those who have yet to experience the transformative power of being the master/mistress of one's own hearth, this is a must read. Twice.This is not a recipe book -- far from it, albeit Pollan does throw in a few handy recipes at the very end, based on the four elements he explores: fire, water, air and earth; in essence, the touchstone elements of our universe, and our humanity. This is more a book on the nature of cooking: the whys and wherefores of throwing that first chunk of meat over burning coals, and then of maybe tossing in a tuber or two for good measure. With this simple action, we defined our humanity, Pollan postulates, and it is this that made us stand taller than the apes, once and for all.He also dabbles in the mysticism of cooking, the art of alchemical transformation of both the eaten, and the eater. It is a magical read -- and unlike Pollan's Dilemma which left me never wanting to eat (industrial) food ever again, this book left me ravenous. It is an exceptional testament to why we should all engage in the action of feeding ourselves -- quite literally. The action of going to the market and buying packaged and frozen food-like substances is not cooking, and offers absolutely nothing to our nutritional intake, either chemically or spiritually, Pollan offers. Rather, we need to be closer than arm's length from the veggies and the meats we slide down our gullets: we need to understand how much nourishment actually lies in the act of preparation. Full stars."
84,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19059096-jill,4,"Usually I read Michael Pollan to feel distressed (but not awash), and ashamed (but not hopeless). But Cooked is Pollan at his most optimistic. While conscientious as always, he sets out in this book not to acquaint us with the grim facts of our world and its consumers’ decisions; rather, he illustrates the wonders of what we as individuals can do. And what we can do is, obviously: cook. Cook in informed, ambitious ways that link us to the ground, to plants and animals and microbes, to farmers and other producers, and to the people in our lives for whom we cook. This book is part of the antidote to the problems laid out in Omnivore’s Dilemma and In Defense of Food. It's structured “by element,” wherein Pollan discusses cooking with fire (such as in the barbecue pits of North Carolina), water (braises and pot-cooking), air (with bread-masters from all over) and earth (fermentation.) Fair warning: you find yourself fairly deep in the weeds of the chemical processes of the latter two topics – as other reviewers before me have found, these chapters are slower to get through than the first half.Cooked veers toward personal anecdotes, nutrition, chemistry, social history, mythology, and even psychology as necessary. Pollan delivers every discussion with the deftness and humility we expect from him. The writing’s great, the subjects are varied, and the tone is encouraging. Four solid stars."
85,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1706153-meghan,5,"Months after finishing this, I feel obligated to bump it up to 5 stars. The Pollanesqe pedantic tone that starts this book off is the only reason that my initial grade was a 4.5 for me, but even that can be kind of endearing... I very regularly felt like I was reading a book by my dad. However, each chapter drew me into a very dreamy, delighted state of reading. I love the path that weaves through research and literature, mixed with Pollan's interactions with fascinating expert cooks as well as his own cooking adventures. I was surprised, inspired, and impressed constantly. This is one book that I'm very happy to own, because even before I finished it I was tempted to refer back to previous chapters as a reference for some real life situation or another. It prompted me to talk about food with people a lot more, and I definitely feel inspired to branch out of my cooking comfort zone. For anyone why might appreciate some background or perspective on the practice of cooking, this is a fabulous choice.I was reading Ecotopia at the same time, a novel that complemented this one very well. Aaaand up next: Moyasimon: Tales of Agriculture, Volume 2, the world of microbes! ""Everything is everywhere."""
86,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4504899-becki-iverson,5,"As always, Michael Pollan's new book ""Cooked"" is an impeccably researched, beautifully written and hands-on journey through the four foundational methods of cooking. Stylistically, it is essentially a mash-up of the styles of his previous books into a snazzy new package - the four pillars of ""Botany of Desire,"" the hands on creation and eating in ""Omnivore's Dilemma,"" and the modern food science vs. traditional eats breakdown of ""In Defense of Food."" The result is glorious(although at very rare instances almost too brainy). Pollan is a deceptively excellent writer who is capable of making extraordinarily complex concepts and terms accessible to nearly anyone; thus, it is easy to forgive him when he goes a bit awry. I would have liked just a little more description of the work Pollan was doing himself on the cooking; more in depth interviews/apprenticeships, or more recipes. But either way, it's been a while since his last book, and it's good to see Pollan in print again."
87,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1386971-marieke,4,"I really enjoyed this. I have officially abandoned my Michael Pollan hater stance. I misunderstood him. I might even give Botany of Desire another chance.Now I will ramble:I'm a little jealous that he gets to write these glorified stunt books that are so appealingly nerdy.Now I'm going to start my starter...it's time to take my bread baking to the next level...I don't think I'll be roasting any whole pigs, though. However, listening to that part of the book did take me down memory lane to summer camp as a kid. Every summer we did ""Ham in a Pit,"" and we had to take turns in pairs overnight to keep watch. I don't remember what I actually thought of the resulting food, though. One last thought: germ is my copilot...this book made me really consider dirtiness and how we seem to be really screwing ourselves over. Oh well, we are evolutionary creatures and somehow we will adapt."
88,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2675284-mollie,4,"I finished listening to the audiobook yesterday and have been considering how to review it. I liked the author's way of encouraging the reader to establish a relationship with food based on ""meaning."" As well as his invitation to ""join the makers of the world.""I admired the breadth of his investigation, his knowledge base.The author reads the book. His inflections added meaning, deepened my relationship with the subject matter. Sometimes his calming voice induced drowsiness; after all, the book does not have a rousing plot.But today, I notice that I miss his soothing voice speaking to me of a recently discovered detail of food preparation. It is as if I now set one less place at my table."
89,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6236139-michael-jones,4,"This was one of those books where at many points I wished I could be the author! To sample the barbecue in the South, or cheeses in France--oooh!The author uses stories to tell you how he learned about different kinds of foods and their origins. Actually very informative if you want to learn about whole foods and there is much science here. But the sciences in the context of relationships with real people who understand these foods. He hits most of the major types of food that we consume.This book would be an important read for someone who is basically only eating a standard American diet (SAD). It will open your eyes to new food horizons and could help you understand why eating real food makes you much happier and healthier."
90,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50262924-dr-tobias-christian-fischer,4,"Cooking stands for healthy, natural and energy-efficient food intake. Our ancestors started cooking at some point because the addition of heat allowed them to get a lot more nutrients from a lot more natural foods. Unfortunately, we have moved further and further away from it since the global boom in convenience foods. The following still applies today: Those who cook at home with natural ingredients are by far the healthiest (Blinkist, 2020)."
91,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53971695-stijn-zanders,5,"A book that inspires, Pollan writes the book around the idea that cooking is much more than just preparing food. He does this by diving into the four elements: fire, water, air and earth. Especially the last two parts that go into the baking of sour dough bread and fermentation are invaluable!"
92,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,4,"""In Cooked, Michael Pollan explores the previously uncharted territory of his own kitchen. Here, he discovers the enduring power of the four classical elements—fire, water, air, and earth—to transform the stuff of nature into delicious things to eat and drink. Apprenticing himself to a succession of culinary masters, Pollan learns how to grill with fire, cook with liquid, bake bread, and ferment everything from cheese to beer.The effects of not cooking are similarly far reaching. Relying upon corporations to process our food means we consume large quantities of fat, sugar, and salt; disrupt an essential link to the natural world; and weaken our relationships with family and friends. In fact, Cooked argues, taking back control of cooking may be the single most important step anyone can take to help make the American food system healthier and more sustainable. Reclaiming cooking as an act of enjoyment and self-reliance, learning to perform the magic of these everyday transformations, opens the door to a more nourishing life.""I have to say that I appreciate an author who tells me that I am being subversive or rebellious if I cook. It’s one of the few forms of rebelliousness to which I wholeheartedly subscribe. Having read Salt Sugar Fat by Michael Moss last year, I been working diligently at eliminating processed foods from my diet—easier said than done! Especially when one is also attempting to go gluten-free. I have many happy memories of cooking on the farm where I grew up. We knew the cows that provided our milk, the chickens that laid our eggs and the cattle and pigs that provided each evening’s main course. Sometimes Mom would even mention them by name as she served up supper. I have been in quest of a real pork chop for some time now and think I have found a butcher shop that provides a product very, very close to my idealized memories. One of the things which struck me when I moved to the city was the lack of taste in the meat and vegetables purchased from the chain grocery stores. Carrots from a chain store are more like wood than like vegetables and tomatoes are hard and tasteless compared to those we grew in our garden (fertilized with well-aged, long composted animal manure).  The problem, for me at least, is one of time. I love to cook and bake—but I also work full time and enjoy a busy social life. Having read Cooked, I can see that I will start attempting to schedule more cooking time into my life—in the past, I have whiled away many happy hours stirring soup pots, checking on oven contents and poking at dough. It’s time to return that gentle form of rebellion to my life on a regular basis."

As someone who cooks 90% of her meals from scratch this had my interest from the first chapter but I wondered how long it would last. After all, what was going to be ""news"" to me at this point. Well, it turns out...a lot!The book is filled with facts, anecdotes and hands on experiences of the author. Topics covered include real barbequing, braises, bread making and fermentation. I have actually caught myself discussing this book at length with my foodie friends and family. My husband was woken up a few times to hear a paragraph or two that struck a chord with me and I felt the need to discuss or share. He's been patient...but I wonder if it was so I could create the recipes at the back of the book. I will be on the lookout for a crock for some sauerkraut...my hubby's parents make this but now I have a stronger urge to try it out.Interesting, intellectual and inspiring!

94,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8986610-chris,3,"This was a good book if you're interested in the anatomy of cooking. Michael Pollan is one of my favorite food writers and I always enjoy his books, this one as well. However, this was a little too in depth for me.Michael explores the four realms of cooking in this book, Fire, Water, Air and Earth. For Fire, he uses whole hog barbeque. For Water, he explores braising. For air, his example is baking bread. For Earth he uses fermentation. Basically, he breaks all of these cooking methods down to the smallest elements and builds on it.My final thought on this book is that it was interesting, but if your not really into cooking/food then this book may be too much for you."
95,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1063843-sarah-hauck,4,"In his latest book, Cooked, Michael Pollan serves up another bestseller that looks at the relationships between us and the food we eat. Struck by the realization that “the less cooking we were doing in our own lives, the more that food and its vicarious preparation transfixed us,” Pollan sets out to explore the art of cooking for himself.Cooked reads like a how-to book for the uninitiated in the kitchen while still providing plenty of more detailed analysis for seasoned cooks. Divided into chapters based on the four classical elements – Earth, Water, Air and Fire – Pollan personally explores the world of cooking where “the stuff of nature gets transformed into the things we eat and drink.”In each chapter, Pollan learns about a corresponding cooking style: in Fire, he gets grilling lessons from a North Carolina barbecue pit master; in Water, he masters braises; in Air, he experiments with bread baking as he seeks to perfect the perfect sourdough loaf; and finally, in Earth, he explores various types of fermentation including pickling, cheese making and home brewing.Along the way, each of his teachers – from “the cheese nun” with a Ph.D. in microbiology to the “most famous fermentor in America” – is whole-heartedly devoted to his or her craft and, in the end, getting a glimpse into their lives and work is half the fun of the book.I’ve been a Michael Pollan fan since I first cracked the spine of The Botany of Desire more than a decade ago, but even I’ll admit, there are a few points in the narrative where even the most devout reader’s eyes may start to glaze over… like when Pollan gets mired in the details of the “all-important Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis” microbe. But only briefly. Because along with straight-up cool science, he also mixes into his narrative a bit of history, art and literature along with a dash of religion (“bread… is an everyday proof of the possibility of transcendence” and sex for good measure (“a cheese that stinks – of manure, of sex – offers a relatively safe way for us to flirt with forbidden desires”).As in his previous books, Pollan extolls the ills (literally) of processed foods and cautions against our over-reliance on corporations, “whose ‘dead food’ is damaging our health and ‘homogenizing’ our experience.”When asked why we don’t spend more time preparing our own meals, apparently most people claim a lack of time. But Pollan points out that, “in the last decade or so, we’ve all found two hours a day to be on line outside of work.” So what gives?Another entire book could be devoted to answering that question, but Pollan doesn’t take on that job in Cooked. Instead, he argues that we would all do well to start getting reacquainted with our kitchens because “cooking is one of the most interesting and worthwhile things we humans do.”While it may be cheaper and easier to rely on others to provide for our basic needs, “to live that way comes at a price, not least to our sense of competence and independence.” We are so disconnected from the makers of our food, Pollan argues, that we stop thinking about what is actually in the food we eat or where it comes from, much less the labor, money or energy it took to get it onto our plate. Worst of all, we forget that “what presents itself to us in the marketplace as a product is in truth a web of relationships between people… and all the other species on which we still depend.” (Yes, even bacteria.)In the end, Cooked turns out to be a commentary on the way we live. It’s true, as in his past books, that Pollan is critical of capitalism, and in particular consumerism, as the downfall of democracy and independence in its most literal sense. The antidote (or part of it, anyway) that he offers up here is cooking. To cook, he says, is to reclaim a bit of independence, and perhaps a bit of pride as well. It’s what separates us from the rest of the natural world and, paradoxically, also what keeps us connected to it.It is also an invitation to modern society (that’s you and me) to reconnect with the world. It’s true that few of us have the luxury of spending hours in the kitchen making all of our meals from scratch, but even small culinary contributions help us to reconnect with the natural world around us. As Pollan himself admits, “The most important thing I learned … is how cooking implicates us in a whole web of social and ecological relationships: with plants and animals, with the soil, with farmers, with the microbes both inside and outside our bodies, and, of course, with the people our cooking nourishes and delights.” And he invites us “to alter, however slightly, the ratio between production and consumption” in our lives.This, he believes, can make a difference. After trying his hand at home brewing, Pollan says, “The beer in that bottle, I’m reminded as soon as I brew it myself, ultimately comes not from a factory, but from nature – from a field of barley snapping in the wind, from a hops vine clambering over a trellis, from a host of invisible microbes feasting on sugars.”So, if preparing our own home-cooked meals makes us think just a little bit more about the world around us and how, ultimately, we all depend on one another to survive, then certainly a little time with a knife and cutting board won’t hurt anyone.For novices in the kitchen – or first-time Pollan readers – Cooked is sure to whet your appetite. For the rest of us, it is the continuation of an ongoing commentary on food, nature and modern society that will not fail to satisfy."

I'll write this review as a ""compliment sandwich."" To begin: The chapters on Barbeque (Fire) and Bread (Air) were particularly strong and interesting. I enjoyed the attention he gave to food research at UC Davis, and was glad to see him visit some interesting operations in Yolo County.That being said...Pollan went on several rants only tenuously connected to his topics. Notably, his nostalgia for an agrarian/culinary past that, to use the phrase of Jello Biafra ""never existed."" Pollan seems oblivious to his own level of wealth and privelege. He emphasizes that he braises ""cheap"" pieces of meat. Has he compared the price of a brisket to chicken? bologna? a can of beans? He spends days at a time on breads, insisting that he can ""get writing done"" in between turns and rises. Not everyone is a freelance writer, buddy. Try making a braise and two sourdoughs a week working 9-5.My final criticism is his love of ""artisans"" while scoffing at anything remotely automated. The problem is that for artisans (of food and everything else) it's a labor of love. An independent baker selling high-end sourdough might be carrying on a food tradition or whatever, but the forklift operator, truck driver, QC specialist, etc. at the Wonder-bread plant he's so quick to dismiss have mentally and physically demanding jobs, with some security, benefits, and disposable income that the starving artist-baker lacks. Does Pollan really envision a bucolic future of nothing but cottage industries? Who would have the income to buy his books?The joke's on him, I took it out of the library.In conclusion- Pollan is an entertaining and gripping writer who has sought out some very interesting characters in the American foodscape. Parts of this book rehash ""Omnivore's Dilema,"" but hey. What can you do? If this were a bad book, I wouldn't have finished it. It's honestly good writing, somewhat choppy, and somewhat obsessive about certain details (raising dough) while ignoring others (Pollan's wealth, and location in the foodie Island of the Bay Area.)"
97,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/867628-catherine,3,"Where has our love gone, Michael? This is the fourth of your books that I've read, which is somewhat fitting, considering your obsession with that number. Second Nature: four seasons, Omnivore's Dilemma: four meals, Botany of Desire: four plants, and with this book four methods of food preparation. I was really excited about a new book from you, as I really enjoyed those three earlier books, despite your tendency to ramble and repeat. When an acquaintance told me how much she enjoyed this book (her first experience with you), I quickly recommended the others and offered to swap her OD for this one. And yet...somehow I just can't get into it. Maybe it's that you're again preaching your slow food message and I've already joined the choir. Maybe it's the current heat wave that makes the subject of cooking less appealing. Maybe it's my stack of novels and lighter non-fiction driving me to distraction. Whatever the cause(s), I'm going to return this copy to the owner (since I've had it for three or four weeks already) and track down a library copy later when cooking and, let's be honest...you, Michael, sound more appealing.Update: it took me almost 7 years, but I finally finished this book! This time, I started with the section on yeast breads, focusing on sourdough. I've experimented with sourdough a couple times since reading Sourdough (and started a new one after finishing the book), so I had more connection to Pollan's experiences than the previous sections. The final section, in which he discusses fermentation (of vegetables, cheese, and alcohol) was also really interesting, especially the American-born nun making traditional cheese in a French convent. For me, the second half of the book was much stronger. "
98,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793094-lisa,5,"Michael Pollan has written another book about food; this time he researches the history of cooking. He focuses on cooking using the classic elements of fire, water, air, and earth.The section on fire focuses almost exclusively on smoking pork, which is something I enjoy doing. For those of you that have never enjoyed barbeque or smoking, you might not connect with this section like I did. Smoked pork (and chicken) is so good, it is worth the effort to try to perfect your efforts! Take a look at my video on smoking Boston Butts: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U2--A...I have videos on smoking chicken, salmon filets, and ribs; smoked food is so good and it is fun to connect with nature to prepare food!In the section on cooking with water, Pollan uses a pot to slow cook various delicious dishes. He talked about the time and effort to cook slowly on the stovetop. I had to wonder why he didn't even try using a crockpot or slow cooker! Nonetheless, all of the food sounded really good!The section on air focused on making bread and I almost wanted to make a loaf myself, but then I remembered how addictive bread out of the oven tastes! It was very interesting!Lastly, Pollan focused on ""earth"" as an element of cooking. Any guess what that could be? I never would have guessed, but it is fermentation. This was my least favorite section because I don't drink, but it was interesting to listen to how Pollan made his own beer. There are many health benefits to eating foods like yogurt that use something like fermentation to grow the cultures. While I eat yogurt every day, I am too much of a wimp to eat the other foods Pollan highlighted.Of course, Pollan could not resist discussing how many people no longer cook--or they heat prepared food and call that cooking. I found all of that fascinating because I do not buy many prepared foods; however, I buy more than I thought!I listened to this audiobook while gardening and loved it! "
99,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,4,"“I found that, much like gardening, most cooking manages to be agreeably absorbing without being too demanding intellectually. It leaves plenty of mental space for daydreaming and reflection.” ― Michael Pollan, Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation In Cooked Michael Pollan stays close to his food roots. Similar in theme to: Omnivore's Dilema (Four Meals), In Defense of Food (Food Manifesto), Botany of Desire (Four Plants), Food Rules (Owner's Manual for Food), and Second Nature (Growing Food).Cooked is just another branch on the Phylogenetic food tree for the Pollan's Omnivore, me thinks. Unless, of course, Pollan is going to delve into the proper way to digest, poop, or compost your waste. And... he might just. I am neither a Pollan lover or hater. I've read a bunch of his stuff because it is fast and rather tasty. The problem with Pollan is reading too much of him. His books are a bit full of roughage and eventually too much of his raw idealism or fiber-rich localism gets to you. I think that is the problem with idealists and their genius (genus?). No one can quite live upto the expectations. There just isn't that many locally grown mushrooms, or farmer's markets, or grass-fed organic beef. But education about farming, feasting, and cooking gives us a better sense of both the idea and the real. As long as we are aware of the costs of the way we eat and the way we cook, we are better than we started. The probelm comes in when we believe ALL the hype. As long as you can remain pragmatic about food and Pollan, reading him is a good thing."

If there ever was a more tedious and odious exercise in navel gazing, I'd be impressed.I must confess I am baffled by this book. Who is the audience? Is it local foodies who are already converted? In which case, why on earth must the author keep telling us again and again and again how awesome cooking is? We get it, we're the choir, quit your preaching.Or perhaps the audience is the mass produced shrink-wrap microwave toting loner. In which case, hearing someone pontificate on and on and on about the joys of combining heat with edible things is also pointlessly preachy, and Mr Pollan does an abysmal sales job here.The problem is that Mr Pollan has completely and totally run out of things to say. As a result, this book is basically reworking the same sentence over and over again using different combinations of words. So to save the hapless potential victim from having to wade through a few hundred pages of tedium, I'd suggest instead spending the next hour rearranging any subset of these words into as many variations as you can:Heavenly, nature, cooking, is, god, primitive man, plants, aroma, animal sacrifice, producesHour over? You're welcome, I just saved you many more hours of your precious time. You can spend the remaining 5-6 you have left over from not reading this book staring blankly into space, it'll be more meaningful and more likely to result in food related insights."

So, when this book was published, I really looked forward to reading it. I love his ability to take the science and technical aspects of food and nutrition and make them fascinating.I thought that it was quite appropriate that I read this book during a holiday centered around cooking and eating: Thanksgiving. I love cooking for our family, and I try hard to share that love with our girls, teaching them the simple concepts that I know and showing them how easy it is for a parent who works out of the home to prepare a home-cooked meal using little to no prepared foods. This book really shows the genesis of human cooking and the emotional and primal urges behind what and how we cook. In four different parts (fire, water, air, and earth), he describes different ways we engage with food. I'm not sure what happened - I read the first three parts in the span of just one day, but then I was overwhelmed with other books that I needed to read (for my book club or because they were coming due), and this book was pushed to the side for over a month. Finally, I decided I needed to finish it (I'm sure it's coming due soon!) and I tackled the fourth part in one day. So, while it looks like I took my sweet time, I just had a big break in between.interesting quotes:""Once cooking allowed us to expand our cognitive capacity at the expense of our digestive capacity, there was no going back: Our big brains and tiny guts now depended on a diet of cooked food.""

Yet another masterpiece by Pollan, Cooked is an anthropological, sociological, ethnographical, and humorous narrative just as engulfing as his others. Whether you are a professional chef or a lover of food, this book makes you hungry...for more. "
106,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65459284-paul,4,How is Brandon Sanderson considered a better writer by reviews than Michael Pollan?
107,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8561-yune,4,"Pollan has an easy, friendly, and persuasive writing style that managed to draw me away from another book I'd pre-ordered in two formats when Cooked happened to show up on the library hold shelf on the other book's release date.He's best when he's describing his own experiences or describing micro-science to a layman; I found him a little less convincing and slightly on the side of pretentious when he indulged in wide-scale anthropological musings or symbolism along the lines of the four elements he uses to organize this book: fire (barbecue), water (braises), air (bread), and earth (fermented foods, like sauerkraut and beer). I would've been totally fine with section headings with the food name.I was actually surprised to discover that he wasn't already an expert cook; one of his previous books, The Omnivore's Dilemma, had so incisively made the case for eating in a wholesome manner that I'd assumed he had mastered this skill. But this book is the story of his education in various culinary arenas, and as he manages gain tutelage under acclaimed pit masters and bakers, he--and I--became engrossed in his teachers' personal stories and the philosophies that brought them to the mastery of their crafts. (Or the philosophies that developed because of those crafts.)Thus you meet such interesting folks as the ""cheese nun,"" who managed to get the state health inspector to stand down in an otherwise shrill war about raw milk...by a scientific experiment:A nun's habit and a Ph.D. in microbiology--the abbey sent her to the University of Connecticut so that she might better be able to defend her cheese, both from pathogens and from public health authorities--are an unbeatable combination, and, so far at least, the FDA has thought better than to mess with Sister Noëlla, even as the agency has come down hard on many other raw-milk cheese makers.This lovely sly humor is on display several times, often parenthetically, such as when he describes a 300-year-old fermentation pit:The breadfruit in it had been reduced to a sour mush, but it was reported to be ""still in edible condition."" (You first.)It was interesting how each type of training received different treatment in Pollan's words. The whole pig barbecue ended up making me think more about the sweaty insanity of the chopping block afterward, while trying to feed thousands of hungry people; the year of weekly braising lessons felt prosaic, free of any sudden revelations, although Pollan admits to using what he learned here the most frequently afterward. His description of the bread-making process was utterly engrossing to me (a non-baker from a rice-centric culture), from how he coaxed the starter yeast to the shaping of the dough. His satisfaction rose almost palpably off the bread as he broke the crust of his efforts.And although he dips into scientific explanations whenever he sees fit, pointing out the chemical processes behind caramelization or the nutrients that separate whole wheat flour from white, he delves most deeply into the question of human interaction with internal bacteria: the gut microflora that actually does a lot of the work in keeping us healthy, and how hyper-sanitized environments and antibiotics can devastate this balance. Mary Roach also devotes some time to this in Gulp, and I anticipate a popular science book on the subject soon. Pollan himself doesn't subscribe to the ""kombucha will cure AIDS!"" line of ""let the bacteria grow wild and free!"" thinking, but he does make a strong case for eating less sterile food.Note: To his credit, Pollan does acknowledge head-on the gender imbalance that tends to accompany kitchen duties, without letting the discussion devour the book. In general I found him to be cognizant of the larger issues lying behind his personal quest, whether it be food industry lobbying power or cultural values, but touching upon them only gently.Quite a satisfying read, although I think it's best viewed more along memoirish lines than the sort of societal revolution hinted at in The Omnivore's Dilemma. And the ending was more powerful than those of many novels I've read."
108,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1020899-patty,3,"“Cooking is all about connection, I've learned, between us and other species, other times, other cultures (human and microbial both), but, most important, other people. Cooking is one of the more beautiful forms that human generosity takes; that much I sort of knew. But the very best cooking, I discovered, is also a form of intimacy.”This is the third book that I have read by Pollan. He started by writing about gardening and naturally moved on to food and cooking. I started with The Omnivore’s Dilemma and skipped the gardening books. (I really should go back to those – I like reading about gardening even though I don’t like gardening much.) All three of these books about food have been interesting and enlightening.When I did my review for The Omnivore’s Dilemma, I wrote, “For me this is what makes a good read. I get immersed in the book; I learn new things and for at least some of the time I am thinking about the book and author even when I am not reading the book.” That was true for this book as well. I listened to this and since it took more than thirteen hours, it was with me for a long time. I enjoyed thinking through Pollan’s theories about how the four elements reflect the four ways of cooking and meeting several chefs, bakers, cheesmakers and brewers. I will look at cooking a bit differently because of this book."
109,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/619524-jaysi,3,3.5 stars and only because I hold Pollen to a higher standard and liked his other books more. 
110,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/427611-karen-a,5,"This book has made me rethink many aspects of cooking. Especially how I cook. It is divided into 4 parts, fire, water, air, and earth all corresponding to specific methods of cooking. The fire portion was probably my least favorite and has made it even less likely that I will take up roasting a pig. And some of his comments about the pork industry, though brief, have made me pass up the pork section altogether at the grocery store. Enlightening are his observations about how we perceive the time it takes to cook and based on our perception that it is laborious and time consuming we have surrendered our meal preparation duties to large industry, an industry that has neither health nor quality at the core of its interests. And he counters that quick meal preparation is not so quick and the time it took him and his family to defrost and cook frozen meals he could easily have made a braise. Pollan also reveals what goes into a loaf of bread and how the baker’s pursuit of a light loaf full of air has caused a whole wheat industry to subvert the nutrition of the grain. My favorite part of this book however is the fourth and final part – earth which he dedicates to the art of fermenting. The whole concept of food decaying and then being turned into something not only particular to region and culture but actually good for the human gut is very intriguing and he does a great job of exploring what is going on with this process on a micro level. Also included in the portion of the book is cheese making. His works with the nun, Sister Noella, who makes cheese the old fashion way in large oak barrels contrary to FDA regulations and contrary to our own ideas of what will make the safest product to eat. But Sister Noella has done her homework (doctorate in microbiology) and can prove that the oak barrels produce a more stable product than the steel barrels used by the rest of the industry. While I wish Pollan would have put some of the same time and effort into the cheese portion of the book that he did for the pork roasting, he does do just enough where one will want to know more. In fact I think most of the book does and excellent job of whetting the appetite so to speak for a real discussion about our notions of convenience, health, taste, and how we cook. I really hope this fans the small flames for the trend to cook at home. It really is better in every way. "
111,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419307-rachel,2,"I thought I liked Michael Pollan's writing. Have I changed, or has he?This book had some good content, but Pollan's writing really got in the way. It read like the writing of someone who has gotten a little overconfident in the value of their interests and opinions to others, someone who loves their own writing a little too much, someone who was perhaps reluctant to seek the editing help they really needed.My problems with Pollan's writing are:1) He hammers his points home to the extent of sounding pedantic and condescending. Yes, cooking is the thing that separates us humans from animals, I get it. Now you're telling it to me another twenty times in twenty not-different-enough ways?2) Indulgent digression - between this and point #2, the book could have been cut down by about 100 pages into a much stronger, poignant book.3) Overwrought sentences and flimsy connections drawn between food and other things. Do the following excerpts not make you want to kind of throw up a little of the beautiful braise you just ate:""...it is the very allusiveness of cooked food that appeals to us, as indeed that same quality does in poetry or music or art. We gravitate toward complexity and metaphor, it seems, and putting fire to meat, or fermenting fruit and grain, gives us both: more sheer sensory information and, specifically, sensory information that, like metaphor, points away from the here and now. This sensory metaphor--this stands for that--is one of the most important transformations of nature wrought by cooking. And so a piece of crisped pigskin becomes a densely allusive poem of flavors...""""Elation, effervescence, elevation, levity, inspiration: air words all, alveolated with vowels, leavening the dough of everyday life.""Ick. And that's only one of several times he ""cleverly"" uses ""leaven."" We get it, Pollan. It's a bread word and you applied it to stuff that isn't bread.Just so tiresome, but I stuck with it because I liked the idea of the book, and some of the content was good. The discussion of bacterial flora did a good job of addressing a new topic in food and health, for example. But this might be the last Pollan book I read."
112,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,3,"I enjoy cooking and eating, but I don't read Michael Pollan's books – this is at least my third – for the food. If so, I would never have finished this. I am a vegetarian, and the first half of Cooked is about barbecue and braising – the smells of cooking pig flesh! – so not my favorite.I read Pollan's books for his curiosity. They are as much or more about the science of cooking and the philosophy of living. You have to be ready to geek out about everything that you come across. You need to be willing to stop and question all sorts of things: nutrition, chemistry, history, politics, gender.What was the single most important thing we could do as a family to improve our health and general well-being? And what would be a good way to better connect to my teenage son?.... Other questions were slightly more political in nature. For years I had been trying to determine (because I am often asked) what is the most important thing an ordinary person can do to help reform the American food system, to make it healthier and more sustainable? Another related question is, how can people living in a highly specialized consumer economy reduce their sense of dependence and achieve a greater degree of self-sufficiency? And then there were the more philosophical questions, the ones I’ve been chewing on since I first started writing books. How, in our everyday lives, can we acquire a deeper understanding of the natural world and our species’ peculiar role in it? (Kindle 96)Pollan goes straight to the horse's mouth to learn about food and cooking. Then he goes to another expert until he begins to work on his own. And he talks about his errors rather than dodging them. For Pollan, mistakes are an opportunity to learn, to understand. He is willing to throw out standard thinking. (Are antibiotics a good thing or not? What about pasteurization?) And, he takes us along for the ride.This is a lovely ride."
113,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14773738-julie,5,"This is another excellent offering by Michael Pollan who, since The Omnivore's Dilemma has become my favourite go-to person in all things food related. Admittedly, this was slightly less interesting to me than Pollan's Dilemma, but only because I've already experienced all the joys of being Cooked -- pun intended. For all those who have yet to experience the transformative power of being the master/mistress of one's own hearth, this is a must read. Twice.This is not a recipe book -- far from it, albeit Pollan does throw in a few handy recipes at the very end, based on the four elements he explores: fire, water, air and earth; in essence, the touchstone elements of our universe, and our humanity. This is more a book on the nature of cooking: the whys and wherefores of throwing that first chunk of meat over burning coals, and then of maybe tossing in a tuber or two for good measure. With this simple action, we defined our humanity, Pollan postulates, and it is this that made us stand taller than the apes, once and for all.He also dabbles in the mysticism of cooking, the art of alchemical transformation of both the eaten, and the eater. It is a magical read -- and unlike Pollan's Dilemma which left me never wanting to eat (industrial) food ever again, this book left me ravenous. It is an exceptional testament to why we should all engage in the action of feeding ourselves -- quite literally. The action of going to the market and buying packaged and frozen food-like substances is not cooking, and offers absolutely nothing to our nutritional intake, either chemically or spiritually, Pollan offers. Rather, we need to be closer than arm's length from the veggies and the meats we slide down our gullets: we need to understand how much nourishment actually lies in the act of preparation. Full stars."
114,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19059096-jill,4,"Usually I read Michael Pollan to feel distressed (but not awash), and ashamed (but not hopeless). But Cooked is Pollan at his most optimistic. While conscientious as always, he sets out in this book not to acquaint us with the grim facts of our world and its consumers’ decisions; rather, he illustrates the wonders of what we as individuals can do. And what we can do is, obviously: cook. Cook in informed, ambitious ways that link us to the ground, to plants and animals and microbes, to farmers and other producers, and to the people in our lives for whom we cook. This book is part of the antidote to the problems laid out in Omnivore’s Dilemma and In Defense of Food. It's structured “by element,” wherein Pollan discusses cooking with fire (such as in the barbecue pits of North Carolina), water (braises and pot-cooking), air (with bread-masters from all over) and earth (fermentation.) Fair warning: you find yourself fairly deep in the weeds of the chemical processes of the latter two topics – as other reviewers before me have found, these chapters are slower to get through than the first half.Cooked veers toward personal anecdotes, nutrition, chemistry, social history, mythology, and even psychology as necessary. Pollan delivers every discussion with the deftness and humility we expect from him. The writing’s great, the subjects are varied, and the tone is encouraging. Four solid stars."
115,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1706153-meghan,5,"Months after finishing this, I feel obligated to bump it up to 5 stars. The Pollanesqe pedantic tone that starts this book off is the only reason that my initial grade was a 4.5 for me, but even that can be kind of endearing... I very regularly felt like I was reading a book by my dad. However, each chapter drew me into a very dreamy, delighted state of reading. I love the path that weaves through research and literature, mixed with Pollan's interactions with fascinating expert cooks as well as his own cooking adventures. I was surprised, inspired, and impressed constantly. This is one book that I'm very happy to own, because even before I finished it I was tempted to refer back to previous chapters as a reference for some real life situation or another. It prompted me to talk about food with people a lot more, and I definitely feel inspired to branch out of my cooking comfort zone. For anyone why might appreciate some background or perspective on the practice of cooking, this is a fabulous choice.I was reading Ecotopia at the same time, a novel that complemented this one very well. Aaaand up next: Moyasimon: Tales of Agriculture, Volume 2, the world of microbes! ""Everything is everywhere."""
116,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4504899-becki-iverson,5,"As always, Michael Pollan's new book ""Cooked"" is an impeccably researched, beautifully written and hands-on journey through the four foundational methods of cooking. Stylistically, it is essentially a mash-up of the styles of his previous books into a snazzy new package - the four pillars of ""Botany of Desire,"" the hands on creation and eating in ""Omnivore's Dilemma,"" and the modern food science vs. traditional eats breakdown of ""In Defense of Food."" The result is glorious(although at very rare instances almost too brainy). Pollan is a deceptively excellent writer who is capable of making extraordinarily complex concepts and terms accessible to nearly anyone; thus, it is easy to forgive him when he goes a bit awry. I would have liked just a little more description of the work Pollan was doing himself on the cooking; more in depth interviews/apprenticeships, or more recipes. But either way, it's been a while since his last book, and it's good to see Pollan in print again."
117,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1386971-marieke,4,"I really enjoyed this. I have officially abandoned my Michael Pollan hater stance. I misunderstood him. I might even give Botany of Desire another chance.Now I will ramble:I'm a little jealous that he gets to write these glorified stunt books that are so appealingly nerdy.Now I'm going to start my starter...it's time to take my bread baking to the next level...I don't think I'll be roasting any whole pigs, though. However, listening to that part of the book did take me down memory lane to summer camp as a kid. Every summer we did ""Ham in a Pit,"" and we had to take turns in pairs overnight to keep watch. I don't remember what I actually thought of the resulting food, though. One last thought: germ is my copilot...this book made me really consider dirtiness and how we seem to be really screwing ourselves over. Oh well, we are evolutionary creatures and somehow we will adapt."
118,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2675284-mollie,4,"I finished listening to the audiobook yesterday and have been considering how to review it. I liked the author's way of encouraging the reader to establish a relationship with food based on ""meaning."" As well as his invitation to ""join the makers of the world.""I admired the breadth of his investigation, his knowledge base.The author reads the book. His inflections added meaning, deepened my relationship with the subject matter. Sometimes his calming voice induced drowsiness; after all, the book does not have a rousing plot.But today, I notice that I miss his soothing voice speaking to me of a recently discovered detail of food preparation. It is as if I now set one less place at my table."
119,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6236139-michael-jones,4,"This was one of those books where at many points I wished I could be the author! To sample the barbecue in the South, or cheeses in France--oooh!The author uses stories to tell you how he learned about different kinds of foods and their origins. Actually very informative if you want to learn about whole foods and there is much science here. But the sciences in the context of relationships with real people who understand these foods. He hits most of the major types of food that we consume.This book would be an important read for someone who is basically only eating a standard American diet (SAD). It will open your eyes to new food horizons and could help you understand why eating real food makes you much happier and healthier."
120,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50262924-dr-tobias-christian-fischer,4,"Cooking stands for healthy, natural and energy-efficient food intake. Our ancestors started cooking at some point because the addition of heat allowed them to get a lot more nutrients from a lot more natural foods. Unfortunately, we have moved further and further away from it since the global boom in convenience foods. The following still applies today: Those who cook at home with natural ingredients are by far the healthiest (Blinkist, 2020)."
121,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53971695-stijn-zanders,5,"A book that inspires, Pollan writes the book around the idea that cooking is much more than just preparing food. He does this by diving into the four elements: fire, water, air and earth. Especially the last two parts that go into the baking of sour dough bread and fermentation are invaluable!"
122,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,4,"""In Cooked, Michael Pollan explores the previously uncharted territory of his own kitchen. Here, he discovers the enduring power of the four classical elements—fire, water, air, and earth—to transform the stuff of nature into delicious things to eat and drink. Apprenticing himself to a succession of culinary masters, Pollan learns how to grill with fire, cook with liquid, bake bread, and ferment everything from cheese to beer.The effects of not cooking are similarly far reaching. Relying upon corporations to process our food means we consume large quantities of fat, sugar, and salt; disrupt an essential link to the natural world; and weaken our relationships with family and friends. In fact, Cooked argues, taking back control of cooking may be the single most important step anyone can take to help make the American food system healthier and more sustainable. Reclaiming cooking as an act of enjoyment and self-reliance, learning to perform the magic of these everyday transformations, opens the door to a more nourishing life.""I have to say that I appreciate an author who tells me that I am being subversive or rebellious if I cook. It’s one of the few forms of rebelliousness to which I wholeheartedly subscribe. Having read Salt Sugar Fat by Michael Moss last year, I been working diligently at eliminating processed foods from my diet—easier said than done! Especially when one is also attempting to go gluten-free. I have many happy memories of cooking on the farm where I grew up. We knew the cows that provided our milk, the chickens that laid our eggs and the cattle and pigs that provided each evening’s main course. Sometimes Mom would even mention them by name as she served up supper. I have been in quest of a real pork chop for some time now and think I have found a butcher shop that provides a product very, very close to my idealized memories. One of the things which struck me when I moved to the city was the lack of taste in the meat and vegetables purchased from the chain grocery stores. Carrots from a chain store are more like wood than like vegetables and tomatoes are hard and tasteless compared to those we grew in our garden (fertilized with well-aged, long composted animal manure).  The problem, for me at least, is one of time. I love to cook and bake—but I also work full time and enjoy a busy social life. Having read Cooked, I can see that I will start attempting to schedule more cooking time into my life—in the past, I have whiled away many happy hours stirring soup pots, checking on oven contents and poking at dough. It’s time to return that gentle form of rebellion to my life on a regular basis."
123,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7424302-sharlene,4,"This book was received as the result of a Good read giveaway.This was not my average book...but how could I not want to read this as it was about my favourite subject...Food!Pollan covers the four ways of cooking covering fire, water, air and earth, something I had never really thought about before. As someone who cooks 90% of her meals from scratch this had my interest from the first chapter but I wondered how long it would last. After all, what was going to be ""news"" to me at this point. Well, it turns out...a lot!The book is filled with facts, anecdotes and hands on experiences of the author. Topics covered include real barbequing, braises, bread making and fermentation. I have actually caught myself discussing this book at length with my foodie friends and family. My husband was woken up a few times to hear a paragraph or two that struck a chord with me and I felt the need to discuss or share. He's been patient...but I wonder if it was so I could create the recipes at the back of the book. I will be on the lookout for a crock for some sauerkraut...my hubby's parents make this but now I have a stronger urge to try it out.Interesting, intellectual and inspiring! Well written and well documented.On a final note...it was peanut free so it's safe for everyone. ;)"
124,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8986610-chris,3,"This was a good book if you're interested in the anatomy of cooking. Michael Pollan is one of my favorite food writers and I always enjoy his books, this one as well. However, this was a little too in depth for me.Michael explores the four realms of cooking in this book, Fire, Water, Air and Earth. For Fire, he uses whole hog barbeque. For Water, he explores braising. For air, his example is baking bread. For Earth he uses fermentation. Basically, he breaks all of these cooking methods down to the smallest elements and builds on it.My final thought on this book is that it was interesting, but if your not really into cooking/food then this book may be too much for you."
125,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1063843-sarah-hauck,4,"In his latest book, Cooked, Michael Pollan serves up another bestseller that looks at the relationships between us and the food we eat. Struck by the realization that “the less cooking we were doing in our own lives, the more that food and its vicarious preparation transfixed us,” Pollan sets out to explore the art of cooking for himself.Cooked reads like a how-to book for the uninitiated in the kitchen while still providing plenty of more detailed analysis for seasoned cooks. Divided into chapters based on the four classical elements – Earth, Water, Air and Fire – Pollan personally explores the world of cooking where “the stuff of nature gets transformed into the things we eat and drink.”In each chapter, Pollan learns about a corresponding cooking style: in Fire, he gets grilling lessons from a North Carolina barbecue pit master; in Water, he masters braises; in Air, he experiments with bread baking as he seeks to perfect the perfect sourdough loaf; and finally, in Earth, he explores various types of fermentation including pickling, cheese making and home brewing.Along the way, each of his teachers – from “the cheese nun” with a Ph.D. in microbiology to the “most famous fermentor in America” – is whole-heartedly devoted to his or her craft and, in the end, getting a glimpse into their lives and work is half the fun of the book.I’ve been a Michael Pollan fan since I first cracked the spine of The Botany of Desire more than a decade ago, but even I’ll admit, there are a few points in the narrative where even the most devout reader’s eyes may start to glaze over… like when Pollan gets mired in the details of the “all-important Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis” microbe. But only briefly. Because along with straight-up cool science, he also mixes into his narrative a bit of history, art and literature along with a dash of religion (“bread… is an everyday proof of the possibility of transcendence” and sex for good measure (“a cheese that stinks – of manure, of sex – offers a relatively safe way for us to flirt with forbidden desires”).As in his previous books, Pollan extolls the ills (literally) of processed foods and cautions against our over-reliance on corporations, “whose ‘dead food’ is damaging our health and ‘homogenizing’ our experience.”When asked why we don’t spend more time preparing our own meals, apparently most people claim a lack of time. But Pollan points out that, “in the last decade or so, we’ve all found two hours a day to be on line outside of work.” So what gives?Another entire book could be devoted to answering that question, but Pollan doesn’t take on that job in Cooked. Instead, he argues that we would all do well to start getting reacquainted with our kitchens because “cooking is one of the most interesting and worthwhile things we humans do.”While it may be cheaper and easier to rely on others to provide for our basic needs, “to live that way comes at a price, not least to our sense of competence and independence.” We are so disconnected from the makers of our food, Pollan argues, that we stop thinking about what is actually in the food we eat or where it comes from, much less the labor, money or energy it took to get it onto our plate. Worst of all, we forget that “what presents itself to us in the marketplace as a product is in truth a web of relationships between people… and all the other species on which we still depend.” (Yes, even bacteria.)In the end, Cooked turns out to be a commentary on the way we live. It’s true, as in his past books, that Pollan is critical of capitalism, and in particular consumerism, as the downfall of democracy and independence in its most literal sense. The antidote (or part of it, anyway) that he offers up here is cooking. To cook, he says, is to reclaim a bit of independence, and perhaps a bit of pride as well. It’s what separates us from the rest of the natural world and, paradoxically, also what keeps us connected to it.It is also an invitation to modern society (that’s you and me) to reconnect with the world. It’s true that few of us have the luxury of spending hours in the kitchen making all of our meals from scratch, but even small culinary contributions help us to reconnect with the natural world around us. As Pollan himself admits, “The most important thing I learned … is how cooking implicates us in a whole web of social and ecological relationships: with plants and animals, with the soil, with farmers, with the microbes both inside and outside our bodies, and, of course, with the people our cooking nourishes and delights.” And he invites us “to alter, however slightly, the ratio between production and consumption” in our lives.This, he believes, can make a difference. After trying his hand at home brewing, Pollan says, “The beer in that bottle, I’m reminded as soon as I brew it myself, ultimately comes not from a factory, but from nature – from a field of barley snapping in the wind, from a hops vine clambering over a trellis, from a host of invisible microbes feasting on sugars.”So, if preparing our own home-cooked meals makes us think just a little bit more about the world around us and how, ultimately, we all depend on one another to survive, then certainly a little time with a knife and cutting board won’t hurt anyone.For novices in the kitchen – or first-time Pollan readers – Cooked is sure to whet your appetite. For the rest of us, it is the continuation of an ongoing commentary on food, nature and modern society that will not fail to satisfy."
126,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10987540-ben,3,"It's difficult to rate a book which was very enjoyable to read, but fraught with quirks of Pollan's writing style and ideology. I'll write this review as a ""compliment sandwich."" To begin: The chapters on Barbeque (Fire) and Bread (Air) were particularly strong and interesting. I enjoyed the attention he gave to food research at UC Davis, and was glad to see him visit some interesting operations in Yolo County.That being said...Pollan went on several rants only tenuously connected to his topics. Notably, his nostalgia for an agrarian/culinary past that, to use the phrase of Jello Biafra ""never existed."" Pollan seems oblivious to his own level of wealth and privelege. He emphasizes that he braises ""cheap"" pieces of meat. Has he compared the price of a brisket to chicken? bologna? a can of beans? He spends days at a time on breads, insisting that he can ""get writing done"" in between turns and rises. Not everyone is a freelance writer, buddy. Try making a braise and two sourdoughs a week working 9-5.My final criticism is his love of ""artisans"" while scoffing at anything remotely automated. The problem is that for artisans (of food and everything else) it's a labor of love. An independent baker selling high-end sourdough might be carrying on a food tradition or whatever, but the forklift operator, truck driver, QC specialist, etc. at the Wonder-bread plant he's so quick to dismiss have mentally and physically demanding jobs, with some security, benefits, and disposable income that the starving artist-baker lacks. Does Pollan really envision a bucolic future of nothing but cottage industries? Who would have the income to buy his books?The joke's on him, I took it out of the library.In conclusion- Pollan is an entertaining and gripping writer who has sought out some very interesting characters in the American foodscape. Parts of this book rehash ""Omnivore's Dilema,"" but hey. What can you do? If this were a bad book, I wouldn't have finished it. It's honestly good writing, somewhat choppy, and somewhat obsessive about certain details (raising dough) while ignoring others (Pollan's wealth, and location in the foodie Island of the Bay Area.)"
127,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/867628-catherine,3,"Where has our love gone, Michael? This is the fourth of your books that I've read, which is somewhat fitting, considering your obsession with that number. Second Nature: four seasons, Omnivore's Dilemma: four meals, Botany of Desire: four plants, and with this book four methods of food preparation. I was really excited about a new book from you, as I really enjoyed those three earlier books, despite your tendency to ramble and repeat. When an acquaintance told me how much she enjoyed this book (her first experience with you), I quickly recommended the others and offered to swap her OD for this one. And yet...somehow I just can't get into it. Maybe it's that you're again preaching your slow food message and I've already joined the choir. Maybe it's the current heat wave that makes the subject of cooking less appealing. Maybe it's my stack of novels and lighter non-fiction driving me to distraction. Whatever the cause(s), I'm going to return this copy to the owner (since I've had it for three or four weeks already) and track down a library copy later when cooking and, let's be honest...you, Michael, sound more appealing.Update: it took me almost 7 years, but I finally finished this book! This time, I started with the section on yeast breads, focusing on sourdough. I've experimented with sourdough a couple times since reading Sourdough (and started a new one after finishing the book), so I had more connection to Pollan's experiences than the previous sections. The final section, in which he discusses fermentation (of vegetables, cheese, and alcohol) was also really interesting, especially the American-born nun making traditional cheese in a French convent. For me, the second half of the book was much stronger. "
128,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793094-lisa,5,"Michael Pollan has written another book about food; this time he researches the history of cooking. He focuses on cooking using the classic elements of fire, water, air, and earth.The section on fire focuses almost exclusively on smoking pork, which is something I enjoy doing. For those of you that have never enjoyed barbeque or smoking, you might not connect with this section like I did. Smoked pork (and chicken) is so good, it is worth the effort to try to perfect your efforts! Take a look at my video on smoking Boston Butts: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U2--A...I have videos on smoking chicken, salmon filets, and ribs; smoked food is so good and it is fun to connect with nature to prepare food!In the section on cooking with water, Pollan uses a pot to slow cook various delicious dishes. He talked about the time and effort to cook slowly on the stovetop. I had to wonder why he didn't even try using a crockpot or slow cooker! Nonetheless, all of the food sounded really good!The section on air focused on making bread and I almost wanted to make a loaf myself, but then I remembered how addictive bread out of the oven tastes! It was very interesting!Lastly, Pollan focused on ""earth"" as an element of cooking. Any guess what that could be? I never would have guessed, but it is fermentation. This was my least favorite section because I don't drink, but it was interesting to listen to how Pollan made his own beer. There are many health benefits to eating foods like yogurt that use something like fermentation to grow the cultures. While I eat yogurt every day, I am too much of a wimp to eat the other foods Pollan highlighted.Of course, Pollan could not resist discussing how many people no longer cook--or they heat prepared food and call that cooking. I found all of that fascinating because I do not buy many prepared foods; however, I buy more than I thought!I listened to this audiobook while gardening and loved it! "
129,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,4,"“I found that, much like gardening, most cooking manages to be agreeably absorbing without being too demanding intellectually. It leaves plenty of mental space for daydreaming and reflection.” ― Michael Pollan, Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation In Cooked Michael Pollan stays close to his food roots. Similar in theme to: Omnivore's Dilema (Four Meals), In Defense of Food (Food Manifesto), Botany of Desire (Four Plants), Food Rules (Owner's Manual for Food), and Second Nature (Growing Food).Cooked is just another branch on the Phylogenetic food tree for the Pollan's Omnivore, me thinks. Unless, of course, Pollan is going to delve into the proper way to digest, poop, or compost your waste. And... he might just. I am neither a Pollan lover or hater. I've read a bunch of his stuff because it is fast and rather tasty. The problem with Pollan is reading too much of him. His books are a bit full of roughage and eventually too much of his raw idealism or fiber-rich localism gets to you. I think that is the problem with idealists and their genius (genus?). No one can quite live upto the expectations. There just isn't that many locally grown mushrooms, or farmer's markets, or grass-fed organic beef. But education about farming, feasting, and cooking gives us a better sense of both the idea and the real. As long as we are aware of the costs of the way we eat and the way we cook, we are better than we started. The probelm comes in when we believe ALL the hype. As long as you can remain pragmatic about food and Pollan, reading him is a good thing."

If there ever was a more tedious and odious exercise in navel gazing, I'd be impressed.I must confess I am baffled by this book. Who is the audience? Is it local foodies who are already converted? In which case, why on earth must the author keep telling us again and again and again how awesome cooking is? We get it, we're the choir, quit your preaching.Or perhaps the audience is the mass produced shrink-wrap microwave toting loner. In which case, hearing someone pontificate on and on and on about the joys of combining heat with edible things is also pointlessly preachy, and Mr Pollan does an abysmal sales job here.The problem is that Mr Pollan has completely and totally run out of things to say. As a result, this book is basically reworking the same sentence over and over again using different combinations of words. So to save the hapless potential victim from having to wade through a few hundred pages of tedium, I'd suggest instead spending the next hour rearranging any subset of these words into as many variations as you can:Heavenly, nature, cooking, is, god, primitive man, plants, aroma, animal sacrifice, producesHour over? You're welcome, I just saved you many more hours of your precious time. You can spend the remaining 5-6 you have left over from not reading this book staring blankly into space, it'll be more meaningful and more likely to result in food related insights."

That said, I agree 100 percent with the author about the practice of making meals as being healthy and a good practice. I think he is a fine author and I look forward to his next book.

So, when this book was published, I really looked forward to reading it. I love his ability to take the science and technical aspects of food and nutrition and make them fascinating.I thought that it was quite appropriate that I read this book during a holiday centered around cooking and eating: Thanksgiving. I love cooking for our family, and I try hard to share that love with our girls, teaching them the simple concepts that I know and showing them how easy it is for a parent who works out of the home to prepare a home-cooked meal using little to no prepared foods. This book really shows the genesis of human cooking and the emotional and primal urges behind what and how we cook. In four different parts (fire, water, air, and earth), he describes different ways we engage with food. I'm not sure what happened - I read the first three parts in the span of just one day, but then I was overwhelmed with other books that I needed to read (for my book club or because they were coming due), and this book was pushed to the side for over a month. Finally, I decided I needed to finish it (I'm sure it's coming due soon!) and I tackled the fourth part in one day.

Yet another masterpiece by Pollan, Cooked is an anthropological, sociological, ethnographical, and humorous narrative just as engulfing as his others. Whether you are a professional chef or a lover of food, this book makes you hungry...for more. "
136,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65459284-paul,4,How is Brandon Sanderson considered a better writer by reviews than Michael Pollan?
137,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8561-yune,4,"Pollan has an easy, friendly, and persuasive writing style that managed to draw me away from another book I'd pre-ordered in two formats when Cooked happened to show up on the library hold shelf on the other book's release date.He's best when he's describing his own experiences or describing micro-science to a layman; I found him a little less convincing and slightly on the side of pretentious when he indulged in wide-scale anthropological musings or symbolism along the lines of the four elements he uses to organize this book: fire (barbecue), water (braises), air (bread), and earth (fermented foods, like sauerkraut and beer). I would've been totally fine with section headings with the food name.I was actually surprised to discover that he wasn't already an expert cook; one of his previous books, The Omnivore's Dilemma, had so incisively made the case for eating in a wholesome manner that I'd assumed he had mastered this skill. But this book is the story of his education in various culinary arenas, and as he manages gain tutelage under acclaimed pit masters and bakers, he--and I--became engrossed in his teachers' personal stories and the philosophies that brought them to the mastery of their crafts. (Or the philosophies that developed because of those crafts.)Thus you meet such interesting folks as the ""cheese nun,"" who managed to get the state health inspector to stand down in an otherwise shrill war about raw milk...by a scientific experiment:A nun's habit and a Ph.D. in microbiology--the abbey sent her to the University of Connecticut so that she might better be able to defend her cheese, both from pathogens and from public health authorities--are an unbeatable combination, and, so far at least, the FDA has thought better than to mess with Sister Noëlla, even as the agency has come down hard on many other raw-milk cheese makers.This lovely sly humor is on display several times, often parenthetically, such as when he describes a 300-year-old fermentation pit:The breadfruit in it had been reduced to a sour mush, but it was reported to be ""still in edible condition."" (You first.)It was interesting how each type of training received different treatment in Pollan's words. The whole pig barbecue ended up making me think more about the sweaty insanity of the chopping block afterward, while trying to feed thousands of hungry people; the year of weekly braising lessons felt prosaic, free of any sudden revelations, although Pollan admits to using what he learned here the most frequently afterward. His description of the bread-making process was utterly engrossing to me (a non-baker from a rice-centric culture), from how he coaxed the starter yeast to the shaping of the dough. His satisfaction rose almost palpably off the bread as he broke the crust of his efforts.And although he dips into scientific explanations whenever he sees fit, pointing out the chemical processes behind caramelization or the nutrients that separate whole wheat flour from white, he delves most deeply into the question of human interaction with internal bacteria: the gut microflora that actually does a lot of the work in keeping us healthy, and how hyper-sanitized environments and antibiotics can devastate this balance. Mary Roach also devotes some time to this in Gulp, and I anticipate a popular science book on the subject soon. Pollan himself doesn't subscribe to the ""kombucha will cure AIDS!"" line of ""let the bacteria grow wild and free!"" thinking, but he does make a strong case for eating less sterile food.Note: To his credit, Pollan does acknowledge head-on the gender imbalance that tends to accompany kitchen duties, without letting the discussion devour the book. In general I found him to be cognizant of the larger issues lying behind his personal quest, whether it be food industry lobbying power or cultural values, but touching upon them only gently.Quite a satisfying read, although I think it's best viewed more along memoirish lines than the sort of societal revolution hinted at in The Omnivore's Dilemma. And the ending was more powerful than those of many novels I've read."
138,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1020899-patty,3,"“Cooking is all about connection, I've learned, between us and other species, other times, other cultures (human and microbial both), but, most important, other people. Cooking is one of the more beautiful forms that human generosity takes; that much I sort of knew. But the very best cooking, I discovered, is also a form of intimacy.”This is the third book that I have read by Pollan. He started by writing about gardening and naturally moved on to food and cooking. I started with The Omnivore’s Dilemma and skipped the gardening books. (I really should go back to those – I like reading about gardening even though I don’t like gardening much.) All three of these books about food have been interesting and enlightening.When I did my review for The Omnivore’s Dilemma, I wrote, “For me this is what makes a good read. I get immersed in the book; I learn new things and for at least some of the time I am thinking about the book and author even when I am not reading the book.” That was true for this book as well. I listened to this and since it took more than thirteen hours, it was with me for a long time. I enjoyed thinking through Pollan’s theories about how the four elements reflect the four ways of cooking and meeting several chefs, bakers, cheesmakers and brewers. I will look at cooking a bit differently because of this book."
139,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/619524-jaysi,3,3.5 stars and only because I hold Pollen to a higher standard and liked his other books more. 
140,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/427611-karen-a,5,"This book has made me rethink many aspects of cooking. Especially how I cook. It is divided into 4 parts, fire, water, air, and earth all corresponding to specific methods of cooking. The fire portion was probably my least favorite and has made it even less likely that I will take up roasting a pig. And some of his comments about the pork industry, though brief, have made me pass up the pork section altogether at the grocery store. Enlightening are his observations about how we perceive the time it takes to cook and based on our perception that it is laborious and time consuming we have surrendered our meal preparation duties to large industry, an industry that has neither health nor quality at the core of its interests. And he counters that quick meal preparation is not so quick and the time it took him and his family to defrost and cook frozen meals he could easily have made a braise. Pollan also reveals what goes into a loaf of bread and how the baker’s pursuit of a light loaf full of air has caused a whole wheat industry to subvert the nutrition of the grain. My favorite part of this book however is the fourth and final part – earth which he dedicates to the art of fermenting. The whole concept of food decaying and then being turned into something not only particular to region and culture but actually good for the human gut is very intriguing and he does a great job of exploring what is going on with this process on a micro level. Also included in the portion of the book is cheese making. His works with the nun, Sister Noella, who makes cheese the old fashion way in large oak barrels contrary to FDA regulations and contrary to our own ideas of what will make the safest product to eat. But Sister Noella has done her homework (doctorate in microbiology) and can prove that the oak barrels produce a more stable product than the steel barrels used by the rest of the industry. While I wish Pollan would have put some of the same time and effort into the cheese portion of the book that he did for the pork roasting, he does do just enough where one will want to know more. In fact I think most of the book does and excellent job of whetting the appetite so to speak for a real discussion about our notions of convenience, health, taste, and how we cook. I really hope this fans the small flames for the trend to cook at home. It really is better in every way. "
141,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419307-rachel,2,"I thought I liked Michael Pollan's writing. Have I changed, or has he?This book had some good content, but Pollan's writing really got in the way. It read like the writing of someone who has gotten a little overconfident in the value of their interests and opinions to others, someone who loves their own writing a little too much, someone who was perhaps reluctant to seek the editing help they really needed.My problems with Pollan's writing are:1) He hammers his points home to the extent of sounding pedantic and condescending. Yes, cooking is the thing that separates us humans from animals, I get it. Now you're telling it to me another twenty times in twenty not-different-enough ways?2) Indulgent digression - between this and point #2, the book could have been cut down by about 100 pages into a much stronger, poignant book.3) Overwrought sentences and flimsy connections drawn between food and other things. Do the following excerpts not make you want to kind of throw up a little of the beautiful braise you just ate:""...it is the very allusiveness of cooked food that appeals to us, as indeed that same quality does in poetry or music or art. We gravitate toward complexity and metaphor, it seems, and putting fire to meat, or fermenting fruit and grain, gives us both: more sheer sensory information and, specifically, sensory information that, like metaphor, points away from the here and now. This sensory metaphor--this stands for that--is one of the most important transformations of nature wrought by cooking. And so a piece of crisped pigskin becomes a densely allusive poem of flavors...""""Elation, effervescence, elevation, levity, inspiration: air words all, alveolated with vowels, leavening the dough of everyday life.""Ick. And that's only one of several times he ""cleverly"" uses ""leaven."" We get it, Pollan. It's a bread word and you applied it to stuff that isn't bread.Just so tiresome, but I stuck with it because I liked the idea of the book, and some of the content was good. The discussion of bacterial flora did a good job of addressing a new topic in food and health, for example. But this might be the last Pollan book I read."
142,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,3,"I enjoy cooking and eating, but I don't read Michael Pollan's books – this is at least my third – for the food. If so, I would never have finished this. I am a vegetarian, and the first half of Cooked is about barbecue and braising – the smells of cooking pig flesh! – so not my favorite.I read Pollan's books for his curiosity. They are as much or more about the science of cooking and the philosophy of living. You have to be ready to geek out about everything that you come across. You need to be willing to stop and question all sorts of things: nutrition, chemistry, history, politics, gender.What was the single most important thing we could do as a family to improve our health and general well-being? And what would be a good way to better connect to my teenage son?.... Other questions were slightly more political in nature. For years I had been trying to determine (because I am often asked) what is the most important thing an ordinary person can do to help reform the American food system, to make it healthier and more sustainable? Another related question is, how can people living in a highly specialized consumer economy reduce their sense of dependence and achieve a greater degree of self-sufficiency? And then there were the more philosophical questions, the ones I’ve been chewing on since I first started writing books. How, in our everyday lives, can we acquire a deeper understanding of the natural world and our species’ peculiar role in it? (Kindle 96)Pollan goes straight to the horse's mouth to learn about food and cooking. Then he goes to another expert until he begins to work on his own. And he talks about his errors rather than dodging them. For Pollan, mistakes are an opportunity to learn, to understand. He is willing to throw out standard thinking. (Are antibiotics a good thing or not? What about pasteurization?) And, he takes us along for the ride.This is a lovely ride."
143,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14773738-julie,5,"This is another excellent offering by Michael Pollan who, since The Omnivore's Dilemma has become my favourite go-to person in all things food related. Admittedly, this was slightly less interesting to me than Pollan's Dilemma, but only because I've already experienced all the joys of being Cooked -- pun intended. For all those who have yet to experience the transformative power of being the master/mistress of one's own hearth, this is a must read. Twice.This is not a recipe book -- far from it, albeit Pollan does throw in a few handy recipes at the very end, based on the four elements he explores: fire, water, air and earth; in essence, the touchstone elements of our universe, and our humanity. This is more a book on the nature of cooking: the whys and wherefores of throwing that first chunk of meat over burning coals, and then of maybe tossing in a tuber or two for good measure. With this simple action, we defined our humanity, Pollan postulates, and it is this that made us stand taller than the apes, once and for all.He also dabbles in the mysticism of cooking, the art of alchemical transformation of both the eaten, and the eater. It is a magical read -- and unlike Pollan's Dilemma which left me never wanting to eat (industrial) food ever again, this book left me ravenous. It is an exceptional testament to why we should all engage in the action of feeding ourselves -- quite literally. The action of going to the market and buying packaged and frozen food-like substances is not cooking, and offers absolutely nothing to our nutritional intake, either chemically or spiritually, Pollan offers. Rather, we need to be closer than arm's length from the veggies and the meats we slide down our gullets: we need to understand how much nourishment actually lies in the act of preparation. Full stars."
144,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19059096-jill,4,"Usually I read Michael Pollan to feel distressed (but not awash), and ashamed (but not hopeless). But Cooked is Pollan at his most optimistic. While conscientious as always, he sets out in this book not to acquaint us with the grim facts of our world and its consumers’ decisions; rather, he illustrates the wonders of what we as individuals can do. And what we can do is, obviously: cook. Cook in informed, ambitious ways that link us to the ground, to plants and animals and microbes, to farmers and other producers, and to the people in our lives for whom we cook. This book is part of the antidote to the problems laid out in Omnivore’s Dilemma and In Defense of Food. It's structured “by element,” wherein Pollan discusses cooking with fire (such as in the barbecue pits of North Carolina), water (braises and pot-cooking), air (with bread-masters from all over) and earth (fermentation.) Fair warning: you find yourself fairly deep in the weeds of the chemical processes of the latter two topics – as other reviewers before me have found, these chapters are slower to get through than the first half.Cooked veers toward personal anecdotes, nutrition, chemistry, social history, mythology, and even psychology as necessary. Pollan delivers every discussion with the deftness and humility we expect from him. The writing’s great, the subjects are varied, and the tone is encouraging. Four solid stars."
145,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1706153-meghan,5,"Months after finishing this, I feel obligated to bump it up to 5 stars. The Pollanesqe pedantic tone that starts this book off is the only reason that my initial grade was a 4.5 for me, but even that can be kind of endearing... I very regularly felt like I was reading a book by my dad. However, each chapter drew me into a very dreamy, delighted state of reading. I love the path that weaves through research and literature, mixed with Pollan's interactions with fascinating expert cooks as well as his own cooking adventures. I was surprised, inspired, and impressed constantly. This is one book that I'm very happy to own, because even before I finished it I was tempted to refer back to previous chapters as a reference for some real life situation or another. It prompted me to talk about food with people a lot more, and I definitely feel inspired to branch out of my cooking comfort zone. For anyone why might appreciate some background or perspective on the practice of cooking, this is a fabulous choice.I was reading Ecotopia at the same time, a novel that complemented this one very well. Aaaand up next: Moyasimon: Tales of Agriculture, Volume 2, the world of microbes! ""Everything is everywhere."""
146,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4504899-becki-iverson,5,"As always, Michael Pollan's new book ""Cooked"" is an impeccably researched, beautifully written and hands-on journey through the four foundational methods of cooking. Stylistically, it is essentially a mash-up of the styles of his previous books into a snazzy new package - the four pillars of ""Botany of Desire,"" the hands on creation and eating in ""Omnivore's Dilemma,"" and the modern food science vs. traditional eats breakdown of ""In Defense of Food."" The result is glorious(although at very rare instances almost too brainy). Pollan is a deceptively excellent writer who is capable of making extraordinarily complex concepts and terms accessible to nearly anyone; thus, it is easy to forgive him when he goes a bit awry. I would have liked just a little more description of the work Pollan was doing himself on the cooking; more in depth interviews/apprenticeships, or more recipes. But either way, it's been a while since his last book, and it's good to see Pollan in print again."
147,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1386971-marieke,4,"I really enjoyed this. I have officially abandoned my Michael Pollan hater stance. I misunderstood him. I might even give Botany of Desire another chance.Now I will ramble:I'm a little jealous that he gets to write these glorified stunt books that are so appealingly nerdy.Now I'm going to start my starter...it's time to take my bread baking to the next level...I don't think I'll be roasting any whole pigs, though. However, listening to that part of the book did take me down memory lane to summer camp as a kid. Every summer we did ""Ham in a Pit,"" and we had to take turns in pairs overnight to keep watch. I don't remember what I actually thought of the resulting food, though. One last thought: germ is my copilot...this book made me really consider dirtiness and how we seem to be really screwing ourselves over. Oh well, we are evolutionary creatures and somehow we will adapt."
148,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2675284-mollie,4,"I finished listening to the audiobook yesterday and have been considering how to review it. I liked the author's way of encouraging the reader to establish a relationship with food based on ""meaning."" As well as his invitation to ""join the makers of the world.""I admired the breadth of his investigation, his knowledge base.The author reads the book. His inflections added meaning, deepened my relationship with the subject matter. Sometimes his calming voice induced drowsiness; after all, the book does not have a rousing plot.But today, I notice that I miss his soothing voice speaking to me of a recently discovered detail of food preparation. It is as if I now set one less place at my table."
149,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6236139-michael-jones,4,"This was one of those books where at many points I wished I could be the author! To sample the barbecue in the South, or cheeses in France--oooh!The author uses stories to tell you how he learned about different kinds of foods and their origins. Actually very informative if you want to learn about whole foods and there is much science here. But the sciences in the context of relationships with real people who understand these foods. He hits most of the major types of food that we consume.This book would be an important read for someone who is basically only eating a standard American diet (SAD). It will open your eyes to new food horizons and could help you understand why eating real food makes you much happier and healthier."
150,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50262924-dr-tobias-christian-fischer,4,"Cooking stands for healthy, natural and energy-efficient food intake. Our ancestors started cooking at some point because the addition of heat allowed them to get a lot more nutrients from a lot more natural foods. Unfortunately, we have moved further and further away from it since the global boom in convenience foods. The following still applies today: Those who cook at home with natural ingredients are by far the healthiest (Blinkist, 2020)."
151,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53971695-stijn-zanders,5,"A book that inspires, Pollan writes the book around the idea that cooking is much more than just preparing food. He does this by diving into the four elements: fire, water, air and earth. Especially the last two parts that go into the baking of sour dough bread and fermentation are invaluable!"
152,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,4,"""In Cooked, Michael Pollan explores the previously uncharted territory of his own kitchen. Here, he discovers the enduring power of the four classical elements—fire, water, air, and earth—to transform the stuff of nature into delicious things to eat and drink. Apprenticing himself to a succession of culinary masters, Pollan learns how to grill with fire, cook with liquid, bake bread, and ferment everything from cheese to beer.The effects of not cooking are similarly far reaching. Relying upon corporations to process our food means we consume large quantities of fat, sugar, and salt; disrupt an essential link to the natural world; and weaken our relationships with family and friends. In fact, Cooked argues, taking back control of cooking may be the single most important step anyone can take to help make the American food system healthier and more sustainable. Reclaiming cooking as an act of enjoyment and self-reliance, learning to perform the magic of these everyday transformations, opens the door to a more nourishing life.""I have to say that I appreciate an author who tells me that I am being subversive or rebellious if I cook. It’s one of the few forms of rebelliousness to which I wholeheartedly subscribe. Having read Salt Sugar Fat by Michael Moss last year, I been working diligently at eliminating processed foods from my diet—easier said than done! Especially when one is also attempting to go gluten-free. I have many happy memories of cooking on the farm where I grew up. We knew the cows that provided our milk, the chickens that laid our eggs and the cattle and pigs that provided each evening’s main course. Sometimes Mom would even mention them by name as she served up supper. I have been in quest of a real pork chop for some time now and think I have found a butcher shop that provides a product very, very close to my idealized memories. One of the things which struck me when I moved to the city was the lack of taste in the meat and vegetables purchased from the chain grocery stores. Carrots from a chain store are more like wood than like vegetables and tomatoes are hard and tasteless compared to those we grew in our garden (fertilized with well-aged, long composted animal manure).  The problem, for me at least, is one of time. I love to cook and bake—but I also work full time and enjoy a busy social life. Having read Cooked, I can see that I will start attempting to schedule more cooking time into my life—in the past, I have whiled away many happy hours stirring soup pots, checking on oven contents and poking at dough. It’s time to return that gentle form of rebellion to my life on a regular basis."

As someone who cooks 90% of her meals from scratch this had my interest from the first chapter but I wondered how long it would last. After all, what was going to be ""news"" to me at this point. Well, it turns out...a lot!The book is filled with facts, anecdotes and hands on experiences of the author. Topics covered include real barbequing, braises, bread making and fermentation. I have actually caught myself discussing this book at length with my foodie friends and family. My husband was woken up a few times to hear a paragraph or two that struck a chord with me and I felt the need to discuss or share. He's been patient...but I wonder if it was so I could create the recipes at the back of the book.

Michael Pollan is one of my favorite food writers and I always enjoy his books, this one as well. However, this was a little too in depth for me.Michael explores the four realms of cooking in this book, Fire, Water, Air and Earth. For Fire, he uses whole hog barbeque. For Water, he explores braising. For air, his example is baking bread. For Earth he uses fermentation. Basically, he breaks all of these cooking methods down to the smallest elements and builds on it.My final thought on this book is that it was interesting, but if your not really into cooking/food then this book may be too much for you."
155,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1063843-sarah-hauck,4,"In his latest book, Cooked, Michael Pollan serves up another bestseller that looks at the relationships between us and the food we eat. Struck by the realization that “the less cooking we were doing in our own lives, the more that food and its vicarious preparation transfixed us,” Pollan sets out to explore the art of cooking for himself.Cooked reads like a how-to book for the uninitiated in the kitchen while still providing plenty of more detailed analysis for seasoned cooks. Divided into chapters based on the four classical elements – Earth, Water, Air and Fire – Pollan personally explores the world of cooking where “the stuff of nature gets transformed into the things we eat and drink.”In each chapter, Pollan learns about a corresponding cooking style: in Fire, he gets grilling lessons from a North Carolina barbecue pit master; in Water, he masters braises; in Air, he experiments with bread baking as he seeks to perfect the perfect sourdough loaf; and finally, in Earth, he explores various types of fermentation including pickling, cheese making and home brewing.Along the way, each of his teachers – from “the cheese nun” with a Ph.D. in microbiology to the “most famous fermentor in America” – is whole-heartedly devoted to his or her craft and, in the end, getting a glimpse into their lives and work is half the fun of the book.I’ve been a Michael Pollan fan since I first cracked the spine of The Botany of Desire more than a decade ago, but even I’ll admit, there are a few points in the narrative where even the most devout reader’s eyes may start to glaze over… like when Pollan gets mired in the details of the “all-important Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis” microbe. But only briefly. Because along with straight-up cool science, he also mixes into his narrative a bit of history, art and literature along with a dash of religion (“bread… is an everyday proof of the possibility of transcendence” and sex for good measure (“a cheese that stinks – of manure, of sex – offers a relatively safe way for us to flirt with forbidden desires”).As in his previous books, Pollan extolls the ills (literally) of processed foods and cautions against our over-reliance on corporations, “whose ‘dead food’ is damaging our health and ‘homogenizing’ our experience.”When asked why we don’t spend more time preparing our own meals, apparently most people claim a lack of time. But Pollan points out that, “in the last decade or so, we’ve all found two hours a day to be on line outside of work.” So what gives?Another entire book could be devoted to answering that question, but Pollan doesn’t take on that job in Cooked. Instead, he argues that we would all do well to start getting reacquainted with our kitchens because “cooking is one of the most interesting and worthwhile things we humans do.”While it may be cheaper and easier to rely on others to provide for our basic needs, “to live that way comes at a price, not least to our sense of competence and independence.” We are so disconnected from the makers of our food, Pollan argues, that we stop thinking about what is actually in the food we eat or where it comes from, much less the labor, money or energy it took to get it onto our plate. Worst of all, we forget that “what presents itself to us in the marketplace as a product is in truth a web of relationships between people… and all the other species on which we still depend.” (Yes, even bacteria.)In the end, Cooked turns out to be a commentary on the way we live. It’s true, as in his past books, that Pollan is critical of capitalism, and in particular consumerism, as the downfall of democracy and independence in its most literal sense. The antidote (or part of it, anyway) that he offers up here is cooking. To cook, he says, is to reclaim a bit of independence, and perhaps a bit of pride as well. It’s what separates us from the rest of the natural world and, paradoxically, also what keeps us connected to it.It is also an invitation to modern society (that’s you and me) to reconnect with the world. It’s true that few of us have the luxury of spending hours in the kitchen making all of our meals from scratch, but even small culinary contributions help us to reconnect with the natural world around us. As Pollan himself admits, “The most important thing I learned … is how cooking implicates us in a whole web of social and ecological relationships: with plants and animals, with the soil, with farmers, with the microbes both inside and outside our bodies, and, of course, with the people our cooking nourishes and delights.” And he invites us “to alter, however slightly, the ratio between production and consumption” in our lives.This, he believes, can make a difference. After trying his hand at home brewing, Pollan says, “The beer in that bottle, I’m reminded as soon as I brew it myself, ultimately comes not from a factory, but from nature – from a field of barley snapping in the wind, from a hops vine clambering over a trellis, from a host of invisible microbes feasting on sugars.”So, if preparing our own home-cooked meals makes us think just a little bit more about the world around us and how, ultimately, we all depend on one another to survive, then certainly a little time with a knife and cutting board won’t hurt anyone.For novices in the kitchen – or first-time Pollan readers – Cooked is sure to whet your appetite. For the rest of us, it is the continuation of an ongoing commentary on food, nature and modern society that will not fail to satisfy."
156,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10987540-ben,3,"It's difficult to rate a book which was very enjoyable to read, but fraught with quirks of Pollan's writing style and ideology. I'll write this review as a ""compliment sandwich."" To begin: The chapters on Barbeque (Fire) and Bread (Air) were particularly strong and interesting. I enjoyed the attention he gave to food research at UC Davis, and was glad to see him visit some interesting operations in Yolo County.That being said...Pollan went on several rants only tenuously connected to his topics. Notably, his nostalgia for an agrarian/culinary past that, to use the phrase of Jello Biafra ""never existed."" Pollan seems oblivious to his own level of wealth and privelege. He emphasizes that he braises ""cheap"" pieces of meat. Has he compared the price of a brisket to chicken? bologna? a can of beans? He spends days at a time on breads, insisting that he can ""get writing done"" in between turns and rises. Not everyone is a freelance writer, buddy. Try making a braise and two sourdoughs a week working 9-5.My final criticism is his love of ""artisans"" while scoffing at anything remotely automated. The problem is that for artisans (of food and everything else) it's a labor of love. An independent baker selling high-end sourdough might be carrying on a food tradition or whatever, but the forklift operator, truck driver, QC specialist, etc. at the Wonder-bread plant he's so quick to dismiss have mentally and physically demanding jobs, with some security, benefits, and disposable income that the starving artist-baker lacks. Does Pollan really envision a bucolic future of nothing but cottage industries? Who would have the income to buy his books?The joke's on him, I took it out of the library.In conclusion- Pollan is an entertaining and gripping writer who has sought out some very interesting characters in the American foodscape. Parts of this book rehash ""Omnivore's Dilema,"" but hey. What can you do? If this were a bad book, I wouldn't have finished it. It's honestly good writing, somewhat choppy, and somewhat obsessive about certain details (raising dough) while ignoring others (Pollan's wealth, and location in the foodie Island of the Bay Area.)"
157,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/867628-catherine,3,"Where has our love gone, Michael? This is the fourth of your books that I've read, which is somewhat fitting, considering your obsession with that number. Second Nature: four seasons, Omnivore's Dilemma: four meals, Botany of Desire: four plants, and with this book four methods of food preparation. I was really excited about a new book from you, as I really enjoyed those three earlier books, despite your tendency to ramble and repeat. When an acquaintance told me how much she enjoyed this book (her first experience with you), I quickly recommended the others and offered to swap her OD for this one. And yet...somehow I just can't get into it. Maybe it's that you're again preaching your slow food message and I've already joined the choir. Maybe it's the current heat wave that makes the subject of cooking less appealing. Maybe it's my stack of novels and lighter non-fiction driving me to distraction. Whatever the cause(s), I'm going to return this copy to the owner (since I've had it for three or four weeks already) and track down a library copy later when cooking and, let's be honest...you, Michael, sound more appealing.Update: it took me almost 7 years, but I finally finished this book! This time, I started with the section on yeast breads, focusing on sourdough. I've experimented with sourdough a couple times since reading Sourdough (and started a new one after finishing the book), so I had more connection to Pollan's experiences than the previous sections. The final section, in which he discusses fermentation (of vegetables, cheese, and alcohol) was also really interesting, especially the American-born nun making traditional cheese in a French convent. For me, the second half of the book was much stronger. "
158,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793094-lisa,5,"Michael Pollan has written another book about food; this time he researches the history of cooking. He focuses on cooking using the classic elements of fire, water, air, and earth.The section on fire focuses almost exclusively on smoking pork, which is something I enjoy doing. For those of you that have never enjoyed barbeque or smoking, you might not connect with this section like I did. Smoked pork (and chicken) is so good, it is worth the effort to try to perfect your efforts! Take a look at my video on smoking Boston Butts: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U2--A...I have videos on smoking chicken, salmon filets, and ribs; smoked food is so good and it is fun to connect with nature to prepare food!In the section on cooking with water, Pollan uses a pot to slow cook various delicious dishes. He talked about the time and effort to cook slowly on the stovetop. I had to wonder why he didn't even try using a crockpot or slow cooker! Nonetheless, all of the food sounded really good!The section on air focused on making bread and I almost wanted to make a loaf myself, but then I remembered how addictive bread out of the oven tastes! It was very interesting!Lastly, Pollan focused on ""earth"" as an element of cooking. Any guess what that could be? I never would have guessed, but it is fermentation. This was my least favorite section because I don't drink, but it was interesting to listen to how Pollan made his own beer. There are many health benefits to eating foods like yogurt that use something like fermentation to grow the cultures. While I eat yogurt every day, I am too much of a wimp to eat the other foods Pollan highlighted.Of course, Pollan could not resist discussing how many people no longer cook--or they heat prepared food and call that cooking. I found all of that fascinating because I do not buy many prepared foods; however, I buy more than I thought!I listened to this audiobook while gardening and loved it! "
159,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,4,"“I found that, much like gardening, most cooking manages to be agreeably absorbing without being too demanding intellectually. It leaves plenty of mental space for daydreaming and reflection.” ― Michael Pollan, Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation In Cooked Michael Pollan stays close to his food roots. Similar in theme to: Omnivore's Dilema (Four Meals), In Defense of Food (Food Manifesto), Botany of Desire (Four Plants), Food Rules (Owner's Manual for Food), and Second Nature (Growing Food).Cooked is just another branch on the Phylogenetic food tree for the Pollan's Omnivore, me thinks. Unless, of course, Pollan is going to delve into the proper way to digest, poop, or compost your waste. And... he might just. I am neither a Pollan lover or hater. I've read a bunch of his stuff because it is fast and rather tasty. The problem with Pollan is reading too much of him. His books are a bit full of roughage and eventually too much of his raw idealism or fiber-rich localism gets to you. I think that is the problem with idealists and their genius (genus?). No one can quite live upto the expectations. There just isn't that many locally grown mushrooms, or farmer's markets, or grass-fed organic beef. But education about farming, feasting, and cooking gives us a better sense of both the idea and the real. As long as we are aware of the costs of the way we eat and the way we cook, we are better than we started. The probelm comes in when we believe ALL the hype. As long as you can remain pragmatic about food and Pollan, reading him is a good thing."

If there ever was a more tedious and odious exercise in navel gazing, I'd be impressed.I must confess I am baffled by this book. Who is the audience? Is it local foodies who are already converted? In which case, why on earth must the author keep telling us again and again and again how awesome cooking is? We get it, we're the choir, quit your preaching.Or perhaps the audience is the mass produced shrink-wrap microwave toting loner. In which case, hearing someone pontificate on and on and on about the joys of combining heat with edible things is also pointlessly preachy, and Mr Pollan does an abysmal sales job here.The problem is that Mr Pollan has completely and totally run out of things to say. As a result, this book is basically reworking the same sentence over and over again using different combinations of words. So to save the hapless potential victim from having to wade through a few hundred pages of tedium, I'd suggest instead spending the next hour rearranging any subset of these words into as many variations as you can:Heavenly, nature, cooking, is, god, primitive man, plants, aroma, animal sacrifice, producesHour over? You're welcome, I just saved you many more hours of your precious time. You can spend the remaining 5-6 you have left over from not reading this book staring blankly into space, it'll be more meaningful and more likely to result in food related insights."

That how to make bolonaise was a revelation to the author was more telling of him than other informational bits. I have a friend whose husband doesn't know how to turn on his oven. That said, I agree 100 percent with the author about the practice of making meals as being healthy and a good practice. I think he is a fine author and I look forward to his next book.

It was an enjoyable way to think about the complexity of a task which we used to do daily, but in which industrial societies have been eschewing."

So, when this book was published, I really looked forward to reading it. I love his ability to take the science and technical aspects of food and nutrition and make them fascinating.I thought that it was quite appropriate that I read this book during a holiday centered around cooking and eating: Thanksgiving. I love cooking for our family, and I try hard to share that love with our girls, teaching them the simple concepts that I know and showing them how easy it is for a parent who works out of the home to prepare a home-cooked meal using little to no prepared foods. This book really shows the genesis of human cooking and the emotional and primal urges behind what and how we cook. In four different parts (fire, water, air, and earth), he describes different ways we engage with food. I'm not sure what happened - I read the first three parts in the span of just one day, but then I was overwhelmed with other books that I needed to read (for my book club or because they were coming due), and this book was pushed to the side for over a month. Finally, I decided I needed to finish it (I'm sure it's coming due soon!) and I tackled the fourth part in one day. So, while it looks like I took my sweet time, I just had a big break in between.interesting quotes:""Once cooking allowed us to expand our cognitive capacity at the expense of our digestive capacity, there was no going back: Our big brains and tiny guts now depended on a diet of cooked food.""

166,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65459284-paul,4,How is Brandon Sanderson considered a better writer by reviews than Michael Pollan?
167,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8561-yune,4,"Pollan has an easy, friendly, and persuasive writing style that managed to draw me away from another book I'd pre-ordered in two formats when Cooked happened to show up on the library hold shelf on the other book's release date.He's best when he's describing his own experiences or describing micro-science to a layman; I found him a little less convincing and slightly on the side of pretentious when he indulged in wide-scale anthropological musings or symbolism along the lines of the four elements he uses to organize this book: fire (barbecue), water (braises), air (bread), and earth (fermented foods, like sauerkraut and beer). I would've been totally fine with section headings with the food name.I was actually surprised to discover that he wasn't already an expert cook; one of his previous books, The Omnivore's Dilemma, had so incisively made the case for eating in a wholesome manner that I'd assumed he had mastered this skill. But this book is the story of his education in various culinary arenas, and as he manages gain tutelage under acclaimed pit masters and bakers, he--and I--became engrossed in his teachers' personal stories and the philosophies that brought them to the mastery of their crafts. (Or the philosophies that developed because of those crafts.)Thus you meet such interesting folks as the ""cheese nun,"" who managed to get the state health inspector to stand down in an otherwise shrill war about raw milk...by a scientific experiment:A nun's habit and a Ph.D. in microbiology--the abbey sent her to the University of Connecticut so that she might better be able to defend her cheese, both from pathogens and from public health authorities--are an unbeatable combination, and, so far at least, the FDA has thought better than to mess with Sister Noëlla, even as the agency has come down hard on many other raw-milk cheese makers.This lovely sly humor is on display several times, often parenthetically, such as when he describes a 300-year-old fermentation pit:The breadfruit in it had been reduced to a sour mush, but it was reported to be ""still in edible condition."" (You first.)It was interesting how each type of training received different treatment in Pollan's words. The whole pig barbecue ended up making me think more about the sweaty insanity of the chopping block afterward, while trying to feed thousands of hungry people; the year of weekly braising lessons felt prosaic, free of any sudden revelations, although Pollan admits to using what he learned here the most frequently afterward. His description of the bread-making process was utterly engrossing to me (a non-baker from a rice-centric culture), from how he coaxed the starter yeast to the shaping of the dough. His satisfaction rose almost palpably off the bread as he broke the crust of his efforts.And although he dips into scientific explanations whenever he sees fit, pointing out the chemical processes behind caramelization or the nutrients that separate whole wheat flour from white, he delves most deeply into the question of human interaction with internal bacteria: the gut microflora that actually does a lot of the work in keeping us healthy, and how hyper-sanitized environments and antibiotics can devastate this balance. Mary Roach also devotes some time to this in Gulp, and I anticipate a popular science book on the subject soon. Pollan himself doesn't subscribe to the ""kombucha will cure AIDS!"" line of ""let the bacteria grow wild and free!"" thinking, but he does make a strong case for eating less sterile food.Note: To his credit, Pollan does acknowledge head-on the gender imbalance that tends to accompany kitchen duties, without letting the discussion devour the book. In general I found him to be cognizant of the larger issues lying behind his personal quest, whether it be food industry lobbying power or cultural values, but touching upon them only gently.Quite a satisfying read, although I think it's best viewed more along memoirish lines than the sort of societal revolution hinted at in The Omnivore's Dilemma. And the ending was more powerful than those of many novels I've read."
168,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1020899-patty,3,"“Cooking is all about connection, I've learned, between us and other species, other times, other cultures (human and microbial both), but, most important, other people. Cooking is one of the more beautiful forms that human generosity takes; that much I sort of knew. But the very best cooking, I discovered, is also a form of intimacy.”This is the third book that I have read by Pollan. He started by writing about gardening and naturally moved on to food and cooking. I started with The Omnivore’s Dilemma and skipped the gardening books. (I really should go back to those – I like reading about gardening even though I don’t like gardening much.) All three of these books about food have been interesting and enlightening.When I did my review for The Omnivore’s Dilemma, I wrote, “For me this is what makes a good read. I get immersed in the book; I learn new things and for at least some of the time I am thinking about the book and author even when I am not reading the book.” That was true for this book as well. I listened to this and since it took more than thirteen hours, it was with me for a long time. I enjoyed thinking through Pollan’s theories about how the four elements reflect the four ways of cooking and meeting several chefs, bakers, cheesmakers and brewers. I will look at cooking a bit differently because of this book."
169,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/619524-jaysi,3,3.5 stars and only because I hold Pollen to a higher standard and liked his other books more. 
170,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/427611-karen-a,5,"This book has made me rethink many aspects of cooking. Especially how I cook. It is divided into 4 parts, fire, water, air, and earth all corresponding to specific methods of cooking. The fire portion was probably my least favorite and has made it even less likely that I will take up roasting a pig. And some of his comments about the pork industry, though brief, have made me pass up the pork section altogether at the grocery store. Enlightening are his observations about how we perceive the time it takes to cook and based on our perception that it is laborious and time consuming we have surrendered our meal preparation duties to large industry, an industry that has neither health nor quality at the core of its interests. And he counters that quick meal preparation is not so quick and the time it took him and his family to defrost and cook frozen meals he could easily have made a braise. Pollan also reveals what goes into a loaf of bread and how the baker’s pursuit of a light loaf full of air has caused a whole wheat industry to subvert the nutrition of the grain. My favorite part of this book however is the fourth and final part – earth which he dedicates to the art of fermenting. The whole concept of food decaying and then being turned into something not only particular to region and culture but actually good for the human gut is very intriguing and he does a great job of exploring what is going on with this process on a micro level. Also included in the portion of the book is cheese making. His works with the nun, Sister Noella, who makes cheese the old fashion way in large oak barrels contrary to FDA regulations and contrary to our own ideas of what will make the safest product to eat. But Sister Noella has done her homework (doctorate in microbiology) and can prove that the oak barrels produce a more stable product than the steel barrels used by the rest of the industry. While I wish Pollan would have put some of the same time and effort into the cheese portion of the book that he did for the pork roasting, he does do just enough where one will want to know more. In fact I think most of the book does and excellent job of whetting the appetite so to speak for a real discussion about our notions of convenience, health, taste, and how we cook. I really hope this fans the small flames for the trend to cook at home. It really is better in every way. "

Have I changed, or has he?This book had some good content, but Pollan's writing really got in the way. It read like the writing of someone who has gotten a little overconfident in the value of their interests and opinions to others, someone who loves their own writing a little too much, someone who was perhaps reluctant to seek the editing help they really needed.My problems with Pollan's writing are:1) He hammers his points home to the extent of sounding pedantic and condescending. Yes, cooking is the thing that separates us humans from animals, I get it. Now you're telling it to me another twenty times in twenty not-different-enough ways?2) Indulgent digression - between this and point #2, the book could have been cut down by about 100 pages into a much stronger, poignant book.3) Overwrought sentences and flimsy connections drawn between food and other things. Do the following excerpts not make you want to kind of throw up a little of the beautiful braise you just ate:""...it is the very allusiveness of cooked food that appeals to us, as indeed that same quality does in poetry or music or art. We gravitate toward complexity and metaphor, it seems, and putting fire to meat, or fermenting fruit and grain, gives us both: more sheer sensory information and, specifically, sensory information that, like metaphor, points away from the here and now. This sensory metaphor--this stands for that--is one of the most important transformations of nature wrought by cooking. And so a piece of crisped pigskin becomes a densely allusive poem of flavors...""""Elation, effervescence, elevation, levity, inspiration: air words all, alveolated with vowels, leavening the dough of everyday life.""Ick. And that's only one of several times he ""cleverly"" uses ""leaven."" We get it, Pollan. It's a bread word and you applied it to stuff that isn't bread.Just so tiresome, but I stuck with it because I liked the idea of the book, and some of the content was good. The discussion of bacterial flora did a good job of addressing a new topic in food and health, for example. But this might be the last Pollan book I read."
172,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,3,"I enjoy cooking and eating, but I don't read Michael Pollan's books – this is at least my third – for the food. If so, I would never have finished this. I am a vegetarian, and the first half of Cooked is about barbecue and braising – the smells of cooking pig flesh! – so not my favorite.I read Pollan's books for his curiosity. They are as much or more about the science of cooking and the philosophy of living. You have to be ready to geek out about everything that you come across. You need to be willing to stop and question all sorts of things: nutrition, chemistry, history, politics, gender.What was the single most important thing we could do as a family to improve our health and general well-being? And what would be a good way to better connect to my teenage son?.... Other questions were slightly more political in nature. For years I had been trying to determine (because I am often asked) what is the most important thing an ordinary person can do to help reform the American food system, to make it healthier and more sustainable? Another related question is, how can people living in a highly specialized consumer economy reduce their sense of dependence and achieve a greater degree of self-sufficiency? And then there were the more philosophical questions, the ones I’ve been chewing on since I first started writing books. How, in our everyday lives, can we acquire a deeper understanding of the natural world and our species’ peculiar role in it? (Kindle 96)Pollan goes straight to the horse's mouth to learn about food and cooking. Then he goes to another expert until he begins to work on his own. And he talks about his errors rather than dodging them. For Pollan, mistakes are an opportunity to learn, to understand. He is willing to throw out standard thinking. (Are antibiotics a good thing or not? What about pasteurization?) And, he takes us along for the ride.This is a lovely ride."
173,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14773738-julie,5,"This is another excellent offering by Michael Pollan who, since The Omnivore's Dilemma has become my favourite go-to person in all things food related. Admittedly, this was slightly less interesting to me than Pollan's Dilemma, but only because I've already experienced all the joys of being Cooked -- pun intended. For all those who have yet to experience the transformative power of being the master/mistress of one's own hearth, this is a must read. Twice.This is not a recipe book -- far from it, albeit Pollan does throw in a few handy recipes at the very end, based on the four elements he explores: fire, water, air and earth; in essence, the touchstone elements of our universe, and our humanity. This is more a book on the nature of cooking: the whys and wherefores of throwing that first chunk of meat over burning coals, and then of maybe tossing in a tuber or two for good measure. With this simple action, we defined our humanity, Pollan postulates, and it is this that made us stand taller than the apes, once and for all.He also dabbles in the mysticism of cooking, the art of alchemical transformation of both the eaten, and the eater. It is a magical read -- and unlike Pollan's Dilemma which left me never wanting to eat (industrial) food ever again, this book left me ravenous. It is an exceptional testament to why we should all engage in the action of feeding ourselves -- quite literally. The action of going to the market and buying packaged and frozen food-like substances is not cooking, and offers absolutely nothing to our nutritional intake, either chemically or spiritually, Pollan offers. Rather, we need to be closer than arm's length from the veggies and the meats we slide down our gullets: we need to understand how much nourishment actually lies in the act of preparation. Full stars."
174,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19059096-jill,4,"Usually I read Michael Pollan to feel distressed (but not awash), and ashamed (but not hopeless). But Cooked is Pollan at his most optimistic. While conscientious as always, he sets out in this book not to acquaint us with the grim facts of our world and its consumers’ decisions; rather, he illustrates the wonders of what we as individuals can do. And what we can do is, obviously: cook. Cook in informed, ambitious ways that link us to the ground, to plants and animals and microbes, to farmers and other producers, and to the people in our lives for whom we cook. This book is part of the antidote to the problems laid out in Omnivore’s Dilemma and In Defense of Food. It's structured “by element,” wherein Pollan discusses cooking with fire (such as in the barbecue pits of North Carolina), water (braises and pot-cooking), air (with bread-masters from all over) and earth (fermentation.) Fair warning: you find yourself fairly deep in the weeds of the chemical processes of the latter two topics – as other reviewers before me have found, these chapters are slower to get through than the first half.Cooked veers toward personal anecdotes, nutrition, chemistry, social history, mythology, and even psychology as necessary. Pollan delivers every discussion with the deftness and humility we expect from him. The writing’s great, the subjects are varied, and the tone is encouraging. Four solid stars."
175,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1706153-meghan,5,"Months after finishing this, I feel obligated to bump it up to 5 stars. The Pollanesqe pedantic tone that starts this book off is the only reason that my initial grade was a 4.5 for me, but even that can be kind of endearing... I very regularly felt like I was reading a book by my dad. However, each chapter drew me into a very dreamy, delighted state of reading. I love the path that weaves through research and literature, mixed with Pollan's interactions with fascinating expert cooks as well as his own cooking adventures. I was surprised, inspired, and impressed constantly. This is one book that I'm very happy to own, because even before I finished it I was tempted to refer back to previous chapters as a reference for some real life situation or another. It prompted me to talk about food with people a lot more, and I definitely feel inspired to branch out of my cooking comfort zone. For anyone why might appreciate some background or perspective on the practice of cooking, this is a fabulous choice.I was reading Ecotopia at the same time, a novel that complemented this one very well. Aaaand up next: Moyasimon: Tales of Agriculture, Volume 2, the world of microbes! ""Everything is everywhere."""
176,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4504899-becki-iverson,5,"As always, Michael Pollan's new book ""Cooked"" is an impeccably researched, beautifully written and hands-on journey through the four foundational methods of cooking. Stylistically, it is essentially a mash-up of the styles of his previous books into a snazzy new package - the four pillars of ""Botany of Desire,"" the hands on creation and eating in ""Omnivore's Dilemma,"" and the modern food science vs. traditional eats breakdown of ""In Defense of Food."" The result is glorious(although at very rare instances almost too brainy). Pollan is a deceptively excellent writer who is capable of making extraordinarily complex concepts and terms accessible to nearly anyone; thus, it is easy to forgive him when he goes a bit awry. I would have liked just a little more description of the work Pollan was doing himself on the cooking; more in depth interviews/apprenticeships, or more recipes. But either way, it's been a while since his last book, and it's good to see Pollan in print again."
177,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1386971-marieke,4,"I really enjoyed this. I have officially abandoned my Michael Pollan hater stance. I misunderstood him. I might even give Botany of Desire another chance.Now I will ramble:I'm a little jealous that he gets to write these glorified stunt books that are so appealingly nerdy.Now I'm going to start my starter...it's time to take my bread baking to the next level...I don't think I'll be roasting any whole pigs, though. However, listening to that part of the book did take me down memory lane to summer camp as a kid. Every summer we did ""Ham in a Pit,"" and we had to take turns in pairs overnight to keep watch. I don't remember what I actually thought of the resulting food, though. One last thought: germ is my copilot...this book made me really consider dirtiness and how we seem to be really screwing ourselves over. Oh well, we are evolutionary creatures and somehow we will adapt."
178,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2675284-mollie,4,"I finished listening to the audiobook yesterday and have been considering how to review it. I liked the author's way of encouraging the reader to establish a relationship with food based on ""meaning."" As well as his invitation to ""join the makers of the world.""I admired the breadth of his investigation, his knowledge base.The author reads the book. His inflections added meaning, deepened my relationship with the subject matter. Sometimes his calming voice induced drowsiness; after all, the book does not have a rousing plot.But today, I notice that I miss his soothing voice speaking to me of a recently discovered detail of food preparation. It is as if I now set one less place at my table."
179,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6236139-michael-jones,4,"This was one of those books where at many points I wished I could be the author! To sample the barbecue in the South, or cheeses in France--oooh!The author uses stories to tell you how he learned about different kinds of foods and their origins. Actually very informative if you want to learn about whole foods and there is much science here. But the sciences in the context of relationships with real people who understand these foods. He hits most of the major types of food that we consume.This book would be an important read for someone who is basically only eating a standard American diet (SAD). It will open your eyes to new food horizons and could help you understand why eating real food makes you much happier and healthier."
180,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50262924-dr-tobias-christian-fischer,4,"Cooking stands for healthy, natural and energy-efficient food intake. Our ancestors started cooking at some point because the addition of heat allowed them to get a lot more nutrients from a lot more natural foods. Unfortunately, we have moved further and further away from it since the global boom in convenience foods. The following still applies today: Those who cook at home with natural ingredients are by far the healthiest (Blinkist, 2020)."
181,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53971695-stijn-zanders,5,"A book that inspires, Pollan writes the book around the idea that cooking is much more than just preparing food. He does this by diving into the four elements: fire, water, air and earth. Especially the last two parts that go into the baking of sour dough bread and fermentation are invaluable!"
182,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,4,"""In Cooked, Michael Pollan explores the previously uncharted territory of his own kitchen. Here, he discovers the enduring power of the four classical elements—fire, water, air, and earth—to transform the stuff of nature into delicious things to eat and drink. Apprenticing himself to a succession of culinary masters, Pollan learns how to grill with fire, cook with liquid, bake bread, and ferment everything from cheese to beer.The effects of not cooking are similarly far reaching. Relying upon corporations to process our food means we consume large quantities of fat, sugar, and salt; disrupt an essential link to the natural world; and weaken our relationships with family and friends. In fact, Cooked argues, taking back control of cooking may be the single most important step anyone can take to help make the American food system healthier and more sustainable. Reclaiming cooking as an act of enjoyment and self-reliance, learning to perform the magic of these everyday transformations, opens the door to a more nourishing life.""I have to say that I appreciate an author who tells me that I am being subversive or rebellious if I cook. It’s one of the few forms of rebelliousness to which I wholeheartedly subscribe. Having read Salt Sugar Fat by Michael Moss last year, I been working diligently at eliminating processed foods from my diet—easier said than done! Especially when one is also attempting to go gluten-free. I have many happy memories of cooking on the farm where I grew up. We knew the cows that provided our milk, the chickens that laid our eggs and the cattle and pigs that provided each evening’s main course. Sometimes Mom would even mention them by name as she served up supper. I have been in quest of a real pork chop for some time now and think I have found a butcher shop that provides a product very, very close to my idealized memories. One of the things which struck me when I moved to the city was the lack of taste in the meat and vegetables purchased from the chain grocery stores. Carrots from a chain store are more like wood than like vegetables and tomatoes are hard and tasteless compared to those we grew in our garden (fertilized with well-aged, long composted animal manure).  The problem, for me at least, is one of time. I love to cook and bake—but I also work full time and enjoy a busy social life. Having read Cooked, I can see that I will start attempting to schedule more cooking time into my life—in the past, I have whiled away many happy hours stirring soup pots, checking on oven contents and poking at dough. It’s time to return that gentle form of rebellion to my life on a regular basis."
183,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7424302-sharlene,4,"This book was received as the result of a Good read giveaway.This was not my average book...but how could I not want to read this as it was about my favourite subject...Food!Pollan covers the four ways of cooking covering fire, water, air and earth, something I had never really thought about before. As someone who cooks 90% of her meals from scratch this had my interest from the first chapter but I wondered how long it would last. After all, what was going to be ""news"" to me at this point. Well, it turns out...a lot!The book is filled with facts, anecdotes and hands on experiences of the author. Topics covered include real barbequing, braises, bread making and fermentation. I have actually caught myself discussing this book at length with my foodie friends and family. My husband was woken up a few times to hear a paragraph or two that struck a chord with me and I felt the need to discuss or share. He's been patient...but I wonder if it was so I could create the recipes at the back of the book. I will be on the lookout for a crock for some sauerkraut...my hubby's parents make this but now I have a stronger urge to try it out.Interesting, intellectual and inspiring! Well written and well documented.On a final note...it was peanut free so it's safe for everyone. ;)"
184,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8986610-chris,3,"This was a good book if you're interested in the anatomy of cooking. Michael Pollan is one of my favorite food writers and I always enjoy his books, this one as well. However, this was a little too in depth for me.Michael explores the four realms of cooking in this book, Fire, Water, Air and Earth. For Fire, he uses whole hog barbeque. For Water, he explores braising. For air, his example is baking bread. For Earth he uses fermentation. Basically, he breaks all of these cooking methods down to the smallest elements and builds on it.My final thought on this book is that it was interesting, but if your not really into cooking/food then this book may be too much for you."
185,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1063843-sarah-hauck,4,"In his latest book, Cooked, Michael Pollan serves up another bestseller that looks at the relationships between us and the food we eat. Struck by the realization that “the less cooking we were doing in our own lives, the more that food and its vicarious preparation transfixed us,” Pollan sets out to explore the art of cooking for himself.Cooked reads like a how-to book for the uninitiated in the kitchen while still providing plenty of more detailed analysis for seasoned cooks. Divided into chapters based on the four classical elements – Earth, Water, Air and Fire – Pollan personally explores the world of cooking where “the stuff of nature gets transformed into the things we eat and drink.”In each chapter, Pollan learns about a corresponding cooking style: in Fire, he gets grilling lessons from a North Carolina barbecue pit master; in Water, he masters braises; in Air, he experiments with bread baking as he seeks to perfect the perfect sourdough loaf; and finally, in Earth, he explores various types of fermentation including pickling, cheese making and home brewing.Along the way, each of his teachers – from “the cheese nun” with a Ph.D. in microbiology to the “most famous fermentor in America” – is whole-heartedly devoted to his or her craft and, in the end, getting a glimpse into their lives and work is half the fun of the book.I’ve been a Michael Pollan fan since I first cracked the spine of The Botany of Desire more than a decade ago, but even I’ll admit, there are a few points in the narrative where even the most devout reader’s eyes may start to glaze over… like when Pollan gets mired in the details of the “all-important Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis” microbe. But only briefly. Because along with straight-up cool science, he also mixes into his narrative a bit of history, art and literature along with a dash of religion (“bread… is an everyday proof of the possibility of transcendence” and sex for good measure (“a cheese that stinks – of manure, of sex – offers a relatively safe way for us to flirt with forbidden desires”).As in his previous books, Pollan extolls the ills (literally) of processed foods and cautions against our over-reliance on corporations, “whose ‘dead food’ is damaging our health and ‘homogenizing’ our experience.”When asked why we don’t spend more time preparing our own meals, apparently most people claim a lack of time. But Pollan points out that, “in the last decade or so, we’ve all found two hours a day to be on line outside of work.” So what gives?Another entire book could be devoted to answering that question, but Pollan doesn’t take on that job in Cooked. Instead, he argues that we would all do well to start getting reacquainted with our kitchens because “cooking is one of the most interesting and worthwhile things we humans do.”While it may be cheaper and easier to rely on others to provide for our basic needs, “to live that way comes at a price, not least to our sense of competence and independence.” We are so disconnected from the makers of our food, Pollan argues, that we stop thinking about what is actually in the food we eat or where it comes from, much less the labor, money or energy it took to get it onto our plate. Worst of all, we forget that “what presents itself to us in the marketplace as a product is in truth a web of relationships between people… and all the other species on which we still depend.” (Yes, even bacteria.)In the end, Cooked turns out to be a commentary on the way we live. It’s true, as in his past books, that Pollan is critical of capitalism, and in particular consumerism, as the downfall of democracy and independence in its most literal sense. The antidote (or part of it, anyway) that he offers up here is cooking. To cook, he says, is to reclaim a bit of independence, and perhaps a bit of pride as well. It’s what separates us from the rest of the natural world and, paradoxically, also what keeps us connected to it.It is also an invitation to modern society (that’s you and me) to reconnect with the world. It’s true that few of us have the luxury of spending hours in the kitchen making all of our meals from scratch, but even small culinary contributions help us to reconnect with the natural world around us. As Pollan himself admits, “The most important thing I learned … is how cooking implicates us in a whole web of social and ecological relationships: with plants and animals, with the soil, with farmers, with the microbes both inside and outside our bodies, and, of course, with the people our cooking nourishes and delights.” And he invites us “to alter, however slightly, the ratio between production and consumption” in our lives.This, he believes, can make a difference. After trying his hand at home brewing, Pollan says, “The beer in that bottle, I’m reminded as soon as I brew it myself, ultimately comes not from a factory, but from nature – from a field of barley snapping in the wind, from a hops vine clambering over a trellis, from a host of invisible microbes feasting on sugars.”So, if preparing our own home-cooked meals makes us think just a little bit more about the world around us and how, ultimately, we all depend on one another to survive, then certainly a little time with a knife and cutting board won’t hurt anyone.For novices in the kitchen – or first-time Pollan readers – Cooked is sure to whet your appetite. For the rest of us, it is the continuation of an ongoing commentary on food, nature and modern society that will not fail to satisfy."
186,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10987540-ben,3,"It's difficult to rate a book which was very enjoyable to read, but fraught with quirks of Pollan's writing style and ideology. I'll write this review as a ""compliment sandwich."" To begin: The chapters on Barbeque (Fire) and Bread (Air) were particularly strong and interesting. I enjoyed the attention he gave to food research at UC Davis, and was glad to see him visit some interesting operations in Yolo County.That being said...Pollan went on several rants only tenuously connected to his topics. Notably, his nostalgia for an agrarian/culinary past that, to use the phrase of Jello Biafra ""never existed."" Pollan seems oblivious to his own level of wealth and privelege. He emphasizes that he braises ""cheap"" pieces of meat. Has he compared the price of a brisket to chicken? bologna? a can of beans? He spends days at a time on breads, insisting that he can ""get writing done"" in between turns and rises. Not everyone is a freelance writer, buddy. Try making a braise and two sourdoughs a week working 9-5.My final criticism is his love of ""artisans"" while scoffing at anything remotely automated. The problem is that for artisans (of food and everything else) it's a labor of love. An independent baker selling high-end sourdough might be carrying on a food tradition or whatever, but the forklift operator, truck driver, QC specialist, etc. at the Wonder-bread plant he's so quick to dismiss have mentally and physically demanding jobs, with some security, benefits, and disposable income that the starving artist-baker lacks. Does Pollan really envision a bucolic future of nothing but cottage industries? Who would have the income to buy his books?The joke's on him, I took it out of the library.In conclusion- Pollan is an entertaining and gripping writer who has sought out some very interesting characters in the American foodscape. Parts of this book rehash ""Omnivore's Dilema,"" but hey. What can you do? If this were a bad book, I wouldn't have finished it. It's honestly good writing, somewhat choppy, and somewhat obsessive about certain details (raising dough) while ignoring others (Pollan's wealth, and location in the foodie Island of the Bay Area.)"
187,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/867628-catherine,3,"Where has our love gone, Michael? This is the fourth of your books that I've read, which is somewhat fitting, considering your obsession with that number. Second Nature: four seasons, Omnivore's Dilemma: four meals, Botany of Desire: four plants, and with this book four methods of food preparation. I was really excited about a new book from you, as I really enjoyed those three earlier books, despite your tendency to ramble and repeat. When an acquaintance told me how much she enjoyed this book (her first experience with you), I quickly recommended the others and offered to swap her OD for this one. And yet...somehow I just can't get into it. Maybe it's that you're again preaching your slow food message and I've already joined the choir. Maybe it's the current heat wave that makes the subject of cooking less appealing. Maybe it's my stack of novels and lighter non-fiction driving me to distraction. Whatever the cause(s), I'm going to return this copy to the owner (since I've had it for three or four weeks already) and track down a library copy later when cooking and, let's be honest...you, Michael, sound more appealing.Update: it took me almost 7 years, but I finally finished this book! This time, I started with the section on yeast breads, focusing on sourdough. I've experimented with sourdough a couple times since reading Sourdough (and started a new one after finishing the book), so I had more connection to Pollan's experiences than the previous sections. The final section, in which he discusses fermentation (of vegetables, cheese, and alcohol) was also really interesting, especially the American-born nun making traditional cheese in a French convent. For me, the second half of the book was much stronger. "
188,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793094-lisa,5,"Michael Pollan has written another book about food; this time he researches the history of cooking. He focuses on cooking using the classic elements of fire, water, air, and earth.The section on fire focuses almost exclusively on smoking pork, which is something I enjoy doing. For those of you that have never enjoyed barbeque or smoking, you might not connect with this section like I did. Smoked pork (and chicken) is so good, it is worth the effort to try to perfect your efforts! Take a look at my video on smoking Boston Butts: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U2--A...I have videos on smoking chicken, salmon filets, and ribs; smoked food is so good and it is fun to connect with nature to prepare food!In the section on cooking with water, Pollan uses a pot to slow cook various delicious dishes. He talked about the time and effort to cook slowly on the stovetop. I had to wonder why he didn't even try using a crockpot or slow cooker! Nonetheless, all of the food sounded really good!The section on air focused on making bread and I almost wanted to make a loaf myself, but then I remembered how addictive bread out of the oven tastes! It was very interesting!Lastly, Pollan focused on ""earth"" as an element of cooking. Any guess what that could be? I never would have guessed, but it is fermentation. This was my least favorite section because I don't drink, but it was interesting to listen to how Pollan made his own beer. There are many health benefits to eating foods like yogurt that use something like fermentation to grow the cultures. While I eat yogurt every day, I am too much of a wimp to eat the other foods Pollan highlighted.Of course, Pollan could not resist discussing how many people no longer cook--or they heat prepared food and call that cooking. I found all of that fascinating because I do not buy many prepared foods; however, I buy more than I thought!I listened to this audiobook while gardening and loved it! "
189,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,4,"“I found that, much like gardening, most cooking manages to be agreeably absorbing without being too demanding intellectually. It leaves plenty of mental space for daydreaming and reflection.” ― Michael Pollan, Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation In Cooked Michael Pollan stays close to his food roots. Similar in theme to: Omnivore's Dilema (Four Meals), In Defense of Food (Food Manifesto), Botany of Desire (Four Plants), Food Rules (Owner's Manual for Food), and Second Nature (Growing Food).Cooked is just another branch on the Phylogenetic food tree for the Pollan's Omnivore, me thinks. Unless, of course, Pollan is going to delve into the proper way to digest, poop, or compost your waste. And... he might just. I am neither a Pollan lover or hater. I've read a bunch of his stuff because it is fast and rather tasty. The problem with Pollan is reading too much of him. His books are a bit full of roughage and eventually too much of his raw idealism or fiber-rich localism gets to you. I think that is the problem with idealists and their genius (genus?). No one can quite live upto the expectations. There just isn't that many locally grown mushrooms, or farmer's markets, or grass-fed organic beef. But education about farming, feasting, and cooking gives us a better sense of both the idea and the real. As long as we are aware of the costs of the way we eat and the way we cook, we are better than we started. The probelm comes in when we believe ALL the hype. As long as you can remain pragmatic about food and Pollan, reading him is a good thing."

If there ever was a more tedious and odious exercise in navel gazing, I'd be impressed.I must confess I am baffled by this book. Who is the audience? Is it local foodies who are already converted? In which case, why on earth must the author keep telling us again and again and again how awesome cooking is? We get it, we're the choir, quit your preaching.Or perhaps the audience is the mass produced shrink-wrap microwave toting loner. In which case, hearing someone pontificate on and on and on about the joys of combining heat with edible things is also pointlessly preachy, and Mr Pollan does an abysmal sales job here.The problem is that Mr Pollan has completely and totally run out of things to say. As a result, this book is basically reworking the same sentence over and over again using different combinations of words. So to save the hapless potential victim from having to wade through a few hundred pages of tedium, I'd suggest instead spending the next hour rearranging any subset of these words into as many variations as you can:Heavenly, nature, cooking, is, god, primitive man, plants, aroma, animal sacrifice, producesHour over? You're welcome, I just saved you many more hours of your precious time. You can spend the remaining 5-6 you have left over from not reading this book staring blankly into space, it'll be more meaningful and more likely to result in food related insights."

I really enjoyed the theme of looking at how we use different elements to cook (fire, water, air, earth). It was an enjoyable way to think about the complexity of a task which we used to do daily, but in which industrial societies have been eschewing."

194,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019021-dolly,5,"I have been a big fan of Michael Pollan's books for many years now. So, when this book was published, I really looked forward to reading it. I love his ability to take the science and technical aspects of food and nutrition and make them fascinating.I thought that it was quite appropriate that I read this book during a holiday centered around cooking and eating: Thanksgiving. I love cooking for our family, and I try hard to share that love with our girls, teaching them the simple concepts that I know and showing them how easy it is for a parent who works out of the home to prepare a home-cooked meal using little to no prepared foods. This book really shows the genesis of human cooking and the emotional and primal urges behind what and how we cook. In four different parts (fire, water, air, and earth), he describes different ways we engage with food. I'm not sure what happened - I read the first three parts in the span of just one day, but then I was overwhelmed with other books that I needed to read (for my book club or because they were coming due), and this book was pushed to the side for over a month. Finally, I decided I needed to finish it (I'm sure it's coming due soon!) and I tackled the fourth part in one day. So, while it looks like I took my sweet time, I just had a big break in between.interesting quotes:""Once cooking allowed us to expand our cognitive capacity at the expense of our digestive capacity, there was no going back: Our big brains and tiny guts now depended on a diet of cooked food.""

Yet another masterpiece by Pollan, Cooked is an anthropological, sociological, ethnographical, and humorous narrative just as engulfing as his others. Whether you are a professional chef or a lover of food, this book makes you hungry...for more. "
196,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65459284-paul,4,How is Brandon Sanderson considered a better writer by reviews than Michael Pollan?
197,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8561-yune,4,"Pollan has an easy, friendly, and persuasive writing style that managed to draw me away from another book I'd pre-ordered in two formats when Cooked happened to show up on the library hold shelf on the other book's release date.He's best when he's describing his own experiences or describing micro-science to a layman; I found him a little less convincing and slightly on the side of pretentious when he indulged in wide-scale anthropological musings or symbolism along the lines of the four elements he uses to organize this book: fire (barbecue), water (braises), air (bread), and earth (fermented foods, like sauerkraut and beer). I would've been totally fine with section headings with the food name.I was actually surprised to discover that he wasn't already an expert cook; one of his previous books, The Omnivore's Dilemma, had so incisively made the case for eating in a wholesome manner that I'd assumed he had mastered this skill. But this book is the story of his education in various culinary arenas, and as he manages gain tutelage under acclaimed pit masters and bakers, he--and I--became engrossed in his teachers' personal stories and the philosophies that brought them to the mastery of their crafts. (Or the philosophies that developed because of those crafts.)Thus you meet such interesting folks as the ""cheese nun,"" who managed to get the state health inspector to stand down in an otherwise shrill war about raw milk...by a scientific experiment:A nun's habit and a Ph.D. in microbiology--the abbey sent her to the University of Connecticut so that she might better be able to defend her cheese, both from pathogens and from public health authorities--are an unbeatable combination, and, so far at least, the FDA has thought better than to mess with Sister Noëlla, even as the agency has come down hard on many other raw-milk cheese makers.This lovely sly humor is on display several times, often parenthetically, such as when he describes a 300-year-old fermentation pit:The breadfruit in it had been reduced to a sour mush, but it was reported to be ""still in edible condition."" (You first.)It was interesting how each type of training received different treatment in Pollan's words. The whole pig barbecue ended up making me think more about the sweaty insanity of the chopping block afterward, while trying to feed thousands of hungry people; the year of weekly braising lessons felt prosaic, free of any sudden revelations, although Pollan admits to using what he learned here the most frequently afterward. His description of the bread-making process was utterly engrossing to me (a non-baker from a rice-centric culture), from how he coaxed the starter yeast to the shaping of the dough. His satisfaction rose almost palpably off the bread as he broke the crust of his efforts.And although he dips into scientific explanations whenever he sees fit, pointing out the chemical processes behind caramelization or the nutrients that separate whole wheat flour from white, he delves most deeply into the question of human interaction with internal bacteria: the gut microflora that actually does a lot of the work in keeping us healthy, and how hyper-sanitized environments and antibiotics can devastate this balance. Mary Roach also devotes some time to this in Gulp, and I anticipate a popular science book on the subject soon. Pollan himself doesn't subscribe to the ""kombucha will cure AIDS!"" line of ""let the bacteria grow wild and free!"" thinking, but he does make a strong case for eating less sterile food.Note: To his credit, Pollan does acknowledge head-on the gender imbalance that tends to accompany kitchen duties, without letting the discussion devour the book. In general I found him to be cognizant of the larger issues lying behind his personal quest, whether it be food industry lobbying power or cultural values, but touching upon them only gently.Quite a satisfying read, although I think it's best viewed more along memoirish lines than the sort of societal revolution hinted at in The Omnivore's Dilemma. And the ending was more powerful than those of many novels I've read."
198,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1020899-patty,3,"“Cooking is all about connection, I've learned, between us and other species, other times, other cultures (human and microbial both), but, most important, other people. Cooking is one of the more beautiful forms that human generosity takes; that much I sort of knew. But the very best cooking, I discovered, is also a form of intimacy.”This is the third book that I have read by Pollan. He started by writing about gardening and naturally moved on to food and cooking. I started with The Omnivore’s Dilemma and skipped the gardening books. (I really should go back to those – I like reading about gardening even though I don’t like gardening much.) All three of these books about food have been interesting and enlightening.When I did my review for The Omnivore’s Dilemma, I wrote, “For me this is what makes a good read. I get immersed in the book; I learn new things and for at least some of the time I am thinking about the book and author even when I am not reading the book.” That was true for this book as well. I listened to this and since it took more than thirteen hours, it was with me for a long time. I enjoyed thinking through Pollan’s theories about how the four elements reflect the four ways of cooking and meeting several chefs, bakers, cheesmakers and brewers. I will look at cooking a bit differently because of this book."
199,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/619524-jaysi,3,3.5 stars and only because I hold Pollen to a higher standard and liked his other books more. 
200,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/427611-karen-a,5,"This book has made me rethink many aspects of cooking. Especially how I cook. It is divided into 4 parts, fire, water, air, and earth all corresponding to specific methods of cooking. The fire portion was probably my least favorite and has made it even less likely that I will take up roasting a pig. And some of his comments about the pork industry, though brief, have made me pass up the pork section altogether at the grocery store. Enlightening are his observations about how we perceive the time it takes to cook and based on our perception that it is laborious and time consuming we have surrendered our meal preparation duties to large industry, an industry that has neither health nor quality at the core of its interests. And he counters that quick meal preparation is not so quick and the time it took him and his family to defrost and cook frozen meals he could easily have made a braise. Pollan also reveals what goes into a loaf of bread and how the baker’s pursuit of a light loaf full of air has caused a whole wheat industry to subvert the nutrition of the grain. My favorite part of this book however is the fourth and final part – earth which he dedicates to the art of fermenting. The whole concept of food decaying and then being turned into something not only particular to region and culture but actually good for the human gut is very intriguing and he does a great job of exploring what is going on with this process on a micro level. Also included in the portion of the book is cheese making. His works with the nun, Sister Noella, who makes cheese the old fashion way in large oak barrels contrary to FDA regulations and contrary to our own ideas of what will make the safest product to eat. But Sister Noella has done her homework (doctorate in microbiology) and can prove that the oak barrels produce a more stable product than the steel barrels used by the rest of the industry. While I wish Pollan would have put some of the same time and effort into the cheese portion of the book that he did for the pork roasting, he does do just enough where one will want to know more. In fact I think most of the book does and excellent job of whetting the appetite so to speak for a real discussion about our notions of convenience, health, taste, and how we cook. I really hope this fans the small flames for the trend to cook at home. It really is better in every way. "
201,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419307-rachel,2,"I thought I liked Michael Pollan's writing. Have I changed, or has he?This book had some good content, but Pollan's writing really got in the way. It read like the writing of someone who has gotten a little overconfident in the value of their interests and opinions to others, someone who loves their own writing a little too much, someone who was perhaps reluctant to seek the editing help they really needed.My problems with Pollan's writing are:1) He hammers his points home to the extent of sounding pedantic and condescending. Yes, cooking is the thing that separates us humans from animals, I get it. Now you're telling it to me another twenty times in twenty not-different-enough ways?2) Indulgent digression - between this and point #2, the book could have been cut down by about 100 pages into a much stronger, poignant book.3) Overwrought sentences and flimsy connections drawn between food and other things. Do the following excerpts not make you want to kind of throw up a little of the beautiful braise you just ate:""...it is the very allusiveness of cooked food that appeals to us, as indeed that same quality does in poetry or music or art. We gravitate toward complexity and metaphor, it seems, and putting fire to meat, or fermenting fruit and grain, gives us both: more sheer sensory information and, specifically, sensory information that, like metaphor, points away from the here and now. This sensory metaphor--this stands for that--is one of the most important transformations of nature wrought by cooking. And so a piece of crisped pigskin becomes a densely allusive poem of flavors...""""Elation, effervescence, elevation, levity, inspiration: air words all, alveolated with vowels, leavening the dough of everyday life.""Ick. And that's only one of several times he ""cleverly"" uses ""leaven."" We get it, Pollan. It's a bread word and you applied it to stuff that isn't bread.Just so tiresome, but I stuck with it because I liked the idea of the book, and some of the content was good. The discussion of bacterial flora did a good job of addressing a new topic in food and health, for example. But this might be the last Pollan book I read."
202,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,3,"I enjoy cooking and eating, but I don't read Michael Pollan's books – this is at least my third – for the food. If so, I would never have finished this. I am a vegetarian, and the first half of Cooked is about barbecue and braising – the smells of cooking pig flesh! – so not my favorite.I read Pollan's books for his curiosity. They are as much or more about the science of cooking and the philosophy of living. You have to be ready to geek out about everything that you come across. You need to be willing to stop and question all sorts of things: nutrition, chemistry, history, politics, gender.What was the single most important thing we could do as a family to improve our health and general well-being? And what would be a good way to better connect to my teenage son?.... Other questions were slightly more political in nature. For years I had been trying to determine (because I am often asked) what is the most important thing an ordinary person can do to help reform the American food system, to make it healthier and more sustainable? Another related question is, how can people living in a highly specialized consumer economy reduce their sense of dependence and achieve a greater degree of self-sufficiency? And then there were the more philosophical questions, the ones I’ve been chewing on since I first started writing books. How, in our everyday lives, can we acquire a deeper understanding of the natural world and our species’ peculiar role in it? (Kindle 96)Pollan goes straight to the horse's mouth to learn about food and cooking. Then he goes to another expert until he begins to work on his own. And he talks about his errors rather than dodging them. For Pollan, mistakes are an opportunity to learn, to understand. He is willing to throw out standard thinking. (Are antibiotics a good thing or not? What about pasteurization?) And, he takes us along for the ride.This is a lovely ride."
203,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14773738-julie,5,"This is another excellent offering by Michael Pollan who, since The Omnivore's Dilemma has become my favourite go-to person in all things food related. Admittedly, this was slightly less interesting to me than Pollan's Dilemma, but only because I've already experienced all the joys of being Cooked -- pun intended. For all those who have yet to experience the transformative power of being the master/mistress of one's own hearth, this is a must read. Twice.This is not a recipe book -- far from it, albeit Pollan does throw in a few handy recipes at the very end, based on the four elements he explores: fire, water, air and earth; in essence, the touchstone elements of our universe, and our humanity. This is more a book on the nature of cooking: the whys and wherefores of throwing that first chunk of meat over burning coals, and then of maybe tossing in a tuber or two for good measure. With this simple action, we defined our humanity, Pollan postulates, and it is this that made us stand taller than the apes, once and for all.He also dabbles in the mysticism of cooking, the art of alchemical transformation of both the eaten, and the eater. It is a magical read -- and unlike Pollan's Dilemma which left me never wanting to eat (industrial) food ever again, this book left me ravenous. It is an exceptional testament to why we should all engage in the action of feeding ourselves -- quite literally. The action of going to the market and buying packaged and frozen food-like substances is not cooking, and offers absolutely nothing to our nutritional intake, either chemically or spiritually, Pollan offers. Rather, we need to be closer than arm's length from the veggies and the meats we slide down our gullets: we need to understand how much nourishment actually lies in the act of preparation. Full stars."
204,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19059096-jill,4,"Usually I read Michael Pollan to feel distressed (but not awash), and ashamed (but not hopeless). But Cooked is Pollan at his most optimistic. While conscientious as always, he sets out in this book not to acquaint us with the grim facts of our world and its consumers’ decisions; rather, he illustrates the wonders of what we as individuals can do. And what we can do is, obviously: cook. Cook in informed, ambitious ways that link us to the ground, to plants and animals and microbes, to farmers and other producers, and to the people in our lives for whom we cook. This book is part of the antidote to the problems laid out in Omnivore’s Dilemma and In Defense of Food. It's structured “by element,” wherein Pollan discusses cooking with fire (such as in the barbecue pits of North Carolina), water (braises and pot-cooking), air (with bread-masters from all over) and earth (fermentation.) Fair warning: you find yourself fairly deep in the weeds of the chemical processes of the latter two topics – as other reviewers before me have found, these chapters are slower to get through than the first half.Cooked veers toward personal anecdotes, nutrition, chemistry, social history, mythology, and even psychology as necessary. Pollan delivers every discussion with the deftness and humility we expect from him. The writing’s great, the subjects are varied, and the tone is encouraging. Four solid stars."
205,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1706153-meghan,5,"Months after finishing this, I feel obligated to bump it up to 5 stars. The Pollanesqe pedantic tone that starts this book off is the only reason that my initial grade was a 4.5 for me, but even that can be kind of endearing... I very regularly felt like I was reading a book by my dad. However, each chapter drew me into a very dreamy, delighted state of reading. I love the path that weaves through research and literature, mixed with Pollan's interactions with fascinating expert cooks as well as his own cooking adventures. I was surprised, inspired, and impressed constantly. This is one book that I'm very happy to own, because even before I finished it I was tempted to refer back to previous chapters as a reference for some real life situation or another. It prompted me to talk about food with people a lot more, and I definitely feel inspired to branch out of my cooking comfort zone. For anyone why might appreciate some background or perspective on the practice of cooking, this is a fabulous choice.I was reading Ecotopia at the same time, a novel that complemented this one very well. Aaaand up next: Moyasimon: Tales of Agriculture, Volume 2, the world of microbes! ""Everything is everywhere."""
206,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4504899-becki-iverson,5,"As always, Michael Pollan's new book ""Cooked"" is an impeccably researched, beautifully written and hands-on journey through the four foundational methods of cooking. Stylistically, it is essentially a mash-up of the styles of his previous books into a snazzy new package - the four pillars of ""Botany of Desire,"" the hands on creation and eating in ""Omnivore's Dilemma,"" and the modern food science vs. traditional eats breakdown of ""In Defense of Food."" The result is glorious(although at very rare instances almost too brainy). Pollan is a deceptively excellent writer who is capable of making extraordinarily complex concepts and terms accessible to nearly anyone; thus, it is easy to forgive him when he goes a bit awry. I would have liked just a little more description of the work Pollan was doing himself on the cooking; more in depth interviews/apprenticeships, or more recipes. But either way, it's been a while since his last book, and it's good to see Pollan in print again."
207,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1386971-marieke,4,"I really enjoyed this. I have officially abandoned my Michael Pollan hater stance. I misunderstood him. I might even give Botany of Desire another chance.Now I will ramble:I'm a little jealous that he gets to write these glorified stunt books that are so appealingly nerdy.Now I'm going to start my starter...it's time to take my bread baking to the next level...I don't think I'll be roasting any whole pigs, though. However, listening to that part of the book did take me down memory lane to summer camp as a kid. Every summer we did ""Ham in a Pit,"" and we had to take turns in pairs overnight to keep watch. I don't remember what I actually thought of the resulting food, though. One last thought: germ is my copilot...this book made me really consider dirtiness and how we seem to be really screwing ourselves over. Oh well, we are evolutionary creatures and somehow we will adapt."
208,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2675284-mollie,4,"I finished listening to the audiobook yesterday and have been considering how to review it. I liked the author's way of encouraging the reader to establish a relationship with food based on ""meaning."" As well as his invitation to ""join the makers of the world.""I admired the breadth of his investigation, his knowledge base.The author reads the book. His inflections added meaning, deepened my relationship with the subject matter. Sometimes his calming voice induced drowsiness; after all, the book does not have a rousing plot.But today, I notice that I miss his soothing voice speaking to me of a recently discovered detail of food preparation. It is as if I now set one less place at my table."
209,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6236139-michael-jones,4,"This was one of those books where at many points I wished I could be the author! To sample the barbecue in the South, or cheeses in France--oooh!The author uses stories to tell you how he learned about different kinds of foods and their origins. Actually very informative if you want to learn about whole foods and there is much science here. But the sciences in the context of relationships with real people who understand these foods. He hits most of the major types of food that we consume.This book would be an important read for someone who is basically only eating a standard American diet (SAD). It will open your eyes to new food horizons and could help you understand why eating real food makes you much happier and healthier."
210,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50262924-dr-tobias-christian-fischer,4,"Cooking stands for healthy, natural and energy-efficient food intake. Our ancestors started cooking at some point because the addition of heat allowed them to get a lot more nutrients from a lot more natural foods. Unfortunately, we have moved further and further away from it since the global boom in convenience foods. The following still applies today: Those who cook at home with natural ingredients are by far the healthiest (Blinkist, 2020)."
211,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53971695-stijn-zanders,5,"A book that inspires, Pollan writes the book around the idea that cooking is much more than just preparing food. He does this by diving into the four elements: fire, water, air and earth. Especially the last two parts that go into the baking of sour dough bread and fermentation are invaluable!"
212,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,4,"""In Cooked, Michael Pollan explores the previously uncharted territory of his own kitchen. Here, he discovers the enduring power of the four classical elements—fire, water, air, and earth—to transform the stuff of nature into delicious things to eat and drink. Apprenticing himself to a succession of culinary masters, Pollan learns how to grill with fire, cook with liquid, bake bread, and ferment everything from cheese to beer.The effects of not cooking are similarly far reaching. Relying upon corporations to process our food means we consume large quantities of fat, sugar, and salt; disrupt an essential link to the natural world; and weaken our relationships with family and friends. In fact, Cooked argues, taking back control of cooking may be the single most important step anyone can take to help make the American food system healthier and more sustainable. Reclaiming cooking as an act of enjoyment and self-reliance, learning to perform the magic of these everyday transformations, opens the door to a more nourishing life.""I have to say that I appreciate an author who tells me that I am being subversive or rebellious if I cook. It’s one of the few forms of rebelliousness to which I wholeheartedly subscribe. Having read Salt Sugar Fat by Michael Moss last year, I been working diligently at eliminating processed foods from my diet—easier said than done! Especially when one is also attempting to go gluten-free. I have many happy memories of cooking on the farm where I grew up. We knew the cows that provided our milk, the chickens that laid our eggs and the cattle and pigs that provided each evening’s main course. Sometimes Mom would even mention them by name as she served up supper. I have been in quest of a real pork chop for some time now and think I have found a butcher shop that provides a product very, very close to my idealized memories. One of the things which struck me when I moved to the city was the lack of taste in the meat and vegetables purchased from the chain grocery stores. Carrots from a chain store are more like wood than like vegetables and tomatoes are hard and tasteless compared to those we grew in our garden (fertilized with well-aged, long composted animal manure).  The problem, for me at least, is one of time. I love to cook and bake—but I also work full time and enjoy a busy social life. Having read Cooked, I can see that I will start attempting to schedule more cooking time into my life—in the past, I have whiled away many happy hours stirring soup pots, checking on oven contents and poking at dough. It’s time to return that gentle form of rebellion to my life on a regular basis."

As someone who cooks 90% of her meals from scratch this had my interest from the first chapter but I wondered how long it would last. After all, what was going to be ""news"" to me at this point. Well, it turns out...a lot!The book is filled with facts, anecdotes and hands on experiences of the author. Topics covered include real barbequing, braises, bread making and fermentation. I have actually caught myself discussing this book at length with my foodie friends and family. My husband was woken up a few times to hear a paragraph or two that struck a chord with me and I felt the need to discuss or share. He's been patient...but I wonder if it was so I could create the recipes at the back of the book. I will be on the lookout for a crock for some sauerkraut...my hubby's parents make this but now I have a stronger urge to try it out.Interesting, intellectual and inspiring! Well written and well documented.On a final note...it was peanut free so it's safe for everyone. ;)"
214,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8986610-chris,3,"This was a good book if you're interested in the anatomy of cooking. Michael Pollan is one of my favorite food writers and I always enjoy his books, this one as well. However, this was a little too in depth for me.Michael explores the four realms of cooking in this book, Fire, Water, Air and Earth. For Fire, he uses whole hog barbeque. For Water, he explores braising. For air, his example is baking bread. For Earth he uses fermentation. Basically, he breaks all of these cooking methods down to the smallest elements and builds on it.My final thought on this book is that it was interesting, but if your not really into cooking/food then this book may be too much for you."
215,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1063843-sarah-hauck,4,"In his latest book, Cooked, Michael Pollan serves up another bestseller that looks at the relationships between us and the food we eat. Struck by the realization that “the less cooking we were doing in our own lives, the more that food and its vicarious preparation transfixed us,” Pollan sets out to explore the art of cooking for himself.Cooked reads like a how-to book for the uninitiated in the kitchen while still providing plenty of more detailed analysis for seasoned cooks. Divided into chapters based on the four classical elements – Earth, Water, Air and Fire – Pollan personally explores the world of cooking where “the stuff of nature gets transformed into the things we eat and drink.”In each chapter, Pollan learns about a corresponding cooking style: in Fire, he gets grilling lessons from a North Carolina barbecue pit master; in Water, he masters braises; in Air, he experiments with bread baking as he seeks to perfect the perfect sourdough loaf; and finally, in Earth, he explores various types of fermentation including pickling, cheese making and home brewing.Along the way, each of his teachers – from “the cheese nun” with a Ph.D. in microbiology to the “most famous fermentor in America” – is whole-heartedly devoted to his or her craft and, in the end, getting a glimpse into their lives and work is half the fun of the book.I’ve been a Michael Pollan fan since I first cracked the spine of The Botany of Desire more than a decade ago, but even I’ll admit, there are a few points in the narrative where even the most devout reader’s eyes may start to glaze over… like when Pollan gets mired in the details of the “all-important Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis” microbe. But only briefly. Because along with straight-up cool science, he also mixes into his narrative a bit of history, art and literature along with a dash of religion (“bread… is an everyday proof of the possibility of transcendence” and sex for good measure (“a cheese that stinks – of manure, of sex – offers a relatively safe way for us to flirt with forbidden desires”).As in his previous books, Pollan extolls the ills (literally) of processed foods and cautions against our over-reliance on corporations, “whose ‘dead food’ is damaging our health and ‘homogenizing’ our experience.”When asked why we don’t spend more time preparing our own meals, apparently most people claim a lack of time. But Pollan points out that, “in the last decade or so, we’ve all found two hours a day to be on line outside of work.” So what gives?Another entire book could be devoted to answering that question, but Pollan doesn’t take on that job in Cooked. Instead, he argues that we would all do well to start getting reacquainted with our kitchens because “cooking is one of the most interesting and worthwhile things we humans do.”While it may be cheaper and easier to rely on others to provide for our basic needs, “to live that way comes at a price, not least to our sense of competence and independence.” We are so disconnected from the makers of our food, Pollan argues, that we stop thinking about what is actually in the food we eat or where it comes from, much less the labor, money or energy it took to get it onto our plate. Worst of all, we forget that “what presents itself to us in the marketplace as a product is in truth a web of relationships between people… and all the other species on which we still depend.” (Yes, even bacteria.)In the end, Cooked turns out to be a commentary on the way we live. It’s true, as in his past books, that Pollan is critical of capitalism, and in particular consumerism, as the downfall of democracy and independence in its most literal sense. The antidote (or part of it, anyway) that he offers up here is cooking. To cook, he says, is to reclaim a bit of independence, and perhaps a bit of pride as well. It’s what separates us from the rest of the natural world and, paradoxically, also what keeps us connected to it.It is also an invitation to modern society (that’s you and me) to reconnect with the world. It’s true that few of us have the luxury of spending hours in the kitchen making all of our meals from scratch, but even small culinary contributions help us to reconnect with the natural world around us. As Pollan himself admits, “The most important thing I learned … is how cooking implicates us in a whole web of social and ecological relationships: with plants and animals, with the soil, with farmers, with the microbes both inside and outside our bodies, and, of course, with the people our cooking nourishes and delights.” And he invites us “to alter, however slightly, the ratio between production and consumption” in our lives.This, he believes, can make a difference. After trying his hand at home brewing, Pollan says, “The beer in that bottle, I’m reminded as soon as I brew it myself, ultimately comes not from a factory, but from nature – from a field of barley snapping in the wind, from a hops vine clambering over a trellis, from a host of invisible microbes feasting on sugars.”So, if preparing our own home-cooked meals makes us think just a little bit more about the world around us and how, ultimately, we all depend on one another to survive, then certainly a little time with a knife and cutting board won’t hurt anyone.For novices in the kitchen – or first-time Pollan readers – Cooked is sure to whet your appetite. For the rest of us, it is the continuation of an ongoing commentary on food, nature and modern society that will not fail to satisfy."
216,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10987540-ben,3,"It's difficult to rate a book which was very enjoyable to read, but fraught with quirks of Pollan's writing style and ideology. I'll write this review as a ""compliment sandwich."" To begin: The chapters on Barbeque (Fire) and Bread (Air) were particularly strong and interesting. I enjoyed the attention he gave to food research at UC Davis, and was glad to see him visit some interesting operations in Yolo County.That being said...Pollan went on several rants only tenuously connected to his topics. Notably, his nostalgia for an agrarian/culinary past that, to use the phrase of Jello Biafra ""never existed."" Pollan seems oblivious to his own level of wealth and privelege. He emphasizes that he braises ""cheap"" pieces of meat. Has he compared the price of a brisket to chicken? bologna? a can of beans? He spends days at a time on breads, insisting that he can ""get writing done"" in between turns and rises. Not everyone is a freelance writer, buddy. Try making a braise and two sourdoughs a week working 9-5.My final criticism is his love of ""artisans"" while scoffing at anything remotely automated. The problem is that for artisans (of food and everything else) it's a labor of love. An independent baker selling high-end sourdough might be carrying on a food tradition or whatever, but the forklift operator, truck driver, QC specialist, etc. at the Wonder-bread plant he's so quick to dismiss have mentally and physically demanding jobs, with some security, benefits, and disposable income that the starving artist-baker lacks. Does Pollan really envision a bucolic future of nothing but cottage industries? Who would have the income to buy his books?The joke's on him, I took it out of the library.In conclusion- Pollan is an entertaining and gripping writer who has sought out some very interesting characters in the American foodscape. Parts of this book rehash ""Omnivore's Dilema,"" but hey. What can you do? If this were a bad book, I wouldn't have finished it. It's honestly good writing, somewhat choppy, and somewhat obsessive about certain details (raising dough) while ignoring others (Pollan's wealth, and location in the foodie Island of the Bay Area.)"
217,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/867628-catherine,3,"Where has our love gone, Michael? This is the fourth of your books that I've read, which is somewhat fitting, considering your obsession with that number. Second Nature: four seasons, Omnivore's Dilemma: four meals, Botany of Desire: four plants, and with this book four methods of food preparation. I was really excited about a new book from you, as I really enjoyed those three earlier books, despite your tendency to ramble and repeat. When an acquaintance told me how much she enjoyed this book (her first experience with you), I quickly recommended the others and offered to swap her OD for this one. And yet...somehow I just can't get into it. Maybe it's that you're again preaching your slow food message and I've already joined the choir. Maybe it's the current heat wave that makes the subject of cooking less appealing. Maybe it's my stack of novels and lighter non-fiction driving me to distraction. Whatever the cause(s), I'm going to return this copy to the owner (since I've had it for three or four weeks already) and track down a library copy later when cooking and, let's be honest...you, Michael, sound more appealing.Update: it took me almost 7 years, but I finally finished this book! This time, I started with the section on yeast breads, focusing on sourdough. I've experimented with sourdough a couple times since reading Sourdough (and started a new one after finishing the book), so I had more connection to Pollan's experiences than the previous sections. The final section, in which he discusses fermentation (of vegetables, cheese, and alcohol) was also really interesting, especially the American-born nun making traditional cheese in a French convent. For me, the second half of the book was much stronger. "
218,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793094-lisa,5,"Michael Pollan has written another book about food; this time he researches the history of cooking. He focuses on cooking using the classic elements of fire, water, air, and earth.The section on fire focuses almost exclusively on smoking pork, which is something I enjoy doing. For those of you that have never enjoyed barbeque or smoking, you might not connect with this section like I did. Smoked pork (and chicken) is so good, it is worth the effort to try to perfect your efforts! Take a look at my video on smoking Boston Butts: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U2--A...I have videos on smoking chicken, salmon filets, and ribs; smoked food is so good and it is fun to connect with nature to prepare food!In the section on cooking with water, Pollan uses a pot to slow cook various delicious dishes. He talked about the time and effort to cook slowly on the stovetop. I had to wonder why he didn't even try using a crockpot or slow cooker! Nonetheless, all of the food sounded really good!The section on air focused on making bread and I almost wanted to make a loaf myself, but then I remembered how addictive bread out of the oven tastes! It was very interesting!Lastly, Pollan focused on ""earth"" as an element of cooking. Any guess what that could be? I never would have guessed, but it is fermentation. This was my least favorite section because I don't drink, but it was interesting to listen to how Pollan made his own beer. There are many health benefits to eating foods like yogurt that use something like fermentation to grow the cultures. While I eat yogurt every day, I am too much of a wimp to eat the other foods Pollan highlighted.Of course, Pollan could not resist discussing how many people no longer cook--or they heat prepared food and call that cooking. I found all of that fascinating because I do not buy many prepared foods; however, I buy more than I thought!I listened to this audiobook while gardening and loved it! "
219,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,4,"“I found that, much like gardening, most cooking manages to be agreeably absorbing without being too demanding intellectually. It leaves plenty of mental space for daydreaming and reflection.” ― Michael Pollan, Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation In Cooked Michael Pollan stays close to his food roots. Similar in theme to: Omnivore's Dilema (Four Meals), In Defense of Food (Food Manifesto), Botany of Desire (Four Plants), Food Rules (Owner's Manual for Food), and Second Nature (Growing Food).Cooked is just another branch on the Phylogenetic food tree for the Pollan's Omnivore, me thinks. Unless, of course, Pollan is going to delve into the proper way to digest, poop, or compost your waste. And... he might just. I am neither a Pollan lover or hater. I've read a bunch of his stuff because it is fast and rather tasty. The problem with Pollan is reading too much of him. His books are a bit full of roughage and eventually too much of his raw idealism or fiber-rich localism gets to you. I think that is the problem with idealists and their genius (genus?). No one can quite live upto the expectations. There just isn't that many locally grown mushrooms, or farmer's markets, or grass-fed organic beef. But education about farming, feasting, and cooking gives us a better sense of both the idea and the real. As long as we are aware of the costs of the way we eat and the way we cook, we are better than we started. The probelm comes in when we believe ALL the hype. As long as you can remain pragmatic about food and Pollan, reading him is a good thing."

If there ever was a more tedious and odious exercise in navel gazing, I'd be impressed.I must confess I am baffled by this book. Who is the audience? Is it local foodies who are already converted? In which case, why on earth must the author keep telling us again and again and again how awesome cooking is? We get it, we're the choir, quit your preaching.Or perhaps the audience is the mass produced shrink-wrap microwave toting loner. In which case, hearing someone pontificate on and on and on about the joys of combining heat with edible things is also pointlessly preachy, and Mr Pollan does an abysmal sales job here.The problem is that Mr Pollan has completely and totally run out of things to say. As a result, this book is basically reworking the same sentence over and over again using different combinations of words. So to save the hapless potential victim from having to wade through a few hundred pages of tedium, I'd suggest instead spending the next hour rearranging any subset of these words into as many variations as you can:Heavenly, nature, cooking, is, god, primitive man, plants, aroma, animal sacrifice, producesHour over? You're welcome, I just saved you many more hours of your precious time. You can spend the remaining 5-6 you have left over from not reading this book staring blankly into space, it'll be more meaningful and more likely to result in food related insights."

So, when this book was published, I really looked forward to reading it. I love his ability to take the science and technical aspects of food and nutrition and make them fascinating.I thought that it was quite appropriate that I read this book during a holiday centered around cooking and eating: Thanksgiving. I love cooking for our family, and I try hard to share that love with our girls, teaching them the simple concepts that I know and showing them how easy it is for a parent who works out of the home to prepare a home-cooked meal using little to no prepared foods. This book really shows the genesis of human cooking and the emotional and primal urges behind what and how we cook. In four different parts (fire, water, air, and earth), he describes different ways we engage with food. I'm not sure what happened - I read the first three parts in the span of just one day, but then I was overwhelmed with other books that I needed to read (for my book club or because they were coming due), and this book was pushed to the side for over a month. Finally, I decided I needed to finish it (I'm sure it's coming due soon!) and I tackled the fourth part in one day.

226,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65459284-paul,4,How is Brandon Sanderson considered a better writer by reviews than Michael Pollan?
227,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8561-yune,4,"Pollan has an easy, friendly, and persuasive writing style that managed to draw me away from another book I'd pre-ordered in two formats when Cooked happened to show up on the library hold shelf on the other book's release date.He's best when he's describing his own experiences or describing micro-science to a layman; I found him a little less convincing and slightly on the side of pretentious when he indulged in wide-scale anthropological musings or symbolism along the lines of the four elements he uses to organize this book: fire (barbecue), water (braises), air (bread), and earth (fermented foods, like sauerkraut and beer). I would've been totally fine with section headings with the food name.I was actually surprised to discover that he wasn't already an expert cook; one of his previous books, The Omnivore's Dilemma, had so incisively made the case for eating in a wholesome manner that I'd assumed he had mastered this skill. But this book is the story of his education in various culinary arenas, and as he manages gain tutelage under acclaimed pit masters and bakers, he--and I--became engrossed in his teachers' personal stories and the philosophies that brought them to the mastery of their crafts. (Or the philosophies that developed because of those crafts.)Thus you meet such interesting folks as the ""cheese nun,"" who managed to get the state health inspector to stand down in an otherwise shrill war about raw milk...by a scientific experiment:A nun's habit and a Ph.D. in microbiology--the abbey sent her to the University of Connecticut so that she might better be able to defend her cheese, both from pathogens and from public health authorities--are an unbeatable combination, and, so far at least, the FDA has thought better than to mess with Sister Noëlla, even as the agency has come down hard on many other raw-milk cheese makers.This lovely sly humor is on display several times, often parenthetically, such as when he describes a 300-year-old fermentation pit:The breadfruit in it had been reduced to a sour mush, but it was reported to be ""still in edible condition."" (You first.)It was interesting how each type of training received different treatment in Pollan's words. The whole pig barbecue ended up making me think more about the sweaty insanity of the chopping block afterward, while trying to feed thousands of hungry people; the year of weekly braising lessons felt prosaic, free of any sudden revelations, although Pollan admits to using what he learned here the most frequently afterward. His description of the bread-making process was utterly engrossing to me (a non-baker from a rice-centric culture), from how he coaxed the starter yeast to the shaping of the dough. His satisfaction rose almost palpably off the bread as he broke the crust of his efforts.And although he dips into scientific explanations whenever he sees fit, pointing out the chemical processes behind caramelization or the nutrients that separate whole wheat flour from white, he delves most deeply into the question of human interaction with internal bacteria: the gut microflora that actually does a lot of the work in keeping us healthy, and how hyper-sanitized environments and antibiotics can devastate this balance. Mary Roach also devotes some time to this in Gulp, and I anticipate a popular science book on the subject soon. Pollan himself doesn't subscribe to the ""kombucha will cure AIDS!"" line of ""let the bacteria grow wild and free!"" thinking, but he does make a strong case for eating less sterile food.Note: To his credit, Pollan does acknowledge head-on the gender imbalance that tends to accompany kitchen duties, without letting the discussion devour the book. In general I found him to be cognizant of the larger issues lying behind his personal quest, whether it be food industry lobbying power or cultural values, but touching upon them only gently.Quite a satisfying read, although I think it's best viewed more along memoirish lines than the sort of societal revolution hinted at in The Omnivore's Dilemma. And the ending was more powerful than those of many novels I've read."
228,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1020899-patty,3,"“Cooking is all about connection, I've learned, between us and other species, other times, other cultures (human and microbial both), but, most important, other people. Cooking is one of the more beautiful forms that human generosity takes; that much I sort of knew. But the very best cooking, I discovered, is also a form of intimacy.”This is the third book that I have read by Pollan. He started by writing about gardening and naturally moved on to food and cooking. I started with The Omnivore’s Dilemma and skipped the gardening books. (I really should go back to those – I like reading about gardening even though I don’t like gardening much.) All three of these books about food have been interesting and enlightening.When I did my review for The Omnivore’s Dilemma, I wrote, “For me this is what makes a good read. I get immersed in the book; I learn new things and for at least some of the time I am thinking about the book and author even when I am not reading the book.” That was true for this book as well. I listened to this and since it took more than thirteen hours, it was with me for a long time. I enjoyed thinking through Pollan’s theories about how the four elements reflect the four ways of cooking and meeting several chefs, bakers, cheesmakers and brewers. I will look at cooking a bit differently because of this book."

230,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/427611-karen-a,5,"This book has made me rethink many aspects of cooking. Especially how I cook. It is divided into 4 parts, fire, water, air, and earth all corresponding to specific methods of cooking. The fire portion was probably my least favorite and has made it even less likely that I will take up roasting a pig. And some of his comments about the pork industry, though brief, have made me pass up the pork section altogether at the grocery store. Enlightening are his observations about how we perceive the time it takes to cook and based on our perception that it is laborious and time consuming we have surrendered our meal preparation duties to large industry, an industry that has neither health nor quality at the core of its interests. And he counters that quick meal preparation is not so quick and the time it took him and his family to defrost and cook frozen meals he could easily have made a braise. Pollan also reveals what goes into a loaf of bread and how the baker’s pursuit of a light loaf full of air has caused a whole wheat industry to subvert the nutrition of the grain. My favorite part of this book however is the fourth and final part – earth which he dedicates to the art of fermenting. The whole concept of food decaying and then being turned into something not only particular to region and culture but actually good for the human gut is very intriguing and he does a great job of exploring what is going on with this process on a micro level. Also included in the portion of the book is cheese making. His works with the nun, Sister Noella, who makes cheese the old fashion way in large oak barrels contrary to FDA regulations and contrary to our own ideas of what will make the safest product to eat. But Sister Noella has done her homework (doctorate in microbiology) and can prove that the oak barrels produce a more stable product than the steel barrels used by the rest of the industry. While I wish Pollan would have put some of the same time and effort into the cheese portion of the book that he did for the pork roasting, he does do just enough where one will want to know more. In fact I think most of the book does and excellent job of whetting the appetite so to speak for a real discussion about our notions of convenience, health, taste, and how we cook. I really hope this fans the small flames for the trend to cook at home. It really is better in every way. "
231,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419307-rachel,2,"I thought I liked Michael Pollan's writing. Have I changed, or has he?This book had some good content, but Pollan's writing really got in the way. It read like the writing of someone who has gotten a little overconfident in the value of their interests and opinions to others, someone who loves their own writing a little too much, someone who was perhaps reluctant to seek the editing help they really needed.My problems with Pollan's writing are:1) He hammers his points home to the extent of sounding pedantic and condescending. Yes, cooking is the thing that separates us humans from animals, I get it. Now you're telling it to me another twenty times in twenty not-different-enough ways?2) Indulgent digression - between this and point #2, the book could have been cut down by about 100 pages into a much stronger, poignant book.3) Overwrought sentences and flimsy connections drawn between food and other things. Do the following excerpts not make you want to kind of throw up a little of the beautiful braise you just ate:""...it is the very allusiveness of cooked food that appeals to us, as indeed that same quality does in poetry or music or art. We gravitate toward complexity and metaphor, it seems, and putting fire to meat, or fermenting fruit and grain, gives us both: more sheer sensory information and, specifically, sensory information that, like metaphor, points away from the here and now. This sensory metaphor--this stands for that--is one of the most important transformations of nature wrought by cooking. And so a piece of crisped pigskin becomes a densely allusive poem of flavors...""""Elation, effervescence, elevation, levity, inspiration: air words all, alveolated with vowels, leavening the dough of everyday life.""Ick. And that's only one of several times he ""cleverly"" uses ""leaven."" We get it, Pollan. It's a bread word and you applied it to stuff that isn't bread.Just so tiresome, but I stuck with it because I liked the idea of the book, and some of the content was good. The discussion of bacterial flora did a good job of addressing a new topic in food and health, for example. But this might be the last Pollan book I read."
232,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,3,"I enjoy cooking and eating, but I don't read Michael Pollan's books – this is at least my third – for the food. If so, I would never have finished this. I am a vegetarian, and the first half of Cooked is about barbecue and braising – the smells of cooking pig flesh! – so not my favorite.I read Pollan's books for his curiosity. They are as much or more about the science of cooking and the philosophy of living. You have to be ready to geek out about everything that you come across. You need to be willing to stop and question all sorts of things: nutrition, chemistry, history, politics, gender.What was the single most important thing we could do as a family to improve our health and general well-being? And what would be a good way to better connect to my teenage son?.... Other questions were slightly more political in nature. For years I had been trying to determine (because I am often asked) what is the most important thing an ordinary person can do to help reform the American food system, to make it healthier and more sustainable? Another related question is, how can people living in a highly specialized consumer economy reduce their sense of dependence and achieve a greater degree of self-sufficiency? And then there were the more philosophical questions, the ones I’ve been chewing on since I first started writing books. How, in our everyday lives, can we acquire a deeper understanding of the natural world and our species’ peculiar role in it? (Kindle 96)Pollan goes straight to the horse's mouth to learn about food and cooking. Then he goes to another expert until he begins to work on his own. And he talks about his errors rather than dodging them. For Pollan, mistakes are an opportunity to learn, to understand. He is willing to throw out standard thinking. (Are antibiotics a good thing or not? What about pasteurization?) And, he takes us along for the ride.This is a lovely ride."
233,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14773738-julie,5,"This is another excellent offering by Michael Pollan who, since The Omnivore's Dilemma has become my favourite go-to person in all things food related. Admittedly, this was slightly less interesting to me than Pollan's Dilemma, but only because I've already experienced all the joys of being Cooked -- pun intended. For all those who have yet to experience the transformative power of being the master/mistress of one's own hearth, this is a must read. Twice.This is not a recipe book -- far from it, albeit Pollan does throw in a few handy recipes at the very end, based on the four elements he explores: fire, water, air and earth; in essence, the touchstone elements of our universe, and our humanity. This is more a book on the nature of cooking: the whys and wherefores of throwing that first chunk of meat over burning coals, and then of maybe tossing in a tuber or two for good measure. With this simple action, we defined our humanity, Pollan postulates, and it is this that made us stand taller than the apes, once and for all.He also dabbles in the mysticism of cooking, the art of alchemical transformation of both the eaten, and the eater. It is a magical read -- and unlike Pollan's Dilemma which left me never wanting to eat (industrial) food ever again, this book left me ravenous. It is an exceptional testament to why we should all engage in the action of feeding ourselves -- quite literally. The action of going to the market and buying packaged and frozen food-like substances is not cooking, and offers absolutely nothing to our nutritional intake, either chemically or spiritually, Pollan offers. Rather, we need to be closer than arm's length from the veggies and the meats we slide down our gullets: we need to understand how much nourishment actually lies in the act of preparation. Full stars."
234,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19059096-jill,4,"Usually I read Michael Pollan to feel distressed (but not awash), and ashamed (but not hopeless). But Cooked is Pollan at his most optimistic. While conscientious as always, he sets out in this book not to acquaint us with the grim facts of our world and its consumers’ decisions; rather, he illustrates the wonders of what we as individuals can do. And what we can do is, obviously: cook. Cook in informed, ambitious ways that link us to the ground, to plants and animals and microbes, to farmers and other producers, and to the people in our lives for whom we cook. This book is part of the antidote to the problems laid out in Omnivore’s Dilemma and In Defense of Food. It's structured “by element,” wherein Pollan discusses cooking with fire (such as in the barbecue pits of North Carolina), water (braises and pot-cooking), air (with bread-masters from all over) and earth (fermentation.) Fair warning: you find yourself fairly deep in the weeds of the chemical processes of the latter two topics – as other reviewers before me have found, these chapters are slower to get through than the first half.Cooked veers toward personal anecdotes, nutrition, chemistry, social history, mythology, and even psychology as necessary. Pollan delivers every discussion with the deftness and humility we expect from him. The writing’s great, the subjects are varied, and the tone is encouraging. Four solid stars."
235,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1706153-meghan,5,"Months after finishing this, I feel obligated to bump it up to 5 stars. The Pollanesqe pedantic tone that starts this book off is the only reason that my initial grade was a 4.5 for me, but even that can be kind of endearing... I very regularly felt like I was reading a book by my dad. However, each chapter drew me into a very dreamy, delighted state of reading. I love the path that weaves through research and literature, mixed with Pollan's interactions with fascinating expert cooks as well as his own cooking adventures. I was surprised, inspired, and impressed constantly. This is one book that I'm very happy to own, because even before I finished it I was tempted to refer back to previous chapters as a reference for some real life situation or another. It prompted me to talk about food with people a lot more, and I definitely feel inspired to branch out of my cooking comfort zone. For anyone why might appreciate some background or perspective on the practice of cooking, this is a fabulous choice.I was reading Ecotopia at the same time, a novel that complemented this one very well. Aaaand up next: Moyasimon: Tales of Agriculture, Volume 2, the world of microbes! ""Everything is everywhere."""
236,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4504899-becki-iverson,5,"As always, Michael Pollan's new book ""Cooked"" is an impeccably researched, beautifully written and hands-on journey through the four foundational methods of cooking. Stylistically, it is essentially a mash-up of the styles of his previous books into a snazzy new package - the four pillars of ""Botany of Desire,"" the hands on creation and eating in ""Omnivore's Dilemma,"" and the modern food science vs. traditional eats breakdown of ""In Defense of Food."" The result is glorious(although at very rare instances almost too brainy). Pollan is a deceptively excellent writer who is capable of making extraordinarily complex concepts and terms accessible to nearly anyone; thus, it is easy to forgive him when he goes a bit awry. I would have liked just a little more description of the work Pollan was doing himself on the cooking; more in depth interviews/apprenticeships, or more recipes. But either way, it's been a while since his last book, and it's good to see Pollan in print again."
237,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1386971-marieke,4,"I really enjoyed this. I have officially abandoned my Michael Pollan hater stance. I misunderstood him. I might even give Botany of Desire another chance.Now I will ramble:I'm a little jealous that he gets to write these glorified stunt books that are so appealingly nerdy.Now I'm going to start my starter...it's time to take my bread baking to the next level...I don't think I'll be roasting any whole pigs, though. However, listening to that part of the book did take me down memory lane to summer camp as a kid. Every summer we did ""Ham in a Pit,"" and we had to take turns in pairs overnight to keep watch. I don't remember what I actually thought of the resulting food, though. One last thought: germ is my copilot...this book made me really consider dirtiness and how we seem to be really screwing ourselves over. Oh well, we are evolutionary creatures and somehow we will adapt."
238,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2675284-mollie,4,"I finished listening to the audiobook yesterday and have been considering how to review it. I liked the author's way of encouraging the reader to establish a relationship with food based on ""meaning."" As well as his invitation to ""join the makers of the world.""I admired the breadth of his investigation, his knowledge base.The author reads the book. His inflections added meaning, deepened my relationship with the subject matter. Sometimes his calming voice induced drowsiness; after all, the book does not have a rousing plot.But today, I notice that I miss his soothing voice speaking to me of a recently discovered detail of food preparation. It is as if I now set one less place at my table."
239,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6236139-michael-jones,4,"This was one of those books where at many points I wished I could be the author! To sample the barbecue in the South, or cheeses in France--oooh!The author uses stories to tell you how he learned about different kinds of foods and their origins. Actually very informative if you want to learn about whole foods and there is much science here. But the sciences in the context of relationships with real people who understand these foods. He hits most of the major types of food that we consume.This book would be an important read for someone who is basically only eating a standard American diet (SAD). It will open your eyes to new food horizons and could help you understand why eating real food makes you much happier and healthier."
240,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50262924-dr-tobias-christian-fischer,4,"Cooking stands for healthy, natural and energy-efficient food intake. Our ancestors started cooking at some point because the addition of heat allowed them to get a lot more nutrients from a lot more natural foods. Unfortunately, we have moved further and further away from it since the global boom in convenience foods. The following still applies today: Those who cook at home with natural ingredients are by far the healthiest (Blinkist, 2020)."
241,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53971695-stijn-zanders,5,"A book that inspires, Pollan writes the book around the idea that cooking is much more than just preparing food. He does this by diving into the four elements: fire, water, air and earth. Especially the last two parts that go into the baking of sour dough bread and fermentation are invaluable!"
242,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,4,"""In Cooked, Michael Pollan explores the previously uncharted territory of his own kitchen. Here, he discovers the enduring power of the four classical elements—fire, water, air, and earth—to transform the stuff of nature into delicious things to eat and drink. Apprenticing himself to a succession of culinary masters, Pollan learns how to grill with fire, cook with liquid, bake bread, and ferment everything from cheese to beer.The effects of not cooking are similarly far reaching. Relying upon corporations to process our food means we consume large quantities of fat, sugar, and salt; disrupt an essential link to the natural world; and weaken our relationships with family and friends. In fact, Cooked argues, taking back control of cooking may be the single most important step anyone can take to help make the American food system healthier and more sustainable. Reclaiming cooking as an act of enjoyment and self-reliance, learning to perform the magic of these everyday transformations, opens the door to a more nourishing life.""I have to say that I appreciate an author who tells me that I am being subversive or rebellious if I cook. It’s one of the few forms of rebelliousness to which I wholeheartedly subscribe. Having read Salt Sugar Fat by Michael Moss last year, I been working diligently at eliminating processed foods from my diet—easier said than done! Especially when one is also attempting to go gluten-free. I have many happy memories of cooking on the farm where I grew up. We knew the cows that provided our milk, the chickens that laid our eggs and the cattle and pigs that provided each evening’s main course. Sometimes Mom would even mention them by name as she served up supper. I have been in quest of a real pork chop for some time now and think I have found a butcher shop that provides a product very, very close to my idealized memories. One of the things which struck me when I moved to the city was the lack of taste in the meat and vegetables purchased from the chain grocery stores. Carrots from a chain store are more like wood than like vegetables and tomatoes are hard and tasteless compared to those we grew in our garden (fertilized with well-aged, long composted animal manure).  The problem, for me at least, is one of time. I love to cook and bake—but I also work full time and enjoy a busy social life. Having read Cooked, I can see that I will start attempting to schedule more cooking time into my life—in the past, I have whiled away many happy hours stirring soup pots, checking on oven contents and poking at dough. It’s time to return that gentle form of rebellion to my life on a regular basis."
243,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7424302-sharlene,4,"This book was received as the result of a Good read giveaway.This was not my average book...but how could I not want to read this as it was about my favourite subject...Food!Pollan covers the four ways of cooking covering fire, water, air and earth, something I had never really thought about before. As someone who cooks 90% of her meals from scratch this had my interest from the first chapter but I wondered how long it would last. After all, what was going to be ""news"" to me at this point. Well, it turns out...a lot!The book is filled with facts, anecdotes and hands on experiences of the author. Topics covered include real barbequing, braises, bread making and fermentation. I have actually caught myself discussing this book at length with my foodie friends and family. My husband was woken up a few times to hear a paragraph or two that struck a chord with me and I felt the need to discuss or share. He's been patient...but I wonder if it was so I could create the recipes at the back of the book. I will be on the lookout for a crock for some sauerkraut...my hubby's parents make this but now I have a stronger urge to try it out.Interesting, intellectual and inspiring! Well written and well documented.On a final note...it was peanut free so it's safe for everyone. ;)"
244,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8986610-chris,3,"This was a good book if you're interested in the anatomy of cooking. Michael Pollan is one of my favorite food writers and I always enjoy his books, this one as well. However, this was a little too in depth for me.Michael explores the four realms of cooking in this book, Fire, Water, Air and Earth. For Fire, he uses whole hog barbeque. For Water, he explores braising. For air, his example is baking bread. For Earth he uses fermentation. Basically, he breaks all of these cooking methods down to the smallest elements and builds on it.My final thought on this book is that it was interesting, but if your not really into cooking/food then this book may be too much for you."
245,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1063843-sarah-hauck,4,"In his latest book, Cooked, Michael Pollan serves up another bestseller that looks at the relationships between us and the food we eat. Struck by the realization that “the less cooking we were doing in our own lives, the more that food and its vicarious preparation transfixed us,” Pollan sets out to explore the art of cooking for himself.Cooked reads like a how-to book for the uninitiated in the kitchen while still providing plenty of more detailed analysis for seasoned cooks. Divided into chapters based on the four classical elements – Earth, Water, Air and Fire – Pollan personally explores the world of cooking where “the stuff of nature gets transformed into the things we eat and drink.”In each chapter, Pollan learns about a corresponding cooking style: in Fire, he gets grilling lessons from a North Carolina barbecue pit master; in Water, he masters braises; in Air, he experiments with bread baking as he seeks to perfect the perfect sourdough loaf; and finally, in Earth, he explores various types of fermentation including pickling, cheese making and home brewing.Along the way, each of his teachers – from “the cheese nun” with a Ph.D. in microbiology to the “most famous fermentor in America” – is whole-heartedly devoted to his or her craft and, in the end, getting a glimpse into their lives and work is half the fun of the book.I’ve been a Michael Pollan fan since I first cracked the spine of The Botany of Desire more than a decade ago, but even I’ll admit, there are a few points in the narrative where even the most devout reader’s eyes may start to glaze over… like when Pollan gets mired in the details of the “all-important Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis” microbe. But only briefly. Because along with straight-up cool science, he also mixes into his narrative a bit of history, art and literature along with a dash of religion (“bread… is an everyday proof of the possibility of transcendence” and sex for good measure (“a cheese that stinks – of manure, of sex – offers a relatively safe way for us to flirt with forbidden desires”).As in his previous books, Pollan extolls the ills (literally) of processed foods and cautions against our over-reliance on corporations, “whose ‘dead food’ is damaging our health and ‘homogenizing’ our experience.”When asked why we don’t spend more time preparing our own meals, apparently most people claim a lack of time. But Pollan points out that, “in the last decade or so, we’ve all found two hours a day to be on line outside of work.” So what gives?Another entire book could be devoted to answering that question, but Pollan doesn’t take on that job in Cooked. Instead, he argues that we would all do well to start getting reacquainted with our kitchens because “cooking is one of the most interesting and worthwhile things we humans do.”While it may be cheaper and easier to rely on others to provide for our basic needs, “to live that way comes at a price, not least to our sense of competence and independence.” We are so disconnected from the makers of our food, Pollan argues, that we stop thinking about what is actually in the food we eat or where it comes from, much less the labor, money or energy it took to get it onto our plate. Worst of all, we forget that “what presents itself to us in the marketplace as a product is in truth a web of relationships between people… and all the other species on which we still depend.” (Yes, even bacteria.)In the end, Cooked turns out to be a commentary on the way we live. It’s true, as in his past books, that Pollan is critical of capitalism, and in particular consumerism, as the downfall of democracy and independence in its most literal sense. The antidote (or part of it, anyway) that he offers up here is cooking. To cook, he says, is to reclaim a bit of independence, and perhaps a bit of pride as well. It’s what separates us from the rest of the natural world and, paradoxically, also what keeps us connected to it.It is also an invitation to modern society (that’s you and me) to reconnect with the world. It’s true that few of us have the luxury of spending hours in the kitchen making all of our meals from scratch, but even small culinary contributions help us to reconnect with the natural world around us. As Pollan himself admits, “The most important thing I learned … is how cooking implicates us in a whole web of social and ecological relationships: with plants and animals, with the soil, with farmers, with the microbes both inside and outside our bodies, and, of course, with the people our cooking nourishes and delights.” And he invites us “to alter, however slightly, the ratio between production and consumption” in our lives.This, he believes, can make a difference. After trying his hand at home brewing, Pollan says, “The beer in that bottle, I’m reminded as soon as I brew it myself, ultimately comes not from a factory, but from nature – from a field of barley snapping in the wind, from a hops vine clambering over a trellis, from a host of invisible microbes feasting on sugars.”So, if preparing our own home-cooked meals makes us think just a little bit more about the world around us and how, ultimately, we all depend on one another to survive, then certainly a little time with a knife and cutting board won’t hurt anyone.For novices in the kitchen – or first-time Pollan readers – Cooked is sure to whet your appetite. For the rest of us, it is the continuation of an ongoing commentary on food, nature and modern society that will not fail to satisfy."
246,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10987540-ben,3,"It's difficult to rate a book which was very enjoyable to read, but fraught with quirks of Pollan's writing style and ideology. I'll write this review as a ""compliment sandwich."" To begin: The chapters on Barbeque (Fire) and Bread (Air) were particularly strong and interesting. I enjoyed the attention he gave to food research at UC Davis, and was glad to see him visit some interesting operations in Yolo County.That being said...Pollan went on several rants only tenuously connected to his topics. Notably, his nostalgia for an agrarian/culinary past that, to use the phrase of Jello Biafra ""never existed."" Pollan seems oblivious to his own level of wealth and privelege. He emphasizes that he braises ""cheap"" pieces of meat. Has he compared the price of a brisket to chicken? bologna? a can of beans? He spends days at a time on breads, insisting that he can ""get writing done"" in between turns and rises. Not everyone is a freelance writer, buddy. Try making a braise and two sourdoughs a week working 9-5.My final criticism is his love of ""artisans"" while scoffing at anything remotely automated. The problem is that for artisans (of food and everything else) it's a labor of love. An independent baker selling high-end sourdough might be carrying on a food tradition or whatever, but the forklift operator, truck driver, QC specialist, etc. at the Wonder-bread plant he's so quick to dismiss have mentally and physically demanding jobs, with some security, benefits, and disposable income that the starving artist-baker lacks. Does Pollan really envision a bucolic future of nothing but cottage industries? Who would have the income to buy his books?The joke's on him, I took it out of the library.In conclusion- Pollan is an entertaining and gripping writer who has sought out some very interesting characters in the American foodscape. Parts of this book rehash ""Omnivore's Dilema,"" but hey. What can you do? If this were a bad book, I wouldn't have finished it. It's honestly good writing, somewhat choppy, and somewhat obsessive about certain details (raising dough) while ignoring others (Pollan's wealth, and location in the foodie Island of the Bay Area.)"
247,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/867628-catherine,3,"Where has our love gone, Michael? This is the fourth of your books that I've read, which is somewhat fitting, considering your obsession with that number. Second Nature: four seasons, Omnivore's Dilemma: four meals, Botany of Desire: four plants, and with this book four methods of food preparation. I was really excited about a new book from you, as I really enjoyed those three earlier books, despite your tendency to ramble and repeat. When an acquaintance told me how much she enjoyed this book (her first experience with you), I quickly recommended the others and offered to swap her OD for this one. And yet...somehow I just can't get into it. Maybe it's that you're again preaching your slow food message and I've already joined the choir. Maybe it's the current heat wave that makes the subject of cooking less appealing. Maybe it's my stack of novels and lighter non-fiction driving me to distraction. Whatever the cause(s), I'm going to return this copy to the owner (since I've had it for three or four weeks already) and track down a library copy later when cooking and, let's be honest...you, Michael, sound more appealing.Update: it took me almost 7 years, but I finally finished this book! This time, I started with the section on yeast breads, focusing on sourdough. I've experimented with sourdough a couple times since reading Sourdough (and started a new one after finishing the book), so I had more connection to Pollan's experiences than the previous sections. The final section, in which he discusses fermentation (of vegetables, cheese, and alcohol) was also really interesting, especially the American-born nun making traditional cheese in a French convent. For me, the second half of the book was much stronger. "
248,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793094-lisa,5,"Michael Pollan has written another book about food; this time he researches the history of cooking. He focuses on cooking using the classic elements of fire, water, air, and earth.The section on fire focuses almost exclusively on smoking pork, which is something I enjoy doing. For those of you that have never enjoyed barbeque or smoking, you might not connect with this section like I did. Smoked pork (and chicken) is so good, it is worth the effort to try to perfect your efforts! Take a look at my video on smoking Boston Butts: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U2--A...I have videos on smoking chicken, salmon filets, and ribs; smoked food is so good and it is fun to connect with nature to prepare food!In the section on cooking with water, Pollan uses a pot to slow cook various delicious dishes. He talked about the time and effort to cook slowly on the stovetop. I had to wonder why he didn't even try using a crockpot or slow cooker! Nonetheless, all of the food sounded really good!The section on air focused on making bread and I almost wanted to make a loaf myself, but then I remembered how addictive bread out of the oven tastes! It was very interesting!Lastly, Pollan focused on ""earth"" as an element of cooking. Any guess what that could be? I never would have guessed, but it is fermentation. This was my least favorite section because I don't drink, but it was interesting to listen to how Pollan made his own beer. There are many health benefits to eating foods like yogurt that use something like fermentation to grow the cultures. While I eat yogurt every day, I am too much of a wimp to eat the other foods Pollan highlighted.Of course, Pollan could not resist discussing how many people no longer cook--or they heat prepared food and call that cooking. I found all of that fascinating because I do not buy many prepared foods; however, I buy more than I thought!I listened to this audiobook while gardening and loved it! "
249,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,4,"“I found that, much like gardening, most cooking manages to be agreeably absorbing without being too demanding intellectually. It leaves plenty of mental space for daydreaming and reflection.” ― Michael Pollan, Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation In Cooked Michael Pollan stays close to his food roots.

Unless, of course, Pollan is going to delve into the proper way to digest, poop, or compost your waste. And... he might just. I am neither a Pollan lover or hater. I've read a bunch of his stuff because it is fast and rather tasty. The problem with Pollan is reading too much of him. His books are a bit full of roughage and eventually too much of his raw idealism or fiber-rich localism gets to you. I think that is the problem with idealists and their genius (genus?). No one can quite live upto the expectations. There just isn't that many locally grown mushrooms, or farmer's markets, or grass-fed organic beef. But education about farming, feasting, and cooking gives us a better sense of both the idea and the real. As long as we are aware of the costs of the way we eat and the way we cook, we are better than we started. The probelm comes in when we believe ALL the hype. As long as you can remain pragmatic about food and Pollan, reading him is a good thing."

If there ever was a more tedious and odious exercise in navel gazing, I'd be impressed.I must confess I am baffled by this book. Who is the audience? Is it local foodies who are already converted? In which case, why on earth must the author keep telling us again and again and again how awesome cooking is? We get it, we're the choir, quit your preaching.Or perhaps the audience is the mass produced shrink-wrap microwave toting loner. In which case, hearing someone pontificate on and on and on about the joys of combining heat with edible things is also pointlessly preachy, and Mr Pollan does an abysmal sales job here.The problem is that Mr Pollan has completely and totally run out of things to say. As a result, this book is basically reworking the same sentence over and over again using different combinations of words. So to save the hapless potential victim from having to wade through a few hundred pages of tedium, I'd suggest instead spending the next hour rearranging any subset of these words into as many variations as you can:Heavenly, nature, cooking, is, god, primitive man, plants, aroma, animal sacrifice, producesHour over? You're welcome, I just saved you many more hours of your precious time. You can spend the remaining 5-6 you have left over from not reading this book staring blankly into space, it'll be more meaningful and more likely to result in food related insights."

That how to make bolonaise was a revelation to the author was more telling of him than other informational bits. I have a friend whose husband doesn't know how to turn on his oven. That said, I agree 100 percent with the author about the practice of making meals as being healthy and a good practice. I think he is a fine author and I look forward to his next book.

I really enjoyed the theme of looking at how we use different elements to cook (fire, water, air, earth). It was an enjoyable way to think about the complexity of a task which we used to do daily, but in which industrial societies have been eschewing."

So, when this book was published, I really looked forward to reading it. I love his ability to take the science and technical aspects of food and nutrition and make them fascinating.I thought that it was quite appropriate that I read this book during a holiday centered around cooking and eating: Thanksgiving. I love cooking for our family, and I try hard to share that love with our girls, teaching them the simple concepts that I know and showing them how easy it is for a parent who works out of the home to prepare a home-cooked meal using little to no prepared foods. This book really shows the genesis of human cooking and the emotional and primal urges behind what and how we cook. In four different parts (fire, water, air, and earth), he describes different ways we engage with food. I'm not sure what happened - I read the first three parts in the span of just one day, but then I was overwhelmed with other books that I needed to read (for my book club or because they were coming due), and this book was pushed to the side for over a month. Finally, I decided I needed to finish it (I'm sure it's coming due soon!) and I tackled the fourth part in one day. So, while it looks like I took my sweet time, I just had a big break in between.interesting quotes:""Once cooking allowed us to expand our cognitive capacity at the expense of our digestive capacity, there was no going back: Our big brains and tiny guts now depended on a diet of cooked food.""

255,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67444659-katie-hamilton,4,"""...cheese was not so much an invention as a discovery."" Yet another masterpiece by Pollan, Cooked is an anthropological, sociological, ethnographical, and humorous narrative just as engulfing as his others. Whether you are a professional chef or a lover of food, this book makes you hungry...for more. "
256,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65459284-paul,4,How is Brandon Sanderson considered a better writer by reviews than Michael Pollan?
257,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8561-yune,4,"Pollan has an easy, friendly, and persuasive writing style that managed to draw me away from another book I'd pre-ordered in two formats when Cooked happened to show up on the library hold shelf on the other book's release date.He's best when he's describing his own experiences or describing micro-science to a layman; I found him a little less convincing and slightly on the side of pretentious when he indulged in wide-scale anthropological musings or symbolism along the lines of the four elements he uses to organize this book: fire (barbecue), water (braises), air (bread), and earth (fermented foods, like sauerkraut and beer). I would've been totally fine with section headings with the food name.I was actually surprised to discover that he wasn't already an expert cook; one of his previous books, The Omnivore's Dilemma, had so incisively made the case for eating in a wholesome manner that I'd assumed he had mastered this skill. But this book is the story of his education in various culinary arenas, and as he manages gain tutelage under acclaimed pit masters and bakers, he--and I--became engrossed in his teachers' personal stories and the philosophies that brought them to the mastery of their crafts. (Or the philosophies that developed because of those crafts.)Thus you meet such interesting folks as the ""cheese nun,"" who managed to get the state health inspector to stand down in an otherwise shrill war about raw milk...by a scientific experiment:A nun's habit and a Ph.D. in microbiology--the abbey sent her to the University of Connecticut so that she might better be able to defend her cheese, both from pathogens and from public health authorities--are an unbeatable combination, and, so far at least, the FDA has thought better than to mess with Sister Noëlla, even as the agency has come down hard on many other raw-milk cheese makers.This lovely sly humor is on display several times, often parenthetically, such as when he describes a 300-year-old fermentation pit:The breadfruit in it had been reduced to a sour mush, but it was reported to be ""still in edible condition."" (You first.)It was interesting how each type of training received different treatment in Pollan's words. The whole pig barbecue ended up making me think more about the sweaty insanity of the chopping block afterward, while trying to feed thousands of hungry people; the year of weekly braising lessons felt prosaic, free of any sudden revelations, although Pollan admits to using what he learned here the most frequently afterward. His description of the bread-making process was utterly engrossing to me (a non-baker from a rice-centric culture), from how he coaxed the starter yeast to the shaping of the dough. His satisfaction rose almost palpably off the bread as he broke the crust of his efforts.And although he dips into scientific explanations whenever he sees fit, pointing out the chemical processes behind caramelization or the nutrients that separate whole wheat flour from white, he delves most deeply into the question of human interaction with internal bacteria: the gut microflora that actually does a lot of the work in keeping us healthy, and how hyper-sanitized environments and antibiotics can devastate this balance. Mary Roach also devotes some time to this in Gulp, and I anticipate a popular science book on the subject soon. Pollan himself doesn't subscribe to the ""kombucha will cure AIDS!"" line of ""let the bacteria grow wild and free!"" thinking, but he does make a strong case for eating less sterile food.Note: To his credit, Pollan does acknowledge head-on the gender imbalance that tends to accompany kitchen duties, without letting the discussion devour the book. In general I found him to be cognizant of the larger issues lying behind his personal quest, whether it be food industry lobbying power or cultural values, but touching upon them only gently.Quite a satisfying read, although I think it's best viewed more along memoirish lines than the sort of societal revolution hinted at in The Omnivore's Dilemma. And the ending was more powerful than those of many novels I've read."
258,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1020899-patty,3,"“Cooking is all about connection, I've learned, between us and other species, other times, other cultures (human and microbial both), but, most important, other people. Cooking is one of the more beautiful forms that human generosity takes; that much I sort of knew. But the very best cooking, I discovered, is also a form of intimacy.”This is the third book that I have read by Pollan. He started by writing about gardening and naturally moved on to food and cooking. I started with The Omnivore’s Dilemma and skipped the gardening books. (I really should go back to those – I like reading about gardening even though I don’t like gardening much.) All three of these books about food have been interesting and enlightening.When I did my review for The Omnivore’s Dilemma, I wrote, “For me this is what makes a good read. I get immersed in the book; I learn new things and for at least some of the time I am thinking about the book and author even when I am not reading the book.” That was true for this book as well. I listened to this and since it took more than thirteen hours, it was with me for a long time. I enjoyed thinking through Pollan’s theories about how the four elements reflect the four ways of cooking and meeting several chefs, bakers, cheesmakers and brewers. I will look at cooking a bit differently because of this book."
259,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/619524-jaysi,3,3.5 stars and only because I hold Pollen to a higher standard and liked his other books more. 
260,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/427611-karen-a,5,"This book has made me rethink many aspects of cooking. Especially how I cook. It is divided into 4 parts, fire, water, air, and earth all corresponding to specific methods of cooking. The fire portion was probably my least favorite and has made it even less likely that I will take up roasting a pig. And some of his comments about the pork industry, though brief, have made me pass up the pork section altogether at the grocery store. Enlightening are his observations about how we perceive the time it takes to cook and based on our perception that it is laborious and time consuming we have surrendered our meal preparation duties to large industry, an industry that has neither health nor quality at the core of its interests. And he counters that quick meal preparation is not so quick and the time it took him and his family to defrost and cook frozen meals he could easily have made a braise. Pollan also reveals what goes into a loaf of bread and how the baker’s pursuit of a light loaf full of air has caused a whole wheat industry to subvert the nutrition of the grain. My favorite part of this book however is the fourth and final part – earth which he dedicates to the art of fermenting. The whole concept of food decaying and then being turned into something not only particular to region and culture but actually good for the human gut is very intriguing and he does a great job of exploring what is going on with this process on a micro level. Also included in the portion of the book is cheese making. His works with the nun, Sister Noella, who makes cheese the old fashion way in large oak barrels contrary to FDA regulations and contrary to our own ideas of what will make the safest product to eat. But Sister Noella has done her homework (doctorate in microbiology) and can prove that the oak barrels produce a more stable product than the steel barrels used by the rest of the industry. While I wish Pollan would have put some of the same time and effort into the cheese portion of the book that he did for the pork roasting, he does do just enough where one will want to know more. In fact I think most of the book does and excellent job of whetting the appetite so to speak for a real discussion about our notions of convenience, health, taste, and how we cook. I really hope this fans the small flames for the trend to cook at home. It really is better in every way. "
261,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419307-rachel,2,"I thought I liked Michael Pollan's writing. Have I changed, or has he?This book had some good content, but Pollan's writing really got in the way. It read like the writing of someone who has gotten a little overconfident in the value of their interests and opinions to others, someone who loves their own writing a little too much, someone who was perhaps reluctant to seek the editing help they really needed.My problems with Pollan's writing are:1) He hammers his points home to the extent of sounding pedantic and condescending. Yes, cooking is the thing that separates us humans from animals, I get it. Now you're telling it to me another twenty times in twenty not-different-enough ways?2) Indulgent digression - between this and point #2, the book could have been cut down by about 100 pages into a much stronger, poignant book.3) Overwrought sentences and flimsy connections drawn between food and other things. Do the following excerpts not make you want to kind of throw up a little of the beautiful braise you just ate:""...it is the very allusiveness of cooked food that appeals to us, as indeed that same quality does in poetry or music or art. We gravitate toward complexity and metaphor, it seems, and putting fire to meat, or fermenting fruit and grain, gives us both: more sheer sensory information and, specifically, sensory information that, like metaphor, points away from the here and now. This sensory metaphor--this stands for that--is one of the most important transformations of nature wrought by cooking. And so a piece of crisped pigskin becomes a densely allusive poem of flavors...""""Elation, effervescence, elevation, levity, inspiration: air words all, alveolated with vowels, leavening the dough of everyday life.""Ick. And that's only one of several times he ""cleverly"" uses ""leaven."" We get it, Pollan. It's a bread word and you applied it to stuff that isn't bread.Just so tiresome, but I stuck with it because I liked the idea of the book, and some of the content was good. The discussion of bacterial flora did a good job of addressing a new topic in food and health, for example. But this might be the last Pollan book I read."
262,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,3,"I enjoy cooking and eating, but I don't read Michael Pollan's books – this is at least my third – for the food. If so, I would never have finished this. I am a vegetarian, and the first half of Cooked is about barbecue and braising – the smells of cooking pig flesh! – so not my favorite.I read Pollan's books for his curiosity. They are as much or more about the science of cooking and the philosophy of living. You have to be ready to geek out about everything that you come across. You need to be willing to stop and question all sorts of things: nutrition, chemistry, history, politics, gender.What was the single most important thing we could do as a family to improve our health and general well-being? And what would be a good way to better connect to my teenage son?.... Other questions were slightly more political in nature. For years I had been trying to determine (because I am often asked) what is the most important thing an ordinary person can do to help reform the American food system, to make it healthier and more sustainable? Another related question is, how can people living in a highly specialized consumer economy reduce their sense of dependence and achieve a greater degree of self-sufficiency? And then there were the more philosophical questions, the ones I’ve been chewing on since I first started writing books. How, in our everyday lives, can we acquire a deeper understanding of the natural world and our species’ peculiar role in it? (Kindle 96)Pollan goes straight to the horse's mouth to learn about food and cooking. Then he goes to another expert until he begins to work on his own. And he talks about his errors rather than dodging them. For Pollan, mistakes are an opportunity to learn, to understand. He is willing to throw out standard thinking. (Are antibiotics a good thing or not? What about pasteurization?) And, he takes us along for the ride.This is a lovely ride."
263,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14773738-julie,5,"This is another excellent offering by Michael Pollan who, since The Omnivore's Dilemma has become my favourite go-to person in all things food related. Admittedly, this was slightly less interesting to me than Pollan's Dilemma, but only because I've already experienced all the joys of being Cooked -- pun intended. For all those who have yet to experience the transformative power of being the master/mistress of one's own hearth, this is a must read. Twice.This is not a recipe book -- far from it, albeit Pollan does throw in a few handy recipes at the very end, based on the four elements he explores: fire, water, air and earth; in essence, the touchstone elements of our universe, and our humanity. This is more a book on the nature of cooking: the whys and wherefores of throwing that first chunk of meat over burning coals, and then of maybe tossing in a tuber or two for good measure. With this simple action, we defined our humanity, Pollan postulates, and it is this that made us stand taller than the apes, once and for all.He also dabbles in the mysticism of cooking, the art of alchemical transformation of both the eaten, and the eater. It is a magical read -- and unlike Pollan's Dilemma which left me never wanting to eat (industrial) food ever again, this book left me ravenous. It is an exceptional testament to why we should all engage in the action of feeding ourselves -- quite literally. The action of going to the market and buying packaged and frozen food-like substances is not cooking, and offers absolutely nothing to our nutritional intake, either chemically or spiritually, Pollan offers. Rather, we need to be closer than arm's length from the veggies and the meats we slide down our gullets: we need to understand how much nourishment actually lies in the act of preparation. Full stars."
264,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19059096-jill,4,"Usually I read Michael Pollan to feel distressed (but not awash), and ashamed (but not hopeless). But Cooked is Pollan at his most optimistic. While conscientious as always, he sets out in this book not to acquaint us with the grim facts of our world and its consumers’ decisions; rather, he illustrates the wonders of what we as individuals can do. And what we can do is, obviously: cook. Cook in informed, ambitious ways that link us to the ground, to plants and animals and microbes, to farmers and other producers, and to the people in our lives for whom we cook. This book is part of the antidote to the problems laid out in Omnivore’s Dilemma and In Defense of Food. It's structured “by element,” wherein Pollan discusses cooking with fire (such as in the barbecue pits of North Carolina), water (braises and pot-cooking), air (with bread-masters from all over) and earth (fermentation.) Fair warning: you find yourself fairly deep in the weeds of the chemical processes of the latter two topics – as other reviewers before me have found, these chapters are slower to get through than the first half.Cooked veers toward personal anecdotes, nutrition, chemistry, social history, mythology, and even psychology as necessary. Pollan delivers every discussion with the deftness and humility we expect from him. The writing’s great, the subjects are varied, and the tone is encouraging. Four solid stars."
265,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1706153-meghan,5,"Months after finishing this, I feel obligated to bump it up to 5 stars. The Pollanesqe pedantic tone that starts this book off is the only reason that my initial grade was a 4.5 for me, but even that can be kind of endearing... I very regularly felt like I was reading a book by my dad. However, each chapter drew me into a very dreamy, delighted state of reading. I love the path that weaves through research and literature, mixed with Pollan's interactions with fascinating expert cooks as well as his own cooking adventures. I was surprised, inspired, and impressed constantly. This is one book that I'm very happy to own, because even before I finished it I was tempted to refer back to previous chapters as a reference for some real life situation or another. It prompted me to talk about food with people a lot more, and I definitely feel inspired to branch out of my cooking comfort zone. For anyone why might appreciate some background or perspective on the practice of cooking, this is a fabulous choice.I was reading Ecotopia at the same time, a novel that complemented this one very well. Aaaand up next: Moyasimon: Tales of Agriculture, Volume 2, the world of microbes! ""Everything is everywhere."""
266,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4504899-becki-iverson,5,"As always, Michael Pollan's new book ""Cooked"" is an impeccably researched, beautifully written and hands-on journey through the four foundational methods of cooking. Stylistically, it is essentially a mash-up of the styles of his previous books into a snazzy new package - the four pillars of ""Botany of Desire,"" the hands on creation and eating in ""Omnivore's Dilemma,"" and the modern food science vs. traditional eats breakdown of ""In Defense of Food."" The result is glorious(although at very rare instances almost too brainy). Pollan is a deceptively excellent writer who is capable of making extraordinarily complex concepts and terms accessible to nearly anyone; thus, it is easy to forgive him when he goes a bit awry. I would have liked just a little more description of the work Pollan was doing himself on the cooking; more in depth interviews/apprenticeships, or more recipes. But either way, it's been a while since his last book, and it's good to see Pollan in print again."
267,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1386971-marieke,4,"I really enjoyed this. I have officially abandoned my Michael Pollan hater stance. I misunderstood him. I might even give Botany of Desire another chance.Now I will ramble:I'm a little jealous that he gets to write these glorified stunt books that are so appealingly nerdy.Now I'm going to start my starter...it's time to take my bread baking to the next level...I don't think I'll be roasting any whole pigs, though. However, listening to that part of the book did take me down memory lane to summer camp as a kid. Every summer we did ""Ham in a Pit,"" and we had to take turns in pairs overnight to keep watch. I don't remember what I actually thought of the resulting food, though. One last thought: germ is my copilot...this book made me really consider dirtiness and how we seem to be really screwing ourselves over. Oh well, we are evolutionary creatures and somehow we will adapt."
268,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2675284-mollie,4,"I finished listening to the audiobook yesterday and have been considering how to review it. I liked the author's way of encouraging the reader to establish a relationship with food based on ""meaning."" As well as his invitation to ""join the makers of the world.""I admired the breadth of his investigation, his knowledge base.The author reads the book. His inflections added meaning, deepened my relationship with the subject matter. Sometimes his calming voice induced drowsiness; after all, the book does not have a rousing plot.But today, I notice that I miss his soothing voice speaking to me of a recently discovered detail of food preparation. It is as if I now set one less place at my table."
269,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6236139-michael-jones,4,"This was one of those books where at many points I wished I could be the author! To sample the barbecue in the South, or cheeses in France--oooh!The author uses stories to tell you how he learned about different kinds of foods and their origins. Actually very informative if you want to learn about whole foods and there is much science here. But the sciences in the context of relationships with real people who understand these foods. He hits most of the major types of food that we consume.This book would be an important read for someone who is basically only eating a standard American diet (SAD). It will open your eyes to new food horizons and could help you understand why eating real food makes you much happier and healthier."

Our ancestors started cooking at some point because the addition of heat allowed them to get a lot more nutrients from a lot more natural foods. Unfortunately, we have moved further and further away from it since the global boom in convenience foods. The following still applies today: Those who cook at home with natural ingredients are by far the healthiest (Blinkist, 2020)."
271,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53971695-stijn-zanders,5,"A book that inspires, Pollan writes the book around the idea that cooking is much more than just preparing food. He does this by diving into the four elements: fire, water, air and earth. Especially the last two parts that go into the baking of sour dough bread and fermentation are invaluable!"
272,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,4,"""In Cooked, Michael Pollan explores the previously uncharted territory of his own kitchen. Here, he discovers the enduring power of the four classical elements—fire, water, air, and earth—to transform the stuff of nature into delicious things to eat and drink. Apprenticing himself to a succession of culinary masters, Pollan learns how to grill with fire, cook with liquid, bake bread, and ferment everything from cheese to beer.The effects of not cooking are similarly far reaching. Relying upon corporations to process our food means we consume large quantities of fat, sugar, and salt; disrupt an essential link to the natural world; and weaken our relationships with family and friends. In fact, Cooked argues, taking back control of cooking may be the single most important step anyone can take to help make the American food system healthier and more sustainable. Reclaiming cooking as an act of enjoyment and self-reliance, learning to perform the magic of these everyday transformations, opens the door to a more nourishing life.""I have to say that I appreciate an author who tells me that I am being subversive or rebellious if I cook. It’s one of the few forms of rebelliousness to which I wholeheartedly subscribe. Having read Salt Sugar Fat by Michael Moss last year, I been working diligently at eliminating processed foods from my diet—easier said than done! Especially when one is also attempting to go gluten-free. I have many happy memories of cooking on the farm where I grew up. We knew the cows that provided our milk, the chickens that laid our eggs and the cattle and pigs that provided each evening’s main course. Sometimes Mom would even mention them by name as she served up supper. I have been in quest of a real pork chop for some time now and think I have found a butcher shop that provides a product very, very close to my idealized memories. One of the things which struck me when I moved to the city was the lack of taste in the meat and vegetables purchased from the chain grocery stores. Carrots from a chain store are more like wood than like vegetables and tomatoes are hard and tasteless compared to those we grew in our garden (fertilized with well-aged, long composted animal manure).  The problem, for me at least, is one of time. I love to cook and bake—but I also work full time and enjoy a busy social life. Having read Cooked, I can see that I will start attempting to schedule more cooking time into my life—in the past, I have whiled away many happy hours stirring soup pots, checking on oven contents and poking at dough. It’s time to return that gentle form of rebellion to my life on a regular basis."

As someone who cooks 90% of her meals from scratch this had my interest from the first chapter but I wondered how long it would last. After all, what was going to be ""news"" to me at this point. Well, it turns out...a lot!The book is filled with facts, anecdotes and hands on experiences of the author. Topics covered include real barbequing, braises, bread making and fermentation. I have actually caught myself discussing this book at length with my foodie friends and family. My husband was woken up a few times to hear a paragraph or two that struck a chord with me and I felt the need to discuss or share. He's been patient...but I wonder if it was so I could create the recipes at the back of the book. I will be on the lookout for a crock for some sauerkraut...my hubby's parents make this but now I have a stronger urge to try it out.Interesting, intellectual and inspiring! Well written and well documented.On a final note...it was peanut free so it's safe for everyone. ;)"
274,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8986610-chris,3,"This was a good book if you're interested in the anatomy of cooking. Michael Pollan is one of my favorite food writers and I always enjoy his books, this one as well. However, this was a little too in depth for me.Michael explores the four realms of cooking in this book, Fire, Water, Air and Earth. For Fire, he uses whole hog barbeque. For Water, he explores braising. For air, his example is baking bread. For Earth he uses fermentation. Basically, he breaks all of these cooking methods down to the smallest elements and builds on it.My final thought on this book is that it was interesting, but if your not really into cooking/food then this book may be too much for you."
275,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1063843-sarah-hauck,4,"In his latest book, Cooked, Michael Pollan serves up another bestseller that looks at the relationships between us and the food we eat. Struck by the realization that “the less cooking we were doing in our own lives, the more that food and its vicarious preparation transfixed us,” Pollan sets out to explore the art of cooking for himself.Cooked reads like a how-to book for the uninitiated in the kitchen while still providing plenty of more detailed analysis for seasoned cooks. Divided into chapters based on the four classical elements – Earth, Water, Air and Fire – Pollan personally explores the world of cooking where “the stuff of nature gets transformed into the things we eat and drink.”In each chapter, Pollan learns about a corresponding cooking style: in Fire, he gets grilling lessons from a North Carolina barbecue pit master; in Water, he masters braises; in Air, he experiments with bread baking as he seeks to perfect the perfect sourdough loaf; and finally, in Earth, he explores various types of fermentation including pickling, cheese making and home brewing.Along the way, each of his teachers – from “the cheese nun” with a Ph.D. in microbiology to the “most famous fermentor in America” – is whole-heartedly devoted to his or her craft and, in the end, getting a glimpse into their lives and work is half the fun of the book.I’ve been a Michael Pollan fan since I first cracked the spine of The Botany of Desire more than a decade ago, but even I’ll admit, there are a few points in the narrative where even the most devout reader’s eyes may start to glaze over… like when Pollan gets mired in the details of the “all-important Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis” microbe. But only briefly. Because along with straight-up cool science, he also mixes into his narrative a bit of history, art and literature along with a dash of religion (“bread… is an everyday proof of the possibility of transcendence” and sex for good measure (“a cheese that stinks – of manure, of sex – offers a relatively safe way for us to flirt with forbidden desires”).As in his previous books, Pollan extolls the ills (literally) of processed foods and cautions against our over-reliance on corporations, “whose ‘dead food’ is damaging our health and ‘homogenizing’ our experience.”When asked why we don’t spend more time preparing our own meals, apparently most people claim a lack of time. But Pollan points out that, “in the last decade or so, we’ve all found two hours a day to be on line outside of work.” So what gives?Another entire book could be devoted to answering that question, but Pollan doesn’t take on that job in Cooked. Instead, he argues that we would all do well to start getting reacquainted with our kitchens because “cooking is one of the most interesting and worthwhile things we humans do.”While it may be cheaper and easier to rely on others to provide for our basic needs, “to live that way comes at a price, not least to our sense of competence and independence.” We are so disconnected from the makers of our food, Pollan argues, that we stop thinking about what is actually in the food we eat or where it comes from, much less the labor, money or energy it took to get it onto our plate. Worst of all, we forget that “what presents itself to us in the marketplace as a product is in truth a web of relationships between people… and all the other species on which we still depend.” (Yes, even bacteria.)In the end, Cooked turns out to be a commentary on the way we live. It’s true, as in his past books, that Pollan is critical of capitalism, and in particular consumerism, as the downfall of democracy and independence in its most literal sense. The antidote (or part of it, anyway) that he offers up here is cooking. To cook, he says, is to reclaim a bit of independence, and perhaps a bit of pride as well. It’s what separates us from the rest of the natural world and, paradoxically, also what keeps us connected to it.It is also an invitation to modern society (that’s you and me) to reconnect with the world. It’s true that few of us have the luxury of spending hours in the kitchen making all of our meals from scratch, but even small culinary contributions help us to reconnect with the natural world around us. As Pollan himself admits, “The most important thing I learned … is how cooking implicates us in a whole web of social and ecological relationships: with plants and animals, with the soil, with farmers, with the microbes both inside and outside our bodies, and, of course, with the people our cooking nourishes and delights.” And he invites us “to alter, however slightly, the ratio between production and consumption” in our lives.This, he believes, can make a difference. After trying his hand at home brewing, Pollan says, “The beer in that bottle, I’m reminded as soon as I brew it myself, ultimately comes not from a factory, but from nature – from a field of barley snapping in the wind, from a hops vine clambering over a trellis, from a host of invisible microbes feasting on sugars.”So, if preparing our own home-cooked meals makes us think just a little bit more about the world around us and how, ultimately, we all depend on one another to survive, then certainly a little time with a knife and cutting board won’t hurt anyone.For novices in the kitchen – or first-time Pollan readers – Cooked is sure to whet your appetite. For the rest of us, it is the continuation of an ongoing commentary on food, nature and modern society that will not fail to satisfy."
276,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10987540-ben,3,"It's difficult to rate a book which was very enjoyable to read, but fraught with quirks of Pollan's writing style and ideology. I'll write this review as a ""compliment sandwich."" To begin: The chapters on Barbeque (Fire) and Bread (Air) were particularly strong and interesting. I enjoyed the attention he gave to food research at UC Davis, and was glad to see him visit some interesting operations in Yolo County.That being said...Pollan went on several rants only tenuously connected to his topics. Notably, his nostalgia for an agrarian/culinary past that, to use the phrase of Jello Biafra ""never existed."" Pollan seems oblivious to his own level of wealth and privelege. He emphasizes that he braises ""cheap"" pieces of meat. Has he compared the price of a brisket to chicken? bologna? a can of beans? He spends days at a time on breads, insisting that he can ""get writing done"" in between turns and rises. Not everyone is a freelance writer, buddy. Try making a braise and two sourdoughs a week working 9-5.My final criticism is his love of ""artisans"" while scoffing at anything remotely automated. The problem is that for artisans (of food and everything else) it's a labor of love. An independent baker selling high-end sourdough might be carrying on a food tradition or whatever, but the forklift operator, truck driver, QC specialist, etc. at the Wonder-bread plant he's so quick to dismiss have mentally and physically demanding jobs, with some security, benefits, and disposable income that the starving artist-baker lacks. Does Pollan really envision a bucolic future of nothing but cottage industries? Who would have the income to buy his books?The joke's on him, I took it out of the library.In conclusion- Pollan is an entertaining and gripping writer who has sought out some very interesting characters in the American foodscape. Parts of this book rehash ""Omnivore's Dilema,"" but hey. What can you do? If this were a bad book, I wouldn't have finished it. It's honestly good writing, somewhat choppy, and somewhat obsessive about certain details (raising dough) while ignoring others (Pollan's wealth, and location in the foodie Island of the Bay Area.)"
277,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/867628-catherine,3,"Where has our love gone, Michael? This is the fourth of your books that I've read, which is somewhat fitting, considering your obsession with that number. Second Nature: four seasons, Omnivore's Dilemma: four meals, Botany of Desire: four plants, and with this book four methods of food preparation. I was really excited about a new book from you, as I really enjoyed those three earlier books, despite your tendency to ramble and repeat. When an acquaintance told me how much she enjoyed this book (her first experience with you), I quickly recommended the others and offered to swap her OD for this one. And yet...somehow I just can't get into it. Maybe it's that you're again preaching your slow food message and I've already joined the choir. Maybe it's the current heat wave that makes the subject of cooking less appealing. Maybe it's my stack of novels and lighter non-fiction driving me to distraction. Whatever the cause(s), I'm going to return this copy to the owner (since I've had it for three or four weeks already) and track down a library copy later when cooking and, let's be honest...you, Michael, sound more appealing.Update: it took me almost 7 years, but I finally finished this book! This time, I started with the section on yeast breads, focusing on sourdough. I've experimented with sourdough a couple times since reading Sourdough (and started a new one after finishing the book), so I had more connection to Pollan's experiences than the previous sections. The final section, in which he discusses fermentation (of vegetables, cheese, and alcohol) was also really interesting, especially the American-born nun making traditional cheese in a French convent. For me, the second half of the book was much stronger. "
278,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793094-lisa,5,"Michael Pollan has written another book about food; this time he researches the history of cooking. He focuses on cooking using the classic elements of fire, water, air, and earth.The section on fire focuses almost exclusively on smoking pork, which is something I enjoy doing. For those of you that have never enjoyed barbeque or smoking, you might not connect with this section like I did. Smoked pork (and chicken) is so good, it is worth the effort to try to perfect your efforts! Take a look at my video on smoking Boston Butts: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U2--A...I have videos on smoking chicken, salmon filets, and ribs; smoked food is so good and it is fun to connect with nature to prepare food!In the section on cooking with water, Pollan uses a pot to slow cook various delicious dishes. He talked about the time and effort to cook slowly on the stovetop. I had to wonder why he didn't even try using a crockpot or slow cooker! Nonetheless, all of the food sounded really good!The section on air focused on making bread and I almost wanted to make a loaf myself, but then I remembered how addictive bread out of the oven tastes! It was very interesting!Lastly, Pollan focused on ""earth"" as an element of cooking. Any guess what that could be? I never would have guessed, but it is fermentation. This was my least favorite section because I don't drink, but it was interesting to listen to how Pollan made his own beer. There are many health benefits to eating foods like yogurt that use something like fermentation to grow the cultures. While I eat yogurt every day, I am too much of a wimp to eat the other foods Pollan highlighted.Of course, Pollan could not resist discussing how many people no longer cook--or they heat prepared food and call that cooking. I found all of that fascinating because I do not buy many prepared foods; however, I buy more than I thought!I listened to this audiobook while gardening and loved it! "

It leaves plenty of mental space for daydreaming and reflection.” ― Michael Pollan, Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation In Cooked Michael Pollan stays close to his food roots. Similar in theme to: Omnivore's Dilema (Four Meals), In Defense of Food (Food Manifesto), Botany of Desire (Four Plants), Food Rules (Owner's Manual for Food), and Second Nature (Growing Food).Cooked is just another branch on the Phylogenetic food tree for the Pollan's Omnivore, me thinks. Unless, of course, Pollan is going to delve into the proper way to digest, poop, or compost your waste. And... he might just. I am neither a Pollan lover or hater. I've read a bunch of his stuff because it is fast and rather tasty. The problem with Pollan is reading too much of him. His books are a bit full of roughage and eventually too much of his raw idealism or fiber-rich localism gets to you. I think that is the problem with idealists and their genius (genus?). No one can quite live upto the expectations. There just isn't that many locally grown mushrooms, or farmer's markets, or grass-fed organic beef. But education about farming, feasting, and cooking gives us a better sense of both the idea and the real. As long as we are aware of the costs of the way we eat and the way we cook, we are better than we started. The probelm comes in when we believe ALL the hype. As long as you can remain pragmatic about food and Pollan, reading him is a good thing."

If there ever was a more tedious and odious exercise in navel gazing, I'd be impressed.I must confess I am baffled by this book. Who is the audience? Is it local foodies who are already converted? In which case, why on earth must the author keep telling us again and again and again how awesome cooking is? We get it, we're the choir, quit your preaching.Or perhaps the audience is the mass produced shrink-wrap microwave toting loner. In which case, hearing someone pontificate on and on and on about the joys of combining heat with edible things is also pointlessly preachy, and Mr Pollan does an abysmal sales job here.The problem is that Mr Pollan has completely and totally run out of things to say. As a result, this book is basically reworking the same sentence over and over again using different combinations of words. So to save the hapless potential victim from having to wade through a few hundred pages of tedium, I'd suggest instead spending the next hour rearranging any subset of these words into as many variations as you can:Heavenly, nature, cooking, is, god, primitive man, plants, aroma, animal sacrifice, producesHour over?

So, when this book was published, I really looked forward to reading it. I love his ability to take the science and technical aspects of food and nutrition and make them fascinating.I thought that it was quite appropriate that I read this book during a holiday centered around cooking and eating: Thanksgiving. I love cooking for our family, and I try hard to share that love with our girls, teaching them the simple concepts that I know and showing them how easy it is for a parent who works out of the home to prepare a home-cooked meal using little to no prepared foods. This book really shows the genesis of human cooking and the emotional and primal urges behind what and how we cook. In four different parts (fire, water, air, and earth), he describes different ways we engage with food. I'm not sure what happened - I read the first three parts in the span of just one day, but then I was overwhelmed with other books that I needed to read (for my book club or because they were coming due), and this book was pushed to the side for over a month. Finally, I decided I needed to finish it (I'm sure it's coming due soon!) and I tackled the fourth part in one day.

286,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65459284-paul,4,How is Brandon Sanderson considered a better writer by reviews than Michael Pollan?
287,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8561-yune,4,"Pollan has an easy, friendly, and persuasive writing style that managed to draw me away from another book I'd pre-ordered in two formats when Cooked happened to show up on the library hold shelf on the other book's release date.He's best when he's describing his own experiences or describing micro-science to a layman; I found him a little less convincing and slightly on the side of pretentious when he indulged in wide-scale anthropological musings or symbolism along the lines of the four elements he uses to organize this book: fire (barbecue), water (braises), air (bread), and earth (fermented foods, like sauerkraut and beer). I would've been totally fine with section headings with the food name.I was actually surprised to discover that he wasn't already an expert cook; one of his previous books, The Omnivore's Dilemma, had so incisively made the case for eating in a wholesome manner that I'd assumed he had mastered this skill. But this book is the story of his education in various culinary arenas, and as he manages gain tutelage under acclaimed pit masters and bakers, he--and I--became engrossed in his teachers' personal stories and the philosophies that brought them to the mastery of their crafts. (Or the philosophies that developed because of those crafts.)Thus you meet such interesting folks as the ""cheese nun,"" who managed to get the state health inspector to stand down in an otherwise shrill war about raw milk...by a scientific experiment:A nun's habit and a Ph.D. in microbiology--the abbey sent her to the University of Connecticut so that she might better be able to defend her cheese, both from pathogens and from public health authorities--are an unbeatable combination, and, so far at least, the FDA has thought better than to mess with Sister Noëlla, even as the agency has come down hard on many other raw-milk cheese makers.This lovely sly humor is on display several times, often parenthetically, such as when he describes a 300-year-old fermentation pit:The breadfruit in it had been reduced to a sour mush, but it was reported to be ""still in edible condition."" (You first.)It was interesting how each type of training received different treatment in Pollan's words. The whole pig barbecue ended up making me think more about the sweaty insanity of the chopping block afterward, while trying to feed thousands of hungry people; the year of weekly braising lessons felt prosaic, free of any sudden revelations, although Pollan admits to using what he learned here the most frequently afterward. His description of the bread-making process was utterly engrossing to me (a non-baker from a rice-centric culture), from how he coaxed the starter yeast to the shaping of the dough. His satisfaction rose almost palpably off the bread as he broke the crust of his efforts.And although he dips into scientific explanations whenever he sees fit, pointing out the chemical processes behind caramelization or the nutrients that separate whole wheat flour from white, he delves most deeply into the question of human interaction with internal bacteria: the gut microflora that actually does a lot of the work in keeping us healthy, and how hyper-sanitized environments and antibiotics can devastate this balance. Mary Roach also devotes some time to this in Gulp, and I anticipate a popular science book on the subject soon. Pollan himself doesn't subscribe to the ""kombucha will cure AIDS!"" line of ""let the bacteria grow wild and free!"" thinking, but he does make a strong case for eating less sterile food.Note: To his credit, Pollan does acknowledge head-on the gender imbalance that tends to accompany kitchen duties, without letting the discussion devour the book. In general I found him to be cognizant of the larger issues lying behind his personal quest, whether it be food industry lobbying power or cultural values, but touching upon them only gently.Quite a satisfying read, although I think it's best viewed more along memoirish lines than the sort of societal revolution hinted at in The Omnivore's Dilemma. And the ending was more powerful than those of many novels I've read."

Cooking is one of the more beautiful forms that human generosity takes; that much I sort of knew. But the very best cooking, I discovered, is also a form of intimacy.”This is the third book that I have read by Pollan. He started by writing about gardening and naturally moved on to food and cooking. I started with The Omnivore’s Dilemma and skipped the gardening books. (I really should go back to those – I like reading about gardening even though I don’t like gardening much.) All three of these books about food have been interesting and enlightening.When I did my review for The Omnivore’s Dilemma, I wrote, “For me this is what makes a good read. I get immersed in the book; I learn new things and for at least some of the time I am thinking about the book and author even when I am not reading the book.” That was true for this book as well. I listened to this and since it took more than thirteen hours, it was with me for a long time. I enjoyed thinking through Pollan’s theories about how the four elements reflect the four ways of cooking and meeting several chefs, bakers, cheesmakers and brewers. I will look at cooking a bit differently because of this book."
289,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/619524-jaysi,3,3.5 stars and only because I hold Pollen to a higher standard and liked his other books more. 
290,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/427611-karen-a,5,"This book has made me rethink many aspects of cooking. Especially how I cook. It is divided into 4 parts, fire, water, air, and earth all corresponding to specific methods of cooking. The fire portion was probably my least favorite and has made it even less likely that I will take up roasting a pig. And some of his comments about the pork industry, though brief, have made me pass up the pork section altogether at the grocery store. Enlightening are his observations about how we perceive the time it takes to cook and based on our perception that it is laborious and time consuming we have surrendered our meal preparation duties to large industry, an industry that has neither health nor quality at the core of its interests. And he counters that quick meal preparation is not so quick and the time it took him and his family to defrost and cook frozen meals he could easily have made a braise. Pollan also reveals what goes into a loaf of bread and how the baker’s pursuit of a light loaf full of air has caused a whole wheat industry to subvert the nutrition of the grain. My favorite part of this book however is the fourth and final part – earth which he dedicates to the art of fermenting. The whole concept of food decaying and then being turned into something not only particular to region and culture but actually good for the human gut is very intriguing and he does a great job of exploring what is going on with this process on a micro level. Also included in the portion of the book is cheese making. His works with the nun, Sister Noella, who makes cheese the old fashion way in large oak barrels contrary to FDA regulations and contrary to our own ideas of what will make the safest product to eat. But Sister Noella has done her homework (doctorate in microbiology) and can prove that the oak barrels produce a more stable product than the steel barrels used by the rest of the industry. While I wish Pollan would have put some of the same time and effort into the cheese portion of the book that he did for the pork roasting, he does do just enough where one will want to know more. In fact I think most of the book does and excellent job of whetting the appetite so to speak for a real discussion about our notions of convenience, health, taste, and how we cook. I really hope this fans the small flames for the trend to cook at home. It really is better in every way. "
291,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419307-rachel,2,"I thought I liked Michael Pollan's writing. Have I changed, or has he?This book had some good content, but Pollan's writing really got in the way. It read like the writing of someone who has gotten a little overconfident in the value of their interests and opinions to others, someone who loves their own writing a little too much, someone who was perhaps reluctant to seek the editing help they really needed.My problems with Pollan's writing are:1) He hammers his points home to the extent of sounding pedantic and condescending. Yes, cooking is the thing that separates us humans from animals, I get it. Now you're telling it to me another twenty times in twenty not-different-enough ways?2) Indulgent digression - between this and point #2, the book could have been cut down by about 100 pages into a much stronger, poignant book.3) Overwrought sentences and flimsy connections drawn between food and other things. Do the following excerpts not make you want to kind of throw up a little of the beautiful braise you just ate:""...it is the very allusiveness of cooked food that appeals to us, as indeed that same quality does in poetry or music or art. We gravitate toward complexity and metaphor, it seems, and putting fire to meat, or fermenting fruit and grain, gives us both: more sheer sensory information and, specifically, sensory information that, like metaphor, points away from the here and now. This sensory metaphor--this stands for that--is one of the most important transformations of nature wrought by cooking. And so a piece of crisped pigskin becomes a densely allusive poem of flavors...""""Elation, effervescence, elevation, levity, inspiration: air words all, alveolated with vowels, leavening the dough of everyday life.""Ick. And that's only one of several times he ""cleverly"" uses ""leaven."" We get it, Pollan. It's a bread word and you applied it to stuff that isn't bread.Just so tiresome, but I stuck with it because I liked the idea of the book, and some of the content was good. The discussion of bacterial flora did a good job of addressing a new topic in food and health, for example. But this might be the last Pollan book I read."
292,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,3,"I enjoy cooking and eating, but I don't read Michael Pollan's books – this is at least my third – for the food. If so, I would never have finished this. I am a vegetarian, and the first half of Cooked is about barbecue and braising – the smells of cooking pig flesh! – so not my favorite.I read Pollan's books for his curiosity. They are as much or more about the science of cooking and the philosophy of living. You have to be ready to geek out about everything that you come across. You need to be willing to stop and question all sorts of things: nutrition, chemistry, history, politics, gender.What was the single most important thing we could do as a family to improve our health and general well-being? And what would be a good way to better connect to my teenage son?.... Other questions were slightly more political in nature. For years I had been trying to determine (because I am often asked) what is the most important thing an ordinary person can do to help reform the American food system, to make it healthier and more sustainable? Another related question is, how can people living in a highly specialized consumer economy reduce their sense of dependence and achieve a greater degree of self-sufficiency? And then there were the more philosophical questions, the ones I’ve been chewing on since I first started writing books. How, in our everyday lives, can we acquire a deeper understanding of the natural world and our species’ peculiar role in it? (Kindle 96)Pollan goes straight to the horse's mouth to learn about food and cooking. Then he goes to another expert until he begins to work on his own. And he talks about his errors rather than dodging them. For Pollan, mistakes are an opportunity to learn, to understand. He is willing to throw out standard thinking. (Are antibiotics a good thing or not? What about pasteurization?) And, he takes us along for the ride.This is a lovely ride."
293,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14773738-julie,5,"This is another excellent offering by Michael Pollan who, since The Omnivore's Dilemma has become my favourite go-to person in all things food related. Admittedly, this was slightly less interesting to me than Pollan's Dilemma, but only because I've already experienced all the joys of being Cooked -- pun intended. For all those who have yet to experience the transformative power of being the master/mistress of one's own hearth, this is a must read. Twice.This is not a recipe book -- far from it, albeit Pollan does throw in a few handy recipes at the very end, based on the four elements he explores: fire, water, air and earth; in essence, the touchstone elements of our universe, and our humanity. This is more a book on the nature of cooking: the whys and wherefores of throwing that first chunk of meat over burning coals, and then of maybe tossing in a tuber or two for good measure. With this simple action, we defined our humanity, Pollan postulates, and it is this that made us stand taller than the apes, once and for all.He also dabbles in the mysticism of cooking, the art of alchemical transformation of both the eaten, and the eater. It is a magical read -- and unlike Pollan's Dilemma which left me never wanting to eat (industrial) food ever again, this book left me ravenous. It is an exceptional testament to why we should all engage in the action of feeding ourselves -- quite literally. The action of going to the market and buying packaged and frozen food-like substances is not cooking, and offers absolutely nothing to our nutritional intake, either chemically or spiritually, Pollan offers. Rather, we need to be closer than arm's length from the veggies and the meats we slide down our gullets: we need to understand how much nourishment actually lies in the act of preparation. Full stars."
294,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19059096-jill,4,"Usually I read Michael Pollan to feel distressed (but not awash), and ashamed (but not hopeless). But Cooked is Pollan at his most optimistic. While conscientious as always, he sets out in this book not to acquaint us with the grim facts of our world and its consumers’ decisions; rather, he illustrates the wonders of what we as individuals can do. And what we can do is, obviously: cook. Cook in informed, ambitious ways that link us to the ground, to plants and animals and microbes, to farmers and other producers, and to the people in our lives for whom we cook. This book is part of the antidote to the problems laid out in Omnivore’s Dilemma and In Defense of Food. It's structured “by element,” wherein Pollan discusses cooking with fire (such as in the barbecue pits of North Carolina), water (braises and pot-cooking), air (with bread-masters from all over) and earth (fermentation.) Fair warning: you find yourself fairly deep in the weeds of the chemical processes of the latter two topics – as other reviewers before me have found, these chapters are slower to get through than the first half.Cooked veers toward personal anecdotes, nutrition, chemistry, social history, mythology, and even psychology as necessary. Pollan delivers every discussion with the deftness and humility we expect from him. The writing’s great, the subjects are varied, and the tone is encouraging. Four solid stars."
295,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1706153-meghan,5,"Months after finishing this, I feel obligated to bump it up to 5 stars. The Pollanesqe pedantic tone that starts this book off is the only reason that my initial grade was a 4.5 for me, but even that can be kind of endearing... I very regularly felt like I was reading a book by my dad. However, each chapter drew me into a very dreamy, delighted state of reading. I love the path that weaves through research and literature, mixed with Pollan's interactions with fascinating expert cooks as well as his own cooking adventures. I was surprised, inspired, and impressed constantly. This is one book that I'm very happy to own, because even before I finished it I was tempted to refer back to previous chapters as a reference for some real life situation or another. It prompted me to talk about food with people a lot more, and I definitely feel inspired to branch out of my cooking comfort zone. For anyone why might appreciate some background or perspective on the practice of cooking, this is a fabulous choice.I was reading Ecotopia at the same time, a novel that complemented this one very well. Aaaand up next: Moyasimon: Tales of Agriculture, Volume 2, the world of microbes! ""Everything is everywhere."""
296,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4504899-becki-iverson,5,"As always, Michael Pollan's new book ""Cooked"" is an impeccably researched, beautifully written and hands-on journey through the four foundational methods of cooking. Stylistically, it is essentially a mash-up of the styles of his previous books into a snazzy new package - the four pillars of ""Botany of Desire,"" the hands on creation and eating in ""Omnivore's Dilemma,"" and the modern food science vs. traditional eats breakdown of ""In Defense of Food."" The result is glorious(although at very rare instances almost too brainy). Pollan is a deceptively excellent writer who is capable of making extraordinarily complex concepts and terms accessible to nearly anyone; thus, it is easy to forgive him when he goes a bit awry. I would have liked just a little more description of the work Pollan was doing himself on the cooking; more in depth interviews/apprenticeships, or more recipes. But either way, it's been a while since his last book, and it's good to see Pollan in print again."
297,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1386971-marieke,4,"I really enjoyed this. I have officially abandoned my Michael Pollan hater stance. I misunderstood him. I might even give Botany of Desire another chance.Now I will ramble:I'm a little jealous that he gets to write these glorified stunt books that are so appealingly nerdy.Now I'm going to start my starter...it's time to take my bread baking to the next level...I don't think I'll be roasting any whole pigs, though. However, listening to that part of the book did take me down memory lane to summer camp as a kid. Every summer we did ""Ham in a Pit,"" and we had to take turns in pairs overnight to keep watch. I don't remember what I actually thought of the resulting food, though. One last thought: germ is my copilot...this book made me really consider dirtiness and how we seem to be really screwing ourselves over. Oh well, we are evolutionary creatures and somehow we will adapt."
298,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2675284-mollie,4,"I finished listening to the audiobook yesterday and have been considering how to review it. I liked the author's way of encouraging the reader to establish a relationship with food based on ""meaning."" As well as his invitation to ""join the makers of the world.""I admired the breadth of his investigation, his knowledge base.The author reads the book. His inflections added meaning, deepened my relationship with the subject matter. Sometimes his calming voice induced drowsiness; after all, the book does not have a rousing plot.But today, I notice that I miss his soothing voice speaking to me of a recently discovered detail of food preparation. It is as if I now set one less place at my table."
299,1594204217,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6236139-michael-jones,4,"This was one of those books where at many points I wished I could be the author! To sample the barbecue in the South, or cheeses in France--oooh!The author uses stories to tell you how he learned about different kinds of foods and their origins. Actually very informative if you want to learn about whole foods and there is much science here. But the sciences in the context of relationships with real people who understand these foods. He hits most of the major types of food that we consume.This book would be an important read for someone who is basically only eating a standard American diet (SAD). It will open your eyes to new food horizons and could help you understand why eating real food makes you much happier and healthier."
