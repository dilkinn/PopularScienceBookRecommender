0,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,4,"This is one of the most poorly written must-reads I've ever read. The topic of artificial intelligence is very important and well-researched by the author. But the delivery is couched in half-baked philosophy and capital abuse of the poetic license. Many times I paused the audiobook to yell at Brian Christian.""Just say what you MEAN!""""I don't think that word means what you think it means!""This book's saving grace is that he did a really cool thing. He was a human ""confederate"" on the Loebner prize. This contest implements the famous Turing Test. There's a prize for the most human computer, and the most human human, thus the book's title. The author won the later prize, mostly by typing everything that popped into his head, but also by studying what makes people vote ""human"" on the other end.This journey takes us through all the different tricks AI programmers use to make their chat bots believable. It doesn't go into depth on algorithms, but it doesn't really need to. When he tries to talk jargon, he gets it horribly wrong. I remember something about ""statistical"" vs. ""algorithmic"" programming that made no sense to this reader with a bachelor's degree in computer science...The book also talks about the history of AI programming, from checkers to chess, etc.One of the stupidest parts of the book was the theme early on with the left vs. right hemisphere of the brain. Christian dragged this neuroscience fact through the dirt and into the realm of nonsense philosophy. He argues that we should teach ""right-brained"" stuff in school like dance. This is wrong. You don't need a PhD in dance to be a dancer. You do need a PhD physics to be a doctor or physicist. These disciplines are different, and one has unique value above the other simply because it's useful to society. Liberal arts degrees do grow on trees, you know.He also thinks that Catholic guild, Von Neumann architecture, and analytical thinking are all left-brained. They aren't. That's a pernicious and foolish myth. Brian Christian should know better.He has this weird fertilization of ""analytical thinking"" that it's somehow lower than other types of thinking simply because it's how computers think. This is backwards. It's the highest form of thinking, and that's why we're able to program it into computers. Other forms of thinking are more messy, less objective, and less specific to the real world. Other forms of thinking may be site-specific (to use one of Brian Christian's favorite pieces of jargon) to your situation or your own feelings, but that doesn't make these other forms of thinking better in any way.Take away all that personal context, and the only type of thinking you have left at the bottom of the barrel is a thin film of ""analytical thinking"".I sound like Brian Freaking Christian right now..."
1,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,5,"""Algorithms To Live By"" was such a special find. It spoke to me and how I think in so many ways. I know human behaviour is weird and varied, but there are patterns. And I am always looking to streamline what I do. And I am always asking why do we do it that way? Surely there's a better way to do this!So, I've been getting around to Brian's previous book for a few months. And it was also magnificent. Not quite so good, but still a humdinger! Brian takes us into his world of the Turing Test. Of being a designated human in the lot. He looks at how similar our cultures and behaviour are away from a potential programmed AI, and he talks of how computers were made in our image, and how we make ourselves into their image. There are some meaty ideas in here.And I listened to it via Audible, read by Brian himself who is a wonderful speaker. His reading is full of nuance and is much more like a lecture than a reading."
2,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24679550-ashley-c,5,"I have a special interest in the philosophy of the mind - and I love reading and re-reading what people have to say about the brain, or mind, or soul. The computational theory of mind is the main angle that Christian explored in this book through the Turing Test and its implications. An AI passes the Turing Test when it's indistinguishable from a human, usually determined through conversation with another human. And there were times throughout history where different AI programs did pass the test - even if it was just for 5 minutes. Christian presents a wonderful mish-mash of thoughts, comparisons, personal experiences, and research. The book was so stuffed full of ideas and I devoured them eagerly. 
""Our very essence is a kind of mongrelism. It strikes me that some of the best and most human emotions come from this lichen state of computer/creature interface, the admixture, the estuary of desire and reason in a system aware enough to apprehend its own limits, and to push at them: curiosity, intrigue, enlightenment, wonder, awe.""
Christian's book can be rambling a large portion of the time - it feels like a raw unedited draft with all his ideas and thoughts. It didn't bother me that much because I'm intrigued by most things he's wrote - but it would have been better if it was more structured.Something he said struck me: that currently, one of the biggest things that separates humans from AIs is that a human actively responds to new information and it's environment. We essentially change after every single new experience we have, because we are always adapting, updating ourselves. Whereas a programmed AI is limited to its program. Even when it's programmed to learn from new experiences it doesn't decide how it learns, only what. (I'm probably not doing this justice and I'm probably wrong, but that was my takeaway.) It blew me away. "
3,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4768273-paul,5,"Quite simply, the best book I've read, ever. I'm compelled get up out of bed and write down some thoughts after finishing The Most Human Human. I did a double-take when Christian wrote about listening to the Spice Girls in middle school. He writes way beyond his 26 years. On the other-hand maybe those further along in years are writing ever so slightly off the pulse of the intersection of humans and technology. In contrast to What Technology Wants by Kelly, a journalist and also a favorite of mine, Christian passes some sort of authenticity tech guru turing test. I point out his age because, in essence, what I'm left with is faith that we, humans, get better with each generation just as Christian's generation is showing the world. That despite the unbounded trajectory of computing power, Humans are also unbounded. Computing will keep taking ground but humans will keep taking the higher ground. Christian writes that the year the Turing test is passed is not the year to watch. It's the next year, when Humans roll up their sleeves and prove that we are context aware, anti-cliche, anti-summupable, autoincorrectable, entropy-rich, uncompressable and have awoken once more from complacency. The singularity IS near but humans will continue to lead computing right past that non- event. I have new faith that my sons and their generation will be smart as hell as a result of this sublime tension of humans and computing."
4,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6223376-bill-horne,2,"In principle, I should have loved this book. I did my PhD in machine learning. I have a fascination with philosophy. But, I found it somewhat tedious at times. I kept wanting to hear more about his actual experience with the competition. He should have included the transcript, or at least more excerpts. But, there was not very much about his experience with the competition at all. Instead it was a collection of examples of how humans differ from computers, or how ideas from AI apply to humans, etc. I thought the last major chapter on compression could have, ironically, been compressed.On the plus side, it's a very unique book. There were some very interesting observations. It was well written, and at times the writing was quite funny. "
5,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/897874-bruce,5,"First there was Eliza. Then fractal music giving way to database-rich Bach- and Beethoven-simulators. Then Deep Blue. Then Watson. Soon… R. Giskard Reventlov of Aurora? Philip K. Dick’s Preserving Machine? Suffice it to say that The Most Human Human is one of the best nonfiction books it has been my pleasure to read. It touches on all my favorite topics -- recreational math, information theory, philosophy, social psychology, virtual vs. genuine identity – it’s like John Searle meets William Poundstone as might have been channeled through Alex Trebek.Those wishing to preview the themes and overall plot of the book in greater depth can read the author’s own 8-page online redaction. I did, and can assure you it only whetted my appetite to read the book itself. Nor did this book disappoint.For those too time-strapped or lazy to check out the redacted version, here’s a thumbnail sketch. If you only had 5 minutes of text-only IM’ing to convince somebody you were YOU, could you do it? How would a stranger figure out that yours were not the automated responses of a preprogrammed ‘bot, nor that of a phisher, nor even that of David Bowie, but YOU. (Umm, uunless, of course, you *are* David Bowie, in which case, may I suggest you use this book’s premise for your next concept album?) Could you convince them? And how would you do it? How do we recognize each other as distinct individuals? How does one measure the soul? Who are we really?That’s the challenge that Christian sets for himself, and if this strikes you as a bit arbitrary as personal challenges go, then you need a bit of background on Alan Turing’s test and its annual incarnation as the Loebner Prize.Alan Turing was a math genius who cracked the Nazi’s Enigma code and helped invent the modern-day computer among other things. (This bit of history is fascinating and well worth your time, as you get to meet not only Turing, but guys like Claude Shannon, Johnny Von Neumann, John Nash, and others. Fiction readers can find them in Neal Stephenson’s Cryptonomicon and the film “A Beautiful Mind;” casual nonfiction readers will find them in books by William Poundstone, James Gleick, and Richard Rhodes, and all of these I highly recommend.Turing was fascinated by the idea of artificial intelligence and thinking machines and proposed that the only way to tell the difference between a sentient and nonsentient being was through a basic conservatory audition. Only, instead of some aspiring floutist piping their way through Fauré’s Morceau des Concours in hopes of an appointment, it was an invisible conversant. If the auditors believed their interlocutor to be human, then voila! Whatever turned out to be behind the screen would have to be considered capable of independent thought.Seem crazy? Yeah, crazy like a fox, and it was only a matter of time before the Turing test got institutionalized in the form of the Loebner Prize competition, that 5-minute IM thing to which Christian wangled himself an invitation (thus the challenge at the core of this book). However, Christian isn’t content to “just be himself” in the hope and expectation that so doing will prove sufficient to win over the Loebner’s panel of PhD’d judges (psychologists, linguists, computer programmers, etc.), nor does Christian want merely to outcompete the various chatbots entered alongside him and his fellow human controls/confederates. No, Christian is out to prove to all and sundry that not only is he capable of demonstrating his humanity anonymously to strangers, he can do so better than any other human in the competition. Much of the book deals with his efforts as a kind of Rocky Balboa IV, training himself to challenge the Ivan Dragos of chatbots and fellow panelists to a human-off.Think it’s easy, do you? Try sitting down next to someone at random on the Acela and striking up a conversation without mentioning the weather or running some other personally pre-programmed bit of dialogue: “Hi, how are you, my name’s ___, where are you headed, etc.” Unless you’re a transactional analyst, you’d be surprised how much of our lives come to us pre-scripted in your typical five-minute span.The issues touched on here run from the sublimity of learning to live life to its fullest (by avoiding rote, repetitive experiences) to the ridiculous informational density of language (he shares his results playing  the “Shannon Game” at p. 227 -– I tried it and can tell you that the phrases given are bizarre, and not always grammatical; anyway, it’s worth playing once). Along the way, he offers a rogues gallery of chatbots -- from the ever-popular therapist Eliza and her patient foil Manny all the way to present-day AIs like the U.S. Army’s SGT STAR – as well as a collection of brain-damaged case-studies the likes of which would fascinate even the pickiest Oliver Sacks fan. If you think you can’t be fooled by a cleverly-written script, the next time you’re desperate for tech help and Click to Chat! to a real-live expert, try getting a rise out of your deponent. Only if you can manage to get it off book and not spewing non sequiturs will you have assurances you have an intelligent counterpart. (This still might not be human, but at this level I think it prejudice to discriminate.)The book overruns with ideas. For example, Christian offers a terrific alternative to the zero-sum forensics of debate/Model UN at pp. 179-180 that manages to promote constructive, persuasive argument and collaboration in a competitive context that all educators should be made to read. For another, there’s this brilliant passage at p. 237 that all Goodreaders ought to appreciate: People complain from time to time about folks who read the Cliffs-Notes to a book, or reviews or essays about a book, but don’t read the book itself. Hey, if the information density of Anna Karenina is low enough that a review 1 percent as long conveys 60 percent of the form and content ‘gist’ of the book, then it’s Tolstoy’s fault. His readers are human beings with only twenty-eight thousand days or so separating birth and death. If they want to read the lossy gloss and move on, who can blame them?Likewise for conceptual art: who needs to see a Duchamp toilet when you can hear about one so much faster and extract most of the experience from that? Conceptual art might be, for better or worse, (definable as) the art most susceptible to lossy compression.The Most Human Human is really a wonderful book. You can take it from me, assuming that at this point in my exegesis I have indeed managed not only to bring you round, but have done so without you having recourse to wonder whether or not *I* and only I wrote this text -- without resort to plagiarism, paraphrase, or other outside assistance organic or otherwise. (See, e.g., my trilogy of essays on this conundrum, the first of which can be found here.)To put it another way: everything that has ever been written or will ever be written can be found in the Universal Library (including all languages, all typos, all lossless compressions of all 4D smellavision film versions, and this review). It has been said (by Martin Gardner, I believe, that it would take more matter than we know to actually be in existence to replicate the Library. On this basis alone, you’d think it safe to conclude that no computer could be devised to make appropriate selections… that each distinct work must be the result of an independently operating, organic intelligence. But computers are matter as we are matter, and we believe ourselves each to have a unique identity, a unique voice.Brian Christian argues passionately that we can work at and improve our too-human, perfectly-flawed organic experience, and thereby exalt ourselves. We need never lose a *real* Turing test to a computer, however it may be run. Of course, computers, programmers' children, are wonderful mimics.It's only a matter of time."
6,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,2,"I was hoping for more of the artificial intelligence part of this book, but it turned out to be more ""what we can do better than AIs"", which wasn't quite what I was interested in. It's an interesting meditation on what sets us apart, in some places, though it's lacking in organisation -- if I tried to turn in my dissertation with such random chaptering and subtitles, I'd be whacked over the head with the red pen of loving correction by my supervisor. It didn't flow at all well. And I know it's non-fiction, but it felt clunkily info-dumpy. Half the time I was going duh, I know this stuff, that's why I'm reading this book and the other half whoa, slow down.I think this could be a very interesting book, if it caters to what you're interested in. I was more interested in the artificial intelligences, of which there's very little direct discussion..."
7,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18370648-mishehu,5,"At last, proof positive that degrees in philosophy and poetry superbly complement a degree in computer science! TMHH is an extended think piece, thread through with prose poetic writing, on how human minds and silicon ones are alike and how they differ. It is a hugely thought-provoking book, sentence after paragraph after page after page. Judging from its jacket photo, the author is a pretty young guy (a striking contrast with the depth and maturity of the book in review). May he have a long and fruitful writing career ahead of him. And may he continue cogitating on the blurring boundaries between man and machine. There's enormous wisdom in his thinking. Splendid book."
8,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155253-ivy,3,"This is a fine book. Which is a huge disappointment, because it could have been excellent. It has one of the best premises--and best titles--of any book to come out recently. It got a lot of press, because the interest in the topic is immediate and obvious.With all that, I wanted a story of the Loebner Prize and the author's quest for the Most Human Human award, along with some computer science and philosophy. I didn't get a story of the Loebner Prize--at all. He talks about leading up to it, makes a few references to the actual event randomly throughout, and then skips to the award ceremony, which was profoundly disappointing.As for the computer science and philosophy, well... There's a lot of it.Christian talks about human speech patterns, which, in spoken conversation, are overlapping, interrupting, digressing--everything but linear. Maybe it was his intent to write the book that way, but if it was, it's an impressive failure. There are some chapters that have a coherent direction. But most of them randomly wander off and never get to the point. You might find yourself suddenly reading about Aristophanes in Plato's Symposium and never quite figure out how that has anything at all to do with the Turing test. Sometimes he'll give a bit of a precis at the start of the chapter, but then he won't follow it.And there are all these headers throughout, which contain no structural value at all. It seems like he wrote the thing and then just stuck a header in whenever a pun occured to him. Or whenever he realized that this page-long bit has nothing to do with anything in the text surrounding it. And they're all A-heads, so they don't help create a sense of hierarchy. There are also random epigraphs, sometimes in the middle of a section. I get it, dude, you studied philosophy and poetry. You know stuff. But you need to work all of this material together into a coherent whole, instead of leaving all the lumps in the gravy.So as you read, you find yourself in a forty-page long digression about data entropy and compression algorithms. Or not even a digression, really, because ""digression"" implies some sort of starting off point, and the only relation this seems to have to the purported topic of the book is that he read about it while researching the book. And there are some interesting things about how video compression works in there, but somewhere in the hour or so of reading this chapter, you start to wonder what the hell happened to the narrative.The chapters that I liked best were the ones I read all in one sitting--it seems like you need to take this book in hundred-page chunks in order for him to wander back to his topic often enough to figure out what's going on.There are interesting things in this book. But--honestly--the interesting things have already been mined. I've heard several radio stories based on this book, and a few more brushing the same topics (on This American Life and Radiolab). Those stories were a lot better than this book is. Which shows what a really talented journalist can do with the material. Christian, on the other hand, mostly squanders it. "
9,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4700987-danny,5,"Once awhile we chanced upon a book that really altered the way we look at things. The every-day things.Learning from machines to become more human. Doesn’t it sound odd? Brain Christian rightly pointed out that computers are tool designed without a specified purpose initially, and tons of applications were designed after computers (tools) were constructed. Now, we can see the power of computing applied to almost every mundane activity.With computers seemingly invading all territories of our daily activities, taking over human jobs, and with our ever-increasing reliance on computers to manage our schedule and tasks, it is inevitable that we question just how much has machines become human.To answer that question, Brian Christian goes on to explore what really make a human.... human? The differentiating factor is our unique ability to ""communicate"" with each other.Most languages are designed around a very structured system, yet we adopt an unstructured way to deliver our ideas, thoughts and feelings everyday. Our tendency to add in conversational fillers (uhh, umm), having unique slang, ability to have our own point of view, having a 'stateful' identity, adding in emotions, all are contributing factors that add depth and flow into conversation that makes us human. Something computers just isn't quite there yet. By creating new thoughts and ideas, and selectively choosing words, every conversation in itself is a poetry. Conversations with machines are repetition and a mimic of ideas that are after all... inputs. Without those 'human' elements, we will never get the form of satisfaction and fulfillment in a conversation with a computer. The duels of arguments and counter-arguments.The gamble of approvals and rejections. The power of anger and encouragement. The emotional energy that bounces off two people.Conversation with another human being is very much rewarding. Something that computers will never take away from us. And i'll start to treasure the one thing that make me uniquely human."
10,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2875383-xavier-shay,5,Fantastic. Very readable and surprisingly interesting given how much of the referenced material I've already read.
11,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/349248-jane,5,"A competition called the Turing test takes place each year. Judges at computer terminals interact with unseen correspondents. Each judge has two correspondents, one a human being and one a computer program, and the judge tries to tell which is which after a five minute online conversation with each. The program that receives the most votes and highest judge confidence score is named the Most Human Computer. This title is highly coveted by programmers. A side result of the voting, however, is that the human who receives the most votes and highest judge confidence score is named the Most Human Human.It is from this side of the Turing test that author Brian Christian writes his book The Most Human Human. He sets out to participate in the test as a correspondent and to win the Most Human Human title. Along the way, he philosophizes about what it means to be human and how our interaction with computers is affecting that. He notes, “We once thought humans were unique for having a language with syntactical rules, but this isn’t so; we once thought humans were unique for using tools, but this isn’t so; we once thought humans were unique for being able to do mathematics, and now we can barely imagine being able to do what our calculators can.”The author makes the point that cell phones, texting, and programs that finish our words for us are making us less creative. It is easier to use the word the phone suggests than to fight the phone and type the word we meant to use. He writes, “I was detachedly roaming the Internet, but there was nothing interesting happening in the news, nothing interesting happening on Facebook…I grew despondent, depressed – the world used to seem so interesting…But all of a sudden it dawned on me, as if the thought had just occurred to me, that much of what is interesting and amazing about this world did not happen in the past twenty-four hours. How had this fact slipped away from me? …. Somehow I think the Internet is making this very critical point lost on an entire demographic.”Christian is an interesting guy. He has a dual bachelor’s degree in computer science and philosophy and a master of fine arts in poetry. He understands the scientific angle of the Turing test but also the human side of what it means for a human to challenge a computer. There is a wonderful scene during the Turing test when he spies on a fellow human correspondent’s chat with a judge and realizes they are chatting in shorthand about Canadian hockey teams, virtually assuring that the judge knows he is talking to a human. This causes Christian a moment of panic and despair when he fears that he will lose the Most Human Human title.Christian’s views on how we interact with the world are refreshing. He says, “I think the reason novels are regarded to have so much more ‘information’ than films is that they outsource the scenic design and cinematography to the reader. … This, for me, is a powerful argument for the value and potency of literature specifically.” I felt somewhat lost toward the end of the book when it got a bit scientific, but the science was not too overwhelming, and I wouldn’t let that put you off as a potential reader. I enjoyed this book tremendously, and it really made me think."
12,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6970638-sheri,4,"This was an interesting read. Not for the reasons I was expecting when I started it, but interesting nonetheless. Christian starts out with his raison d'ecrire (hah..try Shannon Gaming that one!) as the Loebner prize 2009 Turning test competition, but quickly veers off into a discussion of, well lots of stuff. As other reviewers have noted, he does not always follow a tangential line of thought and it is not always clear how all of his details are relevant. Nor does he really describe the Loebner prize.Instead, he gives us a history of AI and computer science and a philosophical discussion about what it means to be a human (from the ""I think therefore I am"" POV all the way to ""we don't parse our words when we speak aloud""). The discussion was interesting (and yeah, I get that he needed to write a full book and there is lots to meat up just the competition), but I kinda wanted to know more about the actual Turing test. I would have liked transcripts of THE ACTUAL COMPETITION for example.Despite not always relating, Christian is pretty easy to read and I learned some from the book, so it gets 4 stars. One of my chuckle aloud moments was when reading his footnote about how he always enjoys the beginnings of books more than the end. At some point, the completions of the project (finish the book) becomes more important than the book itself and he blames this (in part) on the book software he uses to review/take notes on what he reads. Hah! I can totally relate to getting to a point in a book where I know I am gonna finish it today or tonight and then HAVE TO WRITE A REVIEW. And yeah, I am eager to just get done with it already so I can start a new one. One that is bright and sparkly and doesn't have a pending review in the next few hours. I have below my favorite moments/comments/soundbytes:""Having a sense of a person--their disposition, character, 'way of being in the world'--and knowing about them--where they grew up, how many siblings they have, what they majored in, where they work--are two rather different things.""""Our very essence is a kind of mongrelism. It strikes me that some of the bets and most human emotions come from this lichen state of computer/creature interface, the admixture, the estuary of desire and reason in a system aware enough to apprehend its own limits, and to push at them: curiosity, intrigue, enlightenment, wonder, awe.""""I suppose when you get down to it, everything is always once in a lifetime. We might as well act like it.""""It's what we want, chatting with old friends, when our familiar opening book....is not so much a conversation per se as a means for arriving at one-gives pleasantly way to the expectedly unexpected, awaitedly idiosyncratic veers; it's what anyone wants from any conversation, and what artist want from their art; a way to breeze past formalities and received gestures, out of book and into the real thing.""""computers become in effect the first tools to precede their tasks: their fundamental difference from staplers and hole-punchers and pocket watches. You build the computer first, and then figure out what you want to do.....seems to chip away at the existentialist idea of humans' unique purchase on the idea of existence before essence."""
13,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5925863-bastian-greshake-tzovaras,4,"I seem to have a thing going for books that describe how the author tries to achieve some weird self-set goal (reading the Britannica in order to win a game show, reading through the complete OED, becoming US memory champion). In this instance the goal is to win the 'most human human' award that is given out at an annual Turing test. To bring everyone up to speed: the Turing test was meant as a measure how well artificial intelligences perform. Judges have to have a 1:1 chat with a computer and a human confederate without knowing which 'intelligence' is only based in silico and have to make a call of which participant was human and which was the machine. If a computer can fool ~30% of the judges into believing that they are the human participant the program is said to have passed the Turing test and for the Loebner Prize there's the 'Most Human Computer'-Award for the program hat fools most judges, even if not passing the threshold. But as the competition is a zero-sum game (for each time the computer fools a judge into believing that it's human a human must be flagged as non-human) there's also the award for the human confederate that can convince the most judges that they are in fact human. So that's what Christian is trying to win. And instead of just acting like a regular human being he sets out to prepare for the test by reading up on AI, computational linguistics and information theory to find the weak spots of current chatbots. Which is fun to read and one quickly notices that he has a professional background in computer science, philosophy and poetry. I really enjoyed reading about the different strategies applied to fake being human, like turning the chat into a shouting match, as insults are no longer dependent on a larger context but from a computer science perspective are more of a Markov chain, where your retort is only dependent on the last observed state. Another fun topic was the application of the Shannon Entropy to text input on mobile devices via T9 and the different auto-correction algorithms around. Christian argues that these methods are shaping how you write, as they perform best on the vocabulary they were designed on and you thus unconsciously start to adapt to that vocabulary. Anecdotally this is just what I observe while typing away on my phone: Instead of the software adapting to my needs and figuring out what I wanted to say, I start to adapt to the idiosyncrasies of the auto-completion feature and try to predict what words the software can make most sense of, in order to avoid the software turning my intended writing into gibberish (especially for those üseless umlauts while typing in German. And I still have fond memories of T9 turning 'Sure, I'll come over and bring beer' into 'Sure, I'll come over and bring AIDS'). To borrow from Philipp's closings: Recommended for anyone interested in AI and computational linguistics (probably less if you're an expert in one of those fields). "
14,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1448125-jim,5,"The context for this exploration of human intelligence is an annual contest in which judges engage in casual 'chats' with computers and humans and try to determine which is which. The point of the contest, of course, is to determine the ""most human"" computer, a modified Turing test. The risk to the human entrants is that they might be judged a computer! The author was determined not to let that happen to him and so he engages in one of the most entertaining explorations of what it means to engage in distinctively 'human' conversation. One flaw perhaps is that there is relatively little here about the details of the conversations that convinced the judges that the author (spoiler alert)was not a computer, or to show whether the computers were particularly inept that year at seeming human. Still, there are bits of transcripts from years of the contest to illustrate the strategiesthat do and don't work. Recently, I've read about a man who trained his mind to remember random information, but not where he parked his car (Moonwalking with Einstein), and a woman who obsesses over every detail of her life and each day's events, but can't remember phone numbers (The Woman Who Can't Forget). But this book convinces me that it would be far better to have some imagination and the ability to tell a good story than to have either of these extraordinary memory talents."
15,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5362202-jesse,5,"I loved this book. I started with rather low expectations; sort of expecting a new york times style high level view of machine learning and its implications. What I got instead was profound insight into what machine intelligence can tell us about what it means to be human. I suspect I'll look at life differently, both my human interactions and my observations, for weeks to come. I wish I'd been taking notes, because every time there was a great concept which I thought deserved more thought or research, another one would come along and replace it. I'll definitely have to reread this book. If you're interested in philosophy or in how stuff works, I can't recommend this book enough."
16,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1803452-libby,4,"A very interesting, well researched book on what it means to be human in light of developments in artificial intelligence. The traditional factors that defined what it was to be human no longer apply due to the fact that computers can exhibit most, if not all, of these qualities - especially reason - so where does that leave us? What does set us apart? This book is highly thought-provoking. The author does wander quite a bit and it could have been more cohesive but overall it was very enjoyable."
17,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3363047-karel-baloun,5,"An exceptional book on what it means to be truly human, truly empowered for uniqueness and collaboration.Also, as literature, so many precise words and exquisite constructions. Stretched my mind."
18,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549698-nathan,4,"I didn't know what to expect from this book, but it surprised and delighted me with its thoughtful but not stodgy exploration of what it means to be human. The author entered the annual staging of the Turing Test--not as an author of a chatbot, but as a human. The Turing Test is where judges blindly IM with chatbots and humans and try to tell them apart; if a chatbot is reliably mistaken for human, the creator of the test proposed, then it could be said to be artificially intelligent. The book explores the nature of human intelligence and of artificial attempts at intelligence, from the significance of chess to competitive chatbots to neuroscience and philosophy.Think of the Turing Test. If a computer program wins, that means that a human lost: judges have two conversations at a time and must decide which is the human and which is the computer. If a program is declared to be human, that means the human was declared to be a computer. The human lacked ... humanity? The advice to human participants is to ""just be yourself"", but the author can't do that. He's an over-achiever, he wants to study for and excel at this test of his humanity. The topics weren't so enchanting as the approach; the author dazzled me with insight and connection on every page. I know a little about Artificial Intelligence, I thought: I took a class at uni, I pushed machine learning on O'Reilly Radar before everyone was doing it, I've written a chatbot, and I've read Douglas Hofstadter. But, not just once but repeatedly and consistently, Christian surprises me with a new way of looking at a familiar topic. For example:“Sometimes it seems,” says Douglas Hofstadter, “as though each new step towards AI, rather than producing something which everyone agrees is real intelligence, merely reveals what real intelligence is not.” While at first this seems a consoling position—one that keeps our unique claim to thought intact—it does bear the uncomfortable appearance of a gradual retreat, the mental image being that of a medieval army withdrawing from the castle to the keep. But the retreat can’t continue indefinitely. Consider: if everything of which we regarded “thinking” to be a hallmark turns out not to involve it, then ... what is thinking? It would seem to reduce to either an epiphenomenon—a kind of “exhaust” thrown off by the brain—or, worse, an illusion.I'm familiar with this line of thinking, but this is the first time I'd seen it presented in a way that let me connect it directly to the ""God of The Gaps"" argument. In that line of thought, God is presumed to be behind everything that science can't explain, which leaves God to be ""what science hasn't explained yet"", presumably on a monotonically decreasing course to irrelevance. Similarly, the Thing That Makes Humans Special (what Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert calls ""The Sentence"": ""The human being is the only animal that can ___"") is constantly being shot down and replaced with something new:And here’s a crucial, related question: Is this retreat a good thing or a bad thing? For instance, does the fact that computers are so good at mathematics in some sense take away an arena of human activity, or does it free us from having to do a nonhuman activity, liberating us into a more human life? The latter view would seem to be the more appealing, but it starts to seem less so if we can imagine a point in the future where the number of “human activities” left to be “liberated” into has grown uncomfortably small. What then?I really liked the section on computer chess. I had forgotten how seriously chess was held up as an icon of man's superiority over the machine, even though now that attitude seems a quaint relic of a bygone day. Particularly eye-opening was how IBM refused a rematch: as soon as they'd won (through a Kasparov error that was the equivalent of poker's throwing away the pair and keeping the mismatched cards), they dismantled Deep Blue, ended the research program, and moved on. So they would play rematches, improving the computer each time, until man and computer were close enough that the computer could win one series ... at which point they denied the human the chance to improve and regain superiority. Didn't seem right.He connects the strange conversational experiment of the Turing Test to speed dating (having to create a quick instant rapport with someone), Chat Roulette (one popular chatbot may work in a similar fashion, connecting humans to each other), philosophical insistence on ""authenticity"", coherence of identity (bots that learn responses from lots of people have no consistent self: will say they're a single woman when replying to one question, but happily married man as a reply to a different question), the Hardy Boy (written by a team of authors, not a single authorial voice), and finally:The New York Times reported in June 2010—in an article titled “The End of the Best Friend”—on the practice of deliberate intervention, on the part of well-meaning adults, to disrupt close nuclei of friends from forming in schools and summer camps.4 One sleepaway camp in New York State, they wrote, has hired “friendship coaches” whose job is to notice whether “two children seem to be too focused on each other, [and] ... put them on different sports teams [or] seat them at different ends of the dining table.” Affirms one school counselor in St. Louis, “I think it is kids’ preference to pair up and have that one best friend. As adults—teachers and counselors—we try to encourage them not to do that.” Chatroulette and Omegle users “next” each other when the conversation flags; these children are being nexted by force—when things are going too well.It's this charming pan across the range of life and experience, showing how the dilemma of humanity runs through each vignette, that makes this book a keeper. If it had kept up the delight and glory of the first third, I'd have given it five stars. To be fair, though, I did stay up to a ridiculously late/early hour to finish this, so flaws in the last two thirds may well be entirely in my mind. And that, I must say, seems fitting."
19,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1660832-kevin,3,"Christian writes from the perspective that it will be bad if and when machines are intelligent, he's kind of an anti Ray Kurzweil. I completely disagree with his viewpoint but his book is interesting and illustrates lots of Turing problems that I'd never considered.He goes on to say that it will not happen that the same bot will win year after year but is proved wrong just 2 years after the book is written by Mitsuku who won in 2013,2016-2019https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsuku"
20,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7310589-tadeas-petak,5,"My favourite trait of Most Human Human was its optimistic tone. I have read a fair amount of AI criticism, lamenting that it might be very dangerous, moaning about it taking jobs away from people and whining that it is making us more stupid or at least less intelligent. Instead, this book embraces human endeavours directed into this field, highlights the achievements and their implications and treasures the foreseeable future of AI. The author has a very good reason for this, too: artificial intelligence has made us reappraise what it means to be intelligent. It has made us reconsider what it is to be human. Also, Brian Christian suggests that instead of the last few decades being a race of machines against humans, we are in it with them. We need to learn to co-exist and since we already have a pretty good idea regarding what computers excel at, we need to find out - or maybe rather rediscover - what we our qualities are. What makes humans... human.Or it least that's how I interpret it. The book will walk you through the basics of chatbot design and development and take you on the bumpy ride through the recent history of AI and computers in general. It will leave you ruminating on the art of conversation, not leaving out speed dating, pickup artists or the fact that heated arguments are non-contextual in the sense that the answer typically depends solely on the previous question. You will meet ELISA, a psychotherapeutic bot that, basically, by rephrasing questions, provides people with real therapeutic experience, leaving them feeling jollier afterwards.I really enjoyed the section dealing with computer chess and a different one focusing on entropy and statistics in the English language. The whole read is like this: a bit all over the place, pulling out information from every field that might add to the topic. And since the topic is humanity, there is a decent number of potential candidates. Apart from solid grasp of IT, the author seems to be educated (to an extent, anyway) in philosophy, poetry and music among other fields. The author was also 24 or something when he wrote this and he has my eternal utter respect for this achievement. It's about art, literature, small talks and about the fact that only real conversations, i.e. the ones where you cannot be finishing the other person's sentences, matter. The thing is full of beautiful quotes but one that stuck in my mind is that maybe, it is better to be asking: ""How did you stay together?"" instead of ""How did you meet?"". A lot of fairy-tales deal with the latter but almost none with the former. Btw, a friend of mine, also a software developer, recommended this book to me. If someone has read this and you have no connection to software development in your everyday life, could you let me know whether you liked it or not? To me, it seemed that the book is written and organized in such a way that it must appeal to the way minds of people bossing computers around all day long typically function. I am just wondering how well suits anyone else."
21,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8134468-tisasday,3,A lot of interesting data and theories shared about AI and perspectives we forget about as we just keep using tech every day. 
22,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1962408-harold,3,"The Most Human Human is about the Turing contest in which computers and people have separate 5 minute text conversation with judges who try to pick which are humans and which computers. So far the computers have not yet sufficiently fooled the judges to win. Each year the judges also determine the most human human, and the most human computer -- the ones who get the most human votes in each category. The author volunteered to be one of the humans. and then tries to win the most human human label.The author is a poet and a programmer, and looks at the competition from both perspectives, as well as philosophically, linguistically, and several more. So the book is a fugue, one theme and several variations. Some are very interesting. I was particularly fascinated with the with how human language works, and the tells of the computer programs. If you want to try one, go to cleverbot.com. But some of the digressions also wind down dead ends. It is as if the human writer breaks down, and the computer takes over. Interestingly, like the computer programs, I am not sure that everyone would find the same parts the wooden ones. Not each judge in the competition had the same computer conversation, but still the computers haven't won yet. In the same vein, while different people might respond to different tangents, I doubt they all work for anyone.And particularly disappointing was that he led up to his own participation in the contest, he doesn't describe it, even though he did in fact win the title of the most human human. Was it anticlimactic? Certainly its omission from the book is.Yet all in, while uneven, the book did have a fascinating analysis of how computer conversation programs, and even chess programs work, and how we talk, and what some of the difference are. And it does teach something about what it means to be human, or at least sound human. I wonder what would the book would be like if he set out to convince the judges he was a computer. Yes I do. A sequel. "
23,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2672686-matt-musselman,5,"What obviously started based on the premise of entering to be a confederate in the annual Loebner Prize (based on the Turing Test), where the author would be a human trying to differentiate himself from various chat software programs attempting to pass as human, and what it means to win the award of being ""the most human human"" in this contest, Brian Christian delves into a delightful examination of:- What differentiates human thinking from computer ""thinking""? Or from the cognitive processes of non-human animals?- How does human thinking work?- What makes for interesting conversation? When do conversations work or not work? What conversations (and thus people) are most memorable? When are our conversations more robotic in nature?- What aspects of language make it a uniquely human endeavour?- What is the nature of emotion? Creativity? Poetry? Art?That Christian was able to explore all this while also spicing the mix with terrific references to source material from Aristophanes and Plato to grunge music, Heisenberg, Hofstadter, and David Foster Wallace, Cameron Crowe films, Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov, Alan Turing, Claude Shannon, and Bertrand Russell, Isaac Newton, Ezra Pound and Allen Ginsberg, the music of Sting and Feist and Bach, TED Talks, Terminator and The Matrix and Glengarry Glen Ross, Salvador Dali and Marcel Duchamp, Freakonomics, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. . . . I not only learned a lot, but also felt as if I had just walked into a room full of old friends, while also meeting some new friends to get to know.A terrific, fun, and enlightening read. "
24,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1880634-susan,3,"Fascinating subject - artificial intelligence and the Turing test: Alan Turing (Google celebrated his 100th birthday recently) developed the annual test to see if an AI program can fool a panel of judges into thinking they are conversing by text with a human and not a machine. Brian, the author, was one of the 'ringers' - they mix up real human contestants in with the AI programs - and was voted the 'most human human' at the end where they also vote for the 'most human' AI program. As a fellow Brown U Alumni, I got to attend the book discussion with the author in attendance at my Borwn Club book group and it was a terrifically entertaining discussion with a room full of smart, educated people. But we were all wondering why he didn't include a transcript of his actual Turing dialogue. When we asked him why not, he said he thought it was so boring, it wasn't worth including. Let us be the judge, Brian. He was charming though, and so cute (recently engaged and in love, which just made him cuter). Some of the writing was rather technical, even though he went to great lengths to explain, I still sort of glazed over chunks of this. But his deconstruction of what makes conversation was intriguing and I still find myself looking for the 'handholds' - he likens a conversation to reaching for the next hold in a wall climb, and how some people offer a lot of options, and with others you are reaching, reaching for the next sentence. Glad to have read it, interesting to find out about the Turing test, happy to have participated in the discussion with the author, but don't recommend it for the non-computer nerd reader."
25,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51310141-soracha-hardin,2,"So I should start off saying this is not my typical genre, but I love our bookclub because we read a diverse range of books. I did vote for this one because I was intrigued by the concept human vs AI chat bots... but also proving yourself as human in a world becoming increasingly more mechanized both in the physical act of technology growing and at a deeper level of us ourselves as a species becoming more ""computerized"". However it ended there for me. I can usually cruise through an audio book pretty quickly due to commuting around but I couldn't listen to this one for more then 20 minutes at a time. I give author's credit for narrating their own stories, I couldn't do it, but I felt it was VERY computerized/techy. I also just wanted to hear about the transcripts themselves from the competition, I understood the dissection of dialogue/human interactions in general, but I was completely lost and subsequently bored out of my mind, listening about Chess for over an hour, and bits and zipping. I felt like the author has a lot of specific, we'll call them ""nerd"" interests, and he wanted to push them all into the story, some flowed but most did not. I am rating a two because despite my disinterest in it, I have already recommended to a few others in the target audience for this book, who I think will enjoy the tangents and overall concepts explored, however I think there was a big miss in being able to connect with a wider population in general, like myself someone who doesn't usually read non-fiction but was intrigued by the concept. "
26,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,4,"Good, but oh, it could have been better.There's an annual Turing test event in Britain every year. A group of top computer programs compete against a group of human confederates, as the computers try to prove, per Alan Turing, that they're really humans, just as the humans do.So far, no computer has won this test, but, given the relatively narrow parameters of the test at this particular contest, that may not be too far off.Christian, who successfully competed to be a human ""confederate,"" takes off from that point in the paragraph above, to riff on what it means to be human (the human confederate the judges in the Loeber prize most frequently judge to be human wins ""the most human human"" award), larger issues in communication and information theory, and more.Christian invokes the likes of Douglas Hofstadter at times, and in his last chapter, especially, does some Hofstadter-type pondering.Contra others that gave this less than five stars, I didn't mind the digressive tone of the book at all; in fact, I loved it. Unfortunately, there's not a lot of depth or follow-through on the speculation.This book could have been, and should have been 50 pages longer at a minimum. A full 100 pages of additional material, without getting as long as Goedel, Escher, Bach, or as technical, could have been doable.Oh, and given the number of people mentioned in the book ... no index?"
27,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4700832-edward,4,"This is an interesting book that looks at AI and bots (particularly chatbots) from a different angle with a unique perspective. It was written a few years ago in 2011 but it is still timely read for me in 2016 given bots, digital assistants and AI are just starting to get more mainstream recently. A series of conscious thoughts are provided by the author, Brian Christian, who in 2009 participated in the Loebner Prize Turing Test competition as a human participant (called a human confederate). Brian was in an unique position to think about how to beat a computer to be more human. Overall, I find this book illuminating and it sparks a number of insights in how one should think about when designing and personifying an AI. I don't find much discussion on this topic in other literature or text books, partly because this is an archaic subject and partly this is so new. Brian Christian gets philosophical at times but it also touches on different areas of information theory and some computer science problem such as chess playing. He has a poetry background (as well as computer science) and hence this explains why his writing style is somewhat different and for me I find it a little bit hard to follow at times. "
28,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1358899-stephanie,5,"I know loving this book seals my geek status, but I don't care! Brilliantly conceived and written. I learned this new word, and I'm still trying to work it into my vocabulary: entropy. I also loved learning about the Shannon theory of entropy. Check this stuff out:P 143: “With poetry, as with philosophy, there is no exterior, only certain well-behaved interiors: in philosophy we call them sciences (physics originally began as the largely speculative field of ‘natural philosophy’), and in poetry we call them genres. If a play wanders too far from the traditions and conventions of playwriting, the script starts to be regarded as poetry. If a short story starts to wander out of safe short-story territory, it becomes a prose poem. But poetry that wanders far from the conventions of poetry is often simply-e.g. “Howl”-better poetry.”p. 159: l’esprit de l’escalier = staircase wit, the devastating verbal comeback that occurs to you as you’re walking down the stairs out of the party. Finding the mot juste a minute too late is almost like not finding it at all. You can’t go “in search of” the mot juste or the bon mot. They ripen and rot in an instant. That’s the beauty of wit. "
29,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2905816-daniel,5,"Brian Christian brings us into the world of computer intelligence and the Turing test to ask and partially answer the question of what makes us human. Along the way, he wool gathers into the areas of computer chess, mathematics, the pick up artist, the novelist and the brain damaged.His book is incredibly information dense and diverse.I can see it used as the basis of a semester or even year long class about the hallmarks of humanity.He also asks the question, are humans becoming more like computers. Mathematics, long considered the apex of human development is where computers excel. Is it possible that in making ourselves computational experts we are in danger of losing some of our humanity. Let's face it, there is no way to review this book without the review being nearly as long as the book. It touches on everything. It is interesting to note that Christian often refers to the book ""Gödel, Escher, Bach"" by Douglas Hofstadter. I think I am overdue for a reread."
30,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2610234-caren,3,"I listened to the author's talk on Book TV, then read the book. Mr. Christian is an interesting fellow, having a double major degree in computer science and philosophy, with a MFA in poetry. Talk about a Renaissance man! I thoroughly enjoyed his well-researched musings. Afterwards I had an interesting discussion with my son-in-law, a web developer, about artificial intelligence. He pointed out that the real difference between humans and computers is that machines can't feel, but offered that perhaps they will, at some point, be able to teach themselves how to , if not feel, at least respond as though they do. I'm with Mr. Christian on that one---let's not go there!For an article the author did for ""The Atlantic"" on this topic, look here:http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/a..."

I expected it to be a kind of Malcolm Gladwell-esque book that was interesting and well-written. It wasn't actually all that well-written, but it more than made up for it in super interesting material. What really surprised me was how much it made me really re-think how I can make myself more human. By looking at what things computers can easily copy when they are imitating us, we can easily see things we do that are quite pre-programmed, mundane, and robotic. But there are some things that computers simply cannot (yet) copy, and that's where true human interaction really takes place. That's where I want my relationships to go, and reading this book helped me understand better how to get there. Highly recommended."

Brian Christian wove together topics that are uncommonly combined: philosophy, computer science, arts, and neuroscience. Needless to say, he could not probe each one particularly deeply, and hence it was an easy read. However, it was an easy read in the best of ways; as if a knowledgeable and intelligent person would keep a late-night monologue during a quiet evening. This book surely left a lot of ""holds"", as he called them, to continue climbing on! "

In a lot of ways I felt like I was reading a podcast, perhaps because I had already run across some of the stories he used on This American Life and Radiolab, but also because the information was presented without a central argument or thesis. That was probably the most disappointing aspect. On the other hand, I was delighted by the often whimsical footnotes and the use of vocabulary words I don’t usually see like 'eschatological' and 'scrum'. Oh Brian, you had me at ‘fungible’."

Books aren't conversation, after all, and I wanted thoughts to be completed.There were a lot of good tidbits about computing history, language, and communication.

In actuality, however, only one of these people is a real human being, while the other is just a computer program responding to your messages. How would you decide which is which?As computers continue to get more and more powerful, we may be approaching the day when you really won’t be able to tell which of your correspondents is the computer and which is the person. In 2007 one highly cited academic authority on the subject of artificial intelligence at the University of California, San Diego, Dr. Robert Epstein, began writing long love letters to Ivana, a Russian woman he had met at an online dating site. She responded frequently, sending long letters of her own that described her life, her family in Russia, and her ambitions. But after carrying on this correspondence for four months, Epstein finally realized that Ivana was just a computer program!Every year computer programmers enter their ""artificial intelligence"" (AI) programs in a competition for the Loebner Prize, which is awarded to the program that comes closest to fooling humans into thinking it is not actually a program. This annual competition celebratesAlan Turing’s famous observation that once you can’t tell the difference between conversing with a computer and a person, then you have to conclude that the computer is in fact “thinking.” This became known as the ""Turing Test” for artificial intelligence, although Turing himself later modified his conclusion to say that the computer wouldn’t actually be thinking, but merely simulating the appearance of it. (Meaning that no consciousness or self-awareness is implied.)And this is the setting for Brian Christian’s fascinating bookThe Most Human Human: What Talking with Computers Teaches Us About What It Means to Be Alive, (Knopf Doubleday, 2011). The question he sets out to answer flips the problem around to examine it from the other side. If you were in fact the human at the other end of someone’s keyboard conversation, how would you persuade that person that you are not a machine? What would you write? How would you converse?It’s a profoundly interesting question, and Christian, who has academic degrees in computer science, philosophy, and poetry, uses it to launch into a brilliantly insightful discussion of issues that range from artificial intelligence, computation and information entropy, to language, art, purpose, philosophy, specialization, context, analogies and even spam.There are several ways to conceive of a computer program to simulate conversational ability. You might think that you would just design such a program by coding the rules of syntax and coupling this with a good general vocabulary. But syntax is an extremely difficult thing to pin down, and there are so many nuances in any language – especially English – that the task can be overwhelming. Moreover, Christian says, “lossy data compression” inherently characterizes human language, because we can never entirely convey our thoughts with words, always losing some of the data. In a face to face conversation, in fact, we make some of this up with body language and tone of voice, and he cites the “7-38-55” rule, which captures scientists’ best estimates that 55% of the meaning in a face to face conversation is conveyed with body language, 38% with tone of voice, and just 7% with the actual words and grammar chosen.Expert systems, on the other hand, similar to most of the programs that drive Loebner Prize entries, typically use what is known as ""inference engines"" to plumb specific databases of knowledge and come up with appropriate answers. The main drawback to these kinds of systems is that their ability to converse or interact is strictly limited to the field of knowledge that they've decoded. Venture outside that domain and they will be quickly exposed as mere computer programs.One of the most interesting methods for programming computers to conduct keyboard conversations today – in the era of “Big Data” – is simply to arm the program with millions of previous, actual conversations between people. So, for instance, if you were to type out the question “Who do you think actually killed JFK?” the computer would search its database, find the several thousand questions most similar to that one, examine and score the answers, and then respond with something like “Probably Oswald, but it’s scary to think about alternatives.” (Note that while I’m talking about this as a keyboard conversation, you could easily use a speech-to-text program to render the statement as spoken language, in the same way your iPhone Siri assistant speaks to you.)This “Big Data” method for rendering conversational interaction is already reasonably practical, Christian tells us (although his 2011 book pre-dates the immense popularity of the term ""Big Data"" itself). When the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) held a competition for translating Arabic and Chinese by computer, for instance, a team of Google programmers won it handily by arming their program with a database of tens of thousands of humanly rendered translations, mostly from the computerized minutes of the United Nations. Judges at the competition were astounded by the fact that none of the Google programmers actually knew any Arabic or Chinese themselves! (And neither did their computer program, Christian adds.)But let’s return to the central question in Christian’s book. Suppose your name is Ivana, and you’re not a computer but a real person corresponding online with a California professor who has taken a love interest in you. What would you say to convince him that you’re not just a computer program?Well, Christian suggests, you could play word games that are hard for a computer to imitate. Synecdoche, for example, is “the linguistic device by which we name a part but mean the whole—‘a new set of wheels,’ meaning car; ‘mouths to feed,’ meaning people; ‘nice threads,’ meaning clothing item.” With this device we are trying to convey the most salient part of an idea “with the understanding that the reader will fill in the rest.” Or consider “enthymemes,” a linguistic device often used to persuade someone of a position by intentionally leaving out a premise of the argument. “If the glove doesn’t fit, you must acquit” or “With a name like Smucker’s, it has to be good” are examples. The point is that synecdoche and enthymemes are not easily programmed into computer applications, so by using them you are signalling that you are not a computer.Another way to be seen as more human is simply to do the unexpected. Be unpredictable. 99% of the choices in a voice-mail tree are predictable, because voice-mail trees are based on decision rules and communicated by computer. Here Christian discusses the issue of information entropy, a subject I’ve written on in the past. Basically, you can think of information entropy as the degree of “unpredictability” in a piece of data. The missing letter in the word “L I N K _ D” is reasonably obvious, right? But how about the missing letter in the word “B _ T”? It must be a vowel, but which one? They all work. The point is, the more entropy you introduce into a communication – the less predictable you are – the less computer-like you will seem.For business people, Christian has some very insightful thoughts about the subject of entropy and how we can better use it in our own lives. For instance:•	We gain the most insight on a question when we take it to the friend, colleague, or mentor of whose reaction and response we’re least certain.•	To gain the most insight into a person, we should ask the question of whose answer we’re least certain.In each of these cases we would be seeking out high-entropy information in order to learn new things at a faster, more efficient rate. I think there’s a direct analogy between the idea of information entropy and the “strength of weak ties” principle that should define your own personal social media strategy, as well.In my view, dealing with unpredictability and randomness is one of the primary intellectual activities of all human beings, and it is something that is (so far) beyond the means of most computers. The brain of any higher animal can reasonably be described as a prediction engine. It is constantly trying to anticipate what’s going to happen next, given the “context” of everything that has been observed so far. This constant effort to predict, when elevated by the highly developed human neocortex, is probably what gives human beings self awareness. It’s what makes us “conscious” – of ourselves, of others, and of our environment. And from this consciousness flows curiosity, reasoning, abstract thought, and language itself.Christian takes this line of reasoning one step further with what I consider a perfectly brilliant observation about what it really means to be human. ""Curiosity,"" he says, is ""the highest ethical calling."" Curiosity is the attribute that most defines what it means to be a thinking, sentient being. Curiosity is what we are meant for.If you want to be a more human human yourself, you could start by reading Brian Christian’s book."

Brian Christian explores the concept of ""humanness"" as he prepares to be a human participant in the Turing test, where he'll be competing against the best in artificial intelligence to in an attempt to convince a panel of human judges over instant messaging that he's not only a human, but to win the title of the most clearly human participant – the ""Most Human Human.""To the end, Christian explores ""humanness"" from dozens of angles – aesthetics, language, philosophy, art, computer science, and so on, drawing from sources as varied as pick-up artist Mystery and existential philosopher Sartre, and seemingly everything in between. The sheer breadth of the book is impressive (though I wish there had been a greater depth to some of the sections.)I listened to the Audible audiobook, which is read, with success, by Christian himself."
49,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4604883-cheryl-gatling,0,"Alan Turing, one of the fathers of computer science, proposed a test to determine if computers had achieved the ability to ""think."" If a computer and a human both had a conversation with a human judge (via texting), and the judge was fooled into thinking the computer was human, then the computer would have passed the test. This Turing test is performed every year in a competition called the Loebner prize. The computer program that fools the most judges is awarded ""The Most Human Computer."" The human who convinces the most judges that he is in fact human, is ""The Most Human Human."" Brian Christian entered the competition as a human ""confederate."" Usually humans confederates are told to just be themselves. But Christian threw himself into the project. He did intense preparation. He read transcripts of previous tests. He researched the chatbot programs that were out there. He researched AI programs used for chess, for Jeapardy, and for customer service. He also researched human speech. It turns out computers are quite good at making small talk, since so many opening and closing phrases are similar in every conversations. What computers are not good at (and humans are) is following thethread of a conversation, and coming back to it later, tailoring a conversation to a specific situation, interrupting each other, talking at the same time, and talking in a distinctive, individual style. But these details only scratch the surface of what this book covers. Christian has a background in computer science, philosophy, and poetry, and he uses all of that and more. He asks, what makes us, as humans, special? Anything? Does it matter if we are special? Drawing on anecdotes from his own life, his broad reading, and interviews with all kinds of experts, he goes off on what appear to be wild tangents. Just when I thought, ""This is interesting, but what does it have to do with the Turing test?"" he would bring it back, and make it make sense. He waits till almost the last page to announce that yes, he did indeed win the ""Most Human Human"" award. I was not surprised. But by that time, the actual award seemed minor compared to the effects of all Christian's explorations. During his research he developed a new appreciation for the discoveries and playfulness of conversation, with a friend on the phone, with a stranger in a shop. It almost seems like an exalted duty, getting ""off book,"" past the mechanical exchanges, and making contact with the things that make each of us unique. I felt the same way. I wanted to go out and talk to people. "
50,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1119030-miz-moffatt,4,"Full review posted on Across the LitoverseIn 1950, mathematician Alan Turing predicted that computers would become so sophisticated we would start defining them as sentient, thinking beings. Each year the AI community gathers for the Loebner Prize, the field's most anticipated and controversial event, where the Turing test is administered—and the most advanced computer programs compete to fool a panel of judges into mistaking them for actual people. AI programs and human competitors are given five minutes to chat with a judge via instant messaging and, as the contest currently stands, no conversation topics are off-limits. The program that wins gets top honours as the Most Human Computer. However, real people compete, too, and the one who prevails wins the Most Human Human Award.As Brian Christian prepares as a ""human confederate"" for 2009 Loebner Prize, his conversational strategies and tactics uncover greater answers than anticipated—in studying what behaviours are unique in human conversation, Christian discovers our numerous, shifting definitions of humanity in our digital era. What Turing conceived as the test of artificial intelligence has ultimately become a means of measuring ourselves.Had a definite, immediate interest in the linguistic/language sections of the book based on my academic background. I came to realize how complex human interactions are right down to learning how to interrupt speakers and how we learn the difference between ""uh"" and ""um"", two sounds with no dictionary definition. I got a touch lost with the philosophical debates and the in-depth mathematics sections if only because I don't have a background in either field. For the sake of this book and the general approach to its subject matter, Christian had to assume some knowledge on behalf of the reader or otherwise offer extensive footnotes to explain difficult concepts. But, if reading about AI lets me improve myself as a human, well, I can never turn my nose up at that.Ideal for: Science fiction fans who want a real-life dose of exceptional AI; Science geeks who shall inherit the Earth (or create a program to do so); Readers who revel in language and want to learn what makes English oh-so fascinating; Philosophy fans who can't get enough of the ""what constitutes a human"" debate."
51,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46043561-abhishank-sahu,5,"It doesn't happen very often you pick up a non-fiction read a few pages and think ""This is a good book!"". This is what I felt after starting this book. I remember the last non-fiction for which I felt so was Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind. In a way I felt this book is complimentary to Sapiens. And everyone who loved Sapiens should give this a try. So what is this about? I think the title gives it away. Brian has a written a very thought provoking and ambitious book about what it takes to be human in a world filled with machines. Since the invention of computer, it is becoming smarter everyday and coming closer to becoming a human or at least act like a human. Brian takes different aspects of 'what makes a human human' like sociological, anthropological , philosophical and psychological and compares how computer has been breaking each barrier and becoming more like us. But there is a huge gap. Brian has pointed them out. One of my favorite line from the book was:“To be human is to be 'a' human, a specific person with a life history and idiosyncrasy and point of view; artificial intelligence suggest that the line between intelligent machines and people blurs most when a puree is made of that identity.” He plays a confederate in famous the Loebner Prize (a world wide competition on Turing test) where he fights for the prize of 'The most human human' which is kind of ironical. For this competition he does a lot research and learns different AI system and how they have been trying to imitate human. Which brings us to this book. He has pointed out so many intriguing ideas and theories about being a human and what sets apart from a machine. Each of these systems is trying to imitate one or more aspect of human behavior. But to be a human is to have all these behavior and idiosyncrasies at once which is a huge gap to fill. He has mostly focused on the art of conversation and just this small part of our psychology is too advanced and it'd be like climbing a mountain to ever beat a human. I have thoroughly enjoyed this book. There are so many things to ponder about and to learn about ourselves. You find different dimensions of being a human and embracing all this is what makes us human."
52,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18118107-alex,4,"The main inquiry and subsequent structure of this book was a major source of excitement for me. Other books will ask questions about artificial intelligence itself, which is interesting in its own right, but this book gets more specific in a satisfying way. What can an exploration of artificial intelligence as a contest opponent teach us about the still-nebulous essence of humanity? The inquiry is very much one that I've repeated elsewhere, mostly in anthropology and psychology. Of course, this question of essence runs rampant through the annals of philosophy as well, most notably in the work of Aristotle, only later to inspire and inform the work made famous by the field of positive psychology. The middlegame of this book is pretty fascinating. How do we learn more about the human essence? Yes, structurally, we can always turn to ""learning about a thing by studying its opposite."" Yet, this book doesn't exactly do that. It's studying humanity by studying that which seeks to imitate humanity. This last sentence is even fraught because it's not even necessarily AI that is ""seeking"" to do anything. It's humanity that is trying to imitate itself through the product of AI, and perhaps in the process truly finding itself for the first time. The theoretical branches of philosophy, psychology, and the like are both enabled and disabled by an inherent lack of concern for immediate utility and penchant for abstract reflection. Many times, pronouncements of what man is and is not can be discreetly influenced by the pronouncer's beliefs about and desires for the ultimate conclusion and the resulting implications upon thought and behavior. Here, AI is an objective product, much like any other tech product produced in Silicon Valley, and the authenticity of its imitation is rigorously tested and measured in an engineering-style way that I don't think has ever really been conducted before. I'm just really pumped by this book and the degree of rigor and precision that AI engineering has brought to an eternally interesting, yet perhaps wayward mode of philosophical inquiry. The game itself and the contest at the end provides a fantastic backdrop for the narrative..."
53,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58877654-r-clark,1,"The Most Human Human is, unsurprisingly, the story of Brian Christian’s quest to become the “most human” human. Christian employs his knowledge of topics ranging from existential philosophy to computer science to demonstrate that despite the relentless progress of artificial intelligence, humans can improve too: in their interactions with others and their way of living so as to create a more thoughtful culture. He endeavors to show that the rise of AI can teach us to be more meaningful and mindful in our everyday lives, and implores us to “wake up” from robotic behavior. The Most Human Human covers a vast range of topics and ideas, keeping the reader engaged throughout. Despite this, it is never made clear to the reader precisely why the dizzying array of conceptual tangents that constitute The Most Human Human are necessary to conveying a simple goal for people—to be the most authentic version of yourself. Even within his tangential musings, the authors is compelled to indulge in extensive footnotes, further inundating the reader in unneeded information. Although Christian’s involvement in the Loebner Prize allegedly served as the catalyst for his thoughts on being human, it often felt as a mere opportunity to deliver Christian’s personal beliefs. When The Most Human Human began using the ability to compress text as a metaphor for meaningless and robotic conversations and writing, its irony and lack of self-awareness became painfully obvious; Christian’s book boils down to constant repetition of a thesis. Despite its large amount of science, The Most Human Human is merely a re-communication of Romantic-era ideas for contemporary readers. Christian’s unfocused (albeit enjoyable) collection of reflections and experiences is best read as a prescription for humanity, rather than a thoughtful or relevant commentary on artificial intelligence in society. Brian Christian wrote that reading the words “What’s new?” in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance was a major event in his life. I would advise him to reread these words."
54,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1186194-emily-hillard,4,"This book is a great read for anyone interested in linguistics, computer programming, or philosophy. However, you can tell it was written by a philosopher, and not a specialist in other fields. I opened this book expecting more of a narrative of the Turing test with some rumination on his technique, but there are whole chapters that only mention the Turing test or even AI development- I am thinking specifically of the last chapter before the conclusion.Another tell-tale mark of the philosopher are random paragraphs throughout the book that are only barely related to the topic at hand- often asking only a question, or making a simple point and then moving on. It's as if the author wrote his book by writing random thoughts under the chapter headings, and then when he could not sufficiently flesh out a note or merge it with another, he left it in there as an incongruous paragraph.On the whole, the book was an enlightening foray into the world of AI and what it means to be human. I would really like to have seen transcripts of the Turing tests the author participated in as a confederate in an appendix in addition to the little snippets he included, but the was plenty of food for thought without it.Favorite Quotes:""The same woman, as if miraculously, again returns. 'I can make an exception for you' she says. It occurs to me that an 'exception' is what programmers call it when software breaks.""

The book falls in the intriguing and dangerous genre of popular intellectualism (though Christian might bemoan the act of classification itself).Many such books fail because they give off an air of expertise and finality. ""This field is interesting because of what it says about my topic,"" authors seem to say, ""and once you finish reading, there's no reason to go learn more about it.""Christian's work is the opposite. Rather than trying to prove himself in the diverse fields he touches upon (poetry, philosophy, linguistics, computer science, professional chess, and dating, to name a few), Christian marvelously plays the role of intrigued and intriguing guide. He is not a native of the city who leads the same tour that his father did and recites every detail of the architecture and culture by rote. Rather, he's the fellow traveler, as interested in exploring, poking around, and asking questions as we are.The dust jacket boldly pronounces:In examining the philosophical, biological, and moral questions the Turing test poses, the ultimate subject of the book is humanity—an attempt to fill in the blank in the ancient riddle, ""The human being is the only animal that _____.""While a book that did that may have been interesting, it is not the book that Christian wrote. He doesn't provide answers, but the omission is not typical and pedantic. ""I could tell you the answer, but it's better if you work it out for yourself,"" many academics say. ""The remainder is left as an exercise for the reader."" The Most Human Human, on the other hand, has no answers because, in a very real sense, it has no question.Read the rest of the review here."
56,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11065851-greg,4,"Poetry and computer science need to get together more often. This book was, in many regards, profound. I have never considered using computers as a foil to better understanding what it means to be a human. Christian thoughtfully leads the reader though a variety of themes and topics pertaining to the human condition and considers the struggles and barriers computer scientists and AI leaders have faced in trying to simulate or replicate the ineffable attributes of mankind. He does so in a very balanced way though, never slamming the AI community or getting lost in a frenzied Orwellian tone. The themes consisted of things like conversation, identity, compression, innovation, memory, routine, culture, and relationships. I listened to this book, which I think added to my enjoyment of it because it is very poetical. I think some of the imagery would have been lost to me in reading it, and some of the thoughts provoked might have been lost in the cognitive load of pulling meaning from written text. Being poetical, this book was a bit hard to follow in terms of overall point or theme. I didn't mind it that much, but as mentioned above I think I would have struggled with it a bit more if I had read it instead of listened to it. However, one should really spend time with this book. It is by definition and subject more about spending time with the thing than getting through it. I loved how it expanded my thinking about what it means to be a human, and what the future of machines might be like. Indeed, what the future of THINKING ABOUT machines might be like! Be ready for some fascinating bits of thinking around things like programmed chess, autocorrect, the phrases ""um"" and ""ah"" in language, and the comparison of lossless compression to our daily lived experience. This is a fascinating read and offers increasingly more important food for thought in our technology saturated world. "
57,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2017984-bryan-kibbe,5,"What makes us distinctly human? That is the question at the center of this book. Avoiding pretension and useless vagaries, Christian offers up a series of thoughtful meditations in answer, which orient around the major themes of the human capacity for spontaneity, surprise, and artistic creativity. What I especially enjoyed and appreciated about this book were Christian's ability and commitment to see the computer less as a threat and more as an unrelenting question about what we want to stake our humanity on. Framed in such a way, the computer is like a good conversational partner that helps us to learn more about ourselves through the conversation. At different points while reading, I thought that Christian moved too quickly from one thought to the next and did not linger to sustain some thoughts enough. But then I realized that this may be an intentional and possibly brilliant maneuver on Christian's part. That is, this book reads less like a slow and steady argument from beginning to end and more like one of those wandering and deep conversations that you have at 3AM in the morning with a good friend that is well read. Christian writes the book as though it is a conversation, whereby he moves quickly from one topic to the next, in much the way that conversations do. Fortunately, Christian is well read and he is sure to surprise and enlighten his readers with new and thoughtful connections and metaphors. And therein lies the brilliance. Christian exemplifies in his writing the kind of spontaneity, opportunities for surprise, and creativity that he is otherwise pointing to as the distinctly human. That is, Christian does not merely describe authentic humanity, he also strives to evidence it in his own writing about the subject. This is an accessible and enjoyable book that I would recommend to a wide reading audience. "

After all, I'm a software developer and AI is a fascinating topic for me. And that's what I expected this book to be about.But it's not. It's 271 pages of Christian rambling on about whatever topic strikes his fancy. The narrative is framed by him taking part in the 2009 Loebner prize as a ""confederate"", a human who must (hopefully) convince a judge, in five minutes and via nothing but a chat program, that they are indeed a human and not an AI.I was hoping for a discussion of the various techniques used by the AI competitors. While there were brief excursions into computer science, they were not in any depth.The bulk of the book was taken up by Christian arguing about how conversation is something that truly defines a human as a human, and computers may never master it. An old, tired argument, and one that was made about chess up until fifteen years ago. Then Deep Blue came along and the goalposts of AI shifted - ""chess is a simple matter of computation, a computer can be good at it without any real intelligence"". Christian talks at some length about this in his book, but he seems completely oblivious to the irony of him making exactly the same arguments about conversation.If you can get past the philosophical navel-gazing (something I barely managed to do in spots), there are definitely parts of this book that are really interesting. It touches on a huge number of subjects, from computer science to information theory to literature to linguistics."
59,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1000945-david-oskutis,3,"If you are a fan of philosophical discussion and debate, this is a great book in entertaining the idea of what it means to be a human. If non-fiction and theory based ideas are not your cup of tea, you'll probably hate this one. I did find it enjoyable, although I disagreed with a few parts (particularly the author's idea of compression and literature, but I also believe the finer points of a book are in the sentences that make up the story...not just the summary of the story itself). What I did find lacking was the resolution of the contest. The Turing test, pitting humans and computers against a panel of judges, in which the judges must guess which is human and which is a computer. Then, the ""most human computer"" gets a prize, and ironically, the ""most human human"" also gets an honorable prize. While reading a bit of the transcripts of the contest, I found myself sucked in...but a full transcript of the exchange is never provided. Furthermore, once the winner of the most human human prize is announced there is...well, nothing. ""You win, here ya go, on to the next chapter"" is hardly a satisfying finish to a long book questioning the very essence of what makes a human centered around this very contest (it's like watching Rocky, but when the fight starts, it jumps right to the announcement of Apollo winning the decision, without watching the fight at all. But, those were the only drawbacks. The author uses human, layman's terms, and a bit of scientific and philosophic research to venture through the various characteristics of what makes a human a human. Thought, emotion, decision making process, and even interaction with other humans (and machines) are all fleshed out and sometimes even examined at microscopic levels to the point of causing the reader to also question their own definition of what makes a human. "
60,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Amazingly dense but very readable and a lot of funOstensibly the book is about Brian Christian’s adventure preparing for and playing as a human “confederate” in the 2009 annual Loebner Prize contest. This is the competition in which AI enthusiasts use the Turning test to see which computers are the best at fooling human judges into thinking they are human. Christian sits at a remote computer and tries to convince the judges that he is a human and not just a bot pretending to be human. If he succeeds and he is the best of the humans he will win the “Most Human Human” award.I think that after reading this book that Christian is indeed a very human human. He is clever, creative, curious to an almost amazing degree and is social; but whether he is the most human human will be in considerable doubt even if he wins the award. (No spoilers here!) The reason is simple: the Turing test tells us nothing about Christian physically and very little about him emotionally. But more than that the Turing test (and this book) is really more—much more—about language than it is about what it means to be alive (as in the subtitle of the book).Christian is an expert on language—I should say languages since he is a computer geek as well as a teacher of poetry. He knows code and he knows Shakespeare. And Christian is also very smart and very knowledgeable as you’ll discover by reading this book. So (of course!) he can’t be the most human human. Alas.Christian is also a very good writer. His writing style is loud, bold, adventuresome and full of “Look mom, I’m writing” flourishes. There are asides aplenty and oodles of arcane factoids sprinkled everywhere. A poet writes in a nonlinear fashion using poetic devices such as sound and rhythm to enhance meaning. Christian writes like a poet but instead of relying on familiar poetic devices to achieve nonlinear communication he uses ideas and facts from a large variety of human disciplines to achieve the dense feel this book has. Too much information (TMI) is not something that Christian fears!Okay, let’s go back to the book’s title. Notice that the first “human” is an adjective while the second one is a noun. MS Word’s grammar and spell checker doesn’t understand the distinction which is why the second “human” is underlined in red in my text file. But a computer program that does recognize the difference in usage would not see the second “human” as an error. People notice the distinction without thinking about it and without even being aware that one word is an adjective and the other a noun. And that in a nutshell is what the competition is all about: knowing how humans use and understand language.Here’s an example of something similar from the concluding chapter. It’s a headline in which Christian changes the word “offensive” from the intended noun form into an adjective with amusing consequences: “UK Minister’s Charm Offensive.” (p. 268)What makes this book so very interesting is how Christian goes about trying to solve the problem of how to appear human over a computer terminal. What is it that makes us uniquely human, and what can we type to make it clear that we are not a computer program? Since the evidence that the judges would get would be in the form of language—words and symbols typed from a keyboard—Christian’s prep involved a deep study of language. He looked at pauses in speech and seemingly non-meaningful utterances like “um” and “uh” to see what they really conveyed. He found that some sounds meant the speaker wanted to interrupt, or to continue speaking without being interrupted. He called some of this “barging in,” and found that is what humans do. Do chatbots trying to imitate humans know enough to barge in? And then there is the “body language” component of human communication. According to the “7-38-55” rule advanced by UCLA psych prof Albert Mehrabian, “55 percent of what you convey when you speak comes from your body language, 38 percent from your tone of voice, and a paltry 7 percent from the words you choose.” (p. 174) How might Christian include some body language in his effort to convince the judge that he is human? He can’t so he is stuck with the paltry seven percent to work with.And then there is this way of looking at the Turning test: it’s a lie-detector test. The computer is lying and so the judge has to expose the lies. And the “confederate” has to show the judge that he is not lying.And then there are “holds” in conversations, words, phrases, ideas that come up in conversations that encourage the other speaker to reply or ask a relevant question or maybe to change the subject. (Called “holds” from the holds in rock climbing.) How the remote reacts to holds may help the judge know if the remote is a computer or a human. Using holds is distinct from “streamlining” in which the speaker expresses something in a generic and/or nonspecific way, such as saying “I went home” instead of “I bicycled home.” There’s no hold in the first statement. The word “bicycled” is the hold in the second. A human might respond with a question about bicycling. (A smart bot might as well.)Sometimes Christian just likes to show off—and he does it well. For example he makes the point that some surnames come from occupations, such as “Cook,” “Baker,” “Smith”—but no! He doesn’t use such obvious examples. Instead he gives us “Fletchers,” “Coopers,” and “Sawyers,” and tells us that Fletchers made arrows, Coopers made barrels and Sawyers cut wood. He goes on to recall that Chris Moneymaker won some serious coin playing poker and that Usain Bolt can run like lightening while informing us that these serendipitous examples are called “aptronyms.” (pp. 187-188)Finally I want to mention the “Shannon Game” (after Claude Shannon, founder of information theory). The way it works is you try to guess the next letter or space in a sentence—letter not word. Your ability to do so relates to the amount of entropy in the letters. High entropy letters are usually the less-used letters, less predictable and therefore seemingly more random. If the sentence begins “The mastermind failed...” the letters after the first “T” are easy to guess and have low entropy since “the” is one of the most common words in the language. But the “f” has high entropy because it is hard to guess since the “mastermind” could be doing, saying, thinking, or being most anything.I was going to call this a “cute book on a cute subject” but after reading it I discovered that it is much deeper than that. Insofar as possessing language is the essence of what distinguishes us from other animals (and it is to a large extent), Christian’s discoveries and his experiences here are profound.—Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"
61,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11308067-francesca,3,"The content of this book was great. The author, however, comes across as someone with a very inflated opinion of his own knowledge, but who relies on myriad quotes to make any of his points. In good writing, I feel quoting should be used as little as possible, and only in support of something you have already put into words yourself. At one point Christian ironically quotes Dali - ""The first man to compare the cheeks of a young woman to a rose was obviously a poet; the first to repeat it was possibly an idiot."" to make the point that a poetry bot spewing out tired trope and worn-out metaphors is missing the key ingredient of creativity and novel expression that makes human poetry and writing so special. His quote is supposed to teach us (the readers) a lesson, but I think he needs to take a harder look at that himself. I don't mean to be too harsh here, which I probably have been. I did, on balance, enjoy reading 'The Most Human Human'. I just felt that Christian's arrogance and, at times, condescension, was really distracting from what was often fascinating subject matter, and this was much to the book's detriment. His story is of his learning curve ahead of the competition for the Loebner Prize - a curve copied by the reader as they progress through the book - and in my opinion it would have been nicer if he had been someone for the reader to identify with a little more during that progression.On the whole, as a linguist and someone with a little bit of knowledge of and interest in computer science, this book provided me with plenty of daydreaming material, and some interesting conversational tidbits. It's not life-changing, but it's decent commuter reading that gives you something to chat about over coffee. "
62,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2327571-amy,5,"I really love this book. The mix of philosophy and artificial intelligence is interesting throughout. I'm only part of the way through, but I hope he ties it all together in the end. It is sort of all over the place. Parts of this have really made me think. The author researched and worked to participate in the Turing Test - where humans and computers both hold conversations with the judges and try to convince them they are the human. The author succeeds by being unpredictable, and by using humor, among other things. Here's another review that I don't want to forget.It's actually hard to describe this book because it covers so many areas. This makes sense, as Christian is basically trying to define what it means to be human, which is a rather complex question to answer. He has background in a lot of different areas (poetry, philosophy, computers) and this comes out in the writing--he is able to be compelling and technical, poetic and funny, and above all, clear. Despite jumping around to cover almost any subject you can think of while ostensibly answering the question ""What makes us human, and can computers ever capture that quality?"" it never feel unfocused--although it never exactly answers the question. Very satisfying and enjoyable, and I particularly liked the many footnotes that added even more tangential trivia tidbits to the book.What I noticed about this book is that if you pay attention to the main theme of the book--how one might convince someone else that you are human while conversing with them--he rather subtly follows all his own advice while writing this book"

Fertilization to fertilizer. Ashes to ashes. And we spark across the gap.""There are books you love and then there are books you love so much that you immediately think of friends to buy them for. I'm definitely putting this on my Christmas 'to buy' list. Christian writes well and accessibly about what artificial intelligence research, and its intersection with philosophy, tells us about being human. It's a rare gift to write engagingly about a complex topic and toe the line between oversimplification and excessive detail.Most importantly, this book explained things about myself. Why do I feel more connected to certain friends even if I 'like' all of my friends equally? (See: Getting Out of Book) Why do I feel the need to obsessively proofread every email I send to try and guess how it might come across?Christian takes us through a loosely connected tour of artificial intelligence and philosophy, stopping along the way to give us historical insight into how the 'seat of the soul' has changed over the past few thousand years. And then the linguistic theory in the final chapter was interesting, especially when applying ideas like entropy and irreducibility to prose and language. In short, it's a great multifaceted tour of what it means to be human. I should probably go ahead and re-read it!And beyond that, what it means to be me."

Christian thinks about what it means to be humaan in the world in which we live, the world that was, and the world that is to come. I had many ah-ha moments while reading this book: Christian relates a story about an author who attempts to outsource his customer service department only to be besieged by new reps calling to ask how to solve problems. In desperation, the author finally sends the reps an e-mail that says, ""Don't ask me for permission. Do what you think is right."" Suddenly, the calls to the author cease and customer service ratings rapidly improve.

The answer he comes up with is that of grounded spontaneity (TM): humans can be spontaneous in their actions, but this spontaneity is not randomness (which has no meaning and no connection to previous states). It is, rather, creating a fork on the path that one is traveling along. The book (essentially) explores this one idea from several different angles, from information theory and compression algorithms to customer service reps following a set script to pick-up artists. The most successful metaphor was his discussion of chess. Discussing how the game is played, he notes that a chess game really only gets interesting in the middle (out of the opening moves and before falling into the end game). This is called ""getting out of book"", where the book is common knowledge about what you are supposed to do to open the game and, when the game is coming close, how you are supposed to play in order to finish off your opponent. ""Getting out of book"" is where the game is more spontaneous, free-flowing, and less likely to be, in some sense, determined. Your mileage may vary with this book. I found most of it interesting. The organization was clunky in certain chapters and there were too many subsections (especially since the transitions between many subsections was abrupt). If you are interested in a fun (and relatively light) treatment of what it means to be human, you will enjoy this."

Players, each with a list of words they've come up with, compare lists and cross off every word that appears on more than one list. The player with the most words remaining on her sheet wins. I've always fancied this a rather cruel way of keeping score. Imagine a player who comes up with four words, and each of her four opponents only comes up with one of them. The round is a draw, but it hardly feels like one....As the line of human uniqueness pulls back ever more, we put the eggs of our identity into fewer and fewer baskets; then the computer comes along and takes that final basket, crosses off that final word. And we realize that uniqueness, per se, never had anything to do with it. The ramparts we built to keep other species and other mechanisms out also kept us in. In breaking down that last door, computers have let us out. And back into the light.

Who would have imagined that the computer's earliest achievements would be in the domain of logical analysis, a capacity held to be what made us most different from everything on the planet? That it could drive a car and guide a missile before it could ride a bike? That it could make plausible preludes in the style of Bach before it could make plausible small talk? That it could translate before it could paraphrase? That it could spin half-plausible postmodern theory essays before it could be shown a chair and say, as any toddler can, ""chair""?

67,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16524307-tony-fitzpatrick,3,"The development of Artificial Intelligence is big news - with competing camps worried about the advent of the ""singularity"" (when machines become smarter than us), and others concerned about its impact on jobs and skills. I am rather relaxed - the ability of AI to support tasks outside of a narrowly defined field is over hyped, and the opportunity it gives to enhance rather than enslave human life carries much promise. This book is concerned with the differences between human and machine intelligence. Brian Christian took part in the Turing Test as part of the Loebner Contest in Brighton several years ago. In the test, devised by and named after the sainted Alan, humans converse with disembodied others using messaging, trying to determine if they are talking to a human or a machine. Christian was voted ""The Most Human Human"" in that year's particular set of tests.The book rather rambles, however it makes a good fist at exploring the human mind's phenomenal abilities at reasoning, linguistics, and even information compression techniques. It covers art, philosophy, science and interesting diversions on topics like chess playing. It's conclusions rather back up my own hypothesis - we have little to fear from computer intelligence, the bigger problem will be to try and ensure we don't ask AI to run before it can even make toddler steps. AI can successfully play GO or Chess, but it remains hopeless at understanding and summarizing the emotions behind even the simplest of children's stories. Christian celebrates and clearly provides evidence for our awesome abilities, and by comparison shows how dumb machines really are. "
68,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2811685-eva,5,"What I love about this book is the idea that machines could potentially make us more human, forcing us to reexamine the standards we hold for ourselves. Basically, I found this book in the 'new nonfiction' section of the library, and I was immediately intrigued by the title.when the read the first section, about the Turing test, which is a competition for AI program designers where judges talk via chat with a computer and a human and try to tell which one is which. The computer program that best simulates humans is awarded 'the most human computer' award. The human that best convinces judges that they are human is awarded 'the most human human' award. Brian Christian spends the book exploring how humans talk, interact, and what makes us human. I love how he kind of argues with himself, refutes his own arguments. However, i felt like the supersciencey, partsofbraindothisandthat parts were a bit tedious. Furthermore, since it's nonfiction, it was a bit hard to read all in one sitting. I kept reading, hoping to get a complete log of HIS conversations with the judges, since he included so many other people's, but all we got was a small story and then 'oh I won the most human human award!' that was disappointing. The book is funny though, which is hard to do in nonfiction, and I love the hopeful message it ends ~ even if someday, a computer won the Turing test, it would just end the Turing test, not humanity, which can reinvent itself continuously. He never did tell us how to be human best, did he"
69,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3236027-dave,3,"The central premise of the book is excellent and thought provoking: Maybe the fact that machines are starting to look more human is a sign that a) Yes, technology is improving, but b) Maybe humans are getting worse at being human. Hidden behind this question is to what degree we begin to act more like machines the more we interact with them. With interactions between cultures, a least something gets exchanged from one side to the other. Maybe the same thing happens when we interact with machines.My problem with the book is that it rambled and wandered into other questions. Certainly these were related questions, like the nature of the soul, language, and so on, but those parts I found much less interesting. There were times when I felt Christian was reaching to turn what would have been a great 25 page article into a book.Still, his basic point about the general dumbing down of our communication and the staged responses that dominate much of our discourse holds true.The book did raise another question that near as I can tell (I did skip some sections) the author did not deal with. Why are some so bent on proving that machines are 'human?' Is it- Done by some in a vacuum, all for the sake of the experiment itself, or- Done because ultimately this will help us discover what it means to be human after all, or- Done because some hate the idea of humanity and secretly, even if unconsciously, seek to abolish it.I feel like there is an excellent documentary in the making somewhere there.

It’s such a neutral, standard response that it’s lost all meaning. A computer is great at these types of seemingly scripted exchanges, as Brian Christian quickly learns when preparing for the 2009 Turing Test, where judges engage in short instant-message conversations and have to decide whether they’re chatting with a computer or a human. “Pleasantries are low entropy, biased so far that they stop being an earnest inquiry and become ritual. Ritual has its virtues, of course, and I don’t quibble with them in the slightest. But if we really want to start fathoming someone, we need to get them speaking in sentences we can’t finish.” This is just one of many poignant observations Christian makes about the ways humans and computers differ (or, at times, operate similarly) as he tries to figure out how to ensure the judges will deem him human so he can win the Turing Test’s “Most Human Human” award. I don’t want to spoil whether he is in fact the most human human of 2009, but I can tell you he’s at least a very intelligent and witty one, and his narration is engaging even when he’s reading transcripts of instant message conversations. Whether you’re interested in machines or art, and especially why machines can’t make art on their own, there are plenty of soul-searching passages here for everyone."

Each year the 'most human computer' is crowned as the winner, but Christian's goal was a different one: Each year the 'most human human', i.e. the one that gets the highest marks on 'humanness' by the judges, is also determined, and this was the prize that Christian was aiming for. His preparation for the competition here serves as a backdrop for a study of what it entails to behave like a human - and what the difference is between this and /being/ a human.It is a very interesting discussion of what makes a discussion interesting, which involves experts and expertise from many walks of life - from pick-up artists to poets to programmers. Interspersed in the narrative of the Loebner Prize are chapters on information theory, poetry and dating that could have been knitted together more tightly.The book starts with an eyebrow-raising factoid - that Claude Shannon (an early pioneer in information theory) married a computer¹. Christian misses a trick by not ending the book by looking at what it would mean for a (modern-day) computer to be able to marry.¹which in those days of course was a (human) job description, not a machine."

Broadly insightful and rarely overwrought.-Author's background in science writing and philosophy plus his MFA in Poetry correspond well to the fluidity with which he moves between tangential topics while keeping sight of the central theme. The book revolves around communication, in particular the written word since text is the format for the Turing Test undertaken, and Brian Christian's well-written prose shows off the fact that he studied and contemplated the topic well in preparation for his Loebner Prize contest and vie for the Most Human Human.-Topically very similar to the likewise recently published book by James Gleick, The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood."
73,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/346802-rachel,3,"I enjoyed this book. However, reading the full-length version did not add much to my appreciation of the subject compared to just reading The Atlantic magazine article (""Mind vs. Machine"", March 2011) that summarized author Brian Christian's participation as a human confederate competing against chat bots in the 2009 Turing Test.Christian devoted a lot of time to discussing chess, drawing an analogy between chess matches and conversations - both usually rely on customary openings (greetings) and closings (goodbyes) drawn from a standard set of options, and in only some instances do they develop a substantial ""off book"" middle section in which more interesting and unpredictable things happen. He observed that chat bots and computerized chess models strove to minimize the ""off book"" portion because they performed better in more familiar territory. As someone who has not studied chess, I thought Christian's point was well taken but found this section of the book overly long.Descriptions of the Turing Test proceedings and chat transcripts from previous competitions were more interesting, by turns amusing and ironic. Overall, this was a good read. The book made some important philosophical concepts about the nature of humanity more accessible and provided a thoughtful discussion of artificial intelligence and which of humans' claims to uniqueness are most defensible and/or valuable.

What kind of book would you expect from a Brown graduate with a double major in computer science & philosophy and a master's degree in poetry? Probably something like The Most Human Human. Christian uses as his take-off point the annual Loebner Prize contest in which computers try to convince judges that they are human in competition with some humans who want to convince the judges that THEY are NOT computers! Christian was one of the human competitors in 2009 & uses this experience to engage in a far-ranging exploration of what it means to be human. The subjects he covers are extremely diverse, from the existence of the soul to speed dating, and the sources he cites range from Aristotle to Twyla Tharp to Philip K Dick. He is very clearly smart & very liberally educated, and the result is informative & interesting.At the same time, Christian's writing is quite uneven, at times almost amateurish when he descends into GenX jargon and phrases like "" a computer poet would be much scarier of a prospect..."". He also seems to pronounce pure personal opinions, with no apparent supporting evidence, as confidently as he quotes renowned authorities & the great thinkers of history. And personally I am not nearly as interested in chess as Christian, even though I admit it has been a focus of a lot of AI work.Nonetheless, the book is entertaining, thought-provoking, and I guarantee you will learn something. I recommend it."

It is amazing how much of our daily lives are scriptable, and hence copyable by computers/AI. Hopefully nobody falls for those long lost cousin in Nigeria scam emails, but an email that simply says ""hey this (as a hyperlink) made me think of you -name"" would still get many clicks, even in super tech-savvy circles. Another example is highlighted in his explanation about how our society (people) are becoming more robotic (human robots) and it is these jobs that are being replaced by automation; as technology moves forward people need to adapt and fight against complacency.The book is filled with interesting history, philosophy and introductory computer science/AI factoids. Many interesting references are cited and it is clearly written from someone outside the AI community, which is nice because it brings more breadth than other writings that I've read on the Turing Test. The story telling and goal-driven approach to winning The Most Human Human Award worked quite well for the task at hand.I'd suggest it for those interested in the future of computers and humans (hopefully that covers all the readers of this blurb!), as the two will become ever-more tangled in the years to come...

The program receiving the most ""human"" votes is dubbed the ""most human computer,"" while the person receiving the most votes earns the title of ""most human human."" Poet and science writer Christian sets out to win the latter title and through his quest, investigates the nature of human interactions, the meaning of language, and the essence of what sets us apart from machines that can process information far faster than we can. Ranging from philosophy through the construction of pickup lines to poetry, Christian examines what it means to be human and how we interact with one another, and with computers as equals—via automated telephone menus and within the medical establishment, for example. This fabulous book demonstrates that we are capable of experiencing and sharing far deeper thoughts than even the best computers—and that too often we fail to achieve the highest level of humanness.

I enjoyed the sections on those topics and chess, but honestly way too much of this book was random asides and tangents on things that were mildly relevant and poorly held together. This isn't to mention that the writing was just kind of bad, too. Was there an editor?? As a linguist and academically-minded person I was annoyed by a lot of Christian's broad generalizations. First of all, he has a lot of weird misunderstandings about linguistics and language use. Second of all he seems to think he came up with the field of pragmatics when in fact it is a totally legitimate field (he said something about how linguists haven't thought about issues like ""non-words"" such as ""uhh/umm"" in speech, but linguists totally have and write about it a lot). For me this ruined a lot of his other ruminations because I wondered ""if he doesn't understand linguistics, does he really understand all these other topics?""All that said, it was an engaging book. And I really did enjoy the parts about chatbots. That was my main reason for reading it, because I think the chatbot world is very interesting, but I think this particular story would be better suited to an hour-long podcast or a longform article than a book.

So, I had to buy another copy when I got home. And now that I've finished it, my husband will be reading it. To me, this isn't just another book about the history of chess/computer science/... which is sort of what I expected. It's a lovely little gem about not just what makes us human (such an excellent species ;-)) but about that part of our behavior that certainly isn't human at all and yet somehow seems to fill up a lot of our daily lives. It is a gentle reminder to reflect a little more on how to live our lives - living rather than merely existing...One could argue in spirit of this book that just as a philosopher would find it comforting to define thinking as the purpose of humans, a poet would find that purpose strongly linked to language and communication... but then the Turing-test itself has its obvious limits. I'll warmly recommend this book to all of my friends - not just programmers and geeks, but also to people who aren't really that much into tech stuff but have an interest in philosophy and/or linguistics in some way.

Author Brian Christian was intrigued by the ""most human computer"" contest spawned by computer pioneer Alan Turing's famous prediction: by 2000, human simulations would be so convincing that someone chatting online with a human and a bot wouldn't be able to tell them apart. The annual Turing competition (now the Loebner Prize) pairs 4 fake humans (bots) with 4 actual humans. After each 5-minute pair of chats, a judge votes which is which. The bot that convinces the most judges it's human wins the Most Human Computer award. The human that gets the most votes wins the Most Human Human award. How can someone vie to be ""most"" human? ""Just be yourself,"" Christian was advised. But doesn't that imply it's possible to NOT be yourself?--to fail at being yourself? His yellow brick road toward the Most Human Human award is as adventure-filled as Dorothy's. (Comparisons to ""Pilgrim's Progress"" are tempting but off the mark.) Christian explores dozens of angles on defining human uniqueness. Along the way we look into definitions of the soul from ancient Greece to Descartes; communication within as well as between brains; contrasting approaches to programming bots; and a host of other factors that make human beings distinctive...if, indeed, we are distinctive!I found this book so rich, diverse, and insightful that I read it twice.

The Most Human Human takes on a number of these topics, trying to rein them in and make them into a cohesive whole. The breadth and variety of topics that the book takes on is enormous. The things that various brain disorders tell us about how our brains work, the progression of human endeavor in philosophical discussion, and the evolution of computer AI, are just a few of the intriguing realms of ideas explored. One of my favorite sections includes an analysis of how lossy and lossless compression work and how they relate to how we interpret the world naturally. The drawback to the expansiveness of the topic is that at times the book really does seem to fail to hold together and more be a series of tangents that don't always come full circle. The book is good and fun and insightful, but for all its attempts to try and setup a methodical order or unified thesis, it seems to come up short. I'd also recommend reading the book as opposed to listening to the audiobook, as the version read by the author is a bit monotone and as it moves through the plethora of facts, you're more likely to miss something than if you have the text in front of you."

One can learn a lot about how different programs approach conversation, how they sometimes succeed, and what the future of computer communication needs to be more human-like. Even more, the discussions of ""getting out of book"", holds, communication entropy, and the Shannon game were interesting and educational. As others have noted, though, Christian often oversteps his bounds. The book reads like an information dump that feels haphazardly put together to tell a coherent story. Anything that has a remote resemblance to, and that can be fit under a umbrella of computer language and human interaction, is somehow deserving of exposition. It just reads too disconnected, with discussions of compression too tangential to the central thesis, and the essay about how autocorrect forces our language into the vocabulary that Apple/Droid want us to have, itself seems too forced. In 200 (rather than 270) pages, Christian could have told a much tighter and persuasive story. However, and what perhaps is the ultimate metric of non-fiction, I came out the other end of the book more educated than where I started. So for that, 3.5 stars."
82,0385533063,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62238814-rae,1,"Anything interesting Mr. Christian has to say in his book is lost in the frankly sloppy, unfocused and disjointed writing. It's a deep shame, because the topic has the potential to be interesting. I was immediately put off by the author's florid prose - don't get me wrong, I love a bit of extravagant writing now and again, but it was just too much, too often. Nearly every sentence features multiple comma splices. There's a lot of ""Indeed, one might say, perhaps, it's well known..."" type phrases peppered in that don't do much other than pad out the word count. And - my own personal cardinal sin of writing - the abundance of completely unnecessary italics, just stuffed onto any old word regardless of if its presence improves the sentence. Trust me, once you start noticing unnecessary italics, you'll see them everywhere.I'm sorry, Mr. Christian, I really wanted to like your book. But this is a great example of style over substance where the style wasn't nearly well-done enough to conceal the weak substance."

The book is an interesting read, chalk full of interesting quotes and references, along with author's own assessment of aspects that make us human. However, I also found the book to be quite obtuse on multiple occassions, finding myself questioning - ""okay, interesting information but what is the point?"". I am also not a big fan of books whose content promarily comprises of quoting work of others. This book is no exception. It is as if the author feels that without support from other authors, this book would have no bones to stand on its own, would end up being a lump of undifferentiated mass of flesh instead. I don't think this would have been the case. The author had many beautiful insights to share, which would have been delightful to read in their own light and details. "

He talks about the analogies between instances in our daily life and compression (information theory), the repetitive nature of pick-up lines, poetry, the 'singularity', Gary Kasparov's match against Deep Blue and lists down excerpts from his conversations with people pre and post-Turing Test. He has a unique style of writing and the overall take on the problem is different from anything I've read in recent times that's related to AI.

Christian was one of the human participants in the 2009 Turing Test, where computers attempt to pass as humans as both chat to judges over written messages. Christian has degrees in Computer Science and Philosophy and so is ideally placed to write about the subject of humanity and AI. The book is also well crafted. The story of Christian being a confederate in the Turing Test and his discussion of AI and humanity is interleaved skillfully. Comparing chatbots and how people also follow scripts as well as how computers have improved at chess and other fields and pondering what makes humans different is definitely an interesting topic and the book does this all well.For anyone interested and how humanity is different and similar it's definitely worth a read.

Perhaps I am too knowledgeable about this area, but I found almost nothing new or insightful in this book.I was trying to think one of new thing I learned from the book: it that the space was introduced as an interword separator by Irish monks in the seventh century. (See page 245.) This is apparently true, but the author also makes it sound like there were no interword separators before the 7th century, and in spite of script continua and other languages with no interword space, this is not true: Namely, there are many other kinds of interword separators used in ancient writing, e.g., the interpunct dot in Latin.I would have liked a book that delved deeper into topics, but this one is too superficial."

It's mostly about what makes us human, unique, and how to use that by building robots. And that is interesting. If we want to built artificial intelligence that passes Turing tests and works well, we need to understand who we are.Brian Christian has a brilliant mind, is a good observer and seemes programmed to give us all this information.I was excited reading this book, though I have to say it contains lot of (side) information and backgrounds, which slows the book down and makes it pretty incoherent sometimes. It's as far from a relaxing novel as it is from science-fiction. By that I mean that you have to pay full attention during reading.At last, aren't we robots in some way?"

At times the digressions seemed not to go far enough, and other times they seemed to go on and on, and in the end, I think the book is useful as a kind of thought primer- let your brain, with its amazing ability to associate different ideas, continue where Christian cuts his explorations off.

The footnotes are hilarious.Christian's voice is witty, fun, smart, and personal. There is nothing at all boring about this book.

First, Christian left out his participation in the actual event that was driving this book. That, to me, was the essence of this narrative - and it never made an appearance. There were some great bits in here about chatbots and language. But, geez, some of these tangential ideas turned into massive detours. I left really confused and lost at points trying to figure out exactly what Christian wanted this book to be. That confusion aside, though, there are some interesting bits. "

Brian Christian is a poet as well as a computer programmer, and both sensibilities inform this book. Christian uses his experience serving as one of the human ""controls"" at the big annual Turing Test as the jumping-off point for a clearly and warmly written popsci survey of various topics in cognitive science, linguistics, information theory, and AI research. Lots of clever lines, lots of great quotes, lots of subtle and overt encouragements to the reader to be more the kind of person I also want more people to be: curious, idiosyncratic, novelty-preferring, dissatisfied with confining, predictable roles and language. I find Christian to be a kindred spirit -- I liked his book, and after reading it I liked him."

In fact, at a 2008 software competition, a computer program called Elbot deceptively convinced almost 30% of judges interrogating it via teleprompter that they were exchanging messages with another human being – and for this, Elbot won the “Most Human Computer” award. At that same competition, a “Most Human Human” award went to the human contestant who was able to convince the most number of judges that they were indeed teletyping exchanges with another human being. As computers deepen their ability to talk and interact like humans with humans, the book explores the question -what is it that makes our conversations with each other human?"

Christian sets out to win that prize in 2009, and the result is this thought provoking book about the way we reason, the way we communicate and the complexities of language.The book is a few years old so some of the bots he praises seem quite poor, but that's really secondary to the more interesting philosophical discussion to be had here (as well as a nice little anecdote around why those who think philosophy is useless are already philosophizing)."

I think there were moments that the author got lost in his own ideas or pursuit of an idea, but there were definite lessons that I will take away that might improve my communication skills. The idea that we are so easily replaced by a machine in something so personal as conversation frightens me much more than the thought that a robot could take my job. The author gets credit for being one of very few whose writing made me stop reading and pick up pen and paper and take notes and write reflections."

The writing itself is gently humorous and absorbing, but there was only a very lose narrative flow. I kept waiting for him to get to the competition itself, but it only showed up in snippets here and there. Which is perfectly right, as it wasn't the basis or purpose of his book.

I also found that, like many pop-science books, more time was spent illustrating each point than was necessary. This makes the book drag after a while. I was disappointed not to be able to read more of the actual transcripts of the Turing test that resulted in the Most Human Human award. Generally, i think the book could have been more focused.

Throughout the book Brian Christian describes his preparation for the 2009 Turing Test and his quest to prove his humanity.
