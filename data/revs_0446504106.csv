0,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2308090-jennifer,3,"I had to read this non-fiction book quite slowly, over the course of a month, annoying friends and colleagues by citing Iyengar's studies as they attempted to choose items off a menu, though even this slow pace wasn't long enough to really make the information stick in my brain.Iyengar presents a rather overwhelming amount of information on her enormous and fascinating topic, mostly in the form of psychology experiments about how people choose things and make decisions both trivial and life or death...these experiments on far-flung subjects are glued together by her own analysis, antecdotes, and musings. So much material was presented on so many aspects of choice that I felt its significance continually slipping from my grasp. Because of the sheer scope of the topic, and the sometimes contradictory conclusions that the studies showed, it was tricky as a non-psychologist to synthesize the material into a coherent outline. In a few instances does the book have a take-home message that was easy enough to hang on to and those bits were the most interesting to me (especially in the discussion of situations where one is presented with so many choices, for example in health care plans or retirement investments, that one gives up or procrastinates and decides not to choose at all, thereby making the worst possible choice) Taken to its logical conclusion, ""the art of choosing"" starts with the selection of strawberry jam over rasperry, but expands to cover the whole act of making life decisions (or not making decisions) and inevitably lands on the eternal question of when and whether to assign life's twists and turns to chance, fate, or choice. In this way it felt like a timely book to read when every street corner in my town is plastered with Credit Suisse adverts proclaiming ""Erfolg ist die Summe richtige Entscheidungen"" (Success is the summation of a series of correct decisions). Iyengar points out in her own way that this is sometimes the case and sometimes not. Sometimes, for example, it can even be far better to have someone else make choices for you (chapter on doctors making difficult medical decisions and effect on guilt-grief).The ending dips its toe into a big pool of philosophical questions...maybe she had no choice but to go there, but I find these big questions are more elegantly dealt with in fiction or straight up philosophy.Living in a time where a huge number of choices present themselves, and a country where everyone likes to be or at least consult with an expert on every choice, and feeling occasionally overwhelmed by this, I appreciated the following sentence from the book ""To begin with, we have to change our attitudes toward choice, recognizing that it is not an unconditional good. We must respect the constraints on our cognitive abilities and resources that prevent us from fully exploring complex choices, and stop blaming ourselves for not finding the very best option every time."" There is alot of worthwhile information in the book, and I highly recommend reading it despite the 3-star rating. Iyengar is a sympathetic, funny, and insightful writer and thinker. It's just that it may make your head spin a little...and bring about unwanted bouts of commentary at resteraunts."
1,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6303222-prashant,5,"Here are a few lines from the wiki profile of the author 
Sheena Iyengar was born in Toronto, Canada in 1969. Her parents had emigrated there from Delhi, India............................When Iyengar was three years old, she was diagnosed with a rare form of retinitis pigmentosa, an inherited disease of retinal degeneration. By 6th grade, Iyengar had lost the ability to read, and by 11th grade, she had lost her sight entirely and could only perceive light. Iyengar’s life had also taken another turn in high school; when she was 13, her father died of a heart attack.
I found the above fact very intriguing and it played a part in making me finally picking up the book. The thing that I remember most from the book is a passage where she has written about a general person's personality traits and behaviors. While reading this passage I got the feel as if it has been written exclusively for me and as if she is talking about my very own personality. A little spooky, huh?This will be an extremely eventful ride for everyone especially those who have not already read any of the behavioral gurus like Gladwell, Ariely or Tim Harford. "
2,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata,3,"3.5 stars Pretty interesting. I liked the three major areas the author concentrated on: a) culture plays a part in how we see choice in our daily lives, b) too much choice isn't good, c) sometimes we actually would prefer is someone else made a choice where the stakes are really high.I did learn a few things from this book, though a few were self-explanatory. And though Sheena Iyengar did open with a discussion of how choice is perceived throughout different cultures, she did not go into any great detail about how gender, class, economic status and race might also play into how choice is perceived and made. This is probably for the best, as there was already a copious amount of information in this book."
3,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish,5,"By the time I finished this book I found I wanted to start it all over again. Sometimes I think I may have missed my calling, by not pursuing the field of decision-making. I am so bad at it, and yet I recognize that it is the key to navigating the modern world in the West, where the simplest decisions are rendered ridiculously complex by the plethora of choice. Iyengar covers the waterfront with her examination of choice, from birth to death, and addresses many of the major life choices most of us face in the course of our lives. She recognizes the difficulties each of us face in choosing colleges, spouses, jobs, houses, and discusses the irrationality many of us bring to our own choices. Several times I felt my heart beating a little faster when she began to describe a difficult choice that was facing me now, or one that I had made in the past, but which has left me unhappy.Iyengar suggests that decision-making can be improved by setting constraints on our options, and sticking with them. She describes conversations with artists and jazz musicians in which they claim great invention can be achieved when one sets limits on type of creation one seeks to achieve, and operating within a framework. It is too easy to flail about in a sea of options, but if we set limits for ourselves, we narrow our range, and can be satisfied and happy with choices we have made. As art is created by using objects at hand, so good, even great decisions that make us happy can be achieved within our own limited circumstances. After all, isn't it all really about being as happy and satisfied as possible, rather than miserable in the midst of plenty?A good and thoughtful book that moves me forward with hope. The audio was beautifully read by Orlagh Cassidy. "
4,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1337800-mary,3,"Okay, so I'm probably starting out with a spoiler, but Sheela Iyengar is the person who conducted the jam study--that jam study! In books about choice, this is like being Keith Richards. For those of you unfamiliar, the jam study took place in a super-market: 20 kinds of jams on display to taste, people were less likely to buy a jam than 7 kinds of display. The magic number is 7 + or - 2, not coincidentally like how many items we can keep in our short-term memory. Iyengar, unlike some other authors in this genre, is a big fan of choice, but points out that we need to manage the ways (and places) that we make choices. Sometimes people are much happier with choice and control (older people in a rest home choosing a plan and then choosing to take care of it live longer), and sometimes people struggle with choice (parents having to decide whether to continue life support for their babies suffer depression under the pressure). Not as well-written, I think, as Paradox, but still a page-turner. If you so choose!"
5,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt,4,"Interesting little book that really makes its readers think about what they choose, whether it's their purchases, their friends or even the simple act of saying yes or no."
6,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1489276-andrew,3,"This book discusses some research (by the author and others) about how we make choices, and how having too many choices can lead to difficult decision making. But it's interesting that the author chooses to ignore all the existing research that contradicts the point she is trying to make.Take for example her ""jam study"", where people offered 6 varieties of jam samples were much more likely to buy jam in a store than those offered 24 different samples. The author is well aware that other researchers have replicated this study and found no effect. There was even a recent paper published with a meta-analysis of about 50 similar studies. They found many instances where having more options to choose from made decision making easier. But, they also found many studies with the complete opposite conclusion, and in a good number of studies there was no effect at all. The average effect over all of the studies was nearly zero. It seems to me that the interesting research question would therefore be about what conditions led to the different results of these studies (why are more options better in certain cases, while fewer options are better in others). Even if the author disagrees with those contradictory results, they should have at least been mentioned. Instead, the author specifically states on page 190, without any footnotes or references to research, that other similar studies consistently come up with the same results as the jam study. This is not true.Another thing that bothers me about this book and this type of research is the tendency of some people to interpret these results as an argument in favor of government restriction of choices. The claim is that people will be happier if they have fewer choices, thus the government should either limit our choices directly or redistribute income so that eventually less is produced and we have fewer available options. The author doesn't explicitly advocate this interpretation, though, so I shouldn't blame her for the idiocy of others.Though I disagreed with some of the conclusions, this was still a thought-provoking book, and I would recommend it to others."
7,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6196186-max,4,"Outstanding and prolific, amazing book by an awesome author""We do the same thing in our lives- embracing information that supports what we already prefer or vindicates choices we made. After all, it feels better to justify our opinions rather than challenge them""-my pick of the quotes from the bookThe Introduction is warm and amiable, you get to picture a little bit of the writer's life and character, events in her past which then shaped her life and including the project of this book, when you read how she believed that everything was written to the point she was helpless and thought she couldn't have a choice or make a change, it all link with the post chapters..I loved the stories about the survivors and how people underestimate their abilities to endure pressure and struggle, also the big impact religions and faiths have on their followers including positive and negative effects.One ""unique"" thing about the book, is the journey of its writer around the world, like India, Spain, Germany, and Japan, I liked the tea and sugar story- that was hilarious.Best thing overall about this book is its psychological and philosophical studies which teach you one thing or two about how people think and interpret others actions or impressions, I learned that its not just about me being awake in a crowd of sheep, I've learned that others also have deep thoughts and complex ideas and choices that vary..Why 4 stars? because both the book and its writer have influenced me in so many ways, touching stories and being an eye-opener for a lot of stuff that happens around us, I learned about what they call ""reactance"" in psychology and also our ""right to choose"".I'm not going to spoil it, I'll leave you to read the book for yourself."
8,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/582565-hubert,5,"Effectively written: takes the issue of choice from various perspectives, cultural, psychological, evolutionary, and business. The beginning and the final chapters were the best; the book really takes off after she describes her Menlo Park jam experiment. In general the coolest parts of the book involved her description and distillation of important psychological experiments which involve the subject of choice.One aspect of choice she may consider more deeply is how our morality affects decision-making. She alludes to cases where people must make difficult ""better of two evils"" choices but she does not account for choosers' internal thought processes in these cases.In general Iyengar packs in many thinking points over which to ponder."
9,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5451893-wouter,4,"I came across this book by accident so it wasn't a choice by adding it on my toread list. The more I read, the more it reminded me of a book I read last year; ""Willpower"" by mr. Baumeister, and I liked that book a lot. The Art of Choosing is a pleasant read full of stories and weird psychological/social experiments done in very different domains and it keeps on entertaining that way. The only downside I can think of is that it's not a ver practical book; don't expect to learn the ""3 rules of thumb to make any choice in life easier"". You will however gain a (little bit of) insight on how choosing works and why we feel good or bad after the choosing process. The sheer scope of the book does make it very difficult to gain an overview on what you've actually read. After finishing it and taking some notes during my read, I now can safely say that I don't have any clue on what to remember except that it was a very good book... "
10,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,3,"I really liked the first 1/3rd of this book and then the rest of it just devolved into the same old behavioral econ stuff that every single other book just rehashes. I am so tired of it. Then when I read the acknowledgements, it totally made sense. Seems her main inspiration for writing a book was a conversation with Malcolm Gladwell. It's too bad because I wanted to hear more about Iyengar's own very fascinating life and experience. Instead, it was the book Gladwell would have written about choice. "
11,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2485992-charlotte,5," I absolutely loved this book. The author goes to great lengths to clarify why we make the choices we make. She looks at how we are raised helps influence how we approach decisions, how other influence us in the moment of making a choice, how we really feel about the choices we make and how even when you abstain from making a choice you are still making a choice. I really enjoyed reading this as it was able to be both personal and informative. i hope this doesn't end up getting lumped in with ""The Secret"" or ""Positive Thinking"" or some other self help schlock. she is looking much deeper than the same make-good-choices mantra constantly being recycled. She speaks more of humanity and how that is always being balanced by instinct. Basically, she doesn't treat you like an idiot and isn't trying to sell you something. She is an academic and wants to present some interesting findings. There is at least one scientific study to go along with each layer of analysis. most of the studies are with prestigious companies, schools or other institutions. I am a total sucker for scientific validity, so this helped me swallow some of her more abrasive theories.  If you are looking for some solid non fiction, give this one a whirl."
12,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10745200-chhun,4,"What I really learn about Sheena is that she taught me about her excitement and optimism in choosing. She didn't choose blindness, and being blind took many options off the table, but her bodily condition that she didn't choose let her to make the most of what she could choose.Whether or not, we have to choose because we are the master of our choice; otherwise, we'll find ourselves trapped as a slave of choosing. Remember we have the power to go from where are today to where we want to be tomorrow by choice, not by him, not her or them but by ourselves. We are the architects of our future. "
13,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/653338-trish,2,"p265: It is tempting to promote choice as the great equalizer--after all, that's what so many dreams, including the American one, are built on. ... We should not, however, take this to mean that faith, hope, and rhetoric alone are sufficient. Like the swimming rats in Richter's experiment, we can survive for only so long without solid ground beneath our feet; if the choices aren't real, sooner or later we will go under. "
14,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44398025-robyn-morgan,4,"""Choice draws power from its promise of almost infinite possibility, but what is possible is also what is unknown. We can use choice to shape our lives, but we still face great uncertainty."" And sometimes, in some very special circumstances, it's better not to have any choices at all. "

16,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3823335-drani,3,"As the author detailed her social experiments on choice, I kept thinking how fun it would be to do those experiments. Being a social scientist sounds like fun! There's no but -- I still wish I could spend my day thinking of ways to see how people think.I first heard of Sheena Iyengar when I saw her TED talk. She writes very much as she speaks -- very simply, personally, and engagingly. I was initially a little put off by her personal anecdotes, thinking that they didn't address her issues so much as make her a more sympathetic narrator. But given that a lot of the experiments in the book are scientists watching the behavior of everyone from little kids to shoppers, it's good to see a little into a scientist's personal life.I liked how she blended in pop culture, history, mythology, and web phenomena to fill out a picture of our world. In our current environment, where we're in thrall to ubiquitous advertising, it's helpful to have someone explaining how the tricks are done. As a developer of a web product, it made me think about how best to engage our audience. "
17,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s,3,Didn't like it quite as much as many of the reviewers on this site. Found the experminets with the rats (and I don't like rats) and the dogs (my uber dog lover Katherine would find these very disturbing) cruel to say the least. Also much of the book seemed to be what one could figure out using common sense. Did learn and few things and some parts of this book were more interesting than others.

20,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9241468-david,4,"I seldom write a long critique on a book because i) I choose the book because it is my decision ii) whatever I write should not alter other people POV iii) to back up with ii), hopefully providing a more neutral ground for other readers to decide to buy, to borrow, to read or just to read the review...Decisions, decisions, decisions..many decisions to be made in the modern days..author is, new to me, since I have not exposed too much to the reading field of decision making. Author is very well known in the research field on ""choosing"" which is very interesting to me as my interests is focus on consumer behavior...which choosing is the foundations towards service marketing, advertising, consumptions, reckless consumptions, environmental wastes, etc...to refer to the Chinese translation I picked up, I am going to pick out on specific pages because these are the interesting aspects. To move forward a bit, this book was good to read at first, but then, the focus of the book got dispersed, and started to be less interesting and it seems that author has used a lot of research backings at the first half of the book, then it became the personal opinion on her moral standings about decision making which is ok, but not perfect. In the Chinese translation version: i) Page 35: Author points out that it is important that people feel they must have a decision choice to control, it does not matter whether they have the actual power to control..again..as long as they ""FEEL"" they have the power. (advertisers, HMO, etc later mentioned they have use this technique to undermine consumers and the public)ii) page 76: explaining American athletes are often describing their successes as personal journey rather than as a group back, supports to the betterment. Author did not go into the details of the culture aspects..American family often use the low language which relate to their overall culture and upbringings..(You are on your own), and the language is very direct (low)..and no grey area. Rather, a Japanese family and the culture are high language based which grey area are often used..American (individualism) vs Japanese (collectivism). iii) page 82: Author mentions Erich Fromm's Escape from Freedom: has two aspects: Freedom from and Freedom to. To me: freedom is much more than explaining this in absolute literal term. Freedom is when one has the rights ""not to"", ""refrain from"" doing what he/she wants to. (Self Control). Everyone wants to do what he/she wants is not freedom..because some want to kill, some want to hurt, some want to protect..the prior and often use expression do not cover every aspects nor cover the exact meaning of freedom. iv) page 85: explaining why the eastern bloc patients would rather have fewer doctors to choose because too many choices may not be good. And everyone has the same doctor will provide the ""feeling"" that equality is implemented. And it explains to some that less is more and decision without deciding may be better in life v) page 89 greatly reflects what author believes that America is a land of free..and she points out that ""only"" if you work hard and pursuit for your dream..but the best line Brad Pitt on ""Killing Them Softly"" movie: Jefferson was great because he created a best quote: All Men are created Equal. and Brad further cited that Jefferson is nothing more than a slave owner and at the end of the day, he would do the nasty with his slaves because he is rich..and in America, freedom has a price tag, you work hard, you get paid and that is all as realistic as it gets. America ain't free at all. vi) author points out that ""everyone wants"" to be different. Page 110 mentions ""better than average effect""..actually everyone is the same. To me: I have a better expression: what you think has already became the history of what other think. vii) self intimacy is described on page 112. viii) page 122 mentions the importance of ""importance of job"" vs ""importance of family time""..ix) page 125 almost mentions the theory of Similarity..(Similar people love to get together with similar people with the same interests or opposite interests may be?)..x) the THEME of this book: Logic vs Emotional decision. We are driven by emotional first, then logic kicks in later. The emotional drive is the automatic system embedded within ourselves. xi) great mentioning of we often think we are in a comfortable position and often we do not do anything about it..pg 148 xii) pg150. Shiller Case Index xiii) great mentioning of Confirmation Biases (pg 151) on interviews. Companies are too centric to look for someone who are already in their minds. xiv) mere exposure effect explaining when we are exposed to something that we feel neutral at the beginning, soon, we will becoming more in love with. pg177. And this is exactly what advertisers are using: to control the choices, then show the choices. xv) author further elaborates on pg195: our thinking system has 2 modes: Logic/thinking and subconscious/automatic.xvi) Priming: Instigating thoughts pg198 xvii) pg200-203: on election. whatever gets the vote ballot number 1: gets more vote. and yes, if looks can kill xviii) p. 232: Multiple/various choices often make us choosing the ""best choices""..because it has gotten one too many. But it is important to provide many choices, so at least people CAN make at least/some best choices. xix) pg243-244: sometimes more different selections/less volume can provide consumers a comfortable choosing feel. and at times, fewer selections at the beginning can provide easing environment first and easier to choose when more items are added on. xx) Red Button Syndrome: the things that are more restricted tend to create the most curiosity. Reactance as called it. But reactance can draw backfire..eg: high tax on cigarettes will create black market and crime. xxi) Akrasia is mentioned as lack of self control and finally Camus's The Myth of Sisphus's theme is enjoy your ride even though it sucks and provide discomfort. But you still do it..xxii) Author provides a general guideline for choosing: a) reduce the volume b) built self confidence/self efficacy c) categorize d) self adjust."
21,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29806153-high-plains-library-district,5,"This book is an interesting look into how we make choices. Iyengar has studied decision-making in a wide variety of contexts. There are a variety of fascinating studies she notes during the book, showing interesting factors that affect our decision-making. She is most famous for her jam experiments, showing how we react to an overload of choices. In this experiment, she found that people might be more likely to sample jams if there are lots of options, we are more likely to buy them if there are closer to five options. She also looks at the way culture, expertise, and the magnitude of decisions affect us.If you are looking for a book on how to make choices, this isn't it. Far from a self-help book, this book is great for those that like reading about science, economics, or behavior, without the dull tone. However, you might still find ways to apply it to your life, whether it is in your own choice-making, or jam sales."
22,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18638623-nilesh-injulkar,4,"A lot of studies have been mentioned in the book, there are lot of interesting psychological experiments referenced to support the point the author is trying to make. That way this book is really nice collection, summary of studies and experiments about choice and various aspects of it. Practically speaking, though, it has a lot of information about complex topic like choice. Many observations of experiments even contradict with others adding more complexity to the already complex topic.If you expect this book, like many self help books, to provide you 3 4 rules, with examples to support those, which when applied will make you a better chooser, then you will stand disappointed.Many experiments and perspectives about choice are really interesting though. Being Indian, I found comparison of Indian and American culture in terms of how it impacts our choosing and how we feel about choosing very interesting.The impact of having more choices, less choices or a lot of choices on how we feel was also interesting. Connection between how much choice did we really had while making a decision with our happiness, and fulfillment was mind blowing.Overall, a nice book with different perspectives, well, only if any of the information sticks your mind.“Choice is an enormously powerful force, an essential determinant of how we live.”"

Though, some notes I extracted I finished it in 10 hours only, it is a kind of causal read, no deeper instances, though some subtle philosophies has been tried to be presented.

29,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1746354-josh,1,"I'm not so crazy about this book. I feel its reach exceeds its grasp. First I thought it was the pop-science genre in general, but when I picked up Brian Christian's Most Human Human I couldn't put it down. In comparison  The Art of Choosing is sluggish, and sometimes a little out of left field.For example, in a study she did with a grad student, they tracked ""hundreds of graduating college seniors"" describing their ideal job over a six to nine month period that it took the subjects to find work: ""each time, we asked them to rank the same 13 attributes of a job, including ""high income,"" ""opportunity for advancement,"" ""job security,"" ""opportunity for creativity,"" and ""freedom to make decisions,"" from most to least important."" (This appears on page 99-100, c03, end of section iv.)She doesn't say what it is she was expecting to find, but she does talk about cognitive dissonance and how perceptions of self change retroactively as priorities change over time, as in ""It wasn't just that they couldn't remember their original preferences but that they actively reimagined their past."" I'm still on board here, but she concludes with: ""the more successfully they were able to resolve this conflict, by creating a false but consistent story about their values in the life-defining category of ""career,"" the better off they were. [emphasis mine] Those who recalled their past preferences less accurately were happier with the jobs they accepted. These protective illusions prevented them from recognizing their inconsistency, allowing them to choose in accordance with their latest priorities rather than feeling obligated to the ones they had outlined earlier in the process.""So how exactly does happier with a choice of job equal better off? Maybe it's just a poorly chosen phrase but it's awfully judgmental to just say ""better"". So, those who recalled their past preferences more accurately were less satisfied with their job choice and were ultimately worse off? Doesn't follow. Is it better because choice is in the name of the book? What about the people who wouldn't cognitively compromise and kept on their original course despite shifting priorities? Who's to say they're haven't made the better choice, sticking it out and following their dreams? This isn't the only time I get this feeling of being led, either. Maybe I'm too skeptical for it, but this is a logical chasm I can't make myself cross. So I'm stopping at page 100 for awhile."
30,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7881103-roberto-andonie,4,"There were two or three ideas here which by itself made the book worth it for me. One was more an examination of how choice is a modeling act, a defining action for our identity. The author uses the analogy of an sculpture in progress (our identity being the unfinished sculpture and choice is a tool to unearth it beneath all the marble of shoulds and shouldnts). But then, our identity, turns out, is a dynamic process rather than a static sculpture (conditions may change or we may change with time, hopefully as we grow wiser, etc). This presents us with the problem of not only having a plethora of options to choose from (thank you capitalism), there is also many potential selves we could be. This points to the challenge of being ourselves while remaining adaptable, and the conflicts and contradictions we face, and how that can make choosing so hard. The author proposes to strive for consistency at a ""higher level"" such as a moral code, ideals, etc. I found comforting her perspective that choice could be seem as an ""ongoing act of creation"" rather than ""an effort to break down what we dont want to be"". There is a lot of interesting facts, information and history revolving around choice and choosing with the corresponding research and experiments to support her views. The problem for me was that most outstanding ideas came early in the book and then it goes to less interesting, more sterile stuff for large sections. I would've liked to read only some chapters here and there and skip half the book, but didn't know which parts were worthy and which weren't until I read the last chapter.Now, I would recommend to read the last chapter first, which is basically a chapter by chapter in sum, to help you determine if this is what you're looking for, and/or which parts to skip."

There were some very interesting studies presented that give the reader insight into the decision making though process. It also identifies cultural differences effecting decision making. However, I didn't love how the book ended. It felt somewhat abrupt, non-encompassing and didn't clearly translate to me what I can do to improve my decision making process. The author did attempt to do this, but it just didn't hit home for me.My favorite quote from the book:Another way in which greater choice can lead to greater regret is the very fact that it does increase the potential benefits of choosing well, even as it makes the process of choosing more difficult. When the options are few, we can be happy with what we choose since we are confident that it is the best possible choice for us. When the options are practically infinite, though, we believe that the perfect chose for us must be out there somewhere and that it's our responsibility to find it. Choosing can then become a lose-lose situation: If we make a choice quickly without fully exploring the available options, we'll regret potentially missing out on something better; if we do exhaustively consider all the options, we'll expend more effort (which won't necessarily increase the quality of our final choice), and if we discover other good options, we may regret that we can't choose them all. This dilemma can occur for choices from the mundane, like picking a restaurant, to the highly significant, like home to marry or what career to pursue. "

The nursing home studies were interesting (residents given choices, even very unimportant ones, were less likely to die and happier), as were some of the others. In one, Indian arranged marriages were compared with marriages where the partners married for love. After ten years, those in arranged marriages were happier.The main take-home message of the books is that people are very irrational when they make choices. Even those who try hard not to be irrational are still irrational. Having more choices does not bring increased happiness.The author does great in explaining research and how it applies to life, but falls short when she waxes philosophical about global implications of a tiny study. For example, it's hard for me to see how asking someone what they MIGHT do and feel in a situation where they had to make a life-or-death decision about a premature baby shows absolutely what they really would do and how they really would feel."

Salesmen and teachers have always known that presentation matters, but Iyengar reveals just how much and why! In this exceedingly eclectic and very readable book, Iyengar discusses the tension between our automatic and reflective mental systems when making decisions. She explores the heuristics and biases present in cultural differences and the coping skills we use to diffuse cognitive dissonance. Iyengar is most famous for the ""jam experiment"" where shoppers bought significantly more when faced with a choice of 6 or less types of jam than when overwhelmed by dozens of choices. Iyengar's research promises profound impact on more than just 21st century marketing. Information overload and the complexity of our choices often lead to poor choices &/or dissatisfaction with our choices, yet we seek out the excessive input and zealously protect our freedom to choose. Should we? If we do, how do we handle it?"
35,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148911-devika,5,"Simply written, engaging and thought-provoking. Iyengar shows how we have an inherent need to choose, even if we may have the tendency to succumb to 'akrasia' (going against our better judgement). Moreover, there is somewhat of a memory/learning built through not being able to choose, a sense of helplessness that snowballs into the way we deal with subsequent experiences in our life. In addition, how we perceive the individualism vs collectivism debate is a function of our cultural upbringing, and this impacts the way we view everyday situations (for e.g. What we notice in an image may differ depending on which side we favour). Furthermore, we have this interesting need to recreate our perceptions to fit in line with our actions in order to avoid cognitive dissonance (i.e. acting against our own belief systems). In a nutshell, as Blaise Pascal said, ""the heart has its reasons of which reason knows nothing""."

The author uses excellent examples to indicate that lack of rationality, the evidence of framing in creating bias, and the cultural influences that come into play in interpreting and guiding choice. The author also does an excellent job illustrating the very manner in which choice interplays with personal happiness. This piece peels the onion of what choice is not; leaving you with that rare question of what remains and how much does it matter."

I refer to that study a lot in my classes and consulting work.

40,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63897855-michelle,5,"This book falls into my wheelhouse of topics used in various training forums and consulting efforts, but it certainly pertains to my personal life, as well. I knew many of the concepts and case studies referenced in it already, but I still found the reinforcement of them helpful. In addition, there were some additional ways of considering this thing called ""choice"" that I found useful, as noted below.In line with the concept of locus of control often noted in leadership and organizational behavior-related resources, I found the author's words took the concept much beyond its typical characterization: “There’s a suffering that comes when persistence is unrewarded, and then there’s the heartbreak of possible rescue gone unrecognized” (p. 5). While many sources focus on the extremes of complete control over one's destiny versus the other extreme of victim syndrome, this quote caused me to consider that it is possible, and at least as important, to consider the blend of deliberate, proactive forging forward with the complement that that does not ensure others' responses, support, and recognition of such efforts. I also found her later discernment of ""freedom from"" and ""freedom to"" as a reminder to me of the significant ways to bracket the range of choice between protection from harm to the other bracket end of access to options. They are indeed, very different aspects of choice beyond the simplistic locus of control model.Additionally, having the ability, access, and disposition to choose can detrimentally supersede the importance of the actual choices themselves, as well the value of the time and effort taken to explore said choices. And, consciously focusing on the plethora of daily choices in front of us can actually overwhelm us, essentially having the opposite effect of control that the perception of choice in its abstract may suggest.While Western culture and its associated philosophy holds the premise of choice as a birthright and its effects as foregone conclusion, it also by default dismisses other cultures' collectivist mindsets that believe that choice can guarantee decisions, but not results. Western culture in reality may be seen by other cultures as overconfident in comparison to their views that each person is but one voice in a communal choir of change and outcome. Iyengar goes on later in the book to highlight the Greek term ""akrasia, "" which translates to a lack of control over our temptations. This fits nicely with the collectivist (or in political or economic terms, socialist) perspective that relinquishing choice may result in others essentially saving us from ourselves, and that if we consciously seek out the wisdom of crowds and experts to assist us in economizing on, and improving upon, the choices that we make, such relinquishment that we deliberately allow is actually a form of controlled choice in and of itself.I particularly appreciate the discussion of uniqueness versus similarity to others. As the author points out, the answers to the following two questions should be the same, but often are perceived differently: “How similar are you to others?” and “How similar are others to you?”. However, to me, the difference in answers that occurs may be as much attributed to an individual's perception of superiority in addition to any cultural pressures of valuing uniqueness.In line with today's political times of truth-bending, or even truth-fabrication, Iyengar's remarks provide perhaps some kind of intuitive behavioral explanation for this phenomenon (although not what I see as an excuse for it). She notes that in order to avoid cognitive dissonance, we adjust our relaying of motivations and past actions in order to essentially rationalize for ourselves and others a defense of them. (You may also know this behavior through the popular phrase ""changing the narrative"".)Other useful pointers to better head off our own choice bias, as well as those of others, include option ordering phenomenon (where people remember the first and last choices in a list moreso than the middle items), ""priming"" (where our brains file and later connect to information based on sensory and other mind-mapped associations), the 3x3 Rule (essentially applying conjoint analysis to choice, rather than long-listing the options), and the Long Tail and its associated implications for those courting customers in perpetual search for unique items.Lastly, I found personal relevance in the following quote near the end of the book. Having recently been confronted with the statement, ""It was your choice!"" and my associated frustration with the over-simplicity of that declaration, these words more eloquently represented the reply I sloppily gave in the emotional heat of an argument:“At its best, choice is a means by which we can resist the people and the systems that seek to exert control over us. But choice itself can become oppressive when we insist that it is equally available to all... because one can blithely say, ‘Oh, but they had a choice! We all have choices.’ When we begin to use choice as a strategy for evading the problem rather than finding the best solution, we know we’ve gone wrong.” (p. 264)."

45,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1757736-heather,3,"This year I'm doing a project where I read one nonfiction book per month, which is more nonfiction than I normally read. It's been interesting to read some nonfiction books that have been lingering unread on my shelves for ages, and also interesting to explore some types of nonfiction that I don't normally pick up. The Art of Choosing is the kind of pop science book I rarely read, and I'm not sure why. Once I got past the first chapter (which has some things in it about experiments on animals that I found distressing), I enjoyed this book a bunch, and had fun telling my boyfriend about all the psych studies I was learning about. Basically, this book is an exploration of how people make choices, how choice-making sometimes causes us problems, and how we might approach choice-making in ways that might actually increase our happiness. Iyengar partly talks about making the kinds of choices we're used to thinking about as choices—what to have for dinner, career choices, relationship choices—but also talks about the choices we make in the narratives we construct about our lives, the stories we tell ourselves and others, the way we emphasize our own agency, or don't. And she talks about the larger cultural contexts of choice-making—how different cultural backgrounds shape different attitudes towards choice, both in terms of what level of choice-making is deemed appropriate/optimal, and in terms of what people even see as choices. (There's a great part when she talks about having students at the same school, from two different countries/cultures, write down every choice they made the day before. One group of students includes things like brushing their teeth or snoozing/not snoozing the alarm as choices; the other group doesn't list that kind of thing.) I like how Iyengar talks about choice and our sense of self/identity: she talks about how there's a common conception of identity that goes like this: ""Beneath the many layers of shoulds and shouldn'ts that cover us, there lies a constant, single, true self that is just waiting to be discovered"" (75). But is that necessarily true/is it necessarily helpful to frame it like that? Could we not ""acknowledge that our identity itself is malleable but no less authentic for it""(101)? I like how she talks about seeing ""identity as a dynamic process rather than a static object"" and ""finding ourselves in the evolution of choosing, not merely in the results of choice,"" and seeing choice itself as ""an ongoing, liberating act of creation"" (110).Of course, choice is not always great: choosing can be overwhelming, especially when there are a lot of options and we aren't experts/don't necessarily understand all of the differences between them. Iyengar offers some practical advice for dealing with choice overload/decision fatigue: if you're making a lot of choices at once, start with the easy ones and work up to the harder ones; classify options to make choosing easier; consult experts or crowdsource opinions when appropriate. She also talks about cognitive biases that can affect our choices, and how to avoid being blindsided by them. Minor quibbles: when reading about various psych studies, I sometimes found myself thinking about the ""reproducibility crisis"" in psychology—though I realize there are different perspectives on that (1, 2). And when reading about the ways that our choices can be influenced by advertising/priming, I found myself feeling like Iyengar was being too uncritical of consumerism. (Like: she suggests we shouldn't worry too much/""would serve ourselves better by separating the influences that conflict with our values from the influences that are basically harmless"" (175) — but I don't know, I'd rather opt out of consumerism/advertising a bit/I don't think it is basically harmless.) Still: this was an interesting read/maybe I should read more pop science! "
46,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33253383-aishwarya-saxena,3,"Sheena Iyengar is the psychologist responsible for the famous jam experiment. You may have heard about it: At a luxury food store in Menlo Park, researchers set up a table offering samples of jam. Sometimes, there were six different flavours to choose from. At other times, there were 24. (In both cases, traditional flavours like strawberry were left out.) Shoppers were more likely to stop by the table with more flavours. But after the taste test, those who chose from the smaller number were ten times more likely to actually buy jam: 30 percent versus 3 percent. Having too many options, it seems, made it harder to settle on a single selection.“The study hardly seems mine anymore, now that it has received so much attention and been described in so many different ways,” Iyengar, a professor at Columbia Business School, writes in The Art of Choosing. “From the various versions people have heard and passed on,” she adds, “a refrain has emerged: More is less. That is, more choice leads to less satisfaction or fulfilment or happiness.”Now Iyengar is having her own say about the jam experiment and the many other puzzles and paradoxes of choice. More choice is not always better, she suggests, but neither is less. The optimal amount of choice lies somewhere in between infinity and very little, and that optimum depends on context and culture. “In practice, people can cope with larger assortments than research on our basic cognitive limitations might suggest,” Iyengar writes. “After all, visiting the cereal aisle doesn’t usually give shoppers a nervous breakdown.”A congenial writer, Iyengar is less hard-edged and ideological than Barry Schwartz and less glib than Malcolm Gladwell, who she says encouraged her to write this book. The Art of Choosing should appeal to fans of both writers. It’s full of the experimental results that make for good cocktail party chatter, but it offers fewer explicit lessons. Iyengar favours exploration over conclusions. “Isn’t this interesting?” she asks, rather than “Isn’t this awful?” or “Isn’t this useful?”Take a mundane question: Do you choose to brush your teeth in the morning? Or do you just do it? Can a habit or custom be a choice? When Iyengar asked Japanese and American college students in Kyoto to record all the choices they made in a day, the Americans included things like brushing their teeth and hitting the snooze button. The Japanese didn’t consider those actions to be choices. The two groups lived similar lives. But they defined them differently.The daughter of Indian immigrants, Iyengar is drawn to such cross-cultural comparisons. Consider an experiment she conducted with elementary-school children in San Francisco’s Japantown. Half were what Iyengar calls Anglo Ameri­can, and half were the children of Japanese or Chinese immigrants who spoke their parents’ native language at home. “Ms Smith” showed each child six piles of word puzzles and six marking pens. Each pile contained one category of anagram — words about animals, food, San Francisco, etc. — and each marker was a different colour. A third of the children were told to pick whichever category and marker they wanted to play with. Another third were told they should work on a specific category with a specific marker. With the final third, Ms Smith riffled through some papers and pretended to relay instructions from the child’s mother. In the latter two cases, the category and marker were, in fact, the ones picked by the most recent child to select freely. The two ethnic groups reacted differently. The Anglo kids solved the most anagrams and played the longest when they could pick their puzzles and markers, while the Asian children did best when they thought they were following their mothers’ wishes. To the Anglo children, their mothers’ instructions felt like bossy constraints. The Asians, by contrast, defined their identities to a large extent by their relationship with their mothers. Their preferences and their mothers’ wishes, Iyengar writes, “were practically one and the same.” Doing what they thought their mothers wanted was, in effect, their first choice.Anglos and Asians did share one critical reaction: “When the choices were made by Ms Smith, a stranger, both groups of children felt the imposition and reacted negatively.” Just because people happily comply with the choices of an intimate — or, for that matter, an authority they’ve selected themselves — does not mean they want bureaucratic strangers making their decisions. Advocates who want to use psychology experiments to justify choice-limiting public policy should keep that lesson in mind.Iyengar began her scholarly exploration of choice with an undergraduate research project. She suspected that religiously observant people who obey lots of behavioural restrictions would feel unable to control their lives and thus pessimistic. To test this hypothesis, she interviewed more than 600 people from nine different religions, ranging from fundamentalists to liberals. She surveyed their religious beliefs and practices, asked questions to test optimism and had them fill out a mental health questionnaire. What she found surprised her.“Members of more fundamentalist ­­faiths experienced greater hope, were more optimistic when faced with adversity and were less likely to be depressed than their counterparts,” she writes. “Indeed, the people most susceptible to pessimism and depression were the Unitarians, especially those who were atheists. The presence of so many rules didn’t debilitate people; instead, it seemed to empower them. Many of their choices were taken away, and yet they experienced a sense of control over their lives.”In retrospect, the result seems obvious. Even many atheists would agree that believing that God cares about you or that your life is part of a cosmic plan can be a powerful source of hope (or, to put it pejoratively, a crutch). Meaning is as important as choice. Besides, Iyengar conducted her survey in the United States, where people are free to switch religions and often do. If keeping kosher or refraining from alcohol makes you feel constrained and helpless, you can abandon those strictures. The only people left in the restrictive groups are those who value the rules. In a modern, liberal society, religious observance does not “take away” choice. It is a choice.Unlike “provocative” books designed to stir controversy, “The Art of Choosing” is refreshingly thought-provoking. Contemplating Iyengar’s wide-ranging exploration of choice leads to new questions: When is following custom a choice? How costly must a decision be to no longer qualify as a choice? Did Calvinism spur worldly achievement because its doctrine of predestination removed all choice about the hereafter? Do con­temporary Americans adopt food taboos like veganism because they crave limits on an overabundance of choices?Human beings, Iyengar suggests, are born to choose. But human beings are also born to create meaning. Choice and meaning are intertwined. We use choice to define our identities, and our choices are determined by the meanings we give them, from advertising-driven associations to personal relationships and philosophical commitments. Some meanings we can articulate, while others remain beyond words. “Science can assist us in becoming more skilful choosers,” Iyengar cautions, “but at its core, choice remains an art.”"
47,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112553900-raz-pirata,4,"“Choice ranging from the trivial to the life altering, in both its presence and its absence, is an inextricable part of our life stories”The totality of our present is revealed in the outcomes of the choices we have made. But to what extent do we deliberate how to choose? How much thought and practice do we give to choice? Sheena Iyengar's revealing examination, The Art of Choosing, is a thoughtful, considerate and touching look into, and beyond, the how’s and why’s of choice. Through what reads like a seamless blend of personal meditation and academic research, Iyengar pulls choice apart, revealing all of its nuance, shadow and idiosyncrasy, and then put it back together to reveal the world shaping potential of choices.“We can...measure (our lives) by the choices we make, the sum total of which has brought us to wherever and whoever we are today”What makes this book so interesting and valuable to the reader is the questions it asks about the self and world as framed by choice. We all get to choose. Whether by intention or omission, we are always choosing. We are choosing what and what not to do, what to pursue, and what to believe. The Art of Choosing shows us what influences these choices and how we came to choose the way we do. It also offers a way for us to see our choices in a fresh light which may lead us to a profoundly distinct way of choosing. “The power of choice is so great that it becomes not merely a means to an end but something intrinsically valuable and necessary”It is through the choices we make that we show the world how we see ourselves. Our choices tell our story, and each new choice adds a verse into the story of our lives. When you read The Art of Choosing you come to realize the significant role that choice plays in our life, yet how we rarely spend the time to think about the way we choose. Thankfully, we have been gifted this insightful work that will impact not only how we will make choices in the future, but also how we see our past choices and ourselves. This book is not only thought provoking, it is required reading. Overall score: 4.5 / 5.0In a sentence: A beautiful book on something we too often take for granted, our choices."
48,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3930545-prince,5,"Sheena Iyengar's The Art Of Choice is a brilliant revelation that lets you see the world in a new way.This book is a near encyclopedic coverage of the topic of Choice, with its limits going from choosing a shampoo to choosing a life partner. Iyengar is a world renowned expert on Choice, and also the creator of the famous jam experiment that has widely been quoted in several magazines and newspapers over the years (Don't worry, if you don't know the jam experiment, you can read it here in Iyengar's own words).The book hits the ground running by explaining how Choice is one of the most powerful possessions all living beings have. From there it goes on to define what Choice really is, and how it is not as black and white as most people believe, but a product of all your social and cultural values. Iyengar tackles a variety of subjects revealing to us how trends in fashion work, why arranged marriages work (and yes, it makes sense), how people in socialist and capitalist cultures view freedom differently and so on. On a more focused, intimate level, the book tries to show how 'uniquely' similar we all are, making choices that we think allow us to stand just apart from the others, but not too far from the crowd. Seven amazing chapters (the significance of the number seven is explained in the book as well) treat us to some truly eye-opening stuff.This is not however a self-help book, as the title might suggest. A more apt (but less catchy) title would have The Science of Choosing. Iyengar does not give you the 'Five Steps To Choosing Wisely' or the 'Seven Things To Ensure The Best Choice In Any Scenario'. What this book does is to arm you with the understanding of why you end up with the choices before you, why you choose the way you do, why others choose the way they do and what choices are not really choices thereby reducing your overall number of options to choose from. This is also not one of those fluffy pop-science books that has selectively quoted studies, but a near-text book, without the usual dreariness associated with that word.Everyone should read The Art Of Choosing."
49,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21136796-boni-aditya,3,"The research behind the book is very good, but the book itself does not add huge value to an individual as such the entire gist of the book can be put together in less than five pages. All the experiments discussed in this book kind of seem like moral dilemmas rather than logical approach or analytical approach towards decision making. Decisive is a far better book which delivers a structured framework designed to help you make choices with an analytical approach. The book only discusses about the problems of choosing, the author carefully overlooks or avoids taking a stand i.e. the author never says that you need to make this particular choice in this particular context. She never claims that you need to take this approach when you are faced with this kind of problem. The author only discusses all the options i.e. all the choices available, but does not claim that one choice is better than the other. She discusses about the communist approach towards choices, overload of choices, abortion choices and pulling the plug, arranged marriage vs love marriage i.e. taking a choice vs not making a choice! Leaving the choice to others, and so on, many of these cases discussed were derivative examples which have already been discussed time and again in various other books. Marshmallow Experiments, Richard Thaler's Nudges to create defaults to save more etc... I think this book should be condensed a lot and 300 pages are not required to explain such simple concepts. This book can be condensed to 100 pages or less. "
50,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6950166-natalie,3,"It was fascinating how the book describes the benefits and pitfalls of choice. Choice can be very empowering in Western cultures- viewing something as a choice and giving others choices gives them a sense of control. Taking control of one's situation can lead to positive change, versus someone without any control can develop learned helplessness and feel despondent. One study found that American workers do better and are more satisfied the more choice they ""perceived"" to have- framing things as choices can be very positive. On the other hand, choice is not an unconditional good: 4-8 choices are the ideal, and any more is too much. When making a purchase or deciding between too many options, it can be useful to narrow down by category to eliminate a lot of those extra choices. I liked the anecdote that she gave what she thought were beverage ""choices"" to participants (several types of soda), and had to change it after a guy pointed out it was actually the choice between soda or nothing.There was a large array of examples from different industries and popular culture. This was a nice surprise and made it readable, though it felt a bit fake or forced at times. My main issue keeping me from fully recommending was that early on there is a chapter with unapologetic descriptions of psychological studies that caused pain to animals. I almost stopped reading; I hope there is (or will be) a professional recognition that these studies were not the best way to conduct behavioral research. The nonviolent research discussed throughout the rest of the book was much more edifying."
51,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3757971-jaya-nair,5,"I liked the book -- there is a lot of content, reflecting the amount of work the author has put into understanding different perspectives of making choices. Making choices is a difficult task at times, and Sheena Iyengar enlightens the readers about its range of influence in one's life -- from the the triviality of such an activitiy to its profundity -- in the matter of 300 or so pages. Sheena Iyengar is special in herself, maybe there was a bias for me about her disability and the choices that she had to make to reach this point in her career and life, that appealed to me. I heard her TED talk and then bought the book to read. While her talk was quite engaging (she's a good orator), her book was a thought provoking read for me, as it made me ponder about how a lot in life is really about choices one makes. Sheena points out how there's nothing definiteness about making choices, she gives several anecdotes on how some things worked as expected and how she and similar researchers could belabor on how some things worked unexpectedly. I liked her talking about her cultural background to set the context to how some of the questions about choices were posed and, at times, answered for herself."
52,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58019001-roy-wang,3,"For readers familiar with the works of behavioral psychologists like Dan Ariely, Daniel Todd Gilbert, or the Freakonomics series, this book may seem a bit too broad and lacking in focus. As the book's title suggests, the author addresses how we make choices or decisions in a variety of contexts, including marriage, religion, shopping, business, work, friendship, etc. A multitude of related studies are cited to illuminate the fascinating psychological/sociological/cultural forces behind even the most seemingly mundane choices we make or beliefs we hold. I found the parts explaining our human instinct to prefer having choices--even if it's merely a perception--very interesting. However, one of the corollaries of tackling a wide scope of issues is that readers might need to re-read the books to sort out specific action steps that will improve their awareness and decision-making quality."
53,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59696965-oscard,4,"	The Art of Choosing By Sheena Iyengar isn’t exactly a traditional book. There isn’t much of a story or a plot but rather a series of case studies and analysis of their results. As a student who reads plot driven stories constantly, I found this to be a refreshing change as well as quite informative. The case studies are an excellent way to explain as well as provide insight for why humans make certain choices whether a gain is clear or not. As the book goes on it becomes more clear what impacts choices the most but I’d rather not spoil this realization for any prospective readers.		While I thoroughly enjoyed this book I had some problems that kept it from getting five stars. The book is very hard to put down and then pick up again with a full understanding of what was just discussed. The topics of many chapters are quite complicated, especially to a senior in high school, and as a result the worst thing a reader can do is stop in the middle of a chapter. Because time for reading fluctuates it isn’t always easy or possible to read whole chapters in one sitting which can slow down the book quite a bit as a reader essentially has to restart chapters if stopped. Furthermore, the chapters can start off kind of slow which makes them hard to start. 	Despite the few dislikes I had with the book it was still an amazing read and I recommend it to all. "
54,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1074071-sarah-semark,5,"Well-written, engaging, and accessible. If you've read Thinking, Fast and Slow, Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions, or Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness, you'll probably enjoy this book. It manages to present a great deal of information and detail without ever becoming too dry or repetitive, and insperses stories of the studies with personal anecdotes and thought exercises that add human interest to the text. ❤️"
55,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8651322-darien,5,"Fascinating and insightful discussion of how we make choices. ""Choosing helps us create our lives. We make choices and are in turn made by them.""This book took me a very long time to finish, but only because it was so good at stimulating thought, introspection and discussion. I would read a chapter at a time and chew on it, think about how the ideas reflected my ways of thinking, or what I saw in the larger world that illustrated her points. The best part of the book is that is went way beyond experiments and experience, but also gave guideline for making better choices, in our world of plenty.""Science can assist us in becoming more skillful choosers, but at its core, choice remains an art. To gain the most from it, we must embrace uncertainty and contradiction.....We use it without exhausing it, and the more we uncover, the more we find still hidden. We cannot take full measure of it. Therein lies its power, its mystery, and its singular beauty."""
56,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3339748-michelle-farrell,2,"I found the title of this book somewhat misleading. Rather than a discussion on tips/tricks to be better at making decisions, it seemed to add even more gravity to the concept of choice. This is definitely NOT a self-help book (as I had assumed), but rather, a series of psychological studies and discussion thereof. There were certainly some interesting concepts, but all together it left me feeling more confused than ever before about what leads us to make decisions. If anything, it almost gave me too much to think about! So many factors contribute to the decisions we make, but rather than proposing a solution to all of this, the book picks these factors apart and leaves you without direction. That being said, it definitely is an interesting read, just not one that I found myself excited to pick back up each time I returned to it."
57,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10104768-anusha,3,"I have always wondered about too much choice and how that can be confusing sometimes. My first brush with such an experience was shopping in an American supermarket and a shelf with different types of orange juices, which I found quite overwhelming. I think I took about 5 minutes to make a decision and then I wasn't too happy with it either. This is of course was a trivial setting for making a choice, but it did get me thinking about choice in different cultures and what it means to different people. This book talks about such choices in different aspects of our lives. The reason I gave this book 3 stars was that there is a lot of information and I found it difficult to remember much of it afterward. Nevertheless if you are curious about this topic, good place to get started. I might go back to read it again just so that I can re-look at some of the studies."
58,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65581139-ekta-rawat,5,"Wow! The amazingly explained experiments, the way Sheena crafts a story out of her observations and explanations, the variety in her examples (literary, business, religion etc.) and the simplicity with which she conveys even the most profound ideas makes this book beautiful. It has obviously left me many ideas to think about and also enabled me to connect different examples from other books that I have read. From the first chapter where she talks about choice and the perception of choice to the discussion on impact of culture on choices and the associated happiness, the concept of freedom to and freedom from, link between cognitive dissonance and the choices we make, the famous jam experiment, the Sophie's choice and a lot more in subsequent chapters... This book was a superb read for me. Some day, for sure, I am going to pick this one again."
59,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56374666-aryn,5,"I was dragging my feet to start reading this because the material seemed dense and the cover wasn't exactly enticing. More so, I was worried that since a few years had passed the information inside could have been rendered irrelevant by new studies. I was so wrong and am very glad I ultimately did open it up! I cannot believe this book is not assigned or discussed more in college courses focused on human and consumer behavior. Though it seems a bit scattered at times, Iyengar does an exceptional job at discreetly weaving together anecdotes and studies to prove her point. I feel as though I've come away with practical advice regarding making decisions even if that was not the original intention. "
60,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58588536-chandrama-deshmukh,3,"Not a big fan of self help books and let me confess I wouldn't have touched this book if not for the book club read.Personally, didn't enjoy it much. Overdose of experimental data and surveys for my liking. And honestly, it didn't make much of a difference to the way I make my choices. It's interesting in bits - anecdotes (I dig out stories from absolutely anything and like to mull over them), some cool trivia and the crazy ways in which human mind works. P.S. Do not disregard this book based on my review. It's not my preferred genre. Give it a try. One never knows, you might stumble upon what you seek."
61,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9347976-steve,1,"DNF. Read the prologue and couldn't make it through the first chapter. What I did read reminded me of a quote I like: ""Our perception and attitude toward any situation will determine the outcome."" And I believe that's what the author is trying to get at - that is the choice everyone has. But I lost patience with the supporting stories. The stranded mariner story was fine. But I didn't care for the psychology studies of the early 1960s. Having rats struggle for 60 hours and drown? Placing dogs in boxes with electrified floors? I couldn't continue reading. Mind drifted off into thoughts about inhumane treatment of animals, ethics, and the time period it occurred in."
62,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60549529-rob-thistleton,3,"I listened as an audio book, so experience is likely different than reading.More of a book on the psychology of choosing than the art of. As such it was ineresting, descriptions of research experiments was main theme of book. Insights into cultural influence of choice and its effect was good. Quite interesting but at times tending to ramble, making point difficult to ascertain at times. Overall the book was fairly boring. Not an easy read, it did leave me asking why did I persist with the read. I guess books are like life and at times and can be a slog, but my choice would be not to read this a second time. With some regret at doing it once."
63,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90535565-leila-ismayilova,3,"If you want to read this book I would simply recommend to listen to to the NPR's Hidden Brain podcast (episode ""The choices before us""). Sheena Iyengar was a guest of that episode and as a regular Hidden Brain listener I can say that it's one of the best episodes they've ever made. Impressed by Sheena I decided to read the book she had written and was talking about. However, there's nothing new in the book that wasn't mentioned in the podcast. I kept reading hoping to discover something new. The book provides interesting insights on the history of choice and how one's national and social background affect it ,but that is all it covers. "
64,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28127759-ashley-pigott,5,"I really enjoyed this book. It covers a wide variety of topics from medical dilemmas to corporate branding, but ties everything together well by frequently referencing previous chapters. The book does good job of presenting the information in an accessible way, and balances out research and case studies with open ended questions for the reader to consider. The author has experience studying choice in a research setting and it’s clear that she is passionate about her work. This seems like it would be a great book to pick up again in the future because I know for sure there are plenty of details I missed the first time around."
65,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10226212-esther,4,"Very relevant and applicable discussion on the choices we make in life, how to act intentionally, and how to not let the inevitability of choice-making overwhelm us. As a prior psych student, I really appreciated the research references, but moreso, I appreciated Iyengar drawing the connection to real-life choice making. This book is sectioned into different contributors to choice (ie. cultural upbringing), so I'd say each chapter could very well be standalone if the book itself is too much for you. I do find relevance "
66,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2992347-jazmin,4,"Great book for anyone who is interested in the complexities of decision-making. As a clinician, some of the research mentioned was familiar to me, and some of it has found its way into popular knowledge. Iyengar does a great job of breaking down these studies via different perspectives, and making them relatable and relevant to everyday choice, and the more significant choices in our lives. Definitely recommend this book for anyone interested in psychology/social science and/or marketing/creation of products.Worth noting the cultural aspects of this book, were my favorite parts. "
67,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18816175-elsbeth-kwant,3,"Quite interesting - nice review of the theory of choice, illustrated by beautiful vignettes. An impressive reminder that being blind need not discourage you from writing about colour, or any other subject that might interest you. In that sense, a brave and reflective book. About choice, I mostly learned is that you can have too much of a good thing (and yes, it was Iyengar who did the jam-study), that you should and can delegate important choices to have a better life and that we 'all believe ourselve to be alone in a crowd of sheep'. "
68,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67606891-pavig,4,"A very thought provoking book, it starts off with how different cultures across the world look at and approach choices and then moves on to talk a great deal about the choices you make as an individual and the emotional toll it takes on you, a wonderful statement that I was able to resonate ""We pay emotional and mental tax for our freedom of choice"", how true! I loved the way she approached this topic by also emphasizing how crucial knowledge can be when making those choices. Overall great book, great examples and definitely worth reading."
69,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23153588-ashish,4,"A very good read around choice. If you are interested in knowing how people make choices, this book will give an insight into that.I came to this book with the hope that it will provide a universal framework on how to make choices, and the book provides that in a subtle way. The different studies and experiments that have been mentioned in the book provide a good perspective on how choice operates in the real world and its effects on people executing it. "
70,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21213734-alex,2,"Don't take my rating as a blanket judgement - if this is your introduction to the psychology behind the choices we make, this is a nice start.But if you've been interested in business-related psychology for the past 5-10 years, you without doubt will have already come across the information in this book on multiple occasions. It is written well and provides many example experiments, but could easily be condensed down considerably.  "

72,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54187521-bek-graham,4,"A systematic approach to the decision-making process. The material in this book provides the reader the knowledge to process information and decide based on logic rather irrational thoughts. The content of this book takes a theoretical approach to access everyday decisions. The book provides the reader with a clear understanding of thinking patterns and our behavior responses. At times it was repetitive, but it is an interesting read. "
73,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60227135-zeynep-en,4,"We all know that our choices govern our lives. But to what extent do we have control over our choices? How does the process of choosing work? Are we really the ones choosing or are we swayed by outside influences? If so, then to what degree? Some of these questions might sound a bit conspiracy theory like but you'd be surprised and maybe even a little creeped out by some of the answers the answers. Regardless, I'd heartily encourage anyone to choose to read this book."
74,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41938388-kimberly-dulle,3,"The author is correct in saying that there's been ""an explosion of choice"" in our lives. Everything from what to wear to who to vote for to medical and end of life choices for ourselves or loved ones. I found the book interesting but very heavy on studies. (I skimmed a little). Her suggestions to train ourselves to be aware of when our choices are being influenced and to limit our choices were helpful but the book is really more of a study in choice rather than a self help."
75,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47108910-madhura,4,"Books like this one can get too academic too fast. But Sheena Iyengar avoids that pit successfully and gets her point across very effectively. It was a relatively quick read, too. Iyengar lists pitfalls and benefits of too many and too little options, all at the same time. I loved how she went on to convince me of all the invisible influences on my decision making process. Are my choices really my choices or just a by product of who I am?"
76,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51902538-josh-berkey,4,"A thought provoking book about choice. Is freedom to choose always best? Is personal choice, rather than communal choice, best for society? Why do Americans always think having more options to choose from is the best? Or are more choices actually debilitating? The author explores these questions and much more. This book feels similar to a lot of the popular behavioral psychology books out there today, think Malcolm Gladwell, or Daniel Kahneman’ “Thinking Fast and Slow.” "

I didn't particularly like the language though, which I found patronising in tone. I'm surprised this was shortlisted on the FT book of the year as it isn't one of their typical business focused books (being more focused on psychology) but the presentation of the book which shifts from animals to people to enterprise is interesting enough to merit a second read."
78,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41471389-deepa-krishnan,4,"I liked this book. The start was not as compelling as the middle ages and the end. My son picked this up in order to not be an indecisive person and thought this book would have pointers on how not to be one. But this book is about what drives our choices and the psyche of choosing and recommends some ways for breaking out of the guilt when you think you made the wrong choice. Overall, I liked this book. Very interesting perspective and I hope I meet this author some day. "
79,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68503589-shiela-rozich,3,"Good for a psychological self-help book - thought about terminating only two times during the reading. The reader’s voice and style is better suited for fiction.The writer uses “I, me” less than most other self-help books and attempts to keep the science in mind, referencing various experiments in psychological research. She brings up many tantalizing issues though the direction she leans and the conclusions she suggests are questionable."
80,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101686430-nikolai-laba,2,An interesting look into what influences choices and the impact of those on peoples lives. The books starts pretty strong with some insightful experiments and data however I felt that the back end of the book tapered off in effectiveness. The last two chapters were too winding and said too little and failed to carry the momentum forward from the first couple chapters.The afterword was a great succinct look at the book and will serve as a great refresher in the future.
81,0446504106,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5515631-leah,3,"Chapter 2, and to a lesser extent the last chapter, felt like that was the book Sheena wanted to write, but had to add the fluff that is the other chapters. The other chapters aren't bad, but they're very shallow/basic psychology. If you've ever read other pop psychology books you'll recognize about 2/3 of the studies she mentions and probably know most of the content anyways.Chapter 2 was great, I wish she could have expanded more on it.

Our decisions are influenced by external factors far beyond mere rationality. It reminded me of the Robert Cialdini books Influence and Pre-suasion, only less easy to digest.

Indeed, it might do more to stifle and limit us than give us more freedom, all the while make us depressed and unhappy with the choices we ultimately make. If you're interested in how to make better decisions with the minor and major things in life, you could do worse than to look for help in this book."
