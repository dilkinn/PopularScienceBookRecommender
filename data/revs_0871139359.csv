0,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61284794-akash,4,"A very compelling and in-depth narration about the climate crisis that we are currently facing. Even though it is quite outdated (He wrote this in 2004) and anyone reading it today, who follows climate science closely, would possess much greater knowledge on the topic. A ton of discoveries and revelations have been made since then. Nevertheless, it does provide a wealth of information that is rooted at the very beginning of the climate crisis and the basics will always be the same.The book is a descriptive encyclopedia of sorts, and Tim goes to great lengths to talk about the minutest creatures who will be affected by climate change. Whoever knew that the Stratosphere was so fragile, and that even a few degrees of change could literally call the shots on the sexes of a certain species of turtles and alligators? Who knew that ocean currents mix up the water from 5 miles below with the water above, infusing them with oxygen so that nutrients which shallow dwelling species depend on, come up to the surface? Who knew that less winter rain could sound the death knell for a certain species of toads? Moth eggs hatch up to 3 weeks earlier than their food is ready; butterfly ranges have extended from the original habitat by 150 miles; the tree line is moving higher and higher each year; CO2 loving fast-growing tree species are dominating slow-growth species, and subsequently killing off the insects and birds that depend on them; crabs and other crustaceans are unable to make their carbonate shells due to acidifying oceans; and many much more.Tim further elucidates in detail how the developed world knew all along, about the ramifications of global warming from as early as 1985, but kept playing for time, in order to further their own agendas and selfishly develop their own economies; all while playing a hogwash game of ""carbon credits"" (which does absolutely NOTHING to tackle the climate crisis). Lastly, he talks about how the insurance industry will be the first to implode, the first domino to fall, after which the real true color, the ugly side of our fabricated, unsustainable system, starts to reveal itself, as one after another, the rest of the dominoes fall."
1,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4157851-dhitri,4,"This book should be considered a climate change ""classic"": it excellently elaborate the science behind the climate-regulating functions of the Earth's atmosphere, the delicate balance of it and how human's thirst for growth is threatening to destroy that balance, with catastrophic consequences. The book covers many facets of the issue, from the science to the politics, which makes it a one stop shop for all things climate change. Flannery's writing is beautiful and lucid: it is infused with a romanticism for all things nature similarly to what one would find in the works of eighteenth century botanists and biologists (he quotes a lot of Wallace). His prose has a literary quality to it, particularly as he ascribed the atmosphere as ""The Great Aerial Ocean"" and the ""life blood of Earth"". All this makes for a great page turner, unexpected for a book packed with so much scientific details. Considering that this has been published in 2005, it is pretty ahead in voicing the concerns later adopted by the likes of the IPCC report in 2007 and the Stern review. All that delivered in bits and chunks that are digestible to the average reader. Some of the details are outright fascinating: the many layers of the atmosphere, the kinetic quality of its interaction with all living being on earth and the delicate balance at which its climate-regulating functions hinges. Flannery also managed to deconstruct the cliches surrounding climate change and has brilliantly explained the sources of uncertainty in climate modeling. Having said that, it does have some clear pitfalls. Its ambitious scope makes it difficult for Flannery to cover the aspects outside his strength as a scientist, such as the economics and politics of it, in great depth. In fact, towards the end of the book I felt there was a lot of redundancy regarding his take on the global politics of emission reduction efforts and particularly his ideas of a post-Kyoto Protocol deal. The alarmist tone to the last few chapters can also be off-putting. Flannery himself conceded to the uncertainty of the science, yet he is trapped into heralding various catastrophic projections of 2050 as the world's certain future. The book really dragged towards the end because of the author repeatedly stopped in his tracks to remind readers that time is running out and that action needs to be taken. Even a believer like me does not respond too well on too much climate crusading. Finally, a minor but annoying bit has to be the finality with which he starts his last few chapters, which really makes it feel like the book was never going to end. Chapters titled with ""Last Steps on the Stairway to Heaven"", ""The Last Act of God"", ""Time's Up"" made it seem like I had arrived at the end of the book, yet when upon finishing them, I was dismayed to find that there were more chapters to go through (what, another chapter?). But, still, this book comes recommended to anyone who wants to get a better grasp at the issue. Even in the current flood of information on climate change, any reader would find the book highly insightful as well as enjoyable. "
2,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1044330-james,3,"Heatwaves, hurricanes, flooding, drought, extinction. No-one can accuse Tim Flannery of understating the effects of global warming. And there's no doubting his passion for the subject. Once sceptical about climate change, he's now a fully-paid up member of the global warming warning brigade. His chapter headings alone - ""Peril at the Poles"", ""The Carbon Dictatorship"", ""Boiling the Abyss"" - signal that he's nailed his colours to the mast. And those colours are all green.Not so long ago, climate change was confined to the inner reaches of scientific journals. Now it’s front page news. Hardly a day passes without another instance of wild weather being blamed on global warming. Flannery believes the changes we’ve seen in weather patterns, seasons, biodiversity and, above all, rising global temperatures have a single, man-made cause. Fossil-fuelled industrial development is the villain of the piece - from coal-fired power stations to the infernal combustion engine. So busy have we been in pillaging the Earth‘s resources that it’s only when the planet started fighting back that we woke up to the terrible consequences.Of course, he’s aware that not all agree with this argument, and so he sets out to support it with an avalanche of evidence. At times, the reader risks being engulfed by statistics, and some of the scientific vocabulary requires both a deep breath and a running jump. Even so, Flannery’s genuine concern for all forms of life on the planet shines through.But he has to tread carefully. Scary talk about runaway warming, may lead his readers to conclude that it's too late to do anything. Or, as Irving Berlin didn't write: there may be trouble ahead, but let's face the music and turn up the heating. Flannery insists the problem is still soluble, but tackling it will take action by every government, every business and every gas-guzzling, trash-tipping, pollution-pumping one of us.After braving 200 pages of bleak prognostications, it’s a relief to reach an environmental success story. Flannery calls the 1987 Montreal Protocol the world’s first victory over a global pollution problem, and without it life on Earth would have been in deep trouble. A hole in the planet’s ozone layer risked exposing us to dangerous ultra-violet rays from the sun. The Montreal agreement banned the fluorocarbons that were eating away at this layer, and there are now hopeful signs that the hole is healing.Despite this good news, Flannery insists prevention is always better than cure, a view that’s reinforced when turning his fire on the energy sector. Just as the tobacco industry spent many decades in denial about the link between smoking and lung cancer, he says, energy companies have been similarly sluggish in facing up to the impact of fossil fuels on the environment. But while he’s scathing about the automobile, Flannery appears resigned to the increasing volume of air traffic and believes aircraft will continue to spew carbon into the atmosphere long after other forms of transport have gone green.At one point in this book, Flannery speculates that researchers investigating the impact of climate change on mountain regions may have given up because it was all too depressing. It's an odd observation, but if true, who could blame them? Global warming may be a hot topic, but talk of imminent catastrophe is enough to send anyone running for the prozac. Yet, far from being alarmist or defeatist, Flannery is a convincing advocate of the need for urgent action. Perhaps, if enough of us heed his warning, a Tim Flannery of the future might be able to write a book telling the story of how we saved the planet. "
3,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7213075-ted,4,"Humanity is at (or has already passed) an historical crossroads. By the end of the 21st century (possibly by the middle of it) enormous changes in the earth's climate and ecosystems will have precipitated equally momentous changes in human society, our economic systems, and in civilization itself.My personal list of writers who have made significant contributions to the scientific, environmental and societal aspects of what we are heading for include people such as Lester R. Brown, Bill McKibben, Richard Heinberg, Fred Pearce, Elizabeth Kolbert, and John Michael Greer.Of course the Australian Tim Flannery is also on this list. Like Bill McKibben, Flannery's writings span a wide range of subjects. His Wiki article describes him as a mammalogist, palaeontologist, environmentalist and global warming activist, and notes that he was named the 2007 Australian of the Year.The Weather Makers is one of Flannery's most influential books, and although the story of climate change is moving fast, the book (at seven years of age) is probably still worth reading. There is a great breadth of material covered, from descriptions of the earth's atmosphere and ecosystems, to the physical/chemical mechanics of greenhouse gases, climate modelling, and the sorts of outcomes that can be imagined. The index is pretty good, and the notes to each of the 35 chapters should allow an interested reader to track down up-to-date data and research on most of the topics.In fact, as I've been looking at it in writing this review, it occurs to me that perhaps I should reread parts of it!"
4,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1871390-mike,3,"Although the last thing most people need is another 'downer' book about how the climate is spiraling out of control towards disaster, this book manages to deliver more science than opinion and actually offers some reasonable tips on how we can still make a difference if we take the right steps."
5,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/334225-steve,4,"This book is excellent and terrifying. Tim Flannery is a working Australian scientist (mammologist & paleontologist) -- not a journalist -- who lays out the history and science of climate change, likely scenarios for the future, the politics of climate change (both good and bad), and at the very end, provides a manifesto for ways to reduce our carbon output individually. The species he studies have been deeply impacted by climate changes to date, which means that global warming is not just something he decided to write a book about, but has been interested in for years, and that depth of interest is evident in the depth of evidence in the book.When I think of climate change, I think of many things but most of them are in the past 10 years: the hurricane season of 2005, the '8 of the 10 warmest years of the millennium are in the past decade,' ice shelf breakups in the polar regions, and so on. Flannery cites evidence that we've been seeing impacts for 'much' longer (in human terms), ranging from the drying of the Sahel starting in the 1960's, the extinction of frogs and other amphibians in the 1980's -- and the scary part is that human greenhouse gas emissions have risen dramatically since those impacts started.So as not to make the book a complete downer, Flannery finishes with both a hopeful note -- the story of the Montreal Protocol to ban CFCs (which caused the 'ozone hole') and how that seemed so hopeless in the early 1980's but actually came about and is now having a positive impact -- and an action list for individuals to reduce their carbon impact. I think I am less hopeful than he as regards our ability to pull off such a large-scale change in our behavior, but it's an important aspect of the book to make it not all doom-and-gloom.Alas, this book is best written for people who believe (at some level) that humans are responsible for climate change. If you think that climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the liberal media and a scientist's conspiracy, well, this book is full of scientific citations. Of course, I don't think anything will convince the denialists until their house goes underwater for good."
6,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1085095-guy,4,"If, like most people, you have been drifting along, vaguely aware that there might be something called global warming and that it might have some not so good consequences, but you haven't really taken the time to work out how serious it is and whether or not it is something that you could or should do something about... then do yourself, the rest of us, and the animals and plants with which we share the world a favor and read this book. It is short, easy to understand, based on personal experience and solid research, and is guaranteed to shock you out of your slumbering complacency (if you are one of those aforementioned drifters).""The Weather Makers"" isn't perfect, but it is effective, and that, for most potential readers, is more important. Once aware, awake, and concerned, then you can find other books that marshal the scientific evidence more carefully and comprehensively (if you still have questions about how bad global warming could become and what catastrophic effects it will have), or which give you a wider set of recommendations as to what you can do personally or what needs to be done collectively (if you are ready to take action), but you need to wake up to the danger first. So read this book and if it works for you then recommend it further to several friends (who should recommend it further to various of their friends... and so on). There may be better reasons to start a chain-letter than waking up to the risks of global warming, but if so, I don't know what they might be.Note: this review is for the 2005 edition which has apparently been reissued and updated extensively in 2010. I'll post a review for the updated version once I've read it. There's also a young adult edition of this book that was published in 2010. "
7,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2601228-nicolas-levy,4,"As someone who studies climate policy in grad school, I found The Weather Makers to be by far the most comprehensive book I've read on climate change. In a brisk 300 pages, Tim Flannery spans the ecology of climate change and its devastating effects on biodiversity, its geological context (and how this is different than previous ages), the atmospheric models that inform our understanding of its impacts, the history of international climate negotiations, and the pros and cons of alternatives to fossil fuels. This impressive scope has both positive and negative aspects. On the one hand, I can't think of a better single book for someone to quickly get up to speed on climate change: Flannery truly tells a story with each chapter of the book, and manages to combine engaging writing with in-depth detail in many sections. On the other hand, such a broad range in a short 300 pages is bound to not cover all subjects in equal depth. While Flannery provides a lot of rich detail on how climate change is affecting both terrestrial and marine life (he is an ecologist by training) in the first 100-150 pages, his sections on energy technologies and policy are fairly thin. For example, he introduces and summarily dismisses carbon capture and storage as one option to reduce emissions in all of 2 pages; regardless of your opinion on the technology, it surely merits a closer look. However, this book can at least provide some overall ""big picture"" context to help situate where more specific news articles or books fit.Overall, this was a very informative book, and fun to read. Highly recommended for anyone who wishes to learn more about climate change and the imperative to act now."
8,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1697033-cassie-addison,4,"Excellent book about the hows, whys, and what-ifs of climate change. Some of the data is a little outdated at this point, but it still provides a solid argument with great supporting evidence. The science in this book is accessible to a wide variety of readers, including both those new to the concept of climate change, and those who are well versed in the topic. "
9,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23889502-mrsculpepper,3,scary and important reading
10,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14152527-myee-gregory,5,Wow. Terrifyingly still relevant. A call to action that any policy maker and influencer should read. 
11,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/318324-kurt,5,"For some time before I read this book I had been interested in the science behind global warming. I listened with amazement to experts and pseudo-experts of all kinds offer their expertise on the subject to the public. I absorbed, but rarely participated in, the frequent debates that came my way at work, social gatherings, and on talk radio and TV. During this time I tried to keep an open mind on the subject - realizing that humans possibly could have an effect on the global climate, but wanting to be convinced, one way or the other, before actually taking a stand on the subject.A few things that struck me during this time of observation and casual investigation were 1) Those who adamantly deny the possibility of man having any effect on global climate were uneducated about it or primarily ideologically driven, 2) The vast majority of the skeptics (those who have scientific expertise on the subject and insist that the data is inconclusive and that we need more time to analyze the data) are almost invariably funded or supported by industries who have much to lose in the short term if public opinion fails them, and 3) the nearly voiceless community of climate scientists overwhelmingly concurs on the major aspects of the theory.Realizing that there must be something to this theory, I finally decided to become more educated about it. I researched many books and authors, and eventually I decided that The Weather Makers by Tim Flannery would be a very good starting point. I must say that I was not disappointed. A large amount of the book deals with how climate change is affecting various species of plants and animals worldwide. Personally, I found this very informative and appropriate since we have long known that all organisms on this biosphere are inter-related. When significant problems occur to numerous species humans are eventually going to suffer some consequence.The author explains the science behind this subject very well; I believe most readers will comprehend it. Of course, more detail could have been provided, but, as it is, a good balance is achieved.Overall, the book left me in a mild state of gloom. Knowing the prevalence of ignorance in the world, and the forces at work to keep people that way by spreading lies, deceit, and uncertainty made me feel that our unsustainable civilization as we know it is doomed to gradually spiral downward. We all owe it to ourselves and future generations to educate ourselves on this subject."
12,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/315416-peter,4,"A lucid overview, though it definitely zooms around a lot, in time, space and in its considerations of the different facets of the climate change problem. Two specific comments: Was interesting to see how much Flannery quotes Alfred Russel Wallace, of The Malay Archipelago The land of the orang-utan and the bird of paradise a narrative of travel with studies of man and nature. I've never read later Wallace, understanding that his later works devolve into weird late-Victorian spiritualism. But Flannery rescues his writing on the atmosphere, on ""the Great Aerial Ocean"", and recommends his last great work Man's Place In The Universe, ""full of insights that resonate with an environmentally aware twenty-first century"". So it's on my too-read list.Flannery concludes his book with a call to action. And it's a reasonably effective call-to-action too. Inspired by that, let me ask this question to all my Singapore friends. Given how much sunshine we get, why is that solar water heaters are so little used in Singapore? I've asked architects and contractors this question, and they say, oh, no, too expensive, no good, etc. And I haven't pushed. But really, what's the deal? In so many other places around the world they are very common. Athens, Chengdu, etc. "
13,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"I don't normally put much stock in blurbs, but the cover of Tim Flannery's The Weather Makers (2006) that I read has a blurb from Bill Bryson. In this case, it is a surprisingly reliable indicator. Though not as cheerful (hardly surprising given the content) as Bryson's Short History of Nearly Everything, there is something of Bryson's approach here. Flannery tackles the science in a clear, engaging, and methodical manner. There's a summary of Gaia theory, an overview of geological epochs and eras, a look at different species that are threatened by (or that have already gone extinct thanks to) climate change. Readers will learn about climate models, ice sheets, greenhouse gases, the carbon cycle, sulphur dioxide and a whole bunch more. It's interesting to to read about the proposals Flannery considers here. The only thing I would have thought to find but didn't is a consideration of a vegetarian diet. I'm not sure this is the most memorable climate change book I've read, but if someone were to ask me for just one book on this subject to read to get a sense of climate science, I'd probably recommend this one.*Update from 2019: there is a follow up to Weather Makers, entitled Atmosphere of Hope. I'd recommend reading the two books together since they're both so short and engaging, but the follow up speaks to more recent science, technology, and policy."
14,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93024894-rebecca,4,"“It is among those nations that claim to be the most civilised, those that profess to be guided by a knowledge of the laws of nature, those that most glory in the advance of science, that we find the greatest apathy, the greatest recklessness, in continually rendering impure this all-important necessity of life.” Alfred Russel Wallace, Mans Place in the Universe, 1903“If humans pursue a business-as-usual course for the first half on this century, I believe the collapse of civilisation due to climate change becomes inevitable.” Tim Flannery It is petrifying to me that this remarkable book was written over 15 years ago now. It is such a dire warning of the future to come, the future that has already arrived, that I am enraged anew at the total lack of action taken to try and halt the steady march of annihilation. This is a brilliantly accessible and compulsively readable book, packed with science and concrete examples of the disastrous impacts we are having on the planet, as well as providing a fascinating section about climate change over the Earths history. This really is an urgent, desperate call to arms, a rallying cry to international policy-makers, the general public, governments and industries. And yet, in the time since this book was published the situation has become even more critical. The science is so clear, and has been clear for decades and decades now. When Tim Flannery wrote this book, he was banking on the idea that we still had time to halt and reverse the deadly impacts of our fossil fuel addiction. That time has passed. He writes about a group of research scientists at the Hadley Centre who found that ""by 2050 human influence on the planet will have surpassed all natural influences...therefore we will have no more climatic ‘acts of God’, only human-made climate disasters....we are looking at deadly heat waves, extreme droughts, starvation, threatened health due to an increase in diseases, extreme rainfall and flooding, changes in wave patterns and frequent storms, shrinking, sinking continents"" ....and still governments allowed the greenhouse gases to accumulate in the atmosphere. Flannery adopts the Gaian view of our planet which basically just says that everything on earth is intimately connected to everything else, like organs in the body. In such a system, pollutants cannot simply be shunted out of sight and forgotten, and every extinction is seen as an act of self mutilation. He argues that this Gaian world view predisposes its adherents to sustainable ways of living, but that our modern world had fatally attached itself to the reductionist world view which sees human actions in isolation. With the complex science of feedback loops, magic gates, telekinetic atmosphere - we know that this interconnected view of the world is right. Severe damage to one part of the ecosystem in one part of the world, can in turn, affect a whole other ecosystem on the other side of the world. Our actions have consequences that will be impossible to reverse. It is astounding to me that countries still insist on extracting fossil fuels and pumping CO2 into the atmosphere. As we all know, the major danger of CO2 is just how long-lived it is - staying in the atmosphere for 200 years or so, which means we are already committed to a vast amount of climate change, even if we halted carbon emission completely from today. Shockingly, the rate of increase in carbon emissions since 1800 is at least 10 times faster than anything detected for the past 300 million years. There is no known precedent. The IPCC stated a year ago that if we don't reduce our CO2 emissions by 50% before 2030, we are looking at the possibility of cascading tipping points that takes us to hothouse Earth; a point in time where there is no need for human beings to keep warming the planet—it’ll do it itself.Are we on track to half our emissions? Absolutely not. In fact, many governments are now trying to push that date back to 2050. And Flannery dedicates a whole section to the IPCC, which of course is vitally important as the one respected paper on climate change that has the power to alter environmental policies. But he also notes its major drawbacks; which is just how watered down the science is. It goes through a long involved process of being vetted by scientists and every country in the world (including those with a vested interest to carry on extracting oil) that the figures stated in it are absurdly cautious, if not outright lies. As Wallace-Wells said in his fantastic book, the Uninhabitable Earth: ""It is worse, much worse than you think.""Flannery outlines the impacts that were already being seen when he wrote this book - enormous bleaching of the coral reefs, the extinction of hundreds of species of animals, the increase in world temperatures, the increased frequency of extreme weather events, susceptibility to droughts...and we can see the impacts now. Major weather events are now the norm. And pandemics....Flannery levels extreme criticism at the two worst offenders in emission - The US and Australia. What is so utterly ridiculous about these two countries is that they stand to lose so much from the changing climate. In terms of extreme weather events the US already has the most varied weather of any county on earth with more intense tornados, flash floods, thunderstorms, hurricanes, blizzards...with a massive increase in these events, they stand to lose so much more money than they would lose now by investing in a greener future. Australia too suffers a lot, some areas around Alice Springs had already heated by more than 3 degrees, and were experiencing more intense cyclones, floods etc, not to mention the destruction of their greatest attraction - The Great Barrier Reef. For two nations so severely disadvantaged by the effects it is nonsensical that they pursue the path they are on and continue to put fat profits over the fate and health of their people. We live in a world now where only the obscenely wealthy cosseted few will survive the future climate collapse by retreating to some refuge (e.g Peter Thiel in his New Zealand hole, billionaires in bunkers in South Dakota, Musk and Branson hiding out on Mars) but the vast majority will perish. Those in power continue on a route of the murder and genocide of the poorest populations - and now, the entire world.I highly recommend this book for a detailed history of climate change which is brilliantly comprehensible even for those who baulk at science and graphs, and want to be spurred on to take action against those in power who are committed to the extinction of all living things on this planet. "
15,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2104569-sheila,4,"Thought provoking, easy to read book with a compelling history of the climate changes around the globe. This book was more comprehensive than I thought it would be. I am not a scientist. Before reading this book I kind of understood the terms “greenhouse effect”, “global warming”, etc. After reading this book I feel like I truly understand these terms and so much more about our climate and all the factors that influence it.Flannery notes what is being done now and by whom – which countries are making changes to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and which ones are making the problem worse. He presents excellent suggestions for slowing global warming and the advantages/benefits to everyone (countries, people, animals, etc).Global warming is having profound effects around the world. "
16,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1714947-emily,3,"Covers an astonishing breadth of scientific information, mostly fairly well explained for the layman without being condescending. I felt it was somewhat scattered in its presentation and occasionally crossed the line into sensationalism. Would have liked a more thorough section on what actions individuals can take (besides writing our elected representatives) - it seemed like the book set us up for all these horrible things that can happen because of climate change, but all the things that need to be done have to be done on a global level, so all we can do is hope that our nation's leaders get their acts together in time.For more book reviews, visit my blog, Build Enough Bookshelves."
17,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,3,"Inconvenient truth in expanded detail is an apt description for this book. The book format can include a lot more information than a movie so if you want to know more about global warming than what is in Al Gore's movie, this is a good place to start. The author is from Australia so that country gets more coverage than one would otherwise expect. Nevertheless, the subject of global warming is well covered. The book was first published in 2001 and updated in 2006 so it may becoming a bit dated in a quickly expanding subject area."
18,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28771246-samuel-polacek,4,"A great layman summary of the evidence that is suggestive of global climate change, with an even more cursory argument for why we can still be optimistic if we act now.I found tidbits very interesting - there was evidence presented I had not heard about before. But most of it was not quite in depth enough for my taste. A perfect introduction for someone who knows nothing about global warming, and a cursory understanding (if any) of the physical sciences."
19,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3901371-rob,4,A good general introduction to climate change. Even though it is now a few years old it still holds up well. Flannery writes succinctly and well about a difficult scientific subject.His section on the sheer impossibility on carbon sequestration for instance is a joy to read. Not a word wasted and the coal industry fantasy is shot down in flames.
20,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2845897-jeff,4,"I write this from the sink-hole of the COVID-19 pandemic sweeping the U.S. and the world. I began to feel a little guilty, when quarantine opened up new vistas on reading, about the global warming books I'd let sit unread on my shelf. After all, about an hour into the 2006 Al Gore film, An Inconvenient Truth Gore describes ""vectors for infectious diseases"" that ""niche"" in habitat shifts brought on by climate change. He's alluding to a chart displaying bats and mosquitoes; he could be describing the Chinese wet markets, where it's said that bats hosted the virus that via zoonosis infect us. There's nothing special about this stuff, then, but Flannery's view is comprehensive. He's a mammalogist who looks at stuff like the ""jokers"" that are nestled into the deck of, say, the collapse of the Gulf Stream, when particular kinds of drought build into biotic range ""magic gates"" that open space for infestations by mammal populations. Flannery quotes Steven LeBlanc, a Harvard archaeologist, who writes: ""As famine, disease, and weather-related disasters strike . . . many countries' needs will exceed their carrying capacity. This will create a sense of desperation . . . ."" (191) I think many of us feel this presently. Flannery listens to many different kinds of climate scientists, so while this book is 15 years old, its comprehensive view affords a sense of the complexity of the issue, that does not give way to the politics of personal destruction, so popular in our country (the U.S.) at the moment. Climate science reaches across many disciplines, and terrains of culture in our critically effected societies. One must be on guard against vested interest, particularly in the oil and gas industries, but in coal, and in renewables, as well. This does a nice job of explaining to fields that are vastly remote how they might view the critical issues of climate, water, wind, agriculture and geology. Perhaps this kind of undertaking needs to be done every five years."

I recently read “On Thin Ice” that compared the plight of the Polar Bear to Global Warming. The book peaked my interest and I wanted more information. I started reading “The Weather Makers” and found more and better information regarding Global Warming.Although the book claims to be for the common man, those of us who are not statisticians and only can understand clear and precise explanations, it was unfortunately above my head. The book, taking away the stats, is full of weather conditions that can be easily understood.Flannery does an excellent job of bringing Global Warming to the forefront and gives indisputable proof that it is a real and serious problem we must face.Although some of the parts of the book can be disputed, there are some things that were predicted that did not happen. Now whether we were lucky, or we did things to change our lives still remains unresolved. The truth of the matter is, he still brings forth even arguments about Global Warming that most laymen will find that it is here and that we best do something quick, maybe not for our generation but the generations to come.A good book that is a must for those who are concerned about Global Warming and those skeptics that still believe it is not happening.

22,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51461035-fernleaf,4,"It's crazy to me to think that this book was published and everything in it was a known, back when I graduated from high school and was a clueless teen. It's sobering to read this comprehensive and well-written book and know that things haven't changed that much despite nearly 15 years having passed. Although a tad behind-the-times as it were this book still does a good job of laying out the history of climate change and how we understood it in 2005, it's causes, history, and implications. It's with some relief that a few of the predictions for the 2010-2020 period have not come to pass, including the unlikely worst-case-scenario of the collapse of the north atlantic currant. At the same time engineering solutions like the shift of the transportation fleet to carbon-free have not happened either. Although I haven't kept as close track on climate issues in the past couple of years, we seem to be on a mostly business-as-usual course, which makes for a certain amount of depressing reading. "
23,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119706530-mikayla-imrie,4,"A very detailed analysis of the impact of climate change on every aspect of the earth and human civilisation. A depressing book at the best of times, especially knowing it was written in 2005 and that majority of what he enforces needs to be done has not and we are still a world largely fuelled by coal. Very interesting when comparing this 15 year old book which was largely written in the infancy of climate change to now, climate change has its platforms with a lot bigger of an audience now however still lacks those in high places to do their part. I wish it delved deeper into what we could do individually rather than a quick snippet at the end. However I truly learnt energy uses and sources and the impacts scientifically to the globe. May be a bit hard to read for those not all over climate change however they will still get a good base understanding on its catastrophic impact. Would love to read a follow up to this book in 2020 to read Tim Flannery’s take on the action on climate change."
24,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17229516-kieran,4,"Climate change may the the greatest threat to humanity but it is generally an incredibly boring and very depressing subject. This may be partly why human society has failed to seriously respond to it. Tim Flannery is a great science writer and he has succeeded more than most to make the subject interesting, mixing personal anecdotes, history and research reporting. One of the most interesting parts for me is that being over 10 years old, his optimism about the UK's government's response and the promises of the Kyoto Protocol seem very naive in retrospect. As more modelled predictions come true it is sobering that many of Flannery's suggestions from a decade ago continue to be ignored and actively opposed. It is still not a perfect book: it is a bit long, and those not determined to understand climate change will really struggle to finish this, as I did several times. Although that may be because the subject is inherently boring. Nevertheless, recommended."

Are there any political program goals, which could be voted today, and have immediate impact on this planet? Or we're doomed? Or there just aren't on the book?""I'm not an ecologist. Do you think an ecologist is willing to violently hold someone down to sterilize them? What ecologists do isn't effective: overcome by technology. I am effective.My idea for conservatism is a bit more extended: it comes down to 'can it actually change the world?' or just makes you feel good. You know: all these words that mean nothing.

26,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1215302-nancy,4,"There is something intensely frightening about reading a book about climate change which was written in 2006. That was 14 years ago - 14 years in which it seems we have done very little to change the trajectory of the planet which Tim Flannery was warning about back then. He wrote at the time of the Kyoto agreement, which I was horrified to learn of Australia's abysmal behaviour towards it. Since then we've had Paris and this year, before covid-19 hit, we were due to have Glasgow.Have we made changes? Have we moved forward? I have my serious doubts. I think there have been some steps but not nearly enough. Some of the predictions he had made for 2010 had come to pass. Some of them hadn't (what had happened to air-compression cars?). But overall, reading this and realising that we really haven't moved forward and in many cases have gone backward, was very sobering."
27,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15657404-brandon-pytel,4,"Pretty solid intro to climate change guide. The book was broken down into five parts: Gaia's tools, essentially explaining how the world interacts in millions of working parts; one in ten thousand, getting into the specifics of the effects of global warming; the science of prediction, essentially applying science to determining how long the earth can withstand the rate of increase of CO2; people in greenhouses, society's and politic's attempt (or lack thereof) to combat climate change; and the solution, pretty much gives us several dystopian-like options v. actually doing something about this impending threat. At times, the reading was dull and for the better part of the book, I had to take notes in a separate notebook to follow along and retain what I felt was most important; but for the most part, for someone who is not well-read in science, Flannery does a good job at balancing generalizations and being specific when he needs to.If you're looking for a general intro to climate change, backed by a fair amount of accessible science and interwoven with political and economic policy, both in the past and in the future, this is definitely a great place to start. And for an Australian, he does spend a good amount of time drawing similarities between the major nations, and approaches the issue primarily from an international perspective. "
28,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22042167-deepa-pujari,3,"This is the my first read about climate change. The book actually depressed me a lot because I was feeling that the world is going to end in my lifetime, which unfortunately may be true. The book is more like a report about all the factors which lead to global warming and may wipe out life untimely. I did feel it had too many details and was has a lot of chemistry which a commoner might find difficult to grasp. I also thought that a little more emphasis should have been given on what every individual or masses should be doing to keep our ecosystem balanced. Overall a very good awareness book which should not be taken lightly."

In 2020 this book is now 15 years old and many of the topics and technologies mentioned are worth reviewing in comparison to these predictions. This book provides a sound grounding of issues facing the environment in a variety of contexts and is easily accessible to those with no scientific background. I look forward to reading more recent accounts of how we, and the world have reacted 15 years on. Highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to understand more about the history and complexities of the climate within the Anthropocene."

The golden toad chapter requires tissues and should open eyes for those empathic and sensitive enough to make the connection. I like the suggestions for improving at an individual, local, and global level, even if some of the predictions/speculation are a bit off in the interpretation of the data or beg the question. Some of the either/or fallacies seem to leave the argument and solution a bit wanting. Overall, well worth the time and effort to read and apply to one's life. "
31,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1455428-eric,3,"It is informative and depressing to compare the predictions and warnings of this book to the world we're currently in (13 years later). Some of the optimistic goals have not been endeavored, while some of the dire concerns have been turned to stasis or reversed. Overall, however, we as a society have done a piss poor job addressing climate change, and are currently sliding backwards. A few ideas are clearly outdated, at no fault to the author; it is simply the problem of writing timely reports and the passage of time."

Probably going to try to come back frequently to The Weather Makers for certain parts, though."
33,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8084928-jim,4,"It's scary reading this book about 15 years after it was written. Sentences that start with ""By 2018 scientists predict..."" are eerie.

57,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52365545-katenz,5,"This is an excellent introduction to many different and often interrelated aspects of climate change science. It covers everything from changes wrought by natural planetary cycles and solar activity and geological histories of climate change, through to its principal theme: man-made change in the form of the different greenhouse gas emissions. (It also takes a brief foray into the CFC emission history, by way of a great illustration of the success - including the surprising economic benefits - of international regulation). The book is very accessible to non-scientists, which was a relief to yours truly - the book cover rightly claims that Tim Flannery has a knack for making complex ideas easy to understand. It's all the more powerful for not being histrionic or polemical in tone as well. Flannery simply presents the facts with multiple different examples, including acknowledging where we have (often considerable) gaps in knowledge. It's balanced and reasoned, but nonetheless he comes to a clear and compelling conclusion (based on a wide range of different - and irrefutable - evidence) that the planet as we know it and human civilisation are stuffed unless we act really quickly. Along the way, Flannery dismantles many of the arguments of the climate change sceptics, and quietly exposes where those arguments have been fostered and financed by industries that benefit from the status quo. He accepts that there is a cost to change - often put forward as a major reason for doing nothing or delaying - but invites us to also consider both the cost of not changing (an obvious point) but also the opportunities for different industries that arise from being forced to innovate (he gives an example of BP having become a major producer of photovoltaic cells). Refreshingly, he acknowledges the potentially huge intellectual value of scepticism, including on the part of those who question received norms about climate change - without scepticism, as he says, science would never advance. But he rightly takes issue with ""scepticism"" that is nothing more than deceit, propaganda or wilful ignorance.  We may not become extinct - his prediction is that if we don't act soon, we will enter a new 'dark ages' era for a very long time (cities, for instance, will be unsustainable). But the extinction of many other species on the planet is already happening and will only accelerate, even if we were to immediately lower our emissions to a sustainable level, due to the length of time that greenhouse gases, particularly CO2, persist in the environment. Flannery is a biologist, and a lot of the book is taken up with a portrayal of the devastating effect that changing weather patterns have on biodiversity - it's heartbreaking. Originally published in 2005 shortly after the Kyoto Protocol was agreed, the book is now a climate change classic. It documents the George W Bush administration's attitude to climate science - particularly interesting in the light of the current US administration's approach (which now seems like an even less forgivable and pathetic echo of the self-serving, industry-driven policies of the early 2000s). Flannery is even harsher though on his own nation of Australia, and again there's little evidence of serious change over there since the book was written. The same can be said of my own country, though - we have been lulled into complacency by the fact we have such a high proportion of sustainable energy, and we've failed to pay attention to everything else we could be doing to make a difference. More than a decade on, some of the contemporary predictions have proved a little exaggerated, but mostly they can be seen unfolding in front of us - the slow drowning of our Pacific coral atoll nations, increasing intensity of storms in certain areas of the world, desertification in other areas, bleaching of coral reefs, the melting of the Arctic and the starvation of Nanuk (polar bears), the collapse or thinning of the Antarctic ice shelves. Now, of course, we have the Paris Accord and it remains to be seen whether it will have the desired effect. Flannery concludes the book, though, with a challenge to all of us not to wait for governments or industries, but to reduce our own emissions, and by making smart choices, to change the consumer market in favour of sustainable options."
58,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63986322-michel-sizaire,1,"A lot of talk about observations, didn't see much about experiments to support those observations. To me, this comes across as a politician giving me allot of hot air with no substance.I observe the sun rise in the east and set in the west, that must mean is revolves around the earth. *shakes head* "
59,0871139359,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43533-jeanne,4,"Flannery wrote The Weather Makers to address three main issues. He wanted to give an overview of the history of climate change, illustrate how it will continue to change over the next century and discuss what we can do to affect those changes. In this well-developed and accessible book, Flannery lays out his claim and issues a challenge to his readers.Divided into five main sections, Flannery uses short chapters to advance the reader’s understanding of climate change. While the language is not “dumbed down,” his writing builds upon ideas in previous chapters to support his thesis. He begins with an Earth Science lesson, defining his terms, explaining how the climate operates, how greenhouse gases enter and leave the atmosphere, and situates climate change in light of historical evidence – the biggest differences between past and present being the rate of change and the fact that people have affected the environment.Once the reader has a grasp of how Earth and its climate function, Flannery gives examples of how the changing climate impacts plant and animal populations. Entire ecosystems are shown to be imperiled: sea ice is breaking up, coral reefs are in jeopardy, changes in rainfall distribution threaten rainforests and deserts alike. Not only is the natural world affected. Our own ecosystems, the cities and town in which we live, are at risk as drought, flooding and other extreme weather events, such as Hurricane Katrina, put stress on our environment.The historical changes and current observations give way to a discussion of how we can understand future changes through computer modeling. The results of models, even conservative estimates, forecast a grim future for some inhabitants of Planet Earth. Flannery repeats that some change is, at this point, inevitable due to how long certain gases stay in the atmosphere. For this reason he insists that changes must be made immediately to minimize the impact and stabilize our environment.Next, Flannery analyzes reactions to climate change. He looks at political, business and special interest influences on what we have done and can do. He does not shy away from the difficulties in instituting the appropriate actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but he balances it against the costs of doing nothing. He also suggests that once we commit to change, we have the technology, creativity and ability to do more than we think we can.The last section of the book moves away from corporate actions and brings responsibility firmly into the hands of the people. Whether it is a flexing of our political or consumer muscle, Flannery calls for individuals to exercise their rights. He leaves us with a challenge to reduce our own impact on climate change and gives us concrete examples of how we can do just that."
