This book is not about Dr. Kandel's life or scientific contributions, but the reason I dare to open with this information is because the author, Jonah Leher worked in the laboratory with Dr. Kandel and Dr. Si during this pivotal time, reason enough for me to submerge into this book without hesitation and I can pleasantly say that it surpassed my expectations. Proust was a Neuroscientist is a book about artists, writers, musicians and painters, that anticipated many discoveries of our brain functioning through their work. This juxtaposition of art and science has now been used by many neuroscientists to understand more about our brain. But how is possible that artists such as Marcel Proust, Goerge Elliot, Paul Cézanne or Virginia Woolf could predict how our mind works? Can art give us a better closeness to our consciousness than the reductionist approach of neuroscience? On each chapter, the author introduces the reader with a short biography about the artist's life and their work to grasp a better understanding of the their insight and influence. Then, the author uses their contributions to explain a specific function of the brain and how these artists were right in their own way. I think Jonah Lehrer successfully accomplished to demonstrate through his prose, an ability to understand each of the artist's work and put in simple words its application in different areas of Neuroscience. All of the chapters are enjoyable and interesting. In George Elliot, I was surprised to know about Charles Darwin's influence on her writting after reading ""On the origing of Species"" and how she defied the social physics of her day, more specific positivism through ""Middlemarch"". After a good insight about her work Leher brings the association of Middlemarch's characters and neuroplasticity. As George Elliot says: ""It's never too late to be what you might have been"".As with George Elliot and Neuroplasticity, with Marcel Proust the reader will de introduced into the complex and fascinating topic of Memory; which I honestly expected an extension of Dr. Si and Kandel's research work on memory as being part of the laboratory staff working on this project. Nevertheless, the information it is accurate and perfectly ending with the CBEP proteins in memory, a protein that (according to Kandel Journal of Neuroscience 2009) functions like a Prion. The chapter on Gertrude Stein is also fascinating, her social life surrounded by people such as Picasso, Hemingway or Matisse and other intelligentsia learning from each other is almost like a dream which reminds me of early Vienna 1900's when artists and scientists met to exchange ideas. Gertrude Stein, was a medical student but loved the art of writing, as she enjoyed playing with words she approached linguistics and preceded Noam Chomsky, who sayd that Stein was right.... ""A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose"". Virginia Wool, an admirer of Albert Einstein, approaches consciousness through her characters but, albeit scientific explanations of our mind, she never stopped believing in the importance of what art can say about us, au contraire of evolutionary psychologists such as Steven Pinker. Also, through the chef Auguste Escoffier, the sensation of taste and the umami receptors is also a delight!As I previously mentioned, Eric Kandel also approaches the function of the mind through expressionism art In Vienna and its impact on Psychology and Neuroscience. Through artists such as Klimt, Kokoschka, Schiele, Schnitzler and Freud, Kandel explains how our perception of artwork can lead us to understand the way we think and feel. If you liked ""Proust was a Neuroscientist"", you do not want to miss ""The Age of Insight"" by a genius in the field of Neuroscience. I'm unaware of Kandels influence on Lehrer towards this book, but as his mentor and similitudes of both books I suppose there obviously is one. This one being a lighter version. Both are highly recommendable to anyone interested in science and art history and in understanding a little more about how our mind works! I enjoy this kind of books for two reasons. First, because Im fascinated in understanding more about how our brain functions, how we think, how we feel and how each one of us apart from being formed basically by the same chemical formula, we are completely different in our own way. Genetics, epigenetics, environment, neurochemistry... all of these define who we are but it is through art that we get to understand how each one of us think and behave the way we do, individually. Art + science, a hedonistic and interesting combination. Secondly, it gives me a different and wider perspective of an artist's work and enhances me to put attention in details that I might have been missing. Now, I know what to expect from Proust or Gertrude Stein, and what to look for when I re-read Virginia Woolf or enjoy the musical dissonance my brain goes through each time I play Stravinsky's ""The Rite""."

But damn. I both over and underestimated it. Crazy brain. I REALLY liked its structure: Proust was one chapter, but there were chapters on Virginia Woolf, Gertrude Stein, Walt Whitman, Paul Cézanne, Igor Stravinsky, etc.. He exceeded my expectations, kept me engaged, and even his Coda at the end was strong. Sometimes, it did feel a bit forced. Like he REALLY wanted Virginia Woolf to be able to explain the self so bad, but it was enjoyable as far as delivering an argument (with few citations). It wasn't a perfect little book, but it was fun. HOWEVER --I DO, unfortunately, have to re-evaluate an author by his later looseness with Bob Dylan*.

2,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,3,"Lehrer used to be a lab technician in a neuroscience lab. His lab work involved investigating memory. He would read Proust while waiting for his experiments to finish. Then it dawned to him that Proust was right about memory long before modern neuroscience got it right. And that was the forming idea for this book. Lehrer describes a few artists and their works to show that a lot of times artists discover truths about human nature while scientists of their time still have it wrong. Art foretelling science. These are the artists that he discusses and their particular insight into human mind.1. Walt Whitman’s poetry implies that our emotions and sensations are not solely produced by the brain, but involve our entire body. There’s a body-brain loop that goes both ways between sensations and emotions. 2. George Elliot rejected the mechanical and deterministic worldview of her time and believed in something that is close to what is now called neuroplasticity.3. The French chef Auguste Escoffier (he’s the guy who invented menu) was ahead of the narrow understanding that the biologists of his time had of the sense of taste. 4. Marcel Proust knew that recollection is inseparable from memory. The act of remembering can alter the memory. 5. Paul Cezanne’s painting tried to show that vision is not like a picture getting sent accurately to the brain through camera-like eyes. Seeing involves a great amount of post-processing by the brain of the signals that eyes send. 6. Igor Stravinsky understood how the brain expects patterns and how denying these pattern causes conflict and pain. He also knew that the mind was plastic and over time dissonance becomes consonance.7. Gertrude Stein’s deliberately “nonsensical” writing was an attempt to show that the structure of the language was unavoidable. This was 50 years before Chomsky and at a time when behaviorism claimed to explain language as well.8. Virginia Wolf’s characters demonstrate the idea of an emerging self. We continually emerge and construct our self from the scraps of our sensations. Self is an illusion that we invent by turning our sensory inputs into consciousness. Most chapters are an interesting and informative mix of art history and science. As for the Lehrer’s main thesis – artists being ahead of science of their time – in some chapter you can see a case, but in others Lehrer just seems to be forcing it. I have an issue with Lehrer's overall methodology to begin with. If you pick any artist (doesn’t have to be Proust – any half-decent one will do as well) and study their works and look hard enough, you’ll find something that they were right about and arguably ahead of their time. So what? What does it really prove?"

Apparently there have been quite a few books prior to this one about the ""third culture,"" the bridge between art and science (and unfortunately I've not read any of them) —Lehrer mentions E.O. Wilson's 
Consilience
 and Ian McEwan's 
Saturday
 (a kind of update on Virginia Woolf's 
Mrs. Dalloway
) as unsuccessful and successful works on the subject, respectively— but I was very pleased with the scope and depth of this book, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the workings of the human brain, memory and perception, especially as they apply to the arts. I found it super fascinating, and a very rewarding read. Lehrer writes the concepts with enough detail to be interesting, but in language plain enough that you won't have to spend time looking up extra information or texts unless you want to.I did feel that Lehrer romanticizes the artists in the book slightly, (possibly because he's less an artist than a scientist?) the artists surely receive less criticism for their ideas (which in the book are usually validated decades later by science, oops, spoiler) than the equivalent scientists which in some cases are painted as misguided logicals swayed by the slightest change in fashionable thought. I'm not saying I disagree completely, just that there isn't as much criticism of the prevalent arts assumptions as there could be (there is some, particularly around Cezanne and the attitudes of the Impressionists) and it may be slightly misleading.I do very much agree with Lehrer's main idea in the book: Science is a kind of foreign language, a type of overlay built on to the human experience—molded by humans but external, separated from humans by it's precision: mathematics, theorems, equations. It speaks of what we experience but not in the way we experience it. Art, on the other hand, far more fluid and subjective, speaks in the terms of humans. It allows us to use our own internal language to express and understand the world, in context, in focus, and in the most meaningful way possible. Our way. For me, an entire book about that— the single most important thing in my life, was really excellent."

Ah, yes, every nerd’s most guilty pleasure – an instantaneous sugar high of easy information. Intrigue me with the revelation of some vague underlying life pattern! Enlighten me with the minimum amount of detail! Break down this world into consumable nuggets and spoon-feed it to me bit by bit! But then, like with any sugary treat, the pleasure ends with the final bite. Jonah Lehrer’s Proust Was a Neuroscientist ambles through the highlights of turn-of-the-century artistic modernism in celebration of the artists (Walt Whitman, Cezanne, etc.) who hit upon a basic series of now-proven neuro-truths (the body is governed by electric pulses, our brain translates sight into what we see, etc.), and what a lovely idea – this English degree is worth something after all! Art and literature are worthy teachers of human behavior, as sharp as any scientist. I hummed happily through, put the book down, and couldn’t name all eight featured artists for all the beer in Belgium.PWAN is a brief and friendly jaunt, direct and subtly repetitive, with all the trademark short sentences and clipped humor of a well-studied Gladwellian. Lehrer may have taken a few English classes in college between lab periods, but his literary influence is much more Contemporary Middlebrow than Modernist. The Library of Congress lists PWAN under “neuroscience and the arts” when truly it belongs under the category we can surely by now recognize as “instant non-fiction best-seller – life’s complexity simply explained.”PWAN belongs on the American coffeetable besides The Tipping Point, The Black Swan, The Wisdom of Crowds, The Long Tail, The World is Flat, Outliers, Better, Blink, Sway, Nudge and, of course, Freakonomics, that smug schoolboy, the sly pied piper that started it all.I don’t really mean to be flip or dismissive. Like I said, this stuff is genuine candy to a bookgeek – so light and tasty! But so not filling. It must be said once and for all that the non-fiction best-seller list has turned into a literary manifestation of every yuppie’s most loved/hated cocktail game: the Smartest Guy in the Room. I can’t wait to sit around some IKEA’d studio with a bacon-wrapped date and a glass of screw-top red and hear someone mention off-hand that they simply cannot stand Gertrude Stein, but then again wasn’t she prescient? “Anticipated Chomsky, I believe.” Freakonomics, what hath you wrought? Lehrer might resent the Freakonomics classification. He wants to be taken seriously – academically seriously. His coda addresses the tired Two Cultures debate made widespread by scientist and novelist CP Snow’s 1959 assertion that the academy falsely separates science and art into distinct and distant categories. Lehrer notes the increasing salability of “the third culture,” a series of science writers like Richard Dawkins and Brian Greene who make bank translating black holes and genes into accessible prose. But Lehrer wants to be distinct from them as well. These writers are a bridge between the scientific community and the ignorant public, not between the two cultures. These writers want to dominate the humanities’ view of the world, not welcome it. Lehrer advocates a fourth culture, one that recognizes the limits of science because “we now know enough to know that we will never know everything. This is why we need art: it teaches us how to live with mystery. […:] Sometimes there is no answer.” Lehrer wants this book to show “how art and science might be reintegrated into an expansive critical sphere.” Then why does its back cover crow that the book he produced is “a riveting tale of art trumping science again and again”?The thing is, Lehrer doesn’t integrate art and science. He pits them against each other. He wants “to tell a different story,” not investigate the true subject matter at hand – neurology. Lehrer has taken a wide gamut of fascinating material and worthwhile connections and shoehorned them into a simplified narrative as if he’s revealing a new story of science: Look, these artists anticipated science! They hit upon concepts that big bad serious science is only re-discovering now! Lehrer is trying to prove the validity of art by virtue of its prescience, and it’s all marketing spin job. In truth, of course, art and science have been grappling with the nature of being for literally ages. There is no reason to boost up French chef Auguste Escoffier as the inventor of umami when in reality he was simply another contributor to our general understanding of taste, so why not simply fold in Escoffier and to a chapter about taste? This is where a smart, non-mainstream editor steps in. The needless narrative frame exacerbates PWAN’s cutesy Gladwellian tone, and a mound of promising material is boxed into something false and mass-marketable. It’s also a false opposition. Art v. science is meaninglessly broad. There’s literature, and there’s physics, and there’s politics, and there’s chemistry, and there’s cinema, and there’s sociology and all the other various soft and hard and imaginary departments in between. These distinctions are arbitrary and fluid – thus the ever-popular interdisciplinary studies – Lehrer himself ought to realize this. His interest in “bridging the culture gap” stems from his own multi-disciplinary education. The Times’ DT Max fills out Lehrer’s distinguished background: Rhodes scholar, neuroscience lab fellow, and Le Cirque line chef, not to mention magazine editor and New Yorker contributor and all by 25. (Max aptly sums up Lehrer as “one of those young people who turn up in articles on how life is now so competitive that children no longer have time for jump-rope or adolescents for baby-sitting,” and I confess, my own knee-jerk eye-rolls are 100% petty.) What hobby more full embodies the twin loves of science and art than gourmet cooking?Really, I don’t think Lehrer means to create a “fourth culture,” or even prove to an indifferent public that Stein anticipated Chomsky. Lehrer’s main case here is for how clever he is. He is so clever, in fact, that he’s changed the rules of our unceasing parlor game. The Smartest Guy in the Room is no longer the sly explicator of behavioral anomalies a la Leavitt or Gladwell or Sunstein. He’s the guy who’s fluent in science and art. He’s the scientist who escapes the monotony of the lab with long sessions of Proust (as if that’s any less monotonous).The book, meanwhile, deserves a little more summary. My highlights: - Walt Whitman,”The Substance of Feeling” – Whitman emphasized a physical mind-body connection now being elaborated by Antonio Damasio. Rather basic. Fun fact: who knew that Whitman was a volunteer nurse in the civil war? (or, rather, “wound-dresser,” as Lehrer so masculinely puts it)- George Eliot, “The Biology of Freedom” – Eliot “believed that the mind’s ability to alter itself was the source of our freedom”; neurogenesis and neural plasticity suggest that biology thrives on disorder. Rather tenuous. Fun fact: Eliot was a famously ugly woman – “magnificently ugly,” according to Henry James. “Deliciously hideous.”- August Escoffier, “The Essence of Taste” – Escoffier soaked everything in veal stock because he loved him the savory even though it wasn’t recognized as one of the four flavors. Meanwhile, in 1907, Kikunae Ikeda distilled MSG from seaweed and dubbed it umami. Awesome intro to umami; not really so much to do with Escoffier.- Marcel Proust, “The Method of Memory” – Our brain create our memories with every recollection. Yep. Hate to say duh.- Paul Cezanne, “The Process of Sight” – Our brain creates our sight by interpreting our visual input. Sounds good.- Igor Stravinksy, “The Source of Music” – Holy cow am I happy that I’ve never heard the Rite of Spring. This douche sounds like the kind of artiste that needs a good punch in the face. The sound of music “before the arising of beauty”? Count me out; check, please.- Gertrude Stein, “The Structure of Language” – I’ve never understood the allure of Stein’s gibberish and Lehrer comes as close to explaining it to me as any unlucky English prof. Stein wanted to separate language from the yoke of “having to say something,” but found that she couldn’t. Chomsky looked at how words are inescapably attached to meanings and came upon the concept of innate grammar. Compelling, but oh so very boring and even more useless. Fun fact: Who knew that Gertrude Stein got her start in the psych lab of William frickin James? - Virginia Woolf, “The Emergent Self” – I wrote my own pompous thesis about Woolf and Dalloway in college and Lehrer expands commendably on one of my favorite moments, when Clarissa looks in the mirror and sees that “some effort, some call on her to be her, drew the parts together.” Lovely, and very descriptive of the self, of the many parts and pieces that pull in so many different directions. And some or other neuroscientist then backs her up.So, congratulations, Lehrer, add “published best-seller” to your meaty young resume. But a final note for future publications. They say to never judge a book by its cover. I tend to go ahead and judge anyway, because whatever, but in any case the title is always fair game for judgment. And this title, it must be said, is tellingly insipid. Proust wasn’t a neuroscientist. Proust was fanatically neurotic. Proust was a megalomaniacal whining momma’s boy. This would have been a far more fascinating book if Lehrer would not have skimped over such context but instead gone in without a point to prove. Forget the scientific method and go in like a good historian: draw the conclusion from the facts, rather than rearrange them for the sake of the hypothesis."

A few of the chapters are fabulous and he should have quit while he was ahead, but I suppose that would have left a short book. My advice is to only read these chapters: 3 - Auguste Escoffier and The Essence of Taste (best chapter); 4 - Marcel Proust and The Method of Memory; and Igor Stravinsky and The Source of Music (2nd best chapter). Chapters 5 & 7 are also okay if you have more time, but skip the rest."

7,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1392534-catherine,1,"You have no idea how much it pains me to dislike a book that Oliver Sacks hails as brilliant, but dear god, I found this tepid, unproven, and faintly ridiculous in turn. Lehrer never actually proves his thesis - that artists of several kinds anticipated the discoveries of neuroscience by several decades. Instead he describes a neuroscientific discovery and reads back into the work of selected artists a definitive revelation they never sought or articulated - the cause and effect he sees plainly does not match. Worse, he locates those revelations entirely in the Western world - the idea that Walt Whitman understood that the brain and body are mutually dependent in creating our experience of the world and - he intimates - understood it first would likely come as quite a shock to, say, the Buddhists and Hindus of the East who have been exploring the mind-body connection in practice, song, chant, and art for centuries. Similarly, Escouffier made fantastic stock - I am quite convinced of this fact. That Escouffier did so because he understood something about how the brain works rather than because he just thought things tasted better with bouquet garni, however? I'm unconvinced.There's also some shady science in this text, although I'm not sure if it's because Lehrer is getting the science completely wrong or simply because his writing is imprecise. When talking of Civil War soldiers experiencing phantom limb pain, for example, Lehrer argues that the persistence of pain in no-longer-existent body parts showed that ""Since soul is body and body is soul, to lose a part of one's body is to lose a part of one's soul. . . . The mind cannot be extricated from its matter, for mind and matter, these two seemingly opposite substances, are impossibly intertwined."" (14-15) I don't question the sentiment, but I do question its applicability to phantom limb pain, which neuroscience has proven to be wholly and irrevocably a matter of the brain acting alone - of over-active cells, of physical memory, all of which can be erased if the brain is tricked into thinking it has a limb again (mirror therapy is used to treat the phantom limb pain of amputees returning from Afghanistan and Iraq). Similarly, he writes that early 19th century scientist LaPlace ""knew that two astronomers plotting the orbit of the same planet at the same time would differ reliably in their data. The fault was not in the stars, but in ourselves."" Yet we know, thanks to quantum physics, that two astronomers plotting the orbit of the same planet can differ reliably in their data because time does not move in all places and at all times at the same pace. Is Lehrer claiming only that LaPlace put things down to human error, or that we still consider ourselves to be the problem, and not the stars (and, clearly, not the space-time continuum, which is the real issue).I am no scientist - all of this knowledge is gleaned from a somewhat obsessive love of the science articles in The New Yorker - but this (and Lehrer's claim that a bird is a mammal) made me question his other scientific claims.I was also bored. But that almost seems by the by."
8,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a truly perceptive book, about the linkages between art/language/music/cooking/writing and the science of the brain. Each chapter focuses on a different artist, and the insights of his/her artistry into the workings of the brain. I especially appreciated the chapter about Escoffier, the French chef who invented the concept of a restaurant menu. He discovered and put to use the taste of umami, a distinct reaction of taste buds to glutamate. He had a deep understanding about the effects of the smell and appearance of foods on people's appetites. His ideas preceded their acceptance by scientists by many years. The chapter on Igor Stravinsky was also fascinating. He realized that the sense of dissonance in music is temporary. Over time, exposure to dissonance makes the dissonant sound become acceptable, and even beautiful. Therefore, he composed The Rite of Spring to be utterly shocking to the tastes of the contemporary public. He wanted to ensure that the shock value would last for some time, before his music had a chance to become ""beautiful""."
9,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155124-jennifer-guzman,4,"Jonathan Lehrer examines the avante garde work of eight artists -- one poet (Walt Whitman), four novelists (George Eliot, Marcel Proust, Gertrude Stein, and Virginia Woolf), one painter (Paul Cezanne), one composer (Igor Stravinsky), and one chef (Auguste Escoffier) -- and shows how it anticipated scientific principles that would later be discovered. The eight essays are absorbing, and Lehrer writes about science in a way that is accessible and enlightening for those more familiar with the humanities. His literary interpretations of works like Middlemarch, In Search of Lost Time, and To the Lighthouse do not stray from traditional readings and offer anything new as far as literary criticism goes, but that's not really in the scope of this book.The weakest chapter is that on George Eliot, in which he seeks to show that Eliot's rejection of the determinist philosophy of her time is borne out not only in her writing but in the science of DNA. However, in seeking to show that we have biological freedom, Lehrer overlooks that we, like the characters in Eliot's novels, have free will but are born into unalterable circumstance and are affected by forces outside our control -- such as the choices of others and nature (as the characters of Eliot's The Mill on the Floss could tell us).The balance of the book is very strong, however, and I particularly enjoyed the chapters on Whitman, Stravinsky and Woolf. The inseparability of body and mind, the neuroscience of music, and the construction of consciousness are all elegantly explored and explained.The final chapter is a ""coda"" in which Lehrer expresses a wish for a ""fourth culture"" that will ""freely transplant knowledge between the sciences and the humanities, and will focus on connecting the reductionist fact to our actual experience."" He is very persuasive, and a desire to better understand how science can enlighten art and art can enlighten science is what led me to his book in the first place. I do find, though, that Lehrer can be too positive about the limits of science; he writes, ""It is naive to think that science can solve everything by itself, or that everything can be solved."" Too often I've seen in centuries-old writing the opinion that we would never discover something that today we have, such as what stars are made of and how they burn. I agree that there are limits to our knowledge now, and that art helps us delve through those limitations, but I do not think it follows that we will not someday understand and know what we don't today. I think it is better to say that art helps us to discover what we do not yet understand and know, and once those problems are solved, it will discover more. Art is the guide for our increasing knowledge, leading us to new paths of inquiry.I do not agree with Lehrer on everything, but I value this book for that very reason. Where I disagree with him leads me to think things out for myself, and the fascinating work he does linking art and science inspires me to read more, to learn more."
10,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4005044-oroboros72,2,"I think that Lehrer's thesis is flawed. When he says that art is ahead of science, it doesn't really mean anything to me. Proust describes a connection between smell and memory before neuroscientists demonstrated that there was one, but that is not because he is an artist or because he had some special insight into memory that scientists couldn't or didn't have. He describes memory in this way because he is a human and that is how the memory system is set up. Before Proust, I am sure many many people observed that smells could evoke strong and overwhelming memories. It's not that art is ahead of neuroscience, it's that humans with brains do art and the way the brain works determines how art comes out. The thesis seems like this to me ""cave men made pictures using red and green, and color science later showed that green and red are complimentary colors, so cave men were way ahead of science."" It's just a pretty meaningless thing to say. Despite my disagreement with the thesis, I actually really enjoyed reading the book. As a story about certain artists and how their work fit in with the science of their day and how it can be understood in terms of current science, it is really entertaining (I would also recommend ""The Disappearing Spoon"" for some fun stories about the elements of the periodic table). But the weight and importance put on the fact that these 'discoveries' were made by art before they were made by science is tangential to what is actually interesting in this book. It seems like Lehrer is just trying to play to people who want to feel smarter than scientists, and sell more books by making it sound like he has discovered something exciting (that art is so much smarter than science).  "

12,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1419068-elaine,4,"What an unusual book, about art and science, and how artists:poets, novelists, painters and even a chef intuited how the self sees and feels long before scientists did. The book Age of Wonder shows that 18th and early 19th century poets and scientists considered themselves collaborators.Those happy days had ended by the time Walt Whitman arrived on the scene, allowing nothing to be deemed truth unless it could be observed, measured and manipulated.Nevertheless, Whitman, who cared for soldiers in hospitals during the Civil War, put forth, in his poetry, the relationship between the body, the whole body, and emotion. Likewise, Proust was prescient about the nature of memory. George Eliot, an avid reader of science, explored human nature and the malleability of the mind. Escofier, French chef extraordinaire, not only discovered the 5th taste but also much about the physical origins of appetite, besides hunger, of course. Cezanne, to me, was the most amazing. He noticed that the mind sees what it is trained to see. In other words, reality is in our brains. It's not out there. If you read just one piece of nonfiction this year, make it this chapter. By all means, read the others, too, but this, to me, is essential.Unfortunately, I can't say the same for Lehrer's chapter on Gertrude Stein who, to me, was an arrogant talentless bore. She was famous because she knew famous people and bought a lot of paintings. Since she wasn't averse to gossip, people accepted her invitations. That's my take on her fame, anyway.What galled me about Lehrer's assertion that Stein ""discovered"" deep structure in language 50 years before Chomsky was that neither Stein nor Chomsky did so. Chomsky learned structural linguistics, which focused on syntax, and stressed the self-evident fact that we change the deep structure of assertion, for instance, to create questions. Thus, ""He did go"" becomes ""Did he go?"" More interestingly, ""Jack went"" becomes ""Did Jack go?"" Since anthropological linguists were examining such phenomena by the opening of the 20th century because they were busy writing grammars .of tribal peoples. What Chomsky did that was noteworthy was to show that Behaviorism is grossly wrong. He also used mathematical notations to describe syntax.Lehrer claims that Stein's writings were an attempt to show how syntax governs what we say. Scholars in the Middle Ages knew that. They studied Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. They had to compare the syntax of these languages to English to learn them. Lehrer can claim ignorance on the grounds of not knowing the history of Linguistics, but to quote Stein's unlovely, unclever, and unmeaning prose as an example of showing deep structure is silly. He quotes her sentence, ""The care with which incredible justness and likeness all this makes a magnificent asparagus."" This is not pushing syntax, uncovering its role in language. Before Stein, Lewis Carroll did that superbly in Jabberwocky. Since he apparently wanted a writer to illustrate how we are governed by syntax, Lehrer could have used e.e. cummings, ""Anyone lived in a pretty how town with up so many floating bells down...he danced his didn't...""Except for the Stein chapter, this is a great and unusual read"
13,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4963801-daniel-m,3,"Lehrer does a clever thing by taking a slice through contemporary neuroscience as seen from the perspective of different authors. Considering the nature of emotions by reading Whitman’s “Leaves of Grass” or memory by looking through the eyes of Proust’s “Remembrance of Things Past” allows the author to weave together science as revealed by art. I’m not sure I believe his basic argument that art precedes science—he’s cherry-picking the data here to only show positive examples and ignores the vast number of writers who are blatantly wrong about the nature of mind. Still, I enjoy the combination as providing some illumination. Great writers DO provide new language that gives us a way to think about and consider phenomena, especially the slippery, indescribable sensations that flit through our consciousness. Considering the process of visual perception through Cezanne’s point-of-view brings a historical perspective to the front. In Cezanne’s day, perception was thought of a “perfect reflections of the outside world. The eye was like a camera: it collected pixels of light and passed them passively on to the brain.” His artwork is clearly NOT that, but plays with the difference between what’s actually there and what’s perceived. (p. 97) I also learned a few things that I really hadn’t known. Example: The idea that the CPEB protein can exist in multiple stable configurations, but can be flipped from one state to another by a neurotransmitter (the basis of long-term memory encoding?) was astounding. (p. 93-94)Lehrer gets a little fuzzy and over-the-top in the last chapter. Virginia Woolf is a great writer that really does try to be internally introspective, but Lehrer seems to over-value her perspective as telling us that consciousness is fundamentally unknowable. For all his railing about post-modernism as a language trick that devalues rigorous thought, it feels to me as though he does the same thing in end. In discarding reductionism as a methodology for understanding, I think he overdid it and fell into a pool of abstractions that don’t carry his argument forward very well. But I still think it’s a great book. Just don’t take the last 12 pages too seriously. "

Woolf's treatment of the self and Proust's treatment of memory, for example, correspond to the discoveries about how our brain works. If you believe, as I do, that science is an art and that art is a science, this book will be fascinating. Not the least of it's merits are the light it sheds on the life of the artist's discussed."

It is broad in its scope and offers much food for thought along the course of the book. The main body of the book is made up of chapters juxtaposing a particular artist and his or her subjective insights with objectively observed functionings of the brain. Some of the comparisons yield more insight than others, such as the exploration of the discovery of L-glutamate receptors on the tongue with the innovations of pioneering chef Auguste Escoffier or the comparison of the mechanics of vision with the art of Paul Cezanne, but even the weaker chapters, such as the Walt Whitman chapter, have enough interesting observations to keep the reader engaged. In the final chapter, ""Coda"", Lerner brings the book together with an appeal to both scientists and students of the humanities to refrain from writing the understandings of one another off. Postmodernists, he says, can write off the discoveries of science as ""nothing but another text"" while scientist can write off the humanities as ""hopelessly false."" Lerner reminds us that no one has a monopoly on the truth, and calls for a sort of middle path between the two to help us understand our lives and the world around us."

This bridge of art and science was glorious in every way and I think I must own this book to flip back through my favorite sections again and again.

The best kind of books, fiction or nonfiction, are the ones that make me think differently. This book completely changed the way I thought about literary heavy hitters and artists of all kinds. It concerns a subject near and dear to my heart: the relationship between art and science. Being an English major, I'm more often than not spotted with a Stephen King novel in my hand, Hemingway or McCarthy if I'm feeling terse, Austen if I'm feeling romantic. However, it's not so rare for me to be reading WIRED or DISCOVER magazine. I watch NOVA regularly and some of my favorite blogs are science blogs. I've always considered literature to be the expression of the practice of living. Every single thing that science discovers or philosophers theorize about are exemplified in literature. So, I was extremely pleased to find Lehrer articulating all my thoughts and suppositions in a voice that is remarkably accessible and beautiful.You pretty much feel like you're talking to a particularly passionate friend, and then he'll say something that sounds uncommonly like this guy's a real writer. Then you remember, oh yeah, he is. That kind of tone is particularly effective at putting me at ease and making me receptive towards new information. Then you've got all the crazy research, the extremely orderly and sensible format, and it's pretty much a home run. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who thinks that fiction is useless, but also for people who love art and love asking questions. It's a tribute to the brilliance of the human brain. When I read these kinds of books, my belief in the extraordinary miracle of the human race is reaffirmed and celebrated."
20,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/426277-james,4,"Lehrer argues that many 20th and 21st-century discoveries of neuroscience are actually re-discoveries of insights made earlier by various artists, including Gertrude Stein, Walt Whitman, Paul Cézanne, Igor Stravinsky, and, as mentioned in the title, Marcel Proust. It is really an exploration into the old Science vs. Art debate. As such it has some refreshing and thought-provoking ideas, although they are somewhat speculative. Lehrer takes the reader into the dusty corners of literary history, pondering over the musings of poets, writers, artists and composers in order to prove his theory – not just that Proust was a neuroscientist, but that artists are the innovative crowd in matters of science and, in particular, the human brain. Leher argues that it is through the boundless freedom at the heart of these artists’ work, that they have uncovered truths about science before the scientists themselves have had a chance to catch up. The artistic hypothesis which forms the foundation of the work of these creative thinkers is based on ‘measuring the immeasurable’. They attempt it by treating their art as a living entity – exploring the ‘anatomy of emotion’ rather than treating their art as pure surface matter. In this fascinating and unusual book, Lehrer makes an insightful case for Art triumphing over Science, selecting visionary thinkers to illustrate his very valid points. Whether this speculation holds any water is something else. Even if it does not the book presents an interesting hypothesis and is enjoyable to read."
21,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4074574-jan-priddy,5,"PROUST WAS A NEUROSCIENTIST by Jonah Lehrer (editor at large for SEED with a blog: “The Frontal Cortex”) documents how “science is not the only path to knowledge” since the arts (novels, symphonies, poetry, paintings, cookbooks!) often precede scientific discoveries. It seems almost everything I learned about the nervous system is wrong, and artists knew this at least a hundred years before science. Lehrer argues for C.P. Snow’s “Third Culture” as a celebration of pluralism and equitable dialogue between the arts and sciences. “Unfortunately, many of the luminaries of our current third culture are extremely antagonistic toward everything that isn’t scientific,” he writes (192). And that is a pity, because human beings are more than charts and numbers; we are creative and denying this, blinds us to our imaginative capacities. Do I need to add that I loved this book?"
22,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56201438-lina-slavova,4,"The author of the book, Jonah Lehrer, used to be a technician in a neuroscience lab where he was trying to understand how the mind remembers. It was at that time that he began reading Proust. He realised, to his surprise, that what Proust was describing in prose coincided with the new neuroscientific discoveries about memory. This lead to his basic idea of the book: there are many ways of describing reality and each of the methods is capable of generating truth. He goes to show that neuroscience is useful for describing the functioning of the brain and that art is useful for describing our actual experience of the brain. To prove this assertion Lehrer shows the reader how eight artists: a poet, a chef, a composer, a painter and four novelists each described accurately an aspect of the mind that modern neuroscience is now explaining in scientific terms.  This book is original and well written. I would definitely encourage you to read it. Below is a brief summary but obviously, there is a lot more  information in the book and you might be inspired by different aspects or pieces of information.  Walt Whitman served as wound dresser during the 1862 Civil War. During that time he encountered many soldiers with amputated limps but who were still able to “feel” their missing parts. It is because of this experience that he came to see the interconnection between mind and body. Now modern neuroscience explains that feelings emerge from the interaction of our brain and our body and not form any single place. This is the theory of the Body Loop elaborated by Dr. Antonio Damasio. George Eliot was a mid-nineteen century novelist that believed our human nature is malleable and that we can willfully transform ourselves. She believed that the source of our freedom is the ability of the mind to alter itself. Neuroscience now knows that our brain is far from being fixed and is  constantly giving birth to new connections and that the amount of neurogenesis is directly influenced by the environment.  Auguste Escoffier, the French chef who invented the veal stock, was the first to take full advantage of the sense of smell and that is why he served his food hot.   Today, neuroscience findings suggest that up to 90% of what we perceive as taste is actually smell. Escoffier also believed in the plasticity of the sense of smell and its ability to be remodeled by new experiences. This fact is also confirmed by neuroscience. When we sense something the sensation is immediately analyzed in terms of previous experiences. Our individual and subjective brain interprets the sensations. Marcel Proust realised that our senses of smell and taste are closely linked to our memories. Proust used the taste of a madeleine and the taste of tea to reconstruct his childhood. Scientific research indicates that memories are not stored somewhere in our brain but reconstructed each time, and that with each reconstruction we alter the structure of the memory. How exactly we reconstruct the memories is still a mystery, but it appears that our knowledge influences our recollection. We alter past memories to reflect our current understanding of the recollected circumstances, just as Proust’s writing technique, always altering his past words to reflect his present circumstances.  Paul Cezanne felt that to see, the eye is not enough. We need out minds, we need to interpret our impressions. The information captured by the retina is sent into two separate pathways in the brain, one slow and one fast. The fast pathway sends a blurry picture to our prefrontal cortex who then decides what we have seen, it edits the information. We see twice and everything we see is an abstraction. Cezanne’s goal was to give the brain just enough lines to decipher the image. He broke all the laws of painting of his time in order to reveal the laws of seeing. The mind imposes itself on the eye. Igor Stravinsky believed that our sense of sound is malleable. He believed in the limitless possibility of our minds. Neuroscience confirms that our brain is obsessed with order and constantly seeks patterns. A symphony is simply vibrating air that we have learned how to hear, a melody with predictable patterns. Stravinsky intentionally broke down the known patterns and was first rejected for doing so, but then the audiences proved him right by getting used to the new patterns and appreciating his creations.  Gertrude Stein was fascinated by the subject of language. For a long period of time she studied automatic writing and came to the conclusion that the structure of language is built in our brains. Most of her time she wrote about absolutely nothing but that nothing somehow remained grammatical.  Many years later Chomsky in the 1950’s articulated the theory of the universal grammar. Our words are symbolic and gain meaning by the use we make of them. What is permanent is the stricture that binds these words. It is an invisible grammar imbedded in our brain. The structure exists independently of the words.   Virginia Wolf was affected by mental illness and her way of dealing with her condition was to look inside her own mind. What she found was a mind that never stood still. She realised that what makes us whole is the self and that the self is composed of many different fragments that we somehow experience as one. She believed that the self is the story we tell ourselves about our experiences. We emerge from our own fleeting interpretations of the world by paying attention to what we perceive. Although the self is still an elusive concept, the study of split-brain patients (patients with severed nervous tissue that connects the left and right hemispheres) has proved that each lobe has a unique self, a distinct being with its own desires, talents and sensations. Our consciousness seams to emerge form the multiple parts of our brain, we are plural but have the sensation of being whole."

25,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41821997-neuravinci,4,"Being a neuroscience major, I'm a sucker for anything to do with the brain, even pop science books. This is the second time I'm reading Proust was a Neuroscientist, the first time being when I was in college. Yet again, Jonah Lehrer had me hooked. Beautiful poetic prose coupled with what is clearly a ton of literature research on his end, Proust was a Neuroscientist is the perfect merger of art and science. What I loved is that Jonah Lehrer so clearly believes in the marriage of art and science, how one fuels the other, and neither can live without the other. In Proust was a Neuroscientist, Lehrer forges the connection between what writers, artists, painters, musicians, and chefs intuited through their art, and how science is figuring out that they were right. What these 'creatives' understood and felt through their art about the mind, the brain, and what it means to be human, science is now understanding in a lab with controlled experiments and methodologies. I loved most all the chapters, even the ones I didn't think I would care about because I know nothing about painting or postimpressionism, for example. But Lehrer's writing makes it clear the creatives contribution to neuroscience, and gives a background on their personal and professional context. The book ends up reading less like history and science, and more like art itself. Though Jonah tends to have some strong opinions on certain subjects, like epigenetics and how we're not genetically predetermined, I still enjoyed his views based on the research literature. He makes strong cases for much of what he says, and has clearly done his readings, providing in-depth bibliography and notes at the back of the book. Regardless of his current status as writer renegade (based on some plagiarism and misquoting), I think Jonah Lehrer is a talented writer. He writes as smoothly as an orator would speak, and I learned much from Proust was a Neuroscientist. I plan on reading more of his other books, including How we Decide and Imagine: How Creativity Works. I don't think I could possibly read Virginia Woolf or George Eliot the same way again. And I may never eat a madeleine without thinking of Proust and his contribution to our understanding of human memory. "

27,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7070851-jakub,3,"Yes, Jonah Lehrer is a gifted writer. He has a wonderful way with words. He’s extremely knowledgeable and well-read, and he’s also very good at discussing a variety of complicated topics. I should have fallen in love with this book. It attempts to combine my two great loves: the arts, and the sciences. It covers a diversity of creative enterprises, from autobiographical writing to cooking, and connects them to fascinating new insights provided by neuroscience, biochemistry, and so on. So what the hell went wrong? First of all, I have a passion, and what I like to this is a decent general knowledge, about science, and scientific topics. I also happen to have a degree in philosophy. In both those spheres, precise language is crucial, and here Lehrer really annoyed me. When he tries to argue that human brain plasticity allows us to “find our freedom” and steal it back from deterministic physics, all I can say is “What?” What kind of freedom do you mean? How does the fact that the brain adapts to environmental inputs, or the fact that there is randomness in natural selection, in any way mean that we are “free” in any meaningful way? In another part of the book, he says that a hand was sweating because of something that the brain was not aware of, and as a consequence he says that the hand “knew” something that the brain did not. Again, by what definition of “know” did the hand know something? Because to me it seems like the hand was sweating because of an unconscious brain process, and if that’s the case then it makes no sense to say that the hand “knew” something! Amidst these small infractions, there are also sentences like this, that left me banging my head against a wall: ""Since soul is body and body is soul, to lose a part of one's body is to lose a part of one's soul.” Who does he think he is, Deepak Chopra?!But, much worse than imprecise language and a haphazard usage of important terms, was a problem that I found completely and utterly unforgivable. You see, I read Discover, and the New Yorker, and Wired Magazine, and I’ve listened to every episode of Radiolab. And unfortunately for me, and others like me who decided to pick up this book, is that a lot of this book is a retread of topics that Lehrer has already covered in other publications or mediums. Basically, he repeats himself. A lot. There is a chapter in this book, from 2007, that covers something that he talked about on Radiolab last year, which he also wrote about in an article for Wired magazine this year! So while I wanted to get into the book and really enjoy it, and after I’d decided to forgive him for trying to sexify and dumb down his language to appeal to more people, I kept turning the page and realizing that I’d already read large sections of it. Which was a disappointment, to say the least. This book was not marked as a collection of previously published essays. It’s supposed to a new book, with new writing in it, not a twice-reheated collection of articles I’ve already read or heard!Still, the parts that were new were interesting, and he really does connect some very interesting dots. And he really is a damn good writer. More importantly, he does make his point, which is that ""there are many different ways of describing reality, each of which is capable of generating truth."" I just wish he'd be a bit less haphazard with his writing, and a bit less willing to copy & paste. "
28,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1183993-nathan,4,"Lehrer has a clever idea for a nonfiction book: take a retroactive scan across the arts and expose scientific visionaries who ""predicted"" neuroscientific theory ahead of their time. Sampling mostly from popular 19th and 20th century artists (Woolf, Cézanne, Stein, Proust, etc), Lehrer's greatest feat is to successfully find the red thread tying together post-impressionist painters, upscale French chefs, modernist writers, composers, and poets. His main thesis is that each of these arts have contributed understanding and exploring the human condition that served as a (often ignored) precursor to modern scientific discoveries of how the brain works. Along the way, he introduces the artist, their main philosophies and mediums, and how their work ties and taps into our current understanding of cerebral processing.As a semi-artiste and semi-neuroscientiste, this book definitely contains a certain allure; it promises to find a union between Art and Science. I applaud Leher's attempt and ambition, but I couldn't get over his University-thesis-driven report style of writing. His essays become repetitive (his main point is made early in each essay, then is subsequently beaten in like a nearly-dead horse). I got the impression (from the acknowledgments section) that his editor already chopped the book in half; I feel like she was perhaps still too generous. The book isn't necessarily too long, it just could use less repetition. Lehrer is stylistically green (this is his first book). He's still finding his own approach in a non-trivial attempt to mix fine literature (some of his sentences are spectacularly poignant and insightful) and popular science (it shows that he has worked in neuroscience). Unfortunately, it wasn't until the coda that Lehrer came clean with his true purpose in writing such a novel: he's trying to promote a class of thinkers/writers who balance both contributions from art and science in equal stride. I found this final chapter to be one of his most thought-provoking contributions. Lehrer's message is that science and art have been segregated too long and that no proper discourse/research is being performed to tie the two together. He decries the modern-day popular science writers (Dawkins, Pinker, etc) for further polarizing the devide between the arts and science. Despite a tip of the hat for popularizing science to the masses, he claims that they are unwarranted in demanding a reductionist account of all humanities. All artists should learn from modern developments in science, all scientists should look to art for fleshing in the (permanent?) gaps in our knowledge. It is here that Leher's latent anti-reductionism then comes out in full, undisclosed form: he says science can only take us so far in knowledge. The arts are there to fill in the gaps that science will be inevitably unable to explain.As I've reached the end of this long-winded thought dump of my time spent in Leher's world, I have upgraded my rating from 3 to 4 stars (3.5 would be ideal). There aren't many books make me reflect on the state of Art and Science and their mutual interaction. I support Lehrer's current efforts, but anxiously await his development as an effective writer. With his cleverness and passions bridging art and science, I'm sure his upcoming books will be fantastic."

From the blurb:We learn how Proust revealed the fallibility of memory, how George Eliot understood the brain's malleable nature, how the French chef Escoffier intuited umami (the fifth taste), how Cezanne worked out the subtleties of vision, and how Virginia Woolf pierced the mysteries of consciousness.I just didn't buy it. At most, these artists made use of human phenomena - the way taste and smell can trigger memories, the fact that denatured proteins taste delicious, the way that our brains take time to understand how ""noise"" = ""music"", the way that our eyes can build a recognisable image from almost abstract elements - in their work, but they don't predict how scientists will test and describe the brain's behaviour.I will make an exception of Escoffier and Stein. Stein pushed language as far as she could, producing senseless sentences that were still grammatically correct, prefiguring Chomsky's 'Colourless green ideas sleep furiously' and theory that we are born with an inbuilt understanding of grammar. Stein herself had been through medical school and worked in neuroscience; some of her first writing experiments turned her clinical notes into gibberish.Escoffier to seemed to have almost a scientific method - trying to delight his guest, he refined and codified recipes, and turned established practices upside down. Grand food, for example, had previously been served cold, as its grandness was partly derived from its preposterous presentation, which would have been ruined by heat. Escoffier realised that hot food releases smell, and smell is important to taste. He was also a stock an sauce master, deglazing pans and boiling things down - the practices which denature proteins and creates glutamate, the amino acid our body craves (we produce more than 40 grams of glutamate a day, and so we need our Marmite top-ups). At the same time though, Escoffier was hardly peering around the human tongue looking for the tiny areas that would respond not to salty, sweet, bitter, sour but to rich savoury glutamate.I guess I don't see the difference between Cezanne and the ancient Egyptian brewers who passed wooden spoons down from generation to generation, believing they had the magical power to start beer (which they did, through the microorganisms that lived in the cracks of the wood). Both are concerned with the end product, not necessarily the phenomena that produces it. Cezanne was interested in how the eye works and how the mind builds up shapes, sure - but really how close was he to the five steps of visual processing?Lehrer is very sincerely trying to bring the arts and science back together - to repair the right of C.P. Snow's two cultures. I'm not sure this book does it though. The art sections end up feeling like illustrations of the neuroscience - entertaining introductions, but not intellectual equals. Having said that, it's a perfectly enjoyable book, very readable, and packed with snippets and tidbits of information."

(Sorry, my high school principle cut art classes my senior year to fund our losing football team, and I'm still bitter.) Despite all the controversy surrounding the author, I loved this book. It attempts to bridge the gap between the arts and sciences; its thesis is simple: neuroscientists now are only scientifically discovering what artists managed to intuitively learn years and years ago. This book is essentially divided into essays about various (famous) artists- writers, composers, chefs, poets- and how things they wrote or spoke about are just now being proved true. Some people might feel that this book only shows a tenuous connection in half the cases, and that Lehrer romanticizes the artists too much to prove a point (he was a double major in English and Neuroscience) as well as cherry picking data, but this book confirmed a lot of thoughts I've personally had whirling around in my head, about topics like memory and language. Also, the science parts are engaging and very accessible- fellow listeners of RadioLab will recognize a lot of the work of the neuroscientists being explored! Also, I imagine if you listen to the audio book version instead of reading it, it would be well suited to this medium since it was similar to RadioLab in lots of ways.I loved how this book shows artists through a new lens- a scientific one. Even though the only artists I really knew much about were Whitman (who I love) and a bit about Stravinsky and Woolf, the material was still captivating and exciting to me- even though I've never read Proust or Stein. Also, I thought this book was very well-written, making it an easy read for such a complex subject matter. Loved it. Generally, I have very unusual standards for books like this- I'm talking about your nonfiction books like Freakonomics or Malcolm Gladwell types, where there is some sort of lofty thesis that is supported by empirics, and although the empirics might have been lacking here more so, I think I loved this book the most simply because l did really enjoy the way it was written. Also, I think I loved it because as I said, I did have lots of my own theories about subjects it discusses, like consciousness and linguistics, and so that alone made it a very rewarding read for me. I've always found arts and sciences to be very connected in my own life as well, so I almost felt to a degree that this was the book I had been waiting and wanting to read for years. Even if you don't buy the thesis and think it seems forced - I admit, Lehrer must have selectively chosen stuff to prove his point, this book is so interesting anyways.If you want to read the best chapters, you can skip around and read Proust, Stravinsky, Escoffier, and Stein.

In particular, he chooses a few great writers, a painter, a composer, and a chef and shows how their insights proved to be true in light of modern experimental science. He talks about Walt Whitman, and his insight into the lack of duality between the mind and the body (mind is the body) and importance of feelings in our intellectual functioning, Proust and the nature of memory, George Eliot and free will, brain plasticity, and our ability to change, and Virginia Woolf and her great insights into consciousness and the nature of human ‘self’. Then he shows how Cezanne intimated the true nature of visual perception and Stravinsky of how we apprehend music. And, the part I found the most interesting and novel of all, how a French and then a Japanese chef came to find the essence of ‘deliciousness’, and how it related to the research on how we perceive taste.Lehrer’s insight is that there are many ways that may be equally valid to lead us into the nature of things. Art may offer a profound understanding into the workings of our brain, the understanding that’s in no less true and legitimate than quantifiable scientific research. To take matters further, he speaks about the limitations of science and about the inadequacy of the third culture (and science popularizers like Pinker, Dawkins, Wilson, for example) to embrace the more ambiguous realms. He advocates the necessity of a ‘fourth culture’- the bridge between humanities and experimental science.The whole book signals a recent noticeable departure, notably in The Head Trip as well, of some of the younger generation scientists from what Lehrer calls ‘reductionist science’. He means science that concerns itself only with the measurable and observable, and which ignores its own limitations and solutions and insights offered by other, less measurable sources like art, even though art can comfortably live with uncertainty to which much recent and not so recent research points as a fact of existence. Some truths may never be fully known through scientific means, yet each part of our existence (feelings and subjective insights included) can offer truths that are equally scientifically valid.A great read. I loved how it wove literature, art, brain research and a broader humanistic view of human nature together."

I know that many would argue that by all laws of probability, some artists (chefs, writers, painters, etc.) would have to be right about the way that the human brain worked, and that likewise, there are probably 1,000 times more who got it wrong. That being said, the complexity of perception, taste, and senses that these artisans got right makes for a fascinating narrative, with the research science layered on top. Particularly, the sections on Proust, Matisse, and Virginia Woolf fascinated me personally, but the entire book is chock full of fascinating factoids about the human mind. Particularly, the entire section on prions and how it is that we retain memories at all in an ever-changing brain was my favorite.However, I will say that I was reading this, Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain and You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself all at the same time and it it took me a bit to remember which book talked about what neurocognitive study because there was a HUGE amount of overlap! Lehrer and Sacks cite the same studies, and McRaney references both Lehrer's work and Sacks, so it was a mind-boggling amount of science and art combined.I will forewarn it's a slow read because each chapter challenges you to think about your own experiences and perceptions, as well as the complexity that is art and the human mind. It's a fun intellectual conundrum!"
34,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/931498-jessica,5,"I really loved this book. Then again, I am a geek. Anyone who is a dedicated RadioLab listener will recognize many of the stories of neuroscience that Lehrer tells, as several have been featured on that program, as has Lehrer. And actually, as a reader, this is a good thing. It's kind of like when you'd hit a new topic in a class in school and you'd already had some experience with that topic from somewhere else, so you didn't have to start from ground zero. And with tough content, that's helpful. It was like that. RadioLab was the preview, and the book took me deeper. And, most interestingly, the book connects the neuroscience with the work of related artists. For me, the science geek, that added a new dimension and depth, learning about science and art at the same time.But the part that made me really love this book was the Coda at the end. As someone whose recent work has been in an arena called ""public engagement with science"" and ""public understanding of science,"" and who is becoming familiar with pros and cons of the current set-up and conventions of this world, I think Lehrer's arguments about what is missing in society in this area is right on the money. And he says it so much more articulately than I could. I want to make copies of it and pass it around at every science education conference I go to from now on (you know, if that weren't a blatant violation of copyright law, of course).Note: ""Read"" as an audiobook. (I'm doing a lot of road trips these days.) Actually, it was well-suited to audio, since it was similar to RadioLab in so many ways (my usual road trip fare). Perhaps not the best way to commit all of the details of neuroscience to memory, but an engaging way to keep one's brain active on the Pennsylvania Turnpike."
35,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42572371-prima-seadiva,1,"Audio version. Reader so so. To me the book was not well written and incredibly dull. The author alternating lists of scientific facts I didn't remember 5 seconds later (usually I can at least manage 10), applying neuroscience theories to past events then stating (to me at least) the most obvious notion that artists,writers and cooks access the non-logical sides of their brains in their art before scientists knew. Since I did not finish I never did find out why the author thought Proust was a neuroscientist and the impact of other artists but I found I didn't care. I would guess the famous description of the power of memory via madeleine and tea. Most people know from experience that a smell, taste or sound can stimulate an intense memory such as Proust describes. We just can't turn it into classic literature or parse it into neuroscience data. So much science and writing about science today seems to try to be philosophy but ends up seeming bit self aggrandizing. Perhaps because we live in a society that worships science as reality and as a god, to make the artistic process ""real"" it has to be quantified with facts and formulas. I'm not adverse to scientific investigation but so much of it seems pointless. I just could not plow through to the end. One disadvantage of audio books is it is more difficult to browse sections.I did not know about the author's background and the plagiarism issues in his other writing until after putting this book aside. "
36,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7276011-shelley,3,"That artists frequently have insights which scientists later verify is no groundbreaking idea. Some of the case studies in this book, i.e. the chapter on George Eliot (including an unforgivably bad misreading of Lydgate's story, a veritable half of the main plot of Middlemarch), are rather silly. Others, the chapters on Proust and prions, or the search for umami, or the workings of the visual and auditory cortices as revealed by the works of Cezanne and Stravinsky, are rather interesting and compelling.I do think it is harder to make a case for writers, not because they do not have brilliant insights, but quite the converse: anyone who makes the study of the human condition a vocation will necessarily include psychology at some point in their writing exercise. However, they are ""cases"" and ""case series"" at best, the fruits of an invalid lying in bed doing nothing but thinking about his memories: magnificent as those fruits are, they but reveal the inner working of one being. It is very fortunate that Proust's experience of memory is so universal and relatable by all of us one hundred years later, enjoying a type of hustle-bustle that he has not dreamt of. However, it is the job of science to make sure that Proust's revelations has external validity, so to speak. Happily, the prion hypothesis is fantastically persuasive and intriguing."
37,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/292668-jane,4,"This book says a lot of fascinating things, but I can't escape the feeling that it is watered down science and simplified literary criticism. All in all, it is a good read with plenty of thought-provoking topics condensed into eight chapters. Not too challenging of a read, but it points to and references works that are more challenging and sheds some light on the ridiculousness of the ""cultural divide"" between sciences and humanities. The problem with this book,is that it assumes the popular take-away message about C.P. Snow's article. But an actual reading of that article reveals a different attitude: one of the role of science in industrialization and nuclear proliferation and the increasingly marginalized role of art/humanities in the world. C.P. Snow mostly bemoans the fact that ""soft"" humanists could not recite the second law of thermodynamics if you asked them to. Lehrer largely ignores this, as most of us who have heard of C.P. Snow do. He does make some beautiful points, however, and I am sure his call to arms for a ""fourth culture"" will not fall on deaf ears. I certainly felt inspired by this book, and by anyone who can explain Heisenberg's uncertainty principle as eloquently as he can explain Virginia Woolf's ""To the Lighthouse."" Take that, C.P. Snow!"

There is no authority beyond the reach of critcism."" Karl PopperThe overall theme is that art and science need each other to form the most complete picture. Although I enjoyed the whole book, but I really identified with Chapter 3: Escoffier. The writing was so well done that my mouth watered at the mere description of the way in which Esoffier took painstaking detail, time, and effort to create the perfect taste experience--or perhaps I was just hungry. :) His methodology was compared with the scientific creation of MSG and how both came to the same conclusion, but in very different ways. If you like to read about psychology and art, this is a must read. Grow from it, I know I did and I certainly left with a greater appreciation for all disciplines."
39,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7302401-sheri,3,"Although Lehrer sets up the argument that the arts are important investigations akin to scientific investigation, he doesn't really back up his thesis statement in the text itself. Mostly this book is his love letter to particular artists. He tends to focus on one artist per artistic discipline, and in focusing on that one artist's contributions he sets up that artist against all of art history prior to him or her. The result is that we get the sense not that art is an ongoing investigation, but that there have been a handful of artists with unusual insights into human perception. If you are looking to read critical analysis of art from a scientific perspective, this is the book for you. If you want to learn about how science and art can learn from one another and are both important to humanity's quest to understand ourselves, read Margaret Livingstone's Vision and Art: The Biology of Seeing."

Reading the chapter on Walt Whitman ""The Substance of Feeling"" (""we do not have a body, we ARE a body"") is something I will read again and again for its insightful and literary thinking. In the chapter on Proust, the questions are ""What sort of truth did Proust discover?"" or ""Why is the act of remembering a labor in vain?"" If art and science are mysteries to you, this is the book that will bridge the mysteries in a vivid way.

I have been probing the roots of depression, both on personal and cultural levels, and I appreciated the historical context brought to several artists I admire (Walt Whitman, Virginia Woolf) as well as the insight and attention raised on ones I didn't appreciate enough (George Eliot, Stravinsky), some of whom also have struggled with the the suffocation of melancholy. I found as I read this that sections of it would occur to me in my daily life, for example as I moved to change a song that I didn't recognize but then stayed my hand and listened to the novelty, just for its ability to ""shake me up."" I celebrate Lehrer's call for a ""fourth culture,"" since the third one has failed us in its hoped-for (and dearly needed) bridge building between the sciences and the humanities. Certainly my own experience has shown that without both, I am often deeply and almost irretrievably lost. "

Some of the vignettes were exceptionally incisive in their commentary, some of them not so much. Two things you could be sure of: they'd be written as if they were the cleverest things put to paper and there'd be a chunk of scientific jargon that i wouldn't understand after the part that made some sense.Personally, I found the Stravinski piece the most interesting, but that might be because I have some grasp of the technical aspect of music and its affects on the listener, having read about it in the past. The book also made me want to read Gertrude Stein and give Proust another chance, so there's that. All in all, it was something I'm glad to have read, which is saying something. "
43,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4960360-rae,4,"In this collection of artists and scientific explorations, Lehrer attempts to show how art can explain what science cannot. Cezanne painted swatches of color that show how our eyes really do see - not as pixels but as swatches. Virginia Wolfe knew the mind was a fragmented collection of sensations held together by a self that arose from that and science has still not been able to find if there is a where for that greater self.Very enjoyable book and unlike How We Decide, not filled with scientific stories that I had already heard. Made me much more interested in some of the classic writers and artists of our day. Although I probably won't read Gertrude Stein, I have a greater appreciation for George Elliot, Virginia Wolfe, Cezanne, and many others in that when/if I ever read/see/hear them, I will have a new perspective to enjoy them from."
44,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1858836-heather,5,"This book was fascinating in that two of my passions are neuroscience and art, the topics studied in Jonah Lehrer's writing and the main reason that I chose this book. It focused mostly on authors, painters, a chef and a musician whose perspectives on the mind far preceded their time and were ahead of the ongoing studies and findings of neuroscience in general. For example, Virginia Woolf's thoughts were somewhat progressive for her era. They came primarily from her own experiences and the endless thoughts on which she ruminated while she was confined in a mental hospital. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in either neuroscience, art, or both. They can actually be intertwined when one dissects the compositions of these artists with the constantly emerging discoveries in neuroscience."

Initially I was not sure where it was going but once I gave into the process of integrating science and the arts and their relationship to each other set in an unusual context and with an unusual but excited writer who is passionate about his beliefs and observations of writers and scientists. Proust,Thoreau,virginia Wolf, Escoffier are just a few of the artists that reveal visionary insight into the science of today. I am reading it for a second time...much to learn.

Lehrer's writing style captures the essence of a classically poignant author while describing the intricacies of brain science. Each chapter is a sociological reflection and excellent introduction to bring those in the mainstream a closer look at how our actions parallel our internal intrinsic processes.While Lehrer's book is being judged somewhat harshly by the hard-science crowd, it's an excellent bang to what will be a long-lasting career for this author. This book is most noteworthy because it acts as integrative cross-over literature suitable for anyone interested in the blending of both artes liberales and science. "

What genius perceived by insight and intuition, today neuroscience proved to be true. Proust understood how our memory worked, Cézanne created a new way of paintings to change our perception of a human sight, Stravinsky changed the concept of a sound and Virginia Woolf tried to understand the construction of our self as a process. Auguste Escoffier, famous chef, created the modern ""French cuisine"" based on the veal stock and brought the idea of ""umami"" or the fifth taste into life. Many great minds intuited what modern science can prove by experiment today. The author shows that art understands life on multiple levels and science often rediscovers what artists knew and expressed through their vision. "

So, Whitman's sense that the mind depends upon the flesh turns out to be quite accurate, as does Proust's belief that memories are of our ""invention"". Enjoyed this book. The science was good, but most of all I appreciated getting reacquainted with Whitman and Eliot, not to mention Proust (whom I will never read, but wonder at), and Woolf (whom I have always disliked, but am softened to somewhat, after reading the chapter on her), and Stein. The science part of the chapter on Cezanne made my eyes glaze over, but over all, an engaging read for anyone interested in the convergence of art and science."

It raised some interesting epistemic questions across the humanities' vs. science's ability to uncover truth, between science's reductionist limits and art's difficulty confirming its own hypotheses. The thesis I found convincing was not that art ""discovered an essential truth about the mind that neuroscience is only now rediscovering"" (from the blurb), but rather that we need both the humanities and science to reach a more cohesive understanding of the human experience."

One could argues that everybody knows Darwin said that, but one would be wrong.

65,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1275149-cheryl,4," There is endless debate about the function and importance of art, and for each of the eight artists that are in this book, there are hundreds if not thousands whose work is not as meaningful. Those in this book are brilliantly illuminated by the author and confirm the need of art in our lives, and the magic of their ability to discover and say truth in a new and unique way. What I loved most was the explanations of why these works of art were so groundbreaking in their day. The author combines neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, and chemistry in beautiful ways to explain why a piece of art can affect you from your brain to your toes. You can tell me endlessly that Stravinksy’s Rite of Spring caused riots when it debuted, but I have grown up listening to it distilled for Disney’s Fantasia, so I can’t visualize it. The author’s genius lies in the fact that he can explain the pathways of hearing and interpretation of music and show how people were physically disturbed by the dissonance of a symphony. It was painful and it hurt! The author is able to draw from his background in a neuroscience to dissect our brains and the pathways and plasticity that makes it so versatile and alive.  Walt Whitman introduced free verse in poetry, as well as his idea of the fusion of body and soul. “We do not have a body, we are a body.” Our body and emotions are intertwined and of each other; the body causes emotions and emotions cause bodily reactions and sensations. This was a strange idea in his time, the mid 1800’s, as well as the backlash against what was considered his “pornographic” celebration of sex and the flesh. As many Eastern religions preconfigured neuroscience’s discovery that the body is truly electric, so did Whitman. The skin conducts electricity which can signal anxiety or calm, or even more delicious, the maxim to ‘go with your gut’ is proved to be sound advice as your body can give you signals and signs that make rational decisions. In a study of patients with brain damage, with damage to their emotional centers, they made irrational and chaotic decisions. Without emotions, we are chaos. I fight against the cynicism and bleakness of our day where some of us are told we feel too much, need to protect ourselves and not let emotions dictate our actions. I believe it can be taken too far, I don’t let them dictate, but I do know the fullest and richest decisions and times in my life were made in the spirit of listening to my gut or heart or how peaceful a decision made me. There is that delicious chemistry between people that falls into this category as well, and the electricity of skin on skin was something Whitman knew of intimately. A Taoist equivalent:“Situations produce vibrations. Negative, potentially harmful situations emit slow vibrations. Positive, potentially life-enhancing situations emit quick vibrations. As these vibrations impact on your energy field they produce either resonance or dissonance in your lower and middle tantiens (psychic power stations) depending on your own vibratory rate at the time. When you psychic field force is strong and your vibratory rate is fast, therefore, you will draw only positive situations to you. When you mind is quiet enough and your attention is on the moment, you will literally hear the dissonance in your belly and chest like an alarm bell going off, urging you from deep within your body to move in such and such a direction. Always follow it. At times these urges may come to you in the form of internally spoken dialogue with your higher self, spirit guide, guardian angel, alien intelligence, however you see the owner of the “still, small voice within.” This form of dialogue can be entertaining and reassuring but is best not overindulged in as, in the extreme; it tends to lead to the loony bin. At times you may receive your messages from “Indian signs”, such as slogans on passing trucks or cloud formations in the sky. This is also best kept in moderation, to avoid seeing signs in everything and becoming terribly confused. Just let it happen when it happens and don’t try looking for it.” ― Stephen Russell, Barefoot Doctor's Guide to the Tao: A Spiritual Handbook for the Urban Warrior George Eliot’s genius lies in her skill to write about the human ability to change whether in beliefs, or characters, or thoughts. At the time, evolution was being developed and there was a strong belief that the brain could not regenerate itself, that we were born with a complete “machine.” She rejected the view of positivism that life was a fixed and ordered process without free will; that physics could be the ultimate theory and explain it all. She wrote of characters that were based on real people such as a love that rejected her since he wasn’t attracted to her, which he believed was based in biology and could not be swayed from that viewpoint. It wasn’t until 1989 that researchers were able to prove that the brain is plastic, that we can regenerate neurons and develop new pathways. The discovery of DNA and gene translation with junk DNA (DNA without specific purpose) found that “retro transposons- junk genes that randomly jump around the human genome- are present at unusually high numbers in neurons. In fact, these troublemaking scarps of DNA insert themselves into almost 80% of our brain cells, arbitrarily altering their genetic program…. The scientists realized that all these genetic interruptions created a population of perfectly unique minds, since each brain reacted to the junk DNA in its own way. In other words, chaos creates individuality…. All this mental anarchy is adaptive, as it allows our genes to generate minds of almost infinite diversity.” My brain is unique to me in the infinitely diverse world. It makes me laugh to finally understand why it is sometimes so hard to understand those that walk alongside me every day. I don’t think it promotes loneliness to think of our brains like this, there are usually enough kindred souls in a forest or a bar to communicate with.  Proust wrote gorgeous long intricate sentences that last hours about memory, and how it can be edited and changed over time by our subconscious, which is proved later on, after Freud breaks open all these memories of women who were abused or molested in order to explain their hysteria, which is then cyclically shown to be false memories. He predicts the science that found that only smell and taste are connected to our long term memory centers. The discovery of neurons and the spaces between them led to a discovery of the synapses where chemicals like dopamine bring messages. The brain has constant electricity circulating. “What Joseph Conrad said about maps is also true of the brain: the most interesting places are the empty spaces, for they are what will change.” I love the imagery of how the brain works, of the different areas illuminated with each thought and memory, and how each thought and memory can light up new areas or make new associations. For example, my memory of the day I brought my puppy home doesn’t just light up my long term memory of a particular day in a particular year, but also the areas for love and happiness and laughter. I am still trying to make my way through his 1 and ¼ million words that make up In Search of Lost Time. Sometimes it is enough to get lost in his sentences for a while, even as I can’t seem to retain the plot.   Cezanne was a brilliant artist who tried to break down seeing into parts, to stimulate the brain to make connections by filling in the blanks. Annie Dillard writes of a similar thing, the struggle to interpret sight by the newly sighted: “I chanced on a wonderful book by Marius von Senden, called Space and Sight. . . . For the newly sighted, vision is pure sensation unencumbered by meaning: ""The girl went through the experience that we all go through and forget, the moment we are born. She saw, but it did not mean anything but a lot of different kinds of brightness."" . . . In general the newly sighted see the world as a dazzle of color-patches. They are pleased by the sensation of color, and learn quickly to name the colors, but the rest of seeing is tormentingly difficult. . . . The mental effort involved . . . proves overwhelming for many patients. It oppresses them to realize, if they ever do at all, the tremendous size of the world, which they had previously conceived of as something touchingly manageable. . . . A disheartening number of them refuse to use their new vision, continuing to go over objects with their tongues, and lapsing into apathy and despair. . . . On the other hand, many newly sighted people speak well of the world, and teach us how dull is our own vision.” Cezanne did the same thing for us, just as I had an epiphany once about impressionism; without my glasses, I see the world as a fuzzy Monet. Cezanne went a step further and painted canvases that had obvious spaces, and obvious holes or missing parts and allowed our brain to fill in the rest. A patient with a lesion in his brain separating his visual cortex from the rest of his interpretative brain saw reality as it was, “labyrinths of light and masses of color.” He could not make the connections, and could not describe a picture as a whole; for example, he could pick out some shapes and colors on a Nat Geo photo, but could not say it was a landscape.  Regarding music, the author writes, “music is a pleasurable overflow of information. Whenever a noise exceeds our processing abilities- we can’t decipher all the sounds hitting our hair cells in the ear- the mind surrenders. It stops trying to understand the individual notes and seeks instead to understand the relationship between the notes….but before a pattern can be desired by the brain, the pattern must play hard to get. Music only excites us when it makes the auditory cortex struggle to uncover its order. If the music is too obvious, if its patterns are always present, it is annoyingly boring.” It also is why listening to classical music and new genres of music helps to sophisticate the music palate, and now explains why certain terrible pop songs hurts me like Stravinsky’s innovation hurt concertgoers long ago in Paris. He created a work of dissonance, where chords played together frustrated the brain which couldn’t listen to both at the same time and couldn’t make the connections. He merged sounds together that had never been merged together, and never let them fade or end in a pretty tonal resolution. “The emotions generated by musical tension…throb throughout the body. As soon as the orchestra starts to play, the flesh undergoes a range of changes. The pupils dilate, pulse and blood pressure rise, the electrical conductance of the skin lowers, and the cerebellum (movement center) becomes unusually active. Blood is even redirected to the leg muscles. (As a result, we begin tapping out feet in time with the beat.) Sound stirs us at our biological roots.” Stravinsky also knew people would be able to learn to appreciate his music; he in a sense erased the brain’s pattern making machinery and once cleared, forced the listeners to listen harder, more deeply and follow the patterns he was making, and eventually we have Disney’s Fantasia. I am listening to portions of it now (Rite of Spring) and it sounds complex and like a horror movie theme a bit, but I like it. It is true then, that even the bizarre can become commonplace.  My best example in music comes from Jane Siberry’s Love is Everything. At first, nothing seems melodic, she seems off key against some quiet guitar chords, and her voice is reedy and thin. My sister hated the song when I first played it for her, and she even played it for other people who agreed with her. At first, listening, it did sound unusual, atonal, off in some way I couldn’t discern. Eventually, it became absolutely lovely and different than any other music. I missed that feeling of strangeness and exoticism, and it can be hard to find. I love to sing along with songs, which probably makes my listening experience different than the people who do not sing, but love love love when I find a song that challenges my ability to sing to it. It is like I need to figure out a new way to sing, new notes and chords and emotions. An example is a Colorado group Paper Bird who has 3 female lead singers who harmonize; one of their songs (Lost Boys) has a complicated 3 part harmony, and I heard myself off key over and over, but with practice, I was able to somehow synchronize my voice. The complexity challenged my brain and made the song even more linked to my emotions. Now it is easy, and familiar, although if I haven’t heard it in a while, I screech through the first round and have to repeat at least once. This makes me want to try to absorb even more innovations in music, even as I admit to a reluctance when it sounds like noise, and I hate it.  “From the three minute pop songs to the five-hour Wagner opera, the creations of our culture teach us to expect certain musical patterns, which over time are wired into our brain…Once we learn these simple patterns, we become exquisitely sensitive to their variations… Music works by subtly toying with our expected associations, enticing us to make predictions, then confronting us with our prediction errors. In fact, the brainstem contains a network of neurons that responds only to surprising sounds. When the musical pattern we know is violated, these cells begin the neural process that ends with the release of dopamine, also the chemical source of our most intense emotions, which helps to explain the strange emotional power of music, especially when it confronts us with newness and dissonance.”Other little gems: Gertrude Stein combined language in ways that were nonsensical and extremely difficult to interpret, again challenging the brain to think about the structure of language and how it seems hard wired into us somehow. Yes we have to learn grammatical rules, but if you watch the progression of language in children, they figure it out on their own. They mimic at first, and then just name things, and then make senteneces of 2 words, gradually adding complexity before they even get to the English class at school. With Stein, she is so obscure and impossible to read, but again, reading her will develop some new pathways in your brain! “A kind in glass and a cousin, a spectacle and nothing strange in a single hurt color and an arrangement in a system to pointing. All this and not ordinary, not unordered in not resembling.” For example. It does make you want to play with language, though. Even when I try to think in non-grammatical ways, I fail. One of her influences was William James who said, “We ought to say a feeling of and, a feeling of if,a feeling of but, and a feeling of by, quite as readily as we say a feeling of blue, or a feeling of cold.” From Gertie: “red roses are a pink cut pink, a collapse and sold hole, a little less hot.” I think reading some of her sentences makes me appreciate more abstract poetry also.  Virginia Woolf decided to write about “only thoughts and feelings, no cups and tables.” This is so prevalent nowadays, the “mind’s interiors” laid bare, but Woolf was the first to be able to write an entire novel about a day in the life of an ordinary woman. “The mind receives a myriad of impressions. From all sides they come, an incessant shower of innumerable atoms; and as they fall, they shape themselves into the life of Monday or Tuesday…let us record the atoms as they fall upon the mind in the order which they fall, let us trace the pattern, however disconnected and incoherent in appearance, which each sigh or incident scores upon the consciousness.”"

67,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22994712-katrina-sark,2,"Not as good as ""How We Decide,"" but a few interesting points: Preludep.vii – I began to see a surprising convergence. The novelist had predicated my experiments. Proust and neuroscience shared a vision of how our memory works. If you listened closely, they were actually saying the same thing. This book is about artists who anticipated the discoveries of neuro-science. It is about writers and painters and composers who discovered truths about the human mind – real, tangible truths – that science is only now rediscovering. p.ix – We now know that Proust was right about memory, Cézanne was uncannily accurate about the visual cortex, Stein anticipated Chomsky, and Woolf pierced the mystery of consciousness; modern neuroscience has confirmed these artistic intuitions. p.x – Every brilliant experiment, like every great work of art, starts with an act of imagination. Chapter 1 –Walt Whitman, The Substance of Feelingp.1 – “The poet writes the history of his own body.” (Henry David Thoreau) Whitman’s revelation, which he had for the first time at a New Orleans slave auction, was that body and mind are inseparable. To whip a man’s body was to whip a man’s soul. Whitman’s fusion of body and soul was a revolutionary idea, as radical in concept as his free-verse form. At the time, scientists believed that ur feelings came from the brain and that the body was just a lump of inert matter. p.2 – so the poet turned himself into an empiricist, a lyricist of his own experience. Emotions are generated by the body. Ephemeral as they seem, our feelings are actually rooted in the movements of out muscles and palpitations of out insides. p.3 – The story of the brain’s separation from the body begins with René Descartes. The most influential philosopher of the seventeenth century, Descartes divided being into two distinct substances: a holy soul and a mortal carcass. The soul was the source of reason, science, and everything nice. In Whitman’s own time, the Cartesian impulse to worship the brain and ignore the body gave rise to the new “science” of phrenology. p.5 – Without Emerson’s mysticism, it is hard to imagine Whitman’s poetry. “I was simmering, simmering, simmering.” Whitman once said, “and Emerson brought me to a boil.” p.8 – It was during these difficult years when Whitman was an unemployed reporter that he first began writing fragments of poetry, scribbling sown quatrains and rhythms in his cheap notebooks. With no audience but himself, Whitman was free to experiment. While every other poet was still counting syllables, Whitman was writing lines that were messy montages of present participles, body parts, and erotic metaphors. p.9 – At the time, Whitman was an anonymous poet and Emerson a famous philosopher. His letter to Whitman is one of the most generous pieces of praise in the history of American literature. “Dear Sir,” Emerson began, “I greet you at the beginning of a great career.” p.19 – Modern neuroscience is now discovering the anatomy underlying Whitman’s poetry. It has taken his poetic hypothesis – the idea that feelings begin in the flesh – and found the exact nerve and brain regions that make it true. How does the brain generate our metaphysical feelings from the physical body? According to Damasio, after an “emotive stimulus” (such as a bear) is seen, the brain automatically triggers a wave of changes in the “physical viscera,” as the body prepares for action. The heart begins to pound, arteries dilate, the intestines contract, and adrenaline pours into the bloodstream. These bodily changes are then detected by the cortex, which connects them to the scary sensation that cause the changes in the first place. The resulting mental image – an emulsion of thought and flesh, body and soul – is what we feel. p.22 – The moral of Whitman’s verse was that the body wasn’t merely a body. Just as leaves of grass grow out of the dirt, feelings grow out of the flesh. What Whitman wanted to show was how these two different substances – the grass and the dirt, the body and the mind – were actually inseparable. You couldn’t write poems about one without acknowledging the presence of the other. Chapter 2 – George Eliot, The Biology of Freedomp.38 – If science could see freedom, what would it look like? If it wanted to find the will, where would it search? Eliot believed that the mind’s ability to alter itself was the source of our freedom. p.42 – The hippocampus, the part of the brain that modulates learning and memory, is continually supplied with new neurons, which help us to learn and remember new ideas and behaviors. Chapter 3 – Auguste Escoffier, The Essence of Tastep.60 – Embarrassed food manufacturers often hide the addition of MSG by calling it autolyzed yeast extract on their labels (other pseudonyms for MSG include glutavene, calcium caseinate, andsodium caseinate). p.69 – In 2001, Frederic Brochet, of the University of Bordeaux, conducted two separate and very mischievous experiments. In the first test, Brochet invited fifty-seven wine experts and asked them to give their impressions of what looked like two glasses of red and white wine. The wines were actually the same white wine, one of which had been tinted red with food coloring. But that didn’t stop the experts from describing the “red” wine in language typically used to describe red wines. One expert praised its “jamminess,” while another enjoyed its “crushed red fruit.” Not a single one noticed it was actually a white wine. The second test Brochet conducted was even more damning. He took a middling Bordeaux and served it in two different bottles. One bottle was labeled as a fancy Grand Cru. The other bottle was labeled as an ordinary vin du table. Despite the fact that they were served the exact same wine, the experts gave the differently labeled bottles nearly opposite ratings. The Grand Cru was “agreeable, woody, complex, balanced, and rounded,” while the vin du table was “weak, short, light, flat, and faulty.” Forty experts said the wine with the fancy label was worth drinking, while only twelve said the cheap wine was. p.70 – What these wine experiments illuminate is the omnipresence of subjectivity. When we take a sip of wine, we don’t taste the wine first and the cheapness or redness second. We taste everything all at once, in a single gulp. Our human brain has been designed to believe itself, wired so that prejudices feel like facts, opinions are indistinguishable from the actual sensation. If we think a wine is cheap, it will taste cheap. And if we think we are tasting a Grand Cru, then we will taste a Grand Cru. Our senses are vague in their instructions, and we parse their suggestions based on whatever other knowledge we can summon to the surface. As Brochet himself noted, our expectations of what the wine will taste like “can be much more powerful in determining how you taste a wine than the actual physical qualities of the wine itself.” Chapter 4 – Marcel Proust, The Method of Memoryp.80 – Neuroscience now knows that Proust was right. Rachel Herz, a psychologist at Brown, has shown – in a science paper wittily entitled “Testing the Proustian Hypothesis” – that our senses of smell and taste are uniquely sentimental. This is because smell and taste are the only senses that connect directly to the hippocampus, the center of the brain’s long-term memory. Their mark is indelible. All our senses (sigh, touch, and hearing) are first processed by the thalamus, the source of language and the front door to consciousness. As a result, these senses are much less efficient at summoning up our past. p.81 – An honest chronicler of his own brain, Proust embraced such strange associations precisely because he couldn’t explain them. He understood that idiosyncrasy was the essence of personality. Only by meticulously retracing the loom of our neural connections – however nonsensical those connections may be – can we understand ourselves, for we are our loom. Proust gleaned all of this wisdom form an afternoon tea. p.82 – Simply put, he believed that our recollection were phony. Although they felt real, they were actually elaborate fabrications. Take the madeleine. Proust realized that the moment we finish eating the cookie, leaving behind a collection of crumbs on a porcelain plate, we begin warping the memory of the cookie to fit our own personal narrative. We bend the facts to suit our story, as “our intelligence reworks the experience.” Proust warns us to treat the reality of our memories carefully, and with a degree of scepticism. Chapter 5 – Paul Cézanne, The Process of Sightp.97 – Reality, is not out there waiting to be witnessed; reality is made by the mind.p.99 – The story of abstract painting begins with the photograph, which literally means “light writing.” "
68,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5474373-tokreads,3,"The book Proust was a neuroscientist by Jonah Lehrer allowed a comprehensive insight into what he describes as the “4th culture” – a merging of the natural sciences and the arts. Lehrer explores various artist’s works, from the cook to the painter, musician and writer and their early discoveries of the complex workings of the brain. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the book lies in the connections that Lehrer draws between these works of artists and the history behind the neuroscience, which they explored (whether consciously or unconsciously) to a rather distinctive degree. Hence, the focus is on the often-diminished ‘scientific credibility’ of art. Rather than seeing the work as entertainment only, Lehrer comprehensively describes the aim of the artists in exposing new discoveries to how the senses function, to what extent a ‘self’ can be discovered, how memories are formed and retrieved and several more crucial aspects of neuroscience.Lehrer breaks down the book into a prelude, followed by eight chapters, each one focusing on a specific artist, and a coda. The prelude outlines the major points of connecting natural science and art as mentioned before: ‘What science forgets is that this isn’t how we experience the world’. He follows this initial thesis throughout the book. At times, the countless repetition of (almost) precisely these words could make it somewhat monotonous, though I thought it was quite a wonderful way of reminding the reader what exactly we are looking for in these works – the connection between the scientific explanation of the world and the way we actually experience our environment!The chapters follow in chronological order, beginning with the writer Walt Whitman and his discoveries concerning the link between the material body and the mental experiences of a soul. This chapter was interesting in the simple sense that it was an introduction into Lehrer’s writing. He uses many rhetorical questions, which he follows up with explanations, either immediately or after a little discourse. It might be a subconscious pleasantness throughout but it would be rude not to mention his own writing style. Varied vocabulary, both for the scientist and the student, wordplays and stylistic elements such as alliteration or similes add to the whole. Back to Whitman…Whitman’s conviction that ‘body and mind are inseparable’ struck me as a basic observation. It was interesting to follow his own journey through revelations. From working at the camp sites of the soldiers during the Civil War to his old age at which he declared: ‘the only answer is that there is no answer’. ‘Stop thinking of the scientific theories as mirror of nature’, was one of his opinions on science. Though an interesting observation for the time of the scientific revolution, I thought his thoughts on poets even more inspiring: ‘Science and religion might see the body in terms of its shameful parts, but the poet, lover of the whole, knows that the human body and soul must remain an entirety.’ A thought that occurred to me towards the end of the chapter addressed his stance on phantom limbs. If the body and the soul are bound together in their entirety, then why would one not loose part of the soul when one looses part of one’s body? Just a thought…The chapter on George Elliot caused a great deal of thought on the subject of free will but also on the subject of a great respected female writer of her time. Lehrer portrays George Elliot, Maryann Evans, Marian Evans, Mary Ann Cross, whatever name you choose, as the strong woman, the independent woman, the revolutionary of her time, always a step ahead. I guess, as a woman, it makes it all the more interesting to hear that she managed to explain, before science had the means to do so, neuroplasticity. It might be her ebullient personality that allowed her to see more potential in the brain than what it was given credit for. Most interesting for me, was the discussion on free will and her personal relation to the experience of this phenomenon. It was intriguing to read about her observation of herself. The way in which she took a step backwards and gained a more objective view of her mind than what would otherwise have been possible.The chapter on Auguste Escoffier was perhaps the most interesting one for me. The ingenious discovery of a taste bud for protein as part of his art, the creation of hot dinners and a fine dining culture in France does not just seem like quite the big feat, but like the ultimate goal of a designer: to combine the arts and the science to a medium in-between that is useful to us in our everyday life! Umami today, broth back then – his creation offered an insight into the world of the olfactory senses we are only gaining today in neuroscience. It is therefore a wonderful opportunity to read about both sides, parallel in Lehrer’s book. He chooses clever examples and several studies to support his own as well as Escoffier’s own thesis on food: we love umami and we eat with our nose!Marcel Proust – the one person, who’s name got to land on the cover of the book. Personally, I am not quite convinced that his insight was the most profound or the most revolutionary. Still, it is fair to say that his observation of the Madeleine came a long way! ‘He wanted to show how his current condition distorted his sense of the past’. This insight on memory alongside other statements such as ‘ If you prevent the memory from changing, it ceases to exist’ allows us to grasp a little of what Proust was getting at: that our memory is not a picture, just as science is not a mirror! Again, Lehrer made Proust’s discoveries much more interesting by informing the reader about the current developments on the understanding of memory. He rounds up the discussion on prions with: ‘ Every time we conjure up our pasts, the branches of our recollections become malleable again’As an artist, it was fascinating to read about Cezanne’s discoveries regarding our vision. Lehrer explores the cultural circumstances in which Cezanne developed his unique painting style, exposing critical misconceptions on our vision. The camera, a major new invention at the time, is described as being a liar: ‘Because the reality did not consist of static images’ the camera can never really reflect reality. Cezanne was far more interested in what we do not see, what our eyes miss or our brain fails to process. The most interesting aspect of the examples given by Lehrer was the aspect of unfinished lines and shapes that we manage to complete into one comprehensive picture! The chapter on Igor Stravinsky explored the same aspects of misconception of the auditory cortex of our brain that Cezanne had done for sight. Again, Lehrer introduces various studies to help understand how flexible our brain can be. The most prominent point might be that we can change our preference for certain notes or intervals with enough training and exposure!Gertrude Stein was perhaps the most stunning persona I encountered in Lehrer’s book. Her personality, her relationships, her influence – she was a lady of great impact in her time as today. Then, the people might have failed to acknowledge her revolutionary thoughts on grammar but, still, she was respected by all her fellow artists (and credited as mentor after all). The most interesting point was her failed attempt to prove that words are merely words: ‘ Because words are always interconnected by syntax, they can never say nothing.’ Surprisingly, on a hunt for a Stein poem on the internet, I came across one that I thought utterly beautiful, even though her aim might have been to dispose of all connotations and images related to the words used.The final chapter dealt with Virginia Woolf and her insight on the ‘emergent self’ – the source of an identity, which can (as Lehrer concludes) never really be located in our brain. Her observations of her own flow of thoughts allowed her to write as we think. Again, I admire the combining of immediate thought and art, the inevitable reality and the timelessness of the end product. Also, Lehrer gives a wonderful description in support of his thesis that science cannot describe reality fully: ‘Your head contains a hundred billion electrical cells, but not one of them is you or knows you or cares about you. In fact, you don’t even exist. The brain is nothing but an infinite regress of matter, reducible to the callous laws of physics.’To conclude, I should say that I greatly enjoyed reading Proust was a neuroscientist. Jonah Lehrer did a wonderful job of merging the works of some of the most wonderful artists of the last century and the newest discoveries in neuroscience. It shows us again and again: Existence is a miracle!Julia A."
69,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11424703-chad,4,"A beautiful book that seeks to create a space for science and the humanities to meet. Lehrer selects a handful of artists and writers from the 19th and 20th centuries that through their own insight into human nature were able to intuit scientific facts years before they were discovered. To summarize,Walt Whitman's poetry show how our body and mind are a unity, not separate entities. George Eliot's novels show how we are not a biological clock, but a cloud; the randomness in the system leave room for freedom.Auguste Escoffier's recipes anticipated the fifth taste, umami.Marcel Proust's semi-autobiographical novels illustrate how memory isn't linear and pretty random.Paul Cezanne's art shows how our mind stores visual information not as a whole, but as strokes and angles.Igor Stravinsky's music shows how music is defined by its tension rather than its harmony.Gertrude Stein showed how language can't be completely divorced from its meaning.Virginia Woolf's books show how our minds are a few fragile shards held together by an imagined self.I appreciated the author's understanding of both science and art. Similar to another book I read recently, ""The Emperor of Maladies"", Lehrer is able to craft a story from scientific discovery. However, also similar to a book I read, ""Sapiens"", I think Lehrer is tinged with a bit of academic hubris. It comes out in passages like these:Of course, the one thing neuroscience cannot find is the loom of cells that creates the self. If neuroscience knows anything, it is that there is no ghost in the machine: there is only the vibration of the machinery. Your head contains a hundred billion electrical cells, but not one of them is you or knows you or cares about you. In fact, you don't even exist. The brain is nothing but an infinite regress of matter, reducible to the callous laws of physics.I would also remark that Proust really wasn't a neuroscientist. The author had to do a lot of interpretation to connect the dots. Lehrer's choice to focus on postmodernists is fine and dandy, but postmodernists also seem depressing. You can write a book about how St. Augustine was a neuroscientist, or Chesterton, Lewis. Or Beethoven. In his chapter on Stravinsky, Lehrer made Beethoven out to be too mainstream. But Beethoven was pushing the boundaries of music in his day, even if he didn't embrace dissonance. Lehrer ends with this thought: ""We now know enough to know that we will never know everything. That is why we need art: it teaches us how to live with mystery.""I would agree. But even more so, I would agree with Abram Hershel that religion supercedes art in teaching man how to live with mystery."

I cannot imagine that I came upon it, let alone bought it, from random perusal. Who told me to read this?As for the review, I found it an interesting read. The central theme is that artists in visual, musical, and literary media have a more accurate sense of cognition. By 'cognition,' I mean thought processes in the broadest sense. I have long believed all perception and understanding is an interplay of sensory input and subsequent re-creation. That is, all of our awareness is a product of neural interplay involving different parts of the brain. Each person creates their own universe in this way. The author argues that 'science' dictates there is an external reality, including our brain. To understand thought, one must dissect the processes and reassemble them. In the humanities, various artists, mainly emerging in the late 19th and early 20th century, have discovered a deeper truth. It is that human thought is ever plastic, and even our efforts to understand the physical universe are confined by the neural processes. The interesting parts for me are studies on Stravinsky and Cezanne along with various oddities from neuroscience, such as 'blindsight' (the condition of people who are cortically blind due to lesions in their striate cortex, also known as primary visual cortex or V1, to respond to visual stimuli that they do not consciously see). I'm afraid the literary references are far outside of my experience. Gertrude Stein, George Elliot, and Proust are discussed, and unless their works are know to the reader, these passages are opaque. There is a puritanical streak in me that makes me want to be at least familiar with these iconic figures, but life may be too short in these cases. Even a description of their works sound so abstract as to be useless. I have a long running discussion with a friend concerning art and cognition. We once visited the Rothko Chapel in Houston, leaving as puzzled as when we entered. Nearby we visited the Menil Collection featuring works by Cy Twombly. More puzzlement. I am closer to appreciating cubism, but this is not to say I understand it as beauty. And yet I readily accept that these works could be, must be output of deep conviction and perhaps even skill. It is my own path that limits my appreciation of their creations.Well, back to the book. It is well written and interesting, but not for everyone."
71,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1232354-jessica-l-pez-barkl,5,"I usually take a long time to read any books dealing with the mind...and this one was no exception. I wonder sometimes in the aftermath of the killings in Colorado whether or not the shooter ever took the time to realize that reading books on the brain does things to the brain and allowing the brain rest and restitution will keep one saner...I suppose it's too soon to wonder those things, but I definitely know that in some of the chapters of this book, I felt as though I needed a mental hour, day, week, or whatever to process what I had read. This book was so amazing that I want to point out each amazing thing I learned from each chapter. The basic premise is that Jonah Lehrer is trying to suss out is the connection between the humanities and the brain and how artists often are ahead of the scientific world. The Walt Whitman chapter offers the idea that Walt knew that the mind and the body were inextricably linked. I think this is the first chapter because most of us now know that that has been proven, but I don't think most of us knew that it wasn't until after Walt, and Walt definitely rocked a few worlds with his poetry...In the chapter on George Eliot I was struck by the section subtitled ""The Blessing of Chaos"". George knew we are happier in a state of chaos. I really thought this was a great discovery and yet it really wasn't proven until 2002. It makes sense because when we are just learning something, we are, indeed, happier, a sedentary lifestyle will just bore the brain, literally, to death. I guess they are now looking for a way to make this as an anti-depressant...a chaos inducing drug instead of trying to set off more serotonin...which never seems to sustain.The chapter on Auguste Escoffier has invaded my cooking life lately, so much so, I should probably go out and get one of his books. But the idea of umammi (or yummy) based on what he could taste when he was making his famous sauces and not based on fact until 2002 and 2004 respectively when scientists finally found two more taste buds on the tongue. Anyway, I loved this chapter, and I strive to create umammi every time I cook now because it also create happiness in the brain.Proust, the eleven o'clock hour song in this book, and, I'm assuming the inspiration for the title...duh! ""The Remembrance of Things pas is not necessarily the remembrance of things as they were..."" But, what a wonderful way to live when in the creative state. What a memory creates for us, is ours, and belongs to no else. It is weird, though, when I think of memories I have of my father, and then they seem almost sullied when they don't match the ones my siblings have, however, his existence is plural in that way, so...it's also beautiful. ""This is what Proust knew: the past is never past. As long as we are alive, our memories remain wonderfully volatile. In their mercurial mirror, we see ourselves."" (95)Paul Cezanne's chapter talks about what we actually see...and how it is processed. Most people did not appreciate his paintings while he was alive, but they inspired many to reexamine what we see. What we actually see is artifice because when the eye was studied they discovered that it actually sees what Cezanne was painting, but that the rest of our mind fills in the blanks. I'm still sitting with this chapter because it makes a lot of sense when I think about how to ""fill"" a line or ""fill"" the feeling of a song or even a choreographed sequence. We need to ""fill"" in the blanks, apparently, and we do it all the time. Igor Stravinsky realized that even though his initial premiere of ""The Rite of Spring"" might cause a riot, and it did, that eventually the brain would adjust and it would just be music. He was right, and this led people to discover all sorts of things about the way our brain memorizes patterns and that music is really what the mind thinks is music...as long as it hears it enough to convince itself. I was reminded that a bunch of the prisoners I used to teach were outraged by an early sequence in the film LATCHO DROM where the Roma tribe ululated in very high pitches, and then later in the film the commented that they didn't mind it as much anymore. Stravinsky knew that the mind was limitless and just needs patterns to be repeated enough to delve into something new.The Gertrude Stein chapter also touched on patterns, but this time in the literary world. Gertrude Stein tried very hard to destructure language, but by destructuring our language, she discovered that you can't, language is never pure and never stands alone...the mind will always fill in the blanks with some sort of context, no matter how much a writer tries to abstract it. Scientists also discovered truly how much we have a need for language and that need surpasses any destructuring...we always need context, which is why two-year-olds can learn a new word every two hours.The last chapter is Virginia Woolf, and this is the chapter that hasn't been proven because scientists know that she was right, but they haven't found the place in the brain where her observation occurred. She supposed that our true self is illusory and exists only when it is ""at attention"". This idea of an illusory consciousness drowned all of her writings...and yet, it's true...our true self emerges...it doesn't just exist. I think of this a lot when I'm teaching your actors. I remind them that life is more interesting to watch on stage when the character make a discovery before a decision. A decision cannot exist on its own...it has to have a transition...somewhere, however subtle that transition is. I especially like a quote on page 180-1 that I will end this longer than usual review... ""In her art, Woolf let life break in. She shows us our fleeting parts, but she also shows us how our parts come together. The secret, Woolf realized, was that the self emerges from its source. Emerge is the crucial word here. While her characters begin as a bundle of random sensations, echoing about the brain's electrical membranes, they instantly swell into something else. This is why, as Erich Auerbach pointed out in MIMESIS, Woolf's modernist prose is neither a continuous transcription of the character's self-consciousness (as in Joyce's ULYSSES) nor an objective description of events and perceptions (as in a typical nineteenth-century novel). Woolf's revelation was to merge these two polarities. This technique allows her to document consciousness as a process, showing us the full arc of our thought. The impersonal sensation is always ripening into a subjective experience, and that experience is always flowing into the next one. And yet, from this incessant change, the character emerges. Woolf wanted us to see both sides of our being, how we are ""a thing that you could ruffle with your breath; and a thing you could not dislodge with a team of horses."" In her fiction, the self is neither imposed nor disowned. Rather, it simply arises, a vision stolen from the flux."""
72,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27986103-mike,4,"Lehrer’s idea for this book is to compare the thinking of various artists (Walt Whitman, Virginia Wolff, Gertrude Stein and Paul Cezanne to name just a few) with the discoveries science has been making about the brain. In relation to each artist he focuses on a particular aspect of the way (we think) the brain works and shows that often an artist has already ‘gone ahead’ and intuitively understood these things. It’s an intriguing idea and one that comes off well in some chapters and not so well in others. As a musician I found the chapter on Stravinsky less than satisfactory. He insists on calling The Rite of Spring a symphony and writes as though all (actual) symphonies before this composition appeared were classical in structure. And while Stravinsky was certainly an iconoclast, he was by no means the only person changing the shape of music around that time. Nor did he suddenly begin his musical career with a work that was completely off-the-wall. That quibble aside, the book is full of fascinating stuff, both scientifically and artistically. As always, we meet scientists who would rather cling to a theory than allow someone else to prove them wrong, and inevitably their goal becomes the quashing of the younger scientist’s findings. We read about all manner of discoveries in relation to the brain, in areas as varied as the memory, how we perceive feeling, taste, sight, language and what the self is...or isn’t. Many of these discussions are fascinating, and, for the most part, quite accessible. Lehrer’s book is one of a number on neuroscience that have come out in the last short while. V S Ramachandran , Iain McGilchrist and Nicholas Hum¬phrey have all written on the subject. Consequently, while Lehrer often convinces in his discussion of the brain and the mind, it needs to be remembered that what he’s saying is by no means the last word on the topic. Our current state of neuroscientific thinking is in an extraordinary state of forward movement on one hand and dismay at how little we know on the other. "
73,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/167566-neil-white,4,"I see a lot of varying opinions on this book, and I'm honestly not sure what some people expected. Some say he's not scientific and academic enough, some say he's too hard on science, some say his claims are specious at best. I didn't find any of this to be the case.I was familiar with the name Jonah Lehrer from his frequent contributions to the wonderful show/podcast RadioLab, and it was with that approach that I went into this book. If you're familiar with RadioLab, you know it's a science-based show that removes the hard science, and focuses on the wonder of curiosity and discovery. That pleasure that comes from realizing the unexpected connections between things, explaining the unexplainable, and just trying to make sense of it all. It's a fantastic show, and if you've never listened before I urge you to - it's not a stretch to say it might just change how you think.But I digress - this book isn't RadioLab, and never claims to be. Instead it's about how certain scientific discoveries, some of which are considered basic knowledge now, were often precluded or overlapped by similar artistic discoveries. Artists, Lehrer argues, often ""knew"" things about the human condition before scientists did, even if they couldn't necessarily articulate and explain it like science eventually did.He focuses on eight examples, or claims:Walt Whitman's poetry first explored the idea of the ""human body as an irreducible whole"", upending the conventional wisdom of the time that the body & mind/spirit were separate entities. Scientists such as Antonio Damasio later proved this with experiments that showed that our bodies/nervous system can learn and be aware of things long before our conscious mind is.George Eliot's ideas of individual freedom and insistence on the ability to change ourselves presaged ideas of neuroplasticity, and the brain's ability to do just that. It's difficult not to think of such things nowadays as common sense, but the ""nature"" side of ""nature vs nurture"" was very in vogue at the time - the modern idea of ""becoming a new you"" just wasn't there.Auguste Escoffier was insistent before almost anyone that taste involved a ""fifth taste"" of savory sensation, as well as the sense of smell, played a huge impact on a person's ability to enjoy food. It seems crazy to think that back then, most food was served cold, and flavor combinations weren't taken into account. This was later vindicated by the discovery of umami, and findings on the power of sense of smell, and how it is tied directly to the hippocampus - the oldest part of the brain, unlike the other senses.Marcel Proust wrote almost exclusively about memories (sickly and confined indoors most of his life, it was all had). Therefore he understood its fallibility, as well as its ability to spring forth unexpectedly from the strangest of sensory stimuli (such as the famous madeline in his masterpiece ""In Search Of Lost Time"") - long before neurologists caught up to him about just how memory works, or often doesn't work.""[Paul] Cezanne's epiphany was that our impressions require interpretation; to look is to create what you see.” His masterful post-impressionist works seem to understand that perception is such a huge part of seeing – his paintins (especially his later ones) at a glance seem incomplete – like blurry, unfinished sketches. Our mind fills in the blanks, which neuroscientists later discovered is exactly what happens all the time, anytime we perceive just about anything. (See for yourself - http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/...)Igor Stravinsky’s masterpiece “The Rite Of Spring” literally caused a riot when it first debuted. It was screeching, cacophonic noise unlike anything anyone had ever heard before. It was punishing and ugly, exactly how Igor wanted it. The brilliance of this work is that now it is considered a masterpiece – our brains have in effect “learned” that this is music. Stravinsky seemed to have an understanding that our brains can take even the harshest dissonance and make it music if it’s done right.Gertrude Stein attempted to deconstruct language to make it meaningless. She failed, but in doing so found a larger truth about language and its inextricable ties to brain itself. Even her most wild subconscious, free-form ramblings make grammatical sense, if not cognitive sense. (He gives the famous Chomsky example of “Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.”) Linguists like Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker are still championing this idea of a language instinct.Virginia Woolf was one of the famous pioneers of stream-of-consciousness writing in the early 20th century. Before this time, most novels were the standard third-person omniscient narrators, but Woolf challenged this idea by not just getting directly into her character’s narration, but into their deepest selves, and showing that the “self” as many neurologists and psychologists now think of it, may not be more than the random firing of synapses, impulse after impulse, not at all separate from the body or mind. (This idea of the self is still up for contention more so than the others.)I see a lot of laughable reviews along the lines of “No he was NOT a neurologist!” that make me think the point here was missed entirely by some. This is not equating art with science, nor is it championing one over the other. What Lehrer here is doing, in layman’s terms, with little hard science (yet another criticism I see a lot of) is illuminating certain paths which art and science have both crossed. To say that Cezanne was specifically thinking of ocular nerves refracting and processing light rays, or that George Eliot was contemplating neuroplasticity while writing her novels is ridiculous. They weren’t, and nobody is saying otherwise, Lehrer is just showing how these two branches, which too often have little to say to each other, may cross each other in some sort of Venn diagram more often than either realizes.I will admit I was doubtful about some of the connections made, and some of them worked better than others – the Cezanne and Proust chapters worked much better than George Eliot, for example, but as I read on I began to realize Lehrer wasn't actually claiming artistic discovery as much as insight. No, Proust was not a neuroscientist, but as it turns out, he had a few ideas in common with them. The epilogue really summed up Lehrer’s aim with this work, which was to show how art and science aren’t always mutually exclusive, and could benefit from each other immensely. In that respect I think Lehrer has succeeded admirably in his debut. If you’re a fan of nontechnical “pop-science” you’ll find a lot to enjoy here."

This is the second book I've read that concerns the workings of the brain and a reference to Proust (the other being Proust and the Squid: The Story and Science of the Reading Brain), which is interesting in itself. These sciency types do like their Proust.I liked the idea of this book very much, that many artists predicted what scienstists would discover later. I'm not entirely sure that theory is proved though. To me it seems that the artists he discusses are exemplary of when human reflection touches upon unknown knowns. I'm not sure the works of the artists in themselves predict anything. Reading into the works backwards, they can probably be held up as examples of 'oh, that's why!' like the chapter on Igor Stravinsky, when Lehrer talks about cognitive dissonance, or the chapter on Auguste Escoffier talking about the brain lighting up at certain tastes. I didn't think Escoffier predicted that MSG is like gunpowder for the synapses, but clearly he cottoned onto the fact that certain tasts produce certain pleasures (same with music). It's science that later reveals the underlying reason we feel those pleasurers. All art says something about the way we percieve the world, but science takes that perception and dissects it further. So, I wasn't really on board with what Lehrer was saying, however, I enjoyed the hell out of this book."

How the brain releases dopamine when we are in anticipation of finding pattern/ rhythm - and the more that is withheld, the better the music is perceived. Didn't realise how inextricably entwined music was to art, art to literature, music to literature etc. Of course, art doesn't exist just for the purpose of aesthetics - it pursued/ pursues some of the questions science and modern neuroscience are just starting to catch up on. Loved the bits on Virginia Woolf, the philosophy of the self, and parts explaining how we have fragmented minds etc but those fragments conglomerate to find form, and that form (whether being matter or pure thought/ synaptic impulse) blend into each other - but we can't quite capture it; we struggle to see how fragments make the whole. This helped me piece together my shallow understanding of Modernism. Also loved the history of artists - very cool to see how lives intersect. http://flungmagazine.com/2016/04/19/f...

Each chapter focuses on a different artist and how she or he changed the way we think about our mind processes and also changed the history of art. The book focuses mostly on writers exploring how Proust first revealed the fallibility of memory, how Virginia Woolf explored the way we think and how Gertrude Stein explored and revealed the deep structures of language. Another chapter explores how Igor Stravinsky changed the way people thought about music and how as people listened more to his music it became less discordant and ugly as their ears attuned to the new combinations of sound. There's a chapter on how Cezanne tried to show reality as it really is rather than as we see it, thus paving the way for abstract art. Each chapter is fascinating in its own right but together they add up to a very strong argument that the arts are as important for understanding life as are the sciences. This is reflected in the latest policy report from educational charity The Edge Foundation, Towards a Twenty-First Century Education System, which calls for dramatic changes to the UK's current national curriculum and argues that creativity should be at the heart of all learning.

I had already given myself a reading challenge this year to read 12 classics and from this book I discovered Middlemarch by George Eliot and the stories of Virginia Woolf. I adore symphony music and was transported by the music of Igor Stravinsky. I was introduced to art by painters I knew virtually nothing about. In other words, it broadened my horizons. However, the intent was something different. Lehrer’s intention was to explain the connection between the arts and the brain. This he did well. To conceptualize the creation of art, the crafting of music and the ephemeral ‘Self” was fascinating. To learn that artist were doing it long before it became a focus of science was even more fascinating. This book wraps a cord at the nexus of art and science in a way that is readable, enjoyable and reflective. It invites learning and creativity as an approach to understanding one’s self and the world we live in. I have nothing but good to say about this book and hope readers and authors of all genres, artists of all styles and musicians of every class will spend some time with this book to gain a better understanding of why and how we do what we do.

In fact, I stopped mid-chapter and skipped to the next chapter and didn't find my way back to complete the Whitman chapter until just before the Woolf chapter. I also wish the author provided more notes or in-text citations for interested readers to dig a little further into the primary research. The chapter titled ""coda"" at the end is kind of like the thesis statement of the entire book. I understand why it is at the end but I could also see it as an introduction to provide a guiding framework for readers to think about the lives and works of these influential artists.

89,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7118702-loy-machedo,2,"I do not want to sound crafty – at least more than I actually am nor do I want to portray that I have apprehended something I found a bit hard to fathom. Proust was a Neuroscientist is one such book – which is pretty incredible in its composition but can get you sapped in its pages. I had to read and re-read the book, including getting help from others to checking out reference materials online just to get this Book Review in place. Let’s see if I can decipher the book in the most simplistic form. Proust Was a Neuroscientist by Jonah Lehrer is a collection of true stories and its biographical translation by the author who attempts to reveal ideas from artists about the mind that neuroscience is true. It is more like building an analogical bridge between scientific concepts and artists.The characters in the chapters pay homage to a poet, four novelists, a chef, a painter, and a composer. The sequence in each chapters follow the predicted path -a brief biography at the beginning followed by a description of their creative contribution and finally the expose into the neurological insights of the artists. Once that pathway is established, Lehrer translates discoveries in neuroscience that pertain to the artist's ideas. Finally, towards the end Lehrer attempts to draw similarities between what the artist believed and what neuroscience has discovered.So here are the characters that come into the descriptive plot of scientific analogies. Walt WhitmanBefore and during Whitman's time, the common belief was that the body and spirit were two separate entities. Lehrer supplements Whitman's idea that our feelings are due to interactions between the mind and body by citing the work of Antonio Damasio. Damasio used four decks of cards where two decks contained big payouts and even bigger punishments and the other two decks had smaller payouts and very few punishments. He tested the electrical conductance of a test subject's palms and found that the subject's hand would get ""nervous"" just reaching toward the negative decks, long before the subject's mind understood. George EliotGeorge Eliot stated an idea that our ability to change ourselves gives us an innate freedom and then goes into details about neurogenesis and the fact that DNA does not determine our brains. Steps following protein transcription from RNA involve plenty of changes that DNA does not determine, and the environment around any organism plays a huge role in how it behaves. Auguste EscoffierCan you believe that before Auguste, Umami was never considered in existence? Escoffier's was the person who discovered the presence of umami in taste as well the involvement of smell and the power of suggestion. Two studies, one on cheap red wine and the other on white wine with red food coloring, revealed what had to be an embarrassing truth about the power of suggestion to a decent number of wine experts. Marcel ProustProust's thoughts on the memory meshed well with the discoveries in neuroscience. His verbose recollection of eating a madeleine and the memories that sprang from it match perfectly with the smell and taste ""connect directly to the hippocampus, the center of the brain's long-term memory"". The fallibility of memory that Proust realized is another intriguing aspect of neuroscience, the idea that we can ""remember"" something without actually experiencing it or the notion that ""we have to misremember something in order to remember it"". Paul CezannePerception is such a huge part of our senses; Cezanne used his paintings to show us that we can use our minds to complete the picture. Lehrer's inclusion of two of Cezanne's paintings helped to supplement this idea. ""His art shows us what we cannot see, which is how we see"". Igor Stravinsky, Gertrude Stein, and Virginia WoolfStravinsky ""knew"" that people's plastic brains could be taught to enjoy and feel new music. Gertrude Stein attempted to show that the structure of language is built into us by making words meaningless. And Virginia Woolf's ideas about the self were all connected to the concepts of Neuroscience. But now the moment of truth.I have read Jonah’s other books - How We Decide & Imagine: How Creativity Works. And I will admit, I am a fan of his work. But this book got me confused many a times. Personally, I felt though he was intellectually making a point, many a times he would go round and round to the point it left you dizzy and lost wondering what was he trying to say the first place. He does cover an incredible amount of ground with his research but towards the end, I personally do not believe he makes his case obvious. And to be honest, None of the names – apart from George Eliot, Virginia Woolf was familiar to me. So if you are looking at being enlightened by a Great Communicator who makes a Complex Subject easily understandable to Common Laypeople like myself – well this is not the book for you. Overall Rating.Given the complexity of the subject, the amount of data and the confusion I experienced while reading the book, I would have to give this book a 3 out of 10. It is only because I was a fan of his did I go through the whole book – otherwise I doubt I would have completed it the first place. So if you are planning to buy this book – I suggest you check out if you identify the character mentioned in the review. If you do not know them – don’t bother purchasing this book.

120,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32551800-allen-hill,5,Another collection of intriguing results from neuroscientific research by Jonah Lehrer. 
121,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/763730-stewart,3,"	“Proust Was a Neuroscientist” (2007) by Noah Lehrer argues that science and art are both necessary to explain the world around us. Using seven people – Walt Whitman on feeling, George Eliot on freedom and randomness, Marcel Proust on memory, Gertrude Stein on language, and Virginia Wolf on the self; Auguste Escoffier on taste; Paul Cezanne on vision; and Igor Stravinsky on the psychology of music – Lehrer makes a strong case that visionary artists can take us to places later visited by science or can take us to realms to which science can’t go.	The chapter on Proust and memory echoed information I had previously known about the unreliability of memory. Proust, in his epic book about memory, ""In Search of Lost Time,"" believed that memory was to an extent a fabrication and the past elusive. As Lehrer writes, “Proust warns us to treat the reality of our memories carefully, and with a degree of skepticism. … Our remembrance of things past is imperfect.”	Recent neuroscience research has changed the way we think about memory, from something stored intact in the brain into something more complex. Memory is “a ceaseless process, not a repository of inert information.”	The chapter on French chef and food writer August Escoffier had elements that are already well known but added new information. The chapter examined the sense of taste and the importance of food beyond mere nutrition. Escoffier’s ideas about the preparation of food and its presentation can be found in just about every fancy restaurant in the world.	“He believed the greatest threat to public health was the modern transformation of dining from a ‘pleasurable occasion into an unnecessary chore,’” Lehrer writes. This rush by so many Americans to gulp down food, which I have observed the past 50 years, can be traced, I think, to high school cafeterias where we had to hurry to eat our lunches in 20 minutes or less.	Perspective and context are important in eating as almost everything else. “A perfect dish, after all, required a perfect mood. Although Escoffier spent eighteen hours a day behind a hot stove, crafting his collection of sauces, he realized that what we taste is ultimately an idea, and that our sensations are strongly influenced by their context.”	A large part of “context” consists of our past experiences and the resulting expectations we have. “When we sense something, that sensation is immediately analyzed in terms of previous experiences. … Thus, what we think we are tasting is only partially about the morsel of matter in the mouth. Equally important is the sum of past experiences enclosed within the brain, for these memories are what 'frame' the sensation.”	Expectations allow is to judge the present experience, but they can lead us astray as well. Lehrer writes about the 2001 experiments in Bordeaux, France, with wine experts who were deceived into thinking white wine was red wine because unknown to them food coloring had been added. Lehrer had in 2008 written about this subject in a Boston Globe article called “Grape expectations: What wine can tell us about the nature of reality.” These experiments were recounted by David McRaney in the chapter “Expectation” in his book ""You Are Not So Smart.""	“What these wine experiments illuminate is the omnipresence of subjectivity,” Lehrer sums up.	A review of any book by Jonah Lehrer would not be complete without mentioning his admission to fabricating quotes and committing plagiarism in a subsequent book called “Imagine: How Creativity Works” and resigning from The New Yorker in July 2012. While “Proust Is a Neuroscientist” was found by the publisher to be without significant problems, two later books were recalled from bookstores.	Another thing to keep in mind is that Lehrer has training in neurology, but his grasp of the arts can be iffy. For instance, in his chapter on Igor Stravinsky, several times he refers to “The Rite of Spring” as a “symphony” rather than the ballet score that it is. This shows basic ignorance of classical music, and I wonder why the publisher's copy editor didn't catch this; maybe there are no copy editors left at publishing houses. Lehrer’s comment, “Stravinsky’s music is all violation” is hyperbole. Stravinsky violated some of the rules of classical music at the time but not all.	This lends doubt to other chapters. I am knowledgeable about classical music, but not very knowledgeable about Proust, Gertrude Stein, Paul Cezanne, or George Eliot, so I don’t know how accurate his observations are on those people’s work.	However, even after saying this, I will agree with his wider statements about science and the arts both being legitimate ways of experiencing and explaining the universe. “And while science will always be our primary method of investigating the universe,” Lehrer writes in his concluding chapter, “it is naive to think that science can solve everything by itself, or that everything can even be solved.”"
122,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3249449-helen,3,"I was all set to read the new Neil Gaiman book, but my kids drained the iPad. So I picked up this book again and decided to finish it. It's good but not without flaws. Some of these are minor details like leaving out the fact Rosalind Franklin had actually helped discover DNA in Chapter 2: George Eliot - The Biology of Freedom. I thought this was a glaring omission since George Eliot in her time was writer who lived in a time when women had few freedoms. But back to DNA, once again the bulk of the credit goes to Crick and Watson for discovering the structure of molecule, even though it was Franklin who'd actually photographed it first via x-rays. Perhaps if she hadn't had to fight sexism, she might have made it to publication first seeing as her lab partner (a man) decided to show her work without her knowledge to the competition. Like I said, this rubbed me the wrong way because the focus on George Eliot's chapter had to do with free will and self-determination. It bears mentioning Rosalind Franklin defied her father's wishes by becoming a scientist instead of a social worker. Not that there is anything wrong with the latter, but it was only because her father thought university education was not for women. Since I'm not a neuroscience scientist, I can't speak to the veracity and accuracy of other facts, but nonetheless I did think the book brought up interesting points despite the few issues I had with it.At any rate, it did make me fall in love all over again with the likes of Walt Whitman. And I did like an observation in Chapter 4: Marcel Proust - The Method of Memory in the section about Intuitions that ""The impression is for the writer what experimentation is for the scientist."" I think you could flip that around it would still be true, writers experiment in their own way and impressions can lead scientists to hypothesis. This can be seen in Chapter 7 Getrude Stein - The Structure of Language, where Stien was an avant-garde artist after she was an scientist. She experimented with writing and discovered a few interesting facts about syntax. Chapter 6 Igor Stravinsky - The Source of music was enlightening. I'm often drawn to dissonance and while I like parts of old songs, I would rather hear elements recombined weirdly and have elements thrown in that aren't easily recognizable than listen to something manufactured to please. It's a personality thing, it might also explain why I like Animal Collective and some other not-so-easy on the ears bands. pg 142""...over time the auditory cortex works the same way; we become better able to hear those sounds we've already heard before. This only encourages us to listen to the golden oldies we already know (since they sound better), and to ignore the difficult songs that we don't know (since they sound harsh and noisy, and release unpleasant amounts of dopamine). We are built to abhor the uncertainty of newness. How do we escape this neurological trap? By paying attention to art. The artist is engaged in a perpetual struggle against the positive feedback loop of the brain, desperate to create an experience that no one has ever had before. And while the poet must struggle to create a new metaphor and the novelist a new story, the composer must discover the undiscovered pattern...[without this] all we would be left with would be a shell of easy consonance, the polite drivel of perfectly predictable music. Works like The Rite jolt us out of complacency. They keep us literally open-minded. If not for the difficulty of the avant-garde, we would worship nothing but that which we already know.This is what Stravinsky knew: music is made by the mind, and the mind can learn to listen to almost anything. Given time, even the intransigent 'Rite' would become just another musical classic, numbing listeners with its beauty. Its strange patterns would be memorized, and they would cease to hurt. The knifing chord of the 'Augurs' would become dull with use, and all the meticulously engineered dissonances would fade into a tepid kind of pulchritude....Because our human brain can learn to listen to anything, music has no cage. All music needed is a violated pattern, an order interrupted by disorder, for in that acoustic friction, we hallucinate a feeling. Music is that feeling...""Honestly that is all fine and well, but there is something to be said about the comfort of beauty or in the familiar. It's therapeutic for starts, and I think the avant-garde can be beautiful in its strangeness. Anyway, it was an interesting read, not perfect, but food for thought. "

124,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12347036-nick,2,"This was a book that seemed utterly unconcerned with backing up the argument made by the title. In the book Lehrer makes many connections that are truly weak and instead of enforcing those connections he utilizes both art and neuroscience to battle against reductionism. The book does a good job at explaining why Lehrer disagrees with any and all reductionists and finds most ideas of singularity revolting; however, I in no way found myself to have a better understanding of the similarities between neuroscientists and artists afterwards: the only similarity I could find described in this book was that it was possible for an artist to come to a conclusion that was also reached through science.Essentially my problem with the book was that although Lehrer found artists whose ideas - arguably - agreed with current findings in neuroscience, he never even considers that this was due to chance. He analyzes only 8 artists from the past one hundred and fifty or some years (starting with Walt Whitman). I don't claim to have a full list of the people who made major contributions to any form of art through those times (broadly construed as he goes as he assesses both a cook and a musician) but I would assume that there have definitely been hundreds if not thousands. The way I see it, the fact that 8 artists have been consistent with scientific findings is really quite unremarkable. I felt that I didn't need 200 pages to learn that it was possible to express a view that happened to be right. Through the book Lehrer makes no attempt at saying that all artists are neuroscientists and in fact he finds that the true ""neuroscientists are just the ones that are lucky enough -my words not his- to agree with the current findings. In fact he goes as far as to insult many artists that were popular during their time including those in the realist groups of both literature and painting. Although I have no particular affinity to any of these artists or their works I certainly found his scathing criticism of them to be out of place and unnecessary. The reason I gave this book two stars is that it did accomplish two things. One: it provided solid biographies of the eight artists lives. Two: it managed to describe some interesting studies in neuroscience. This is however, about where my praise ends. The scientific descriptions that Lehrer gives are often quite misleading, saying things like ""Inside our cells, shards and scraps of nucleic acid and protein float aimlessly"" when in fact they are carefully guided by a grand network of microfibers and rarely if ever ""aimlessly float"" in the cells. Worse than his descriptions is his so called analysis of the science. Particularly bad was his essay on George Eliot whom he said expressed the idea that humans have free will - thus bravely opposing the reductionist Darwinism of her time. He then ""explains"" retrotransposons, (""junk genes"" that move around in the DNA and are very prevalent in neurons) neuroplasticity (which means that neurons can make new connections) and late neurogenesis (which means that new nerves can be born in the brain after adolescence). After describing these things he proceeds to analyze the information. First he paraphrases and quotes Karl Popper, (a great philosopher of science) saying that ""life is not a clock, it is a cloud. Like a cloud, life is 'highly irregular, disorderly, and more or less unpredictable'"". Within this same paragraph, having added nothing new, he concludes that ""the idée fixe of deterministic order proved to be a mirage. We remain as mysteriously free as ever"". He repeats this conclusion in a few more ways. He says that ""[George Eliot] knew that we inherit minds that let us escape our inheritance; we can always impose our will onto biology"" I for one found myself unconvinced that we can in fact do this and equally uncertain that George Eliot had even asserted it. He concludes the chapter with the final conclusion: ""As Eliot anticipated, our freedom is built into us. As its most fundamental level, life is full of leeway, defined by a plasticity that defies every determinism"". This is a grand statement made with very little evidence and supposedly supported by plasticity which truly isn't understood to be an indeterminable process controlled by freewill.In all, this book was filled with careless writing, presumptuous conclusions, and misleading hooks. I would not recommend it to anyone as a good source for either neuroscience or the way artists can understand the mind. "

126,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1533440-al-bit,5,"Readers should not be put off by the title of this book; it could seem that it will deal with difficult subjects, but such an approach would be wrong.This fascinating book looks at the works of eight 'artists' whom we might call 'modernist' (they fit into the period from ca. mid-19th to mid-20th centuries) from the perspective of a neuroscientist. Lehrer sees their works as containing prototypes of human qualities which would only later would be confirmed by the new discipline of neuroscience. Walt Whitman (feeling/the body), George Eliot (mind/ freedom), Auguste Escoffier (taste), Marcel Proust (memory), Paul Cezanne (sight), Igor Stravinski (music), Gertrude Stein (language) and Virginia Woolf (mind/self) all dealt with the themes mentioned with as much clarity and honesty as they could muster. By being honest to their understanding of themselves they revealed to others things which neuroscience has since suggested are basic truths about the human condition. Their art is thus connected essentially with being human beings and humanity in general.All this could have been rather ponderous and heavy, but the special thing about this book is that the opposite is true. These eight individuals and their concerns in their art are discussed as the first and foremost subject of each, so that we learn to appreciate their output in ways that would not otherwise have been accessible to the ordinary reader. It enriches our understanding of them. The 'neuroscience' part is almost secondary to the main theme: that true artists give us access through their art to a better understanding of ourselves. This cross-disciplinary approach suggests a more holistic approach to the arts is not only possible but also perhaps essential in expanding our appreciation of them in new and exciting ways. A few decades ago such an approach would have been considered 'inappropriate' at University (one could not safely argue that scientific views expressed in these works had any validity from a 'literary' or 'artistic' discipline — not if you wanted to pass your exams…) So first and foremost, this delightful work is about art (in whatever guise that might come in) and only secondarily about 'science'; but it quietly and subtly suggests that the two are not necessarily at odds with one another.At the end of this work (p. 197) the author expresses his purpose: 'I hope that this book has shown how art and science might be reintegrated into an expansive critical sphere. Both art and science can be useful, and both can be true. In our own time, art is a necessary counterbalance to the glories and excesses of scientific reductionism, especially as they are applied to human experience. This is the artist's purpose: to keep *our* reality, with all its frailties and question marks, on the agenda.' Earlier, towards the end (pp. 187-8) of his section on Virginia Woolf, where issues of the mind and the self are looked at, he is more specific regarding his attitude to purely reductionist interpretations of the mind: 'To define consciousness solely in terms of oscillations in the prefrontal cortex is to miss out on our subjective reality. The self feels whole, but all science can see is its parts… If science breaks us apart, art puts us together again.'Whether this noble sentiment will be confirmed or not in the future (especially in relation to astonishing developments in neuropsychology still at the infancy of its discipline) remains to be seen. It would be a grave mistake, however, to think that the author is saying that artists can somehow 'predict' future scientific facts in their works — they can't, and it is not their function to do so; what he is saying is that artists true to their art, and able to communicate their understandings of themselves to others in their work, will, ipso facto, be true to whatever truths about ourselves that future science might confirm. In the meantime, this superb little book will educate you in ways not really allowed before in the arts; it sheds new light on a more extensive appreciation of the arts and science as partners, and of humanity in general."
127,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/297553-akemi,4,"Jonah Lehrer is my new hero. I want to be him. Kind of. This book combines my two academic passions: literature (and the arts in general) and neuroscience. Normally I feel like combining science with the arts ends up diluting both and producing something unsatisfactory, but this book manages to do it in an enlightening way. The book goes into enough scientific detail to satisfy someone familiar with the literature while not getting too jargony, an important pro for a science writer. Also, from the artistic side, I liked that I didn't have to have read everything he discussed- i.e. I've never read anything by Gertrude Stein (nor am I likely to after the descriptions of her work in this book), but I still appreciated the chapter on her work. Granted, I probably got more out of, say, the chapter on George Eliot, but it certainly wasn't a hindrance.I really enjoyed the chapter on Eliot, ""The Biology of Freedom,"" especially after having discussed free will at length with a philosopher friend. Got me pumped to read more Eliot in the fall and hopefully to read Lehrer's other book, How We Decide.Probably the most interesting scientific moment of the book was the discussion of memory and prions. Prions are proteins that change conformation for no apparent reason, and Eric Kandel, a Nobel laureate whose lab Lehrer worked in, thinks they may be the keeper of memories, explaining why memories are always changing and can come to mind at the most random of times. It's also fascinating/scary to think how malleable memories are. I feel like memories are a large chunk of what makes up a self, suggesting that our selves are not as constant as I once would have thought.I thoroughly support his sentiments in the coda, that art and science should re-converge. I've listened to a few TED talks on the subject recently as well. It seems ridiculous now to think that Stein was a med student at Johns Hopkins, or that Eliot wrote in her diary about Darwin- can you see modern day writers and artists reading Nature from cover to cover? I'm sure some do (as Lehrer points out, Ian McEwan is one good example), but surely not enough. Too often we separate ourselves as either humanities people or science people, especially in college. All this results in is ignorance and petty squabbles over which is ""better"" or more challenging. I do think it is difficult to fuse the two in a satisfying way, but that doesn't mean it's impossible. I think the problem is that when people do try to fuse them, they just directly inject one into the other- i.e. let's scientifically analyze this piece of art, or, let's create a painting based on DNA patterns. Most of those pursuits are pretty dumb, in my opinion, because they don't use one discipline to influence or change the other, so the end result just feels artificial and contrived. Rather, I think there should just be a more general awareness and sharing of ideas. Part of the problem is that science has become too specialized, but that's a whole other argument. Moral of the story is, artists should keep up with science, and scientists should keep up with art."
128,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,3,"Three stars seems a bit paltry, because I like Lehrer as an author, but it does, after all, mean “I liked it.”I like the idea of what this book could have been more than the actual execution. In our bookclub meeting, someone suggested a better title might have used a question mark: Proust Was a Neuroscientist?, but I think a better idea would have been to drop the “w”: Proust as a Neuroscientist. Lehrer traces the history, personal development and impact of each artist’s contribution and points out how those advances presaged much later changes in our understanding of cognition.The idea that artistic revolution might intuit things that scientists hadn’t yet noticed is wonderful; showing such foreshadowing is the pleasant core of this book. What I didn’t like was when Lehrer presented the artists as actually understanding cognition or neuroscience. So he claims that Proust spent so much time and effort examining his flawed memories that he “understood how the brain worked”, and his ”hypothesis”, “model” and “theory of memory” have since been ratified by contemporary science.Our current culture is atrociously science-averse. Lehrer’s assertion that these artists really are cryptoscientists diminishes science in service of further glorifying select artists. Although radical insights and creative explosions are the visible highlights of scientific endeavors, they are precisely what is shared by every creative field, and focusing on them as the sine qua non of science is precisely what is misleading. Science is the drudgery of data gathering, experimental replication and hypothesis testing. Most of it is, necessarily, ”little science” in Kuhn’s paradigmatic scenario: not glorious at all. Lehrer’s eight revolutionary artists were not engaged in science, but radical creativity. Look to inventors like Nikola Tesla or Alexander Graham Bell, perhaps, as their equivalents.In Lehrer’s final chapter, he repeats C.P. Snow’s lament at the divide between art and science. Frankly, I’m a bit of a heretic on that point; I think the divide is as natural as that between, say, shoe-making and ice cream production. Science and art are both important to our society, but that does not mean they have a natural touching point. When Lehrer attempts to build a bridge between these two domains, he diminishes some important points and emphasizes lesser points, inevitably to the detriment of one field or the other — which is precisely what he complains in his afterword what science popularizers often do.This is a pleasant book to read, especially if you re-imagine it as a book showing artists intuiting and foreshadowing later research into neuroscience or cognition. That might not be quite as grand as Lehrer had intended, however.     •     •     •     •     •     •     •     •     •(Selected as the book-of-the-month for the reading group of the Down to a Science Science Café for November 2010.)"
129,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13369978-jana-light,4,"This was a very engaging book, even though I found some of Lehrer's conclusions problematic. In his discussion of the ways art anticipates certain breakthroughs in neuroscience, Lehrer elucidates the different knowledge spheres in which science and art exist and how those the two ""cultures"" (as he calls them) can only enhance each other if approached as equally significant and unique in their contributions to the conversation of what it means to be human. Ultimately, science describes what *""is"" and art describes what ""is"" ""feels like,"" and that often ""feels like"" precedes understanding of what ""is."" Being human means feeling before understanding, and as such both disciplines together can help us sort out the complexity of humanity and The Self.As I happen to love most the artists Lehrer uses to frame each chapter (Woolf, Stravinsky, Cezanne, Whitman, to name a few -- I loathe Stein's writing but appreciate her literary/psychological goals and influence), I particularly enjoyed the bits of artistic criticism and analysis in the book. The descriptions of how the brain works when someone presents a cohesive self, listens to a piece of music, recalls a memory, etc., were also interesting as I have very little science in my postsecondary educational background and everything was written in such a way that even science dummies like me can easily grasp the concepts and processes described. If I could crudely summarize Lehrer's conclusion concerning how the brain operates, the brain and its functions do not operate like a ""mirror"" as we most often assume, but as a ""tool"" by which we categorize, see, perceive and ultimately experience reality. The concept of reality is, as a result, difficult, and we would do best to keep an open mind and benefit from the insights we can glean from all spheres of knowledge -- those spheres to which art and science contribute included.One criticism I have of the book (besides the couple aforementioned problematic conclusions) was that Lehrer really seemed to be writing a book centered on the psychologist William James and his contributions or influences. James pops up in almost every chapter, so much so that it seems to unveil a bias or the scraps of a previously-rejected book proposal. It's like this book is Lehrer's _William James's Contributions to Art, Literature and Neuroscience_ reframed for popular consumption. I don't think this is a particularly black mark against reading the book, but for some reason it annoyed me. It needed to be acknowledged; it made the book at the end seem somehow slightly disingenuous. I toyed between giving this book a 3-star or 4-star rating. I think I will stick with 4-star as I learned much about how the brain works and thoroughly enjoyed the interdisciplinary approach. I'd like to reread Lehrer's _How We Decide_, I have his _Imagine_ on deck for reading, and this book only solidified my intent to read those works. "
130,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5000686-ibrahim-miqdady,4,"From his neuroscience lab, and inspired by Proust's Swann's Way, Johah Lehrer writes this masterpiece on the intimate not-so-celebrated relationship between Science, with all it's capabilities to produce a vastly acceptable understanding of the human mind, and Art, with all it's unfamous, yet significant, contributions to the modern understanding of life as we know it.Proust was not a neuroscientist, but indeed very close to be one. This well-written book sheds the light on the aspects of modern scientific understanding of the human mind, that was previously analysed and assembled by artists of all kinds. From Novelists, Poets, Linguistics, to Musicians and actual paint-on Artists. This book is a great entry to what the author has called a Third (or a fourth) culture that brings scientists and artists together, on the same table, for a more realistic understanding of life, realizing and acknowledging each others' weaknesses and strengths, and visualizing the world through both; the abstract analysis exerted by Science, and the beauty of the human experience enjoyed and presented by Art.It took me a long time to finish this book, not that it made bored, but every time I come back to read, i felt the need to go over what I read the previous time. It was out of being interested in reading and actually remembering the interpretations it presents.The book goes through many important contributions of artists of all kinds to the development of neuroscience,yet in a not very science-detailed manner, that gives the reader the freedom of being not so acknowledged with the detailed scientific explanations, that the average reader can get to the point. The author makes a great effort highlighting the reductionist approach of science, and how every experiment we do, and every discovery we stumble upon, is the result of us trying to reduce science into atoms, smaller particles, individual and independent processes, projecting all the fragments into the laws of physics and chemistry. The book discusses a controversial idea about Science. Is Science really omnipotent? Can it really answer all the questions human beings have been asking throughout the centuries? And more importantly, can it do all this independently from individual experiences, and art? The author amazingly states his conclusion saying: ""It is ironic but true; that the one reality science cannot reduce is the only reality we will ever know...that no map of matter will ever explain the immateriality of our consciousness"".The last 2 two chapters were definitely the best ones, but the other 6 chapters weren't any less great. This is a highly-recommended book for whoever feels interested in science in general, and neuroscience in particular.And as he stated it; The greater one's science, the deeper the sense of mystery."
131,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4992141-keshov-sharma,4,"This is a very fascinating read. I must expose my bias: I am a college freshman looking to study Neuroscience. Nonetheless, the spread of concepts, ideas, references, and interesting footnotes makes this book a solid read for almost anyone one. The book progresses nicely, opening with a very hooking concept (Whitman and the unity of body and soul) and closing with kicker (Woolf and the self, as well as a call to purpose in the Coda). The middle does get a bit slow for anyone that does not have an experience or link with the artists referenced but can be fascinating if you do. For example, I was not captivated by the chapters on Gertrude Stein and linguistics and Proust and Memory because I do not have any experience with these artists and their work. However, because I have done some painting, I found the chapter on Cezanne utterly fascinating. My music background also allowed me to enjoy the chapter on Stravinsky. In the end, this book is completely my cup of tea because it addresses some of the most fascinating topics in Neuroscience and connects them to the work of artists. I found that my appreciation of art and the humanities has been further increased by reading this book (coming from a family of scientists, that is really saying something for a book of 256 pages). It is well researched and very entertaining. Anyone interested in Neuroscience, the bridge between science and art, philosophy of the mind, or art history should give this book a read. With that said, I must reveal why this book does not get a fifth star. Although it is one of the best book I have ever read, I rob it of one star because 1.) at certain points, the abuse of a single, stylish word was very annoying and 2.) the book does not fulfill the expectation drawn to it. One the first point, there are two words, verisimilitude and avant-garde, that just too frequent at certain points. Although this is nit-picky, I find that abusing stylish and attention mongering words does detract from the reading experience. Secondly, the expectation that these artists foresaw these concepts in Neuroscience is not met to my criteria, in that I expected them to consciously foresee these concepts and to explicitly express that they had discovered them. As a scientist at heart, this is what I need to see to meet such an expectation. However, I will credit Lehrer with his mountains of supporting evidence that lead me to believe that these artists might have had a ""blindsight"" to their discoveries - never consciously perceiving that they had discovered something about the human mind, but unconsciously pursuing something that they found true in human nature. At the baseline: a killer read that will blow your mind at least once."

I've read bits and pieces about most of these artists and bits and pieces about neurology, but Lehrer pulls things together in a succinct way. At times, I think the arguments are a bit forced, but they are still interesting, and all the pieces alone are worth learning about along the way. This would work well for an honors seminary or even a common reading / first year reading since it's multidisciplinary. An interesting book on how art and science can complement each other despite their radically different methods. Ch. 1 ""Walt Whitman: The Substance of Feeling."" Lehrer argues that Whitman saw the embodied nature of the mind a century or more before neurologists did. Lehrer draws on selections from Whitman's Song of Myself and compares them to scientific support for the mind-body connection.Ch. 2 ""George Eliot: The Biology of Freedom."" Lehrer shows how Eliot argued against deterministic views of human nature by insisting that people had free will and self-determinism despite the ways that many argued that people are merely a product of biology or of their social position. Lehrer examines journal entries as well as passages from Eliot's fiction, primarily Middlemarch. Ch. 3 ""August Escoffier: The Essence of Taste."" Lehrer traces the career of a famous French chef who discovered the 5th taste before scientists isolated it: umami--a savory flavor found in cheese, eggs and broth. Ch. 4 ""Marcel Proust: The Method of Memory."" Lehrer demonstrates how Proust's novels explored the subjective nature of memory before neurologists did. Ch. 5 ""Paul Ce'zanne: The Process of Sight."" Lehrer describes Ce'zanne's exploration of how sight imposes structure on external stimuli rather than acting as a mirror of nature. Ch. 6 ""Igor Stravinsky: The Source of Music."" Lehrer discusses Stravinky's deconstruction of musical techniques to show how auditors impose structure on sounds when processing them and how people get bored once they find predictable patterns. Instead, people want a hint of a pattern that composers then defy and contort. Ch. 7 ""Gertrude Stein: The Structure of Language."" Lehrer shows how Stein anticipates Chomsky's deep structure view of language. The more Stein tried to shatter language into nonsense, the more her poetry demonstrated that people insist on imposing order. Ch. 8 ""Virginia Woolf: The Emergent Self"" Lehrer traces the construction of the self that Woolf performs throughout her writing, showing that the nature of individual identity shimmers and shape shifts more than it remains still and in tact.

133,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32666518-matt,3,"I was weary about reading this book after the whole kerfuffle with the author fabricating and plagiarizing material for a different book, but I found this in a thrift store for a buck and decided to finally give it a shot. It's an enjoyable book. The premise is that famous artists reveal fundamental concepts about the human mind that have only recently been discovered by neuroscience. This sounds a bit cornier than it is. A lot of college lit students end up writing a paper proving that Euripides invented feminism or that Jane Austen followed the principles of postmodernism hundreds of years before they existed. This book isn't quite so trite. It often reveals that the authors and artists it discusses were actually interested in the science of the mind. The chapters vary in quality (the George Eliot one was my least favorite), but are generally solid. Sadly, despite the fact that many of the artists seem to have lived in the same period and even to have commented on each other's work, the book makes little effort to connect one chapter to another. Each chapter essentially stands alone.Each chapter combines a mixture of biography, literary or art criticism, and scientific explanation. I'm sure specialists in each of these fields could find errors. I found few, but I did find myself sometimes disappointed with the overblown way that the author tries to present the sense of wonder in his narrative. And despite the remarkable breadth of knowledge that the author demonstrates in combining criticism with scientific insight, sometimes he tries to show off his polymathy a bit too much by dropping in seemingly irrelevant quotations from Bob Dylan or Shakespeare.I think my favorite part of the book was it's knack for good exposition (the logic and conclusions are usually less impressive). Much of the material here was new to me, so getting to learn about the discovery of MSG and the modernization of French cooking by Auguste Escoffier were enough to satisfy my palate, even without the add neurological element.My other big criticism is that the author frequently likes to claim that someone is ""deconstructing"" something, when they really are simply challenging a tradition or applying analytic principles. I hate when people misuse this word, and it was a particularly painful blow to suffer through so many false ""deconstructions"" only to have Lehrer slip into the usual tired anti-postmodernist rhetoric near the end of the book. The end of the book was so promising. He calls for us to bridge the gaps between arts and science, and he disproves that airhead Steven Pinker, and just when I was happiest with the book BAM!, he ignorantly skewers the old postmodernist straw man and loses me entirely."
134,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2296281-brandon,4,"In Proust Was a Neuroscientist, Jonah Lehrer shows how many revolutionary artists started their insurrections by accurately rendering in their work how they physically experienced life. Essentially, Lehrer offers a scientific look at aesthetics of 8 artists. In each case, audiences responded to an aesthetic truth that could not have been verified scientifically at the time.In the chapter on the chef Auguste Escoffier, Lehrer overturns the adage that there is no accounting for taste. Do eggs basted in bacon fat taste better? If the brain being mapped by science has anything to do with it, yes. I won't go into the whole explanation here other than to say it has to do with converting amino acids into glutamate, and that cooked meat is a prime example of this conversion.In these cases, the artistic instincts turn out to have neurological explanations. Most of the artists Lehrer investigates come from literature: Marcel Proust of course, Walt Whitman, George Eliot, Gertrude Stein and Virginia Woolf. Paul Cezanne's painting went beyond ""the limits of light,"" as Lehrer writes, and requires our brains to see more than what's before us because the ""brain is not a mirror."" For music, Lehrer considers how Igor Stravinsky's Rite of Spring modified the dopamine neurons first in the brains of the musicians who played it and later how it did the same for audiences who heard it more than once.Long ago, Octavio Paz said that ""Poets are scientists of the senses."" In Proust Was a Neuroscientist, Leher offers the scientific goods that prove Paz was correct when he got there first.postscript: After Lehrer's fall from grace primarily for ""self-plagiarism"" (this concept seems oxymoronic; can I steal from myself?), I ran search on plagiarism and this title and found many gloating blog posts that couldn't bother to cite an example. I did find mention of Lehrer failing to cite another journalist's work, which is a real transgression. Unfortunately, the blogger failed to cite the original journalist wronged. So please take the above review as representative of my thoughts from several years ago. If you have specific evidence of plagiarism in Proust Was a Neuroscientist in which Lehrer steals ideas or language from another writer, please leave a comment directing me to those articles, because at present, the vapid blogosphere has worn out my interest in the topic.

135,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1286392-tom,3,"I picked this book up for $2 at a local book store on their “bargain” chair, yes, bargain chair. Basically it tells that there were people (artists of various stripes) who with their books, food, etc., predated scientific findings in, particular, the neurological field. One could make a case that he, obviously, picked people who happen to “prove” what he wants to say. And to actually call these people “neuroscientists” is a bit of a stretch - and, certainly, to claim that these people “knew” what they were talking about that only in the last several years neuroscience has come to understand was a bit hard to believe. It took me several readings on some paragraphs because of some of the “technical” talk but overall, one could follow it fairly well.One of the coolest stories was of a chef, August Escoffier, who created dishes that took on the flavor of “umami” (Japanese word that roughly means, “delicious”). Umami, is the taste of L-glutamate (the dominant amino acid in the composition of life). It, L-Glutamate, is released by death, rot, or cooking. It goes back to a chemist, Ikeda, who wanted to know why the Japanese dish, Dashi, was so good. It had another taste unlike the four basic tastes we are used to (salty, sweet, sour, bitter)…it was, umami. Could the tongue actually taste something called, “delicious”? Ikeda actually created MSG. Many, at the time, said MSG wouldn’t do well because we couldn’t “taste” it…but, man, was it delicious! And it (MSG) became an overnight sensation.But the question that still plagued Ikeda was can we actually “taste” umami? Can we taste, without a doubt, “delicious”? More than 90 years later scientists in 2000 and 2002 discovered that our tongues have two distinct receptors that sense only glutamate and L-amino acids - and have named these receptors - umami receptors. So indeed, we can taste “deliciousness” that is separate from salty, sweet, sour or bitter.The author does a great job of weaving each persons personal history into the story and, again, makes the science part not way too technical that it makes the average person, like myself, slam the book down never to pick it up again. I think a second reading of it later on may prove to be beneficial to be able to grasp some of the concepts he was talking about and in being able to explain the book a little better. It was a good read."
136,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1082965-jean,4," I originally grabbed this on what felt like a whim for my first subway ride to work after finishing ""The Beautiful Fall"". In the subway, I realized that my streaming thoughts on Drake's recounts of YSL and his obssession for Proust had associated this to be a sequel of sorts, but the title is pretty much all that remotely connects the two. My curiosity was piqued by the premise that art is led to a lot of the truths that science now claims for its own. I've always felt that art is necessary, not a luxury, for the whole of human existence/experience, and this book did indeed confirm my convictions. Lehrer's argument that science is not the end-all to life's mysteries is something that has been on my mind for a while. The common argument for the supremacy of science over the arts is that it provides the main tools necessary to understand how things really are, and that without it, humanity is doomed to floundering in ignorance or superstition. In the same vein, the arts are considered as trivial and exploited for the sake of inflated egos and gross flights of fancy. Lehrer's examples of artists from different disciplines and their intuitive discoveries predate the corresponding scientific confirmation. For example, Proust thought outside of the box on how our memory is fallible and ever-changing, providing the framework in which science could explore the synapses behind it. And even after the scientific explanations, it is clear that no medical journal could encompass the whole of the memory or how it permutates over time to become something altered and yet still retain the same sense of truth. Ironically enough, this book helped me understand some of the things that I studied during my undergrad years better than when I had first heard of it in school, and reminded me why I had originally wanted to major in neuroscience. I especially enjoyed the sections on George Eliot (malleability of the brain), Paul Cezanne (process behind vision), Igor Stravinsky (question of good music), and Virginia Woolf (our streaming consciousness). The book ends with a reminder that some things, like the awareness of self, cannot be explained and may never be, but that art teaches us how to live with these mysteries. ""When we venture beyond the edge of our knowledge, all we have it art."" Yay for art! (And I guess, science.)"
137,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/648132-katie-bruce,3,"I liked this book! How's that for a stellar review?For one, this book reminded me of something I may have read for a class in college, in a good way. I tend to miss academic learning and this book gave me just the taste I was looking for, you know, once a year or so. Also, Lehrer makes neuroscience very accessible. I actually understood almost everything he was talking about! Much to my surprise. In my opinion, some of the literature references might actually be more difficult for those unacquainted with the subject than the science.Also, my little English major heart was made happy by the subject of this book--the overlap between art and science. The humanities so often play second fiddle to science in our society, that it was nice to read about someone arguing the other way. I like call this societal view the ""James Franco problem."" James Franco has recently been gaining notoriety for pursuing a variety of humanities degrees while still continuing to act professionally. And he's been catching a lot of flack for this. People don't get why he would want to do this. However, do you think if James Franco was acting and say, pursuing a degree in physics or neuroscience at Yale that people would still have a problem? No way! They'd be praising him to no end. But creative writing? Fuhgeddaboutit. This book explains how we need both art AND science though. WE NEED BOTH, PEOPLE. See? Creative writing James Franco = imaginary scientist James Franco.Finally, I found some chapters in this book more compelling than others, as with any anthology-esque book. The Walt Whitman was a great way to start it off. I think that may have been my favorite. Also enjoyed George Eliot and the french chef. Those both stick out. I was again confused by Gertrude Stein. Although her chapter helped me understand what she was trying to do a little bit better. The fact that so many artists had an interest in pursuing science in their works is fascinating! I was almost compelled to pull out my copy of 'Tender Buttons'...almost. ;-)Full disclosure: I may have recently watched James Franco's appearance on Colbert, which may or may not have influenced the writing of this review. Also, the first review I wrote for this book was somehow not saved by goodreads. It was sad. The first one was better."
138,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3074982-keith,3,"A set of interesting biographies about 8 memorable people.Since I recently finished Middlemarch: A Study of Provincial Life by George Elliot, I found chapter 2 about George Elliot especially interesting as also chapter 2 where we eventually learn that there are really 5 kinds of taste buds and not just four.My initial reaction to Chapters 6, 7, and 8 is that I won't bother with Stravinski, Gertrude Stein or Virginia Woolf. But having finished each of those chapters, my initial reaction was probably the wrong conclusion. While reading the chapter on Stravinsky, I listened to the Rite of Spring (the only version I had was the Disney Fantasia version), and sure enough it has become accepted enough that it did not feel extreme to me. LIkewise Stein and Woolf might someday be something I want to read.Chapter 7 on language made me want to reread Language in Thought and Action. I know that linguists have more modern ideas, but when I read it, I found Hayakawa delightful.The author reminds us that fiction so often says things better than non fiction. This was really brought home to me when reading The Oz Principle: Getting Results through Individual and Organizational Accountability, a book that was rather boring except when it quoted from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. I stopped reading the boring business book, took a refreshing break to read The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and then went back to finish the modern business book. What a wonderful balance when we can learn more from fiction than non-fiction. Yet, I still read more non-fiction. Perhaps I need to reconsider my ways and get more classics in my diet."
139,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13097236-kurt,4,"I'm not sure if it ultimately matters if the neuroscience or the art/literary/culinary/etc. theory that Mr. Lehrer discusses in this book is factual or accurate or not. Ultimately, this discussion of the relationship between artistic creative advances and the later advances in neuroscience works because it gets you the reader thinking about how your mind works and your own consciousness functions. It is amazing how little we understand about how the mind/self works and how little reductionism/the scientific method can explain to us. What science can do though is open up a world of wonder about how much more there is that we cannot understand. While science's answers are incomplete, it does give us a good approach to understanding some of the underlying systems in the brain that help create this thing that we call the mind. Art, Literature, music, culinary art, etc. predated these advances, according to Lehrer, because artists were more willing to question the unknowable and were satisfied with not necessarily being able to find answers for these questions. This book is also amazing because it makes me want to get closer to many of the artistic subjects in it. I want to read Virginia Wolff again and closely look at what she was thinking about and seeing in her own mind. I want to listen to Stravinsky more closely and understand what he was attempting to do and the discoveries he made by attempting to destroy traditional form. I want to read Walt Whitman again and find my own understanding of my own consciousness in his poetry about the self. I still don't want to actually read Proust (more fun to read about than actually read imo) but I appreciate what he was trying to do with the sense of time. I haven't wanted to read classics for quite awhile and this book rekindled that interest.I know Lehrer is a controversial figure because of some later misquoting of sources and possible (self)-plagarism. This book doesn't seem to have the controversy behind it and I wonder if the later books (which I don't think you can actually buy anymore) are really that bad. Sometimes if you have a good idea that moves people to think about themselves more critically, more thoroughly then the actual facts might not matter that much. You still take a lot away from the experience."
140,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1477685-ted,3,"I like the premise of this book - that artists have managed to intuit things about human nature that neuroscience is only now discovering to be true - and have heard it from several other sources. But that's about all I really liked about the book - it follows a pretty basic format in each chapter of 1) Introduce the artist's work; 2)Introduce the brain science idea this relates to; 3) Kind of discuss the two in a pretty disjointed way. Also, I would think that Lehrer didn't really mean to say that Escoffier ""discovered"" our fifth taste, or that Proust ""knew"" about the unreliability of our memory - he often seems to give the impression that a lot of these artists were almost prophetic in their work, when really I think it came down to experience - Escoffier cooked the way he did because it tasted good, and Proust likely wrote about memory as an unreliable source because he found it to be through his own experience. I feel like in almost any Intro Cognitive/Neuro/Other Brain Science class, the professor will undoubtedly mention that a large number of modern experiments in brain science are really just empirically proving what we already probably guessed about human nature to being with - so in this sense, we're seemingly all ""neuroscientists"".This book would probably also be better for people who didn't study brain stuff in college... The things I enjoyed and got most out of the book was actually mostly about the artists and their art themselves. The only chapters that I really enjoyed were 3 - Escoffier and Taste, and 7 - Stravinsky and Music (both of these were actually quite good). I also liked 4 - Proust and Memory and 5 - Cezanne and Sight, though I liked these more for what Lehrer said about the artists and their work than for their correlation with modern brain science. Finally, Lehrer's writing style just started to drive me nuts - he manages to wax poetic or summarize complex ideas in a seemingly intentionally hip and concise way about just about... anything, just about... all the time. Stuff like ""Color became symbolic. Blurriness was chic. The gaze was out, the glance was in."" This might sound alright in isolation, but with nearly every paragraph ending this way, it becomes nearly vomit-inducing. Maybe just me."
141,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11848264-sumire,5,"I came upon this book on my way down to a camping weekend in Big Sur at a used book sale. My friend jokingly handed me this book in reference to my Neurobiology degree.While I wasn't the biggest fan of Lehrer's writing style, this was an eye-opening book. It confirmed many of the values and ideologies I have held since my early college days when I was contemplating between fine arts and biology to declare as a college major. Not only this, but it reminded me of the last discussion section of college class MCB 167: Neurobiology of Animal and Human Behavior. The takeaway from that discussion and this book was that the human experience endlessly modifies our consciousness. Science is able to explain so little.Lehrer explains that George Eliot (Middlemarch) is optimistic about this elastic view of our humanity. He says that this means that we can always improve ourselves. Cezanne shows that what we ""see"" is actually the highly modified version after the cortical brain project down and influence our actual sensations. The brain influences what we see because its goal is to make the experience of the world make sense for itself. So what is reality? Is it all a lie? Lehrer also talks about the self: ""the head holds a raucous parliament of cells that endlessly debate what sensations and feelings SHOULD become conscious."" We create a sense of being and self. It is a necessary fiction that the brain creates in order to make sense of its own disunity.The kernel of truth that I personally believe to be true is summarized in one sentence: ""What the artists in this book reveal is that there are many different ways of describing reality, each of which is capable of generating truth."" What does studying all of these different perspectives teach us about ourselves? I believe they help us to understand who we are because they give us a certain locus of control -- the different parts of our existence define our personal identity. Without a sense of who we are, how can we live purposeful lives? This is the only way out of the tragic human circumstance, of being aware of our existence simultaneously with our inevitable death. My question is, is it possible to know ourselves and love ourselves?"
142,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/298072-kj,3,"I was drawn to Jonah Lehrer's book when I saw a light blue paperback with a madeleine cookie on the cover along with the word ""neuroscientist"". Tasty looking indeed. When I opened it up, I saw that an entire chapter was devoted to George Eliot and ""The Biology of Freedom"". With little more info than that, I basically took the book to the cash register and had at it.To quote the description on the back, Lehrer's book explores the idea that ""when it comes to understanding the brain, art got there first."" Each chapter profiles a 19th-early 20th century artist and how their work revealed an understanding of how our brains function that neuroscience is only just beginning to discover. Most engaging was the chapter on chef Auguste Escoffier and the intuiting of umami- our only very recently canonized new taste- joining savory, sweet and the rest. The chapter on Stravinsky and how our brains learn to enjoy music was also refreshing.Overall, however, I find I was most alert while Lehrer profiled the artists, particularly as he located them within the scientific atmosphere of their time. Once each chapter switched to descriptions of neurological functioning, the writing became dense and hard to connect with. Maybe there's just no easy way to write about neuroscience no matter how many literary references one uses. Lehrer's effort is much appreciated, but still feels only mildly successful. I loved learning about the relationships (or animosities) these artists had to the scientific communities of their era, but the connection to what their art revealed about what we now know of the brain, still felt like a bit of a reach. But still interesting. Ultimately, I love Lehrer's goal of fostering dialogue and mutual understanding between science and art. ""We now know enough to know that we will never know everything. That is why we need art: it teaches us how to live with mystery. Only the artist can explore the ineffable without offering us an answer, for sometimes there is no answer...When we venture beyond the edge of our knowledge, all we have is art."" Beautiful."""

But, upon seeing it on a friends' shelf when i was without book (!), I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did!While Lehrer gave many simplified examples for several of his arguments, or while he attributed too much to single people [see article from Slate], I didn't mind and found it to be easy reading while giving the reader enough to ponder. The idea of this books is that many of the advancements made in neuroscience can be shown in example in the philosophies of artist long before science proved them (or even tried to prove them).Some of my favorite chapters are:* The Essence of Taste, which talked about the discovery of umami and its pared down amino acid, L-glutamate, by Kikunae Ikeda, the savory cooking style of August Escoffier, and the finding of the exact receptors on the tongue for this particular taste in 2000. Fascinating. It also made me hungry.* The Method of Memory, which discusses how faulty our memory is, how the act of remembering changes our memories, and how Marcel Proust philosophized on this very subject in his ""fiction.""* The Source of Music, which discusses our mind's plasticity, especially when it comes to sound, the corticofugal network (awesome), which continually alters what patterns our sensory cells respond to, and Stravinsky's experiment of these very phenomena with his Rite of Spring.* AND The Emergent Self, which discusses teh quest of neuroscientists to find the self in the contradictory mess of our short-term memory, the ""neural corelate of consciousness"" (NCC for short - c'mon - really??) and Virginia Woolf's experiments with demonstrating these functions and the self's elusiveness in her literature.This book is touted as a work that demonstrates how art trumps science, but I really see it as showing two sides of the same coin and how related the two really are. "
145,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2977132-jeff,4,"Lehrer's debut is a marvelous introduction into the linkages between literary modernism and neuroscience. Writing in a style at once youthful and insightful, he manages to balance an engrossing historical narrative of the life and work of some of the more colorful nineteenth- and twentieth-century artists with appropriately (at least for this reader) dumbed down scientific explanations of the foibles of memory, brain plasticity, and the language instinct. Jonah's intent doesn't seem to be to convince us of the irrefutability of his research, which, at times, is still very experimental. Rather he takes pleasure in the worthy exercise of paying homage to his literary and artistic heroes and suggesting that art, although idiosyncratic and subjective, is as relevant a discourse as science for understanding the peculiarities of the human mind. The book might appear too much like a multidisciplinary college dissertation, albeit a brilliant one, were it not for Lehrer's archivist's eye for curiosities and non-essential facts. He forays into George Elliot's love life, providing an unsparing description of her famous ugliness (on page 30 there is an drawing of what Victorian biologist Herbert Spencer describes as her ""low forehead, dull grey eye . . . vast pendulous nose""). He shows how Whitman's poetic revelation, the notion that the body and mind are inseparable, grew out of his work as a wound dresser treating amputated soldiers in Union hospitals. Perhaps most engaging, at least for someone interested in music, is his discussion of how Igor Stravinsky's Paris premiere of the The Rite of Spring led to a disastrous riot. As we learn in a section called Plato's mistake, it is not the rationality of music but its novelty that releases dopamine in the corticofugal network and makes us feel. All of this is, of course, remarkably fascinating and good fodder to impress your high-minded friends at cocktail parties. You also get your money's worth out of 197 pages.

There is indeed a lot of interesting information in this book, and I quite enjoyed the juxtapositioning of ideas emerging from the arts throughout history and the concurrent (and future) scientific thinking on the same concepts. I was however disconcerted by the way the worlds of art and science are presented as being oppositional and even hostile to one another. That is just simply not my experience of those I know who consider themselves to be artists or scientists. Even if I were to accept this as being the case, I found many of the arguments presented for how some individual artists actually had a better grip on science than the scientists of their day silly at best. Many, many people of every age have feelings about how things work, including artists and scientists. We don't know what thoughts Joe Smith had back in the seventeenth century regarding how human memory works, because Joe Smith wasn't a famous artist, but obviously people pondered such concepts just as they do today. Taking individual artists and saying ""see, they knew what was going on long before science did"" is, to use a word Lehrer often applies to scientific thinking, reductionist (at best). Science provides explanations for the way things happen. That doesn't mean for a second that scientists didn't and don't differ in what they believe is actually happening in our world. There is often a large gap between belief and proof. There were undoubtedly those who viewed memory as Proust did, or consciousness as Wolfe saw it, just as there were undoubtedly artists who got it screamingly wrong. An argument can certainly be made that art and science are of equal importance, but they are not the same thing, they are not even different approaches to the same end. The arts are in part about the promotion of ideas, while science is about the more tedious work of painstakingly exploring and documenting the possible processes behind those ideas. Bottom line, Proust was not a neuroscientist. "
147,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/204691-ryan,4,"I had no idea what a book called Proust was a Neuroscientist would be about, but it came highly recommended on the intertubes. It was absolutely worth the read - his premise is that you can often find artists (be they painters, composers, authors, poets, or even a chef) that discovered interesting aspects of brain and sensory function before the science had a chance to think of experimenting on the ideas. It didn't really get anti-sciency, which was something I was nervous about after reading the introduction. But it's more that the artists served a function, in addition to producing their art, to become a font of hypotheses about the way we experience the world. It makes absolute sense - if science stays in the laboratory all the time, it won't function right. The best kind of science starts with people saying ""I wonder why"" or ""I wonder if"" - ideally triggered by doing things in the world. These cooks, writers and visionaries knew a lot more about the actual qualia (triple bonus word score for using the word that inspired my blog in an actual post) of existence than many of the scientists running experiments did at the time. Auguste Escoffier realized that we like hot food not just because you're supposed to cook the meat or warm ourselves up - it tasted better. Science figured out that the nose is more important to taste than the tongue is in terms of receptors. Impressionist painters saw the world in blotches and mixes of colors, which is actually how our eyes see the world. Our brains are relied upon to make sense of a very rudimentary primary set of visual data. Proust himself wrote very uniquely about memory (as did Virginia Woolf) - presenting people that don't remember things accurately, which is often ignored in fiction. It's a neat introduction to some psychological and neurological ideas that definitely does not get bogged down in details. If you like Oliver Sacks, you'll like this book."
148,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5642319-anthony-cannistra,4,"In light of the bad press Jonah Lehrer has gotten in the past few years for his questionable quotation and possible plagiarism in Imagine: How Creativity Works and How We Decide, I entered into this book with at least one or two grains of salt at the ready. However, I found Proust Was a Neuroscientist to be a well-rounded approach to the intersection of some literary works and the neuroscience that has since been found to stand behind their philosophies. Having studied some of the neurobiological and psychological results Lehrer mentions previously, I am undoubtedly coming from a place where most of my critical thinking went toward the mentions of literary work rather than understanding the neuroscience. One of the most enjoyable parts of this book was Lehrer's references to quotations in the texts he works with, which really strengthen his arguments in places. However, that's not to say that Lehrer makes a strong argument for his thesis at all times, in fact quite the opposite. He often makes some unsupported claims, but it was easy for me to overlook them in favor of the choice selections of text and the mentions to real science, letting my own sensibilities connect them to the extent I was comfortable with. In addition, the references to literary works I'd never heard of before were eye-opening, and it's clear that Lehrer has absolutely done his homework in preparing this book. For someone who has given at least some thought to the societal dichotomy of humanities and science, this book is at the very least a good place to find food for thought. "

Points out the obvious to some extent (i.e., the connections he makes between histoircal figures and how they translate into now what can be taken as scientific regulations is sometimes far reaching or very general (many figures could have been used to create the connections) -- in my opinion of course. Worth the read if you're interested in the subject though! Personal rating would be 3 stars. But that's partly influenced by the fact that this is not the type of book I would generally gravitate towards."
150,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/858854-timothy,4,"As the title suggests, this is a book that probes on this theme that artists and writers are the ones who have had all the answers to the various neuro questions we all had. All the mysteries and alchemy of neuroscience have been answered by unscientific methods. this is what exactly is being suggested. It may all seem like a chimera, totally wild, absurd and unscientific thought. However, this book probes us to hazard that guess and goes on to prove his point. In fact when one thinks deeper into this issue, it does not seem too grandiose or even to the extreme of being imbecilic. Artists and writers are in fact the best observers of the surroundings. it is always through experience and keen observations that writers and artists derive their inspirations from. Their descriptions and narratives are all based on the actual happenings in life, which would beyond doubt coincide snugly with conclusions that scientists drawn from their theories. It should not be surprising that artists hazarded a guess on some neurological questions before scientists. However, in some aspects, this book discredited the ability and need for scientists. The contributions of scientists to answering some of nature's most perplexing questions should be given greater credit. Though the process may be slower, in comparison with artists, yet the whole nature of science is brilliant as it is ephemeral. By systematically breaking down a huge problem into bite size one and seeking to provide solutions is science's beauty. Science tries to add concrete facts to aid in its explanations,hence providing a solution that has a totally different facade from the observations that artists and writers provide.Yet, this book is indeed an enjoyable read. it is a book that tries to provide a paradigm shift in our thinking of science and more specifically neuroscience. "
151,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4485143-david,3,"This is a book that has as its thesis that artists, mainly in the 1800s and early 1900s anticipated the findings of modern neuroscience in their art. It is a lovely idea -- that great poets, novelists and painters were ahead of their time with their art. However, ""Proust Was a Neuroscientist"" is a lot like a Malcolm Gladwell book in that it often gives the illusion of making a profound point, while falling apart if you actually think hard about the claims being made.I almost abandoned this book after reading the first two chapters on Walt Whitman and George Eliot. The Eliot chapter is definitely on the boring side, and the claim that she anticipated modern understandings of freedom and determinism is weak, at best. You can certainly read Eliot as *reaction* against the ""modern"" science of her day that argued that everything is determined in advance. However, to make her a precursor of modern neuroscience again, is a nice thought that doesn't really stand up to scrutiny.The third chapter about taste is interesting, and the neuroscience is interesting as well. Again, the connection is a little less than convincing. However, the chapter is quite entertaining and interesting. Perhaps the most convincing is Stravinsky -- how his ""Rite of Spring"" went from being hated to being accepted as a masterpiece, and how that process occurs in the brain, is the most convincing chapter of the book.On the whole, this book is best read as you would a Malcom Gladwell book (see my review of ""Outliers"". If you go looking for revolutionary truth or even just practical knowledge that you can apply to your life, you will be disappointed. On the other hand, if you want to learn a little about some great artists and are interested in how the brain works, you will enjoy the book a lot. I went the latter route and enjoyed it."
152,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7310589-tadeas-petak,3,"Jonah Leher first had the idea for this book when he worked in a neuroscience lab of Dr. Eric Kandel, a nobel prize laureate in medicine. He would read Proust when carrying out experiments and it dawned on him that Proust was spot on with regards to memory a long time ago before (neuro)scientists had any proper understanding of how our memory actually works. And that this holds true for many other artists as well. Which is exactly what this book is all about - writers, painters, poets, even cooks who anticipated scientific discoveries, people who predicted what we believe now even though in their days, it was often regarded as controversial or just plain wrong.It was an interesting read, one of those that generate plenty of other titles to immerse oneself into, but the main Leher's thesis seems a bit strained to me. I understand that he needed a main thread that would hold the entire book together. But at quite a few places, I felt I would rather have all the wonderful pieces of stories without him constantly reminding me of his own distaste for scientific reductionism. Don't get me wrong, I agree with him for the most part but after the first couple of chapters, there is no need to rehash it over and over again. Also, the credibility of the book went downhill once I read about him fabricating quotes in some of his previous books.Nevertheless, I would recommend it to anyone interested in popular science. It is a quick, rather simple book given the topic it focuses on (neuroscience) with a lot of fun facts about quite a few famous people. I feel it can serve as a good introduction to the field that could help you decide if you want to dive deeper or just stay on the surface."

The chapters look at Walt Whitman, George Eliot, Auguste Escoffier, Proust, Igor Stravinsky, Gertrude Stein & Virginia Wolf. Whitman knew feelings began in the flesh. A quote: ""Neuroscience knows what Whitman's poetry spoke the truth: emotions are generated by the body. Ephemeral as they seem, our feels are actually rooted in the movements of our muscles and the palpitations of our insides. Furthermore, these material feelings are an essential element of the thinking process. As the neurosicientist Antonio Damasio notes, ""The mind is embodied...not just embrianed."" “knowledge emerges from the litter of our mistakes…” Jonah Lehrer""How does the brain generate our metaphysical feelings from the physical body? According to Damasio, after an ""emotive stimulus"" (such as a bear) is seen, the brain automatically triggers a wave of changes in the ""phyical viscera,"" as the body prepares for action. The heart begins to pound, arteries dialte, the intestines contract, the adrenaline pours into the bloodstream. These bodily changes are then detected by the cortex, which connects them to the scary sensation that caused the changes in the first place. The resulting mental image—an emulsion of thought and flesh, body and soul—is what we feel. It is an idea that has passed through the vessel of the body.""Just as leaves of grass grow out of the dirt, feelings grow out of flesh. What Whitman wanted to show was how these two different substances—the grass and the dirt, the body and the mind—were actually inseparable.I and the mystery, here we stand.

154,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4975321-joseph,1,"Well, after doing a bit of research on Jonah Lehrer and finding that he plagiarized his way out of a job at both the New Yorker and Wired, I can't really take any of his claims seriously.But even assuming all of his sources were correct, his arguments don't seem to match the thesis he's trying to defend. Basically, Lehrer wants science and the arts to have more of a dialogue, since as he claims there were artists who saw truths it took scientists decades or centuries to come to understand. This apparently says something about art in general and how it can filter the findings of science through an artist's own subjective experiences and somehow generate more science down the road. But then he ignores this claim to focus on just a handful of figures, making pretty much the same argument for all of them: 1. Introduce the figure, and spend 5 pages in slavish adoration of their art. 2. Reduce their art to something you can torture into a scientific claim. 3. Show that the science of the time opposed the ""claim"" the artist made. Throw around a bunch of Scary Religious Words like ""dogma"" to paint science as an uncool thing that's more concerned with enforcing rules than seeking after truth. 4. Show that the artist has been ""vindicated"" by modern science.Then, after 5 or 6 figures, claim this is indicative of some sort of broader trend, don't explain the trend, and suddenly pretend that science is cool again. Seriously, this argument is nonsensical and poorly written, and does nothing to ""advance"" the dialogue between science and the arts. I don't even know why he wants some sort of fusion between science and the arts, since they're both trying to do fundamentally different things anyway."
155,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22094221-morgan,4,"Proust was a Neuroscientist is part history, part explanations of scientific theories of the brain. The historical aspects are well described and very interesting. The scientific aspects tantalize a bit more than they explain, but are also incredibly interesting.Each chapter describes a different non-scientist who held beliefs about the world that conflicted with contemporary views on the brain. The people chronicled range from a poet (Walt Whitman) to a chef (Auguste Escoffier). The chapters first explain the person, then their insight and how it relates to the brain. There's a lot of discussion about how the brain may work, and various aspects of how sense perceptions and consciousness may work.While all of the people chronicled in the book had views that went against the established science of their day, not all of them interacted with that contradiction. Some were interested in science and incorporated the parts they liked into their work, others looked at the common scientific wisdom of the day and consciously rejected it, still others just did the thing they wanted to do with no bother as to what a scientist of the day may say. The main thing they all had in common was a dedication to exploring the way their own experience of the world worked. I'd say one of the best parts of the book is how this confidence in subjectivity and self-experience is promoted.The book ends with a call to action for artists and for scientists. Lehrer wants people involved in both pursuits to talk more, and to talk with more respect and understanding. He feels that the reductionism of science and the experientialism of art can add to each other. Without both art and science, people will miss a part of life."
156,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4100341-ashley,4,"Recently I've been fascinated by this 4-layer cake of neuroscience, psychology, sociology, and the arts, how these seemingly disparate disciplines reach surprisingly similar conclusions regarding human nature: neuroplasticity is cognitive behavioral therapy is open-mindedness is abstract art. One can approach some existential inquiry from any of these 4 pathways, adjusting their focus from the detail-oriented neuroscience, then broadening it to the right-brained, intuitive artist's perspective, and somehow fall upon the same results. Thus, reading this book was a no brainer to me, as this is its primary message. I imagine this book helps those who are more scientific minded appreciate various art forms and introduces them to the available outlets. The chapter on Virginia Woolf in particular inspired me to follow-up with her literature, particularly Mrs. Dalloway for her unabashed exposure of human consciousness. The idea that intuition brings us into the same realms of truth as the scientific method is a concept that may be difficult to digest for some; however, some of the chapters were not as shocking in their artistic and scientific parallels, and felt like somewhat of a stretch to fit Lehrer’s pre-defined mold. However, I felt there was some dissonance in his discussions of materialism/reductionism and phantom limb pain. He proclaimed that the existence of phantom limb pain was evidence of the reductionism, but I feel it exemplified the opposite. But overall, I think he succeeds in creatively intertwining two trains of thought that are often mistakenly severed."

I still enjoyed reading it thoroughly and found much in it that I thought was valuable; for all I know much of that was because Lehrer was more interested in telling a good story, and maybe flattering my prejudices, than telling the truth. I'm not sure what would be worse; for this book to be partially bullshit, or for it to be relatively untouched by Lehrer's fabrications and still dismissed because of the author's sins. I can no longer recommend it to people, that's for sure. The three stars here are a compromise between my initial five-star review and the one star I am tempted to give it now.I already knew and enjoyed Lehrer's work on Radiolab, but I wasn't quite prepared for how great Proust Was a Neuroscientist is. Some of the stuff in it I knew from other science books (and even Radiolab), but the chapters on taste, vision, the self, memory, and so on were all fairly revelatory. This is the kind of book that you burn through (in my case, saving the last chapter like it was the last season of the Wire, not quite wanting to be done it) and then walk around recommending to literally (and I do mean literally) everyone you meet for a few weeks. I read a friend's copy, but I need to own my own copy and soon. You can slot this one with Carl Wilson's book on Celine Dion as one of the best nonfiction books I've ever read (nonphilosophy division) and one of the few that actually changes the way you look at the world.

I like this idea, and I agree with it, but I found that the most interesting chapters were about artists and neuroscientists I hadn't already heard about. Knowing that smell is closely connected to memory (probably from Lehrer's blog, which I read and recommend), I wasn't surprised with anything in the Proust chapter. However, I wasn't familiar with the research on umami (""fullness"" sensation of a food of MSG infame), so the chapter on Escoffier was the most exciting. Lehrer's writing style is different from most other psychology books I've read: he uses technical language to explain an idea, and then simplifies the idea to an easily remembered phrase (which strongly reminds me of Isaiah: parallelism, alliteration, and paradoxes are all friends here). Example: ""Subjects repeatedly exposed to androstenone [steroid in human sweat/urine:] become more sensitive to it, thanks to feedback from the brain. This feedback causes the stem cells in the nasal passages to create more androstenone-sensitive odor receptors. The new abundance of cells alters the sensory experience. What was once a perfume becomes piss."" And again: ""The Rite started a riot""; ""Stein showed us what we put into language by leaving it out."" Lehrer uses this technique all over the place, and sometimes I can't decide if I think it's cool or annoying. "

Lehrer fails to actually prove or even clearly argue for the ostensible main point of the book, which is that artists discovered - in the scientific sense of the word - truths about the mind which neuroscience is only now uncovering. Instead, he produced a wonderful book about how artists described or depicted phenomena of the mind so accurately that one can use them as examples to support neuroscientific ideas.Through a series of delightful self-contained chapters, Lehrer takes interesting art pieces and interesting modern science which relates to them and sort of mashes them together. The results vary, as one would expect from such a haphazard process. Some reveal his sexist bias, others his inadequate research into a field which he isn't involved in; to me, the best feature neuroscience which he has clearly studied thoroughly.There is an underlying point in the book which to me is more important than the advertised one, which is that neuroscience cannot establish causal links with the phenomena of consciousness, only correlative ones. Thus, art will always provide a useful lens into the workings of the mind, the clarity and character of which depends on the quality of the artist. Lehrer's knack for finding piquant facts and intriguing art makes this tasty brain popcorn; a remotely plausible or testable hypothesis, it has not. "
162,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1340898-denis,4,"This is a really fantastic look at how different artists working in different mediums (literature, painting, music, and even cuisine) were able to achieve insights into the way the human mind works that flew in the face of the science of the day, only to be confirmed by more recent discoveries in neuroscience. The central thesis of the book is that our knowledge about what it is to be human is impoverished when science and art are set at odd with each other, and the author makes his point extremely well through most of the book. What makes his points compelling is that he does a good job of balancing the art with the science, but unfortunately that balance falls apart in the last two chapters. It seriously undermines his ultimate conclusion about the need for art and science to communicate when his penultimate chapter on Gertrude Stein is devoid of any of the clearly presented scientific foundation that he gave to his earlier chapters (a couple of vague references Noam Chomsky just don't cut it). Although the flawed final chapters forced me to take a step back from my initial rapturous reaction, they don't change the fact that the overall argument is sound, and the keen insights that make up the bulk of the book are more than enough to make it an extremely worthwhile book to read."
163,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4654733-sophie,3,"The idea behind this is that artists first thought of ideas that neuroscience only afterwards 'discovered'. E.g. Proust first set out that memory is transient and can be recalled randomly by, for example, the taste of a madeleine, something that was found to be true later by experiment.Does that sound a bit simplistic to you? It did to me. And it was. Some of the science explanations are a bit patronising in their dumbing down and a lot of the connections are a bit far-fetched. It's an interesting idea and a lot of the information in the book is fascinating (I particularly liked the chapter on Escoffier). But the problem I had with it is that the things that Lehrer says that the various artists 'knew' were in fact often things that lots of people knew from experience. Scientists 'knew' that these things were so from experience, which is why they started researching them to find out why they were so. It felt as though he'd just looked for a tag he could hang some science off to make people read it.And that's the other thing that annoyed me about this book: he used a lot of the experiments and science he'd already used in his previous book 'The Decisive Moment'. Often with a slight twist, but it's still the same experiments.So in conclusion: don't bother buying it, but it has enough of interest in it that it's worth picking up if you see it in the library."

I didn't listen, because the title intrigued me so much. I don't regret having read the book, but she was definitely right about it.The book discusses eight different artists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and how they came to discover things that would later be proven true by scientists. Some of the connections Lehrer makes are interesting. I especially enjoyed the chapters on Escofier, a prominent French chef who discovered the concept of umami, or deliciousness, which is a taste associated with glutamates and is found in a lot of food we eat. I also thought the chapter on Stravinsky was fun, but the rest? Well, it turned out that the book was good for my bedtime reading for a reason. Zzzzz.I love Lehrer's work on Radio Lab, a podcast I regularly listen to, and I'm told his other books are better, but this one was just way too boring for me.

So the concept of this book alone makes me really really happy. But also-- well carried out. Seriously, this is such a smart way to show why we need both. Near the start, I mildly took issue with the fact that Lehrer uses art as support for scientific principles; because the value of art doesn't lie solely in relation to quantifiable stuff. But as the book progresses, it becomes less and less of an issue (and at some point he outright says just what I wanted him to say, so yay). And though I seriously doubt it was his intention, Lehrer managed to make me value science a little more, especially in relation to visual art (the Cezanne chapter messed with my brain) and music. It's just really nice to see concrete examples of how intertwined things are. Not to mention that I just learned a lot.And this has nothing to do with the inherent quality of the book, but the fact that it exists and is pretty widespread gives me small amounts of hope for how people will eventually come to view this stuff.

I liked that when he was writing about scientific research, he didn't use a lot of technical jargon, but kept it simple with layman's terms. I wasn't all that hip on his personal tack that appeared in the book, but you really almost can't get rid of that in any book. He came at each subject/chapter with his personal belief that we are magnificent machines that can think and feel. That is all well and good, except that in his model, there is no God that made the machines. I don't happen to share that belief. But each person that reads this will draw their own conclusions on that subject, if they even find it in there at all. And that really isn't what this book is about. That was just my little hang-up with it. It has to do with tying together the observations of art with the facts of science and how they have revealed many things to each other. I love that. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys art and who would like to learn more about how their brain works. Fascinating stuff. I would still love to discuss this book with someone else who has read it. Any takers? "
167,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4665070-bill-wheelock,4,"Pretty good. Makes some leaps in logic and attempts to revise history in a way to show that artists were discovering facts about how we perceive before we had the scientific evidence to prove them. Now we can prove them. OK, but that isn't really a surprise, and when you pick and choose from the past of art history, you can pretty much find examples to fit any scientific theory.What is interesting are the big ideas: that there may be biological explanation for the need for an avant-garde. ""New""ness in music composition, narrative structure, and culinary arts can actually help our brains grow. It explains why the avant-garde is usually perceived as ugly at first, as it confounds the synapses the brain expects to fire. Most of all I find comforting the model of consciousness described in the section on Virginia Woolf; that individual ""self""-hood is like a consensus arrived at from an aggregate of sensations mixed with memories and spun into narrative. That is how the brain arrives at truth. Pretty shaky grounds actually, but nothing you would want to do without. I especially liked seeing some mention of Henri Bergson, the philosopher most influential to Proust. Bergson is hugely underrated today. "

First of all, if you have not read Middlemarch or if you are planning to re-read it in the near future, do so before you read this. Lehrer discusses the entire plot including quoting from the last paragraph. So, be warned.This is not a major offense as Middlemarch is a well-read classic. But, then Lehrer gets into Proust. Now it would certainly be unfair to expect him not to discuss In Search of Lost Time, given the title of this book, and I do not think there was anything wrong with him doing so. But, given that he talks a great deal across the whole breadth of that massive work, I began to wonder how any publishing company thought it would be profitable to publish this book. If you write a book where the one of the prerequisites for the reader is to have already read In Search of Lost Time, your target sales demographic is very small indeed. Don't get me wrong, I love that the book got published in spite of that, and I desperately hope that I'm living in a world where this isn't as big of an anomaly as it seems to me, and where writers feel free to not worry about target audiences and demographics when they do their thing."

At that time, science and technology advanced rapidly and it greatly influenced the artists (and sometimes vice versa). For example, the invention of photography forced the painter to paint what brain see and interpret instead of what eyes see (beginning of post-impressionism). The Freud’s theories of psychology inspired the novelists of the time to write about profound mental insights of their characters. This book features prominent artists in various fields (e.g., poetry, culinary, novel, music, painting) and was very fun to read.This book has an interesting point of view about the relationship between art and science. The neuroscience and art complement together in understanding the mind. As the science takes a bottom-up approach, trying to find the brains' mechanism by dissecting it into small cell-level pieces, thus losing the whole picture. The art rather takes the top-down approach, trying to understand the mind as a whole.I read another Jonah Lehrer’s book, “How we decide?” years ago, and I liked it very much (even though the book was recalled). His book seems to be always inspiring."

As he pushes his interesting and innovative line of reasoning, Lehrer's examples seem to lose some of their argumentative force as the book progreses. Take for instance the way he goes about using his subjects as parallels for recent neuroscientific discoveries: as his argument continues into the second half of the book, his points grow more and more analogical and abstract. For example, the chapters on Whitman and Proust are concise and matter-of-fact (as much as possible) whereas he becomes much more poetic when addressing the artistic philosophy behind Cezanne's paintings. Likewise, the final chapters which examine Gertrude Stein and Virginia Woolf seem to embrace a more fanciful and coincidental connection to neuroscience than what Lehrer spoke of in regards to Whitman, Escoffier or Proust.All in all, I strongly recommend the book despite its somewhat let-down of an ending. It opens up a very interesting discussion of how disciplines ought to interact and how they may successfully inform each other. For that alone it is worth the read."

I definitely appreciate the acknowledgment of innate human understanding and the integrity of insight in this book, not just empirical science. However, so far, I also find it HILARIOUS reading about the struggles of men (males) trying to divine the mysterious of emotions without once ever bother listening to women about them. I think by now it's a proven fact that women's brains are hard-wired to be better equipped to understand emotions. For example, it wasn't until Walt Whitman that philosophers started to think that maybe emotions had to do with our bodies. I recently read in a CNN article that women's brains are designed in such a way to identify more with their (our) bodies, while men tend to project their identities onto things like their cars. In any case, philosophy would have advanced much more quickly if the insight of women had been added. For most of history, the story was only half-complete, and human nature only half understood. Kudos to Lehrer for understanding the benefit of the right-brained thinkers."

It did not disappoint and may be better than HWD.Although I found the direct connections between certain artists ideas and the neuroscience pursuits to be a little shaky at times, it was still fascinating to see the ideas behind them. I thoroughly enjoy any writing where someone takes an idea from one discipline and connects it to an idea in a discipline that seems far, far away. For example, your mind really starts moving when you try to connect Walt Whitman to the concept of the Mind-Body problem. The ""Song of Myself"" is not so much a poem as it is a self-exploration of the concept of consciousness, something which neuroscientists still wrestle with.The chapter on Virginia Woolf was extremely interesting because of her pursuit of the idea of ""self."" Where is the self? Where does it reside? How do we change our idea of self so often? Can we have more than one self?Even if you don't read anything related to science, you should take a peek at this if you are interested in any of the great thinkers involved in the text. A delightful read!"

Possibly, this is because I'm not familiar most of the works referenced. But I think that some of my confusion is because Lehrer didn't make convincing arguments or explinations. Some sections are more clearly spelled out than others.George Eliot changed religions and believed in free will and one of her characters got married. Therefore: Brain plasticity. I can't connect those dots and I don't believe Eliot was the first person to understand free will.I also don't believe that Gertrude Stein (who happened to be a neuroscience (or equivalent at the time)) discovered grammar. Or that the linguist Noam Chompsky confirmed the existence of grammar. Huh? I'm certain that everyone knew that grammar existed hundreds of years before either was even born.

Unless you are well read on the authors, artists, and culinary greats in each chapter, it may help to have additional material on hand. I found myself using Google to find out more about the subjects. For instance, the chapter on Cezanne is enhanced when you are actually looking at his art. The author does include some black and white images, but it helps to see them in color.Lehrer does elaborate on the subjects so his thesis can be understood. Initially I must confess I thought this book would be too intellectual for me, but I stuck with it and I'm glad I did. I love science, but I never took a science class in college. Still I did understand and enjoyed reading about it.This would be a good book for a book club or small discussion group. Each chapter could be read, then you could meet and do whatever that chapter's topic is about, like visiting an art gallery for the Cezanne chapter, or going to a gourmet restaurant for the culinary one.

This whole ordeal has marred my experience with this chapter that I was looking so forward to--I mean, I love Virginia Woolf! Mrs. Dalloway was one of the formative literary works in my life! What a bummer. Divorced from the (it appears accurate) accusations hurled at Lehrer, the book is a good one. Some chapters are fantastic--namely the Walt Whitman, Marcel Proust, Igor Stravinsky--and the rest are mostly OK. The notable exception here being the Paul Cezanne chapter which was tedious and boring because for some reason, the argument simply doesn't translate without photos. This is odd, of course, because I couldn't taste any of the food Lehrer describe in the August Escoffier chapter but somehow this is simply the case.Anyway, I am definitely interested in the intersection of the humanities and the sciences.

By looking at a group of artists in different fields, Lehrer provides an interesting look at how the works of these artists have been able to use their work and the process involved creation such work as a means to understand the human mind. At times, these artists have used their work to address what their personal experiences have allowed them to understand about human nature, such as how the mind uses language, understands music, uses and builds memories, and develop mental illnesses. I enjoyed the book largely since it parallels my belief that art and science do in fact have a relationship with each other, and that both serve as a means to understand human nature and the brain. Lehrer provides a well researched argument, relying both on scientific studies and specific artistic works, that articulates the importance of art within a world filled with scientific advancement. "
178,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49718914-jennifer,4,"Art and science must exist in unity, however fragile, in order for us to remain sane. Lehrer's arguments take the general form of: artist has an idea -> scientist quantifies this idea later on. At times, I felt like some correlations he made seemed forced, like the evidence used was molded almost to the point of absurdity in order to fit the argument. I like how half this novel is analysis of various art forms, but some may be put off by this. The biggest problem I had was the subtle put down of science. For example, Lehrer writes about the ""cold realm of scientific fact,"" and how science may ""never"" answer some questions. Lehrer also argues that science (often paralleled with reductionism) rejects the idea that we are more than matter (embraced by art), but I would argue that science upgrades matter into something much more interesting by accepting that we are our matter. The Coda section does accept the differences between the two fields, though, and does a great job of qualifying and proposing a ""fourth culture.""All in all, I found this novel to be very thought-provoking. Take it with a grain of salt. "

While it is evident that the connections between Proust and neuroscience were foremost in Lehrer's conception of this book, the connections between neuroscience and each of the other featured artists is clear and - while not groundbreaking - very interesting and insightful.The importance of this work lies in the Coda, where Lehrer uses these forged connections to weave a convincing argument for a ""fourth culture"" in which there exists intersection between science and art with each discipline standing on equal footing for the common goal of exploring a shared human experience.That said, a major criticism of this book is that it is primarily a work of Modernism - ignoring and at times taking unfair jabs against Postmodern notions that have been explored in the half-century between the artists' time and the book's publication."

Even at thirteen, I thought this was just an exercise in bullsh*tting, but I did realize that there was some truth to it.What Jonah Lehrer has done here is take the so-called human condition and dissect the brain to find out why. On the outside, it seems like an obvious argument. We experience art because it appeals to the way our brain functions. This is sort of a tautology, no? Our brain works in a certain way, so works that exercise the brain appeal to us, because they make our brain work the way it was supposed to.But once you get past that, and past the feeling that theses are essays to be turned in at the end of the semester, there's a lot to learn from this book, both about art and science.

People on one side kept saying the only truth is a scientific, empirically verifiable truth while opponents kept bringing to light that those truths don't get to the heart of reality and questions of the emergent self. This is where the Fourth Culture must step in. I believe that we are in the midst of the development of scientific arts and artistic scientists. Jonah Lehrer, a self-proclaimed failed neuroscientist chose to write, obviously inspired by his scientific practices. The author of Einstein's Dreams is another example. As far as artistic concerns go, not only is there an increasing number of artists using advanced technology but there are artists who are using scientific data and methods of inquiry to produce amazing bodies of work.We are that emergent convergence."

You can see Columbia all over this guy, especially the concepts that the Core Curriculum teaches to its somewhat begrudging audience. Another review noted that Lehrer credits Whitman when he should have looked further into history for those, like the Buddhists, who explored the mind-body connection. I too noticed his essays are pretty Euro-centric. Lehrer makes a valiant attempt to unite the humanities and sciences--he focuses a lot on what ""truth"" means--and makes many insightful points. However, the value that I found in the book had more to do with the people and studies he cites. Even if Lehrer (or someone like Malcolm Gladwell) isn't particularly groundbreaking or water-tight in his argument, it doesn't matter to a reader like me, who will continue to explore the topics he only brushed against."

Each different artist is a chance to explore a different facet of the mind, and Jonah is clearly versed in both art history and modern science.

I read and loved his second book, How We Decide, but a friend said this one is even better, and I agree.Lehrer's point here is that creative artists — whether painters, writers, musicians or even a great chef — intuitively understand truths about the human mind long before scientists have a clue. To prove his point, he devotes chapters to Walt Whitman, George Eliot, Auguste Escoffier, Marcel Proust, Paul Cezanne, Igor Stravinsky, Gertrude Stein and Virginia Woolf. While some chapters are better and more heartfelt than others, I learned something from each one and his observations about Virginia Woolf are simply luminous. Lehrer disagrees with science's tendency toward reductionism. He knows not everything about our world can be explained in a laboratory.

Although Lehrer writes with a passion and immediacy that keeps his tone from becoming too dry, there was a general lack of fun. I read for entertainment purposes, and challenging fiction often provides me with a sense of conspiratorial problem-solving. Non-fiction can be equally entertaining, but more in a more transparent, group effort. (I'm a nerd; learning for the sake of learning IS fun.) But there was certain je ne sais quoi that kept the ignition to fun from turning.Each chapter was so packed with cross-referencing physiological facts that I retained about as much new information as I would from a magazine article. Which is to say, I feel/ fear that a lot of the finer points went over my head.

But Lehrer belabored the point and by halfway thru his hypotheses and conclusions became too convenient entirely. But I forged ahead. By 3/4 of the way thru I was doing a google search on Lehrer (I found it funny he thanked his girlfriend so profusely in the acknowledgements and wanted to know if he was still dating said girlfriend) which lead me to the discovery of his recent journalism indiscretions and subsequent firings and public disgrace. That was the straw that broke my back. I had truly pushed to get as far as I had in the book and to feel as if I couldn't even trust anything that had been written made finishing pointless. So there it is, 1.5 chapters and a coda left and I feel utterly betrayed as a reader. Especially as I loved his book ""Imagine"", which happens to be the infamous book in question.

Each chapter features an artist, writer, composer, and even a chef, and ties their works to what neuroscientists now know (or suspect) about the brain. The problem I had with this is that Lehrer often erroneously attributes scientific breakthroughs to these artists decades ahead of the scientific community. Like a psychic whose hints are too vague to be of any use, yet are easily interpreted as correct after the fact, Lehrer gives his subjects supernatural powers of scientific prognostication. In the end, I believe he was struggling to make connections where none truly exist. Oh, and every time he'd starts railing against the evils of reductionism, my eyes would involuntarily roll skyward. I get it, Jonah - you don't like reductionism. You've said that multiple times in each chapter. Please, move on to a more interesting point. The language in the book is grammatically correct."

At least half of the stories sailed above my head, and if I had been reading rather than listening to this book I don't think they're any way I would've finished it. I did find many of the stories interesting, however, particularly the chapters on Whitman and Stravinsky.The main flaw I see with this book is that even though it seems to be saying that science does not have the final say on knowledge, Lehrer seems to assume all of life could be explained by science. In fact, he seemed to imply that the artist's discoveries were not legitimate until they were scientifically proven.I can't claim that this was his viewpoint, and those who read the book can feel free to cite paragraphs proving I'm wrong, but this was my impression of the book."

I think that science often ignores or downplays the role art or literature has had in certain discoveries or advances, whether or not they are listed in this book. Or perhaps the two areas progress individually -- which is unlikely as the exchange is at least one-way, with authors, often those of science fiction, incorporating new or hypothetical science into their work. While this book was an easy read, I recommend it only to anyone with a fairly strong working knowledge in literature/poetry, French culture and/or science. The book covers a broad range of figures and concepts, and without a basic familiarity with Cézanne, linguistics and theories of perception, it is difficult to give the book the attention and appreciation it deserves.

Then I read about Gertrude Stein, the Shostakovich, then Cezanne and so on. Everywhere, Lehrer points out how these early pioneers apprehended the workings of the human mind in ways that the ""old guard"" of their particular art form could not in any way conceive, but were much later to be established as good neuroscience by the top men in this field.

Taking a group of artists – a painter, a poet, a chef, a composer, and a handful of novelists – Lehrer shows how each one discovered an essential truth about the mind that science is only now rediscovering.We learn, for example, how Proust first revealed the fallibility of memory; how George Eliot discovered the brain’s malleability; how the French chef Escoffier identified umami (the fifth taste); how Cézanne worked out the subtleties of vision; and how Gertrude Stein exposed the deep structure of language – a full half-century before the work of Noam Chomsky and other linguists.It’s the ultimate tale of art trumping science. More broadly, Lehrer shows that there’s a cost to reducing everything to atoms and acronyms and genes. Measurement is not the same as understanding, and this is what art knows better than science. "

Admittedly my first reaction to the book was Lehrer was just looking for artistic examples of scientific facts. And I really don't know enough about either the artists (and their beliefs) or the science behind it to know whether that's exactly what Lehrer did do.

If you don't each mushrooms or have never listened to Stravinsky beyond the dinosaur segment of Fantasia, then this is not the book for you.Essentially, this is still a book for the artists of the world, not the scientists. It provides a surface though not a probing look at the different subjects of neuroscience. Too much attention is paid to certain subjects (Gertrude Stein) and too little is paid to others (Escoffier and Stravinsky) but the overall treatment of the subjects was thoughtful and interesting.

I found more compelling the authors that he cites who incorporated science into their artistry (Walt Whitman, Gertrude Stein). Neither art nor science exist in a vacuum. These artists were able to take the scientific knowledge of the time and use it push their writing and their reader. Currently, scientists have not done the inverse. Popular science is the closest that we have come to incorporating art into science. I don't necessarily agree that there needs to be further art integration into science, because science can be so esoteric, but I do think Lehrer's writing can give a fresh perspective to scientists on the importance of thinking outside the box."

Collective intimacy is perhaps the major hallmark of many traditional cultures - an intimacy with time, the natural world and one another.

In eight chapters exploring features of consciousness, the author tries to convince us that artistic geniuses had great insights about the inner workings of the mind way before neuroscience could uncover those secrets. While the premise of the book is interesting, Lehrer fails to draw convincing arguments to support his claim. Instead of focusing on the parallels between art and science, the book is presented in the form of an exhausting tirade against scientific reductionism. While this does lead to one of the notable arguments that Lehrer makes in the book is that Consciousness is an emergent property and hence breaking it down and looking at its parts won't help in understanding consciousness, it gets lost in the 220 pages and is only clearly stated in the epilogue.

I enjoyed parts of this book very much; parts I thought were more forced, but overall it was great fun to explore the connections between current science and art. I personally think this book could have been expanded considerably to take into account other artists besides the very modern types profiled here, but this was an interesting start. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on Cezanne, Proust and Gertrude Stein, although about a page and a half into the Stein chapter I remember thinking ""Oh, he's going to drag in Noam Chomsky, my least favorite linguist, isn't he"" and then a couple of pages later, ta-da! Chomsky. LOL I'm just delighted to have found another human being who ever read Stein--they are few and far between where I live. "

Art got there first!"" Guessing right is not the same as knowing. I agree that science and the humanities would both benefit from deeper interaction, but you've got to throw out the argument that art somehow finds ""truths"" that science can never know. Bullcrap. Art is how we express our experience. Science is how we try to figure out what's really going on. There's no value in drawing a line and saying, ""Here's what we know, and over there is art!"" It's the god-of-the-gaps all over again. It trivializes art and demeans science.Lehrer is a tremendously smart guy, and I think his more recent work is much more sound, but this book raised my hackles a bit, philosophically speaking."

To be honest, what I read was not new; alot of people already know science does not hold the ultimate key to universal truths. In fact, through art, the truth uncovered steeped in mystery is a bigger and more shocking revelation. I adored Lehrer's abstract and very eloquent writing style. It highlights way more details than it appears to.I like to quote this book and it's presence as a testimony of collapsing positivism structures. It is by no means a bible - but Lehrer's attempt at highlighting the various other ways of key figures is audacious at best, and it worked out very well to explain the concepts he puts forth. A very good effort, and I'd probably be continuing with ""How we decide""."

I'm giving four stars because I felt that this book had a few standout chapters, and while all were worthwhile reading, I was fascinated with the analyses of Escoffier, Cezanne, and Stravinsky, but slightly less for the other artists/""neuroscientists"". Anybody that enjoys the arts or science (I can't imagine anyone that isn't somewhat interested in one or the other) needs to read this book and learn to view these two fields as essential and integrative with each other."

My two favorite subjects! Stories about how artists and writers made observations that predicted things later proven by science.The title comes from a passage in Proust's ""In Search of Lost Time"" in which describes the experience of eating a madeline cookie and how the taste and smell remind him of experiences from his childhood. Science later discovered that the part of the brain responsible for smell also controls memory. There are many other interesting stories in here such as Cezanne's paintings revealing aspects of how the brain really sees things or what went on in people's brains when they first heard Stravinsky's ""Rite of Spring""A fascinating read."

In Proust Was a Neuroscientist it is as if Art is one side of the brain, science the other, and Mr. Lehrer is the ""self"" that composites both factions into a very readable whole. Irritated by artsy-fartsy literary types and abstract artistes? Confused by stuffy and smug empiricists? That's okay, we have this book here to help us. You will both agree and argue with the subjects in this book, whether artist or scientist, which seems at once to spar and joust with itself and also pat, rub and coo effusive. This book is a delight, and it deftly illustrates how we need neither science nor art to tell us how we know so little. Our own personal experience has proven this already. "

This book is fascinating and compares a series of artists' views of the world with current scientific knowledge. The author uses this to postulate that art precedes science. It's an incorrect assumption based on a few cases that match his theory. That said, the few comparisons he does go into great depth and are very interesting. I highly recommend the book. It's just that you can't take these few test cases and say that art precedes science across the board, which he attempts to do on occasion. Some of the scientific principals are either cutting edge or way beyond my limited knowledge so I'd be very interested to hear what my sciency friends have to say about it. "
209,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4317344-jared,4,"On a basic sense, this book is about how artists ""discovered"" scientific things before scientists actually understood them, like how Walt Whitman believed that our whole body experiences feelings instead of just the brain. Lehrer has in essence, eight separate articles where he discusses how these artists (Marcel Proust, Paul Cezanne, Igor Stravinsky and others) intuited later scientific discoveries. I really enjoyed the book until the end when he started talking about Gertrude Stein and Virginia Woolf. It was hard for me to comprehend what he was saying about them, and I'm not sure that his comparison to their work and science worked. (Could be that my mind was not completely focused on the book, too.) However, overall, this book is well worth reading and I think it is one that I would like to buy in order to refer to it every so often."

So, I was probably predisposed to like this book. Lehrer's premise is that both science and the humanities are necessary to probe the nature of ourselves. 4 stars and not 5:Sometimes Lehrer wasn't clear (forthcoming?) about how much the artists knew or intuited about the nature of the mind. For example, the description of the neural/neurotic response to Strawinsky's dissonant chords was brilliant, but Lehrer's description of Strawinsky himself leaves the reader wondering whether Strawinsky really understood what effect his music would have on the public.I could have used a little more neuroscience.The last chapter was boring and really not necessary; anyone reading the book closely had already come to the same conclusion."

Highly recommend this one.I'd have given it an even higher rating than 4 stars, and almost feel like I still should, if it weren't for the fact that I found something about the writing style (can't quite put my finger on what it was) a bit tough to engage with at times.

Now I've got to read some of the books he refers to. Middlemarch by George Elliot, Leaves of Grass by Whitman.  And there are chapters on vision, taste, sound, memory, brain plasticity... And the Stravinsky chapter clearly and so very simply explains why some music is so emotional. There are pieces that set up a pattern your mind desires to hear again, yet the composer gives you variations, teases you with everything around the pattern your brain desperately wants to hear again. ""The longer we are denied the pattern we expect the greater the emotional release when the pattern we expect returns safe and sound."" ahhh. that explains so many tearful/joyful music experiences I've had.

Lehrer gave me a new appreciation for the authors he discussed and made me want to read the referenced works to understand them from this new perspective of dissecting their neuroscience connections.At times the book feels a bit like a literary review, but after it breaks ground, the middle chapters are where Lehrer's writing, connections, and descriptions really sing out and make me want to deeply ponder the ideas of taste, memory, and sound. If this book does nothing more than get you to slow down and really experience simple things at a profound level, than I think it will have been worth the time reading it."

Otherwise, this is just a nice series of little bios. Otherwise, I don't feel the author makes a strong case for the connections of these individuals to neuroscience, despite their tendencies to intense introspection of their own cognitive processes. I would have to think that this abstraction applies to most real humans of accomplishment in any field. By this extension, ""Dirac was a neuroscientist"", ""P.Diddy was a neuroscientist"", etc. This leads me to ask if he chose the best subjects to study, or just chose to build his diffused case through his own pet heroes."

He examines 8 visionary artists from a wide range of fields including Proust, Stravinsky and Escoffier. His claim is that through the artistic process and trusting their own instincts they arrived at a deep and revolutionary understanding of the working of the human mind that is only now being validated by neuroscience. I originally found this a bit problematic, given that scientific understanding is a constantly changing target and what we believe to be true today may change in the future. However, Lehrer eventually won me over to his project of trying to reconcile humanistic and scientific ways of understanding the world. He wants science and humanities to find a place of mutual respect and understanding in order to collectively advance our knowledge of ourselves and the world. "

Jonah Lehrer has ambition and wants to great things, which is wonderful. Unfortunately, ambition alone couldn't carry this book. It reads like a collection of college term papers, with assertions being supported by very thin, conveniently chosen threads. I've read several of Lehrer's books, and am struck by how he obviously aspires to be our generation's Malcolm Gladwell - an aspiration apparently so great that he cites many of the same studies, anecdotes and research findings that Gladwell did in his books written long before Lehrer was ever published. If you like Lehrer, you'll love Gladwell. And if you love Gladwell, you'll only be disappointed by Lehrer. "

Unfortunately, the library was demanding it back and I couldn't finish it but what I did read was fascinating.Lehrer (who looks like an undergraduate in his photo), discusses various 20th century artists and how their work reflects what contemporary science knows about the brain and how consciousness functions. The author is especially interested in memory but investigates all kinds of cognition. Most of the artists are writers, although painters and musicians are also represented -- and even a chef, which gives the author a chance to explore olfactory phenomena.

While I very much appreciated the chapter on Marcel Proust and memory, I was also surprised and pleased by those on the other artists--especially the one on the French chef Escoffier and the sense of taste.I've really enjoyed this book and would love to own a copy of it to refer to when my own mind only partially recalls something I read in one of the chapters and want to think about again. :)"

So, not as good as Murder on the Orient Express, say, but much better than Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows. Be advised, not a science book; essentially a literary book. What I mean by that is: this is a scientific spin (specifically a neuroscience spin) on a book that, in the orders of possible worlds, bears many other incarnations. So what. Lehrer's book is fine reading; his prose is pleasant (he has a taste of aphorism)and his stories are good. The structure of his ideas as they appear in the chapters did seem to lack more rigor than I liked, sometimes, but not a major issue and there have been clearer explanations of scientific discovery.

I love the idea that Woolf's explanation of this is that we invent the ""self"" (a false whole that encompasses many divergent parts) in order to have something through which to filter the world - in other words, in order to experience perceptions we have to invent a perceiver, so the self is basically just a story we tell ourselves about our experiences."

There is something fascinating about both science and art in each chapter, but his success in marrying them varies. The connections felt weakest in the literary chapters. The best chapters were Cezanne, Stravinsky, and Escoffier. Predictably, these chapters are successful because they describe less subjective reactions and more physical, brain involved subjects.

The scientist in me wished that more was presented about recent neuroscience research and that the science was more clearly intertwined/related to the information about the various artists' lives. Much of the time I felt like I was reading discrete blocks of information: a quickie bio of a person followed by a block about the time period in which they lived for context finally followed by a smaller block about ""recent discoveries."""

I don't think you can make a point based on certain excerpts, poems or paintings and conclude about an artist's way of thinking. A work of art could be a result of the artist finally understanding how the brain works, could be an intuition, could be a product of specific mood or chance etc. We will never know. Also, art being art, there is no definite interpretation of what it means or symbolises.However if one reads it more casually it is fascinating. Science, art, history, the lives of great people, all these are intertwined in such a captivating way. Art intrigues and science explains.

That said, the chapters on Escoffier and Proust are quite good, and present an interesting perspective on the artistry of food.The basic premise is a good one, and he advocates for something very important: science and art do not exist on two sides of an impenetrable boundary.

I grew frustrated with that intent and wished instead he just allowed the work of artists to stand as an expression of life, rather than as a scientific proof.

The arguments for some of his points seemed a stretch by the author, but sound nonetheless. This book was an academic exercise in proving his points and was not a pleasurable or enlightening reading experience.

Written by a research lab assistant going through medical school attempting to provide evidence that artists discover things about world that scientists only rediscover centuries later. The only difference is that scientists spend time trying to prove things over and over again. Artists reflect and really immerse themselves fully to the unknown not afraid of what they might find or what they are trying to prove. Many examples from literary works as well as popular paintings used to prove points. There are also several scientific research findings that supplement the merger of science and art.

Lehrer's observations on Proust and memory were the most fascinating to me based on my college French class examining Proust's epic In Search of Lost Time. He points out that flaws and inconsistencies in this work are actually accurate portrayals of how memory works, and in doing so shows how art has unearthed important breakthroughs in science, and how science has inspired art. This book does a great job of bridging the gap between art & science and kept the attention of a reader who wouldn't normally be drawn to the subject."

I have an extremely wide range of academic interests, majoring in a biologically-based subject and women's studies in college, for example. As such, Lehrer's joining of literary and artistic subjects with scientific findings is a unique endeavor that illustrates that the realms of art and science are not exclusive from each other. Additionally, the fact that this book was produced by someone who worked for Dr. Eric Kandel can only boost my opinion and respect for the book and author further!"

This is perhaps different from the usual forays of scientists into this conversation, which Lehrer himself recognizes.Overall an enjoyable read, quick and factual (for those that don't read Nature consistently), good for somebody looking a for a point of junction to begin their quest into this third culture."

Art focuses on how we experience reality and helps us to try and make sense or create sense out of it. Science takes reality apart and tries to understand all of the individual pieces.

I spent an entire afternoon reading this getting up only to make more coffee and go to the bathroom. It shows how the brain is functioning when we are in the act of creating and how making art forces the brain to do what is is intended to do. And it also highlights how little we know of our brains which is endlessly fascinating. Lehrer shows this by describing the artistry of 20th century thinkers and how the way that they make art is the way that our brains process certain information. Not only are the artists he chose interesting and messy but he is also an excellent writer able to weave science into narrative fluidly.

It's like a short survey course on artists, authors, musicians - and the world's greatest-ever-chef, Auguste Escoffier - who have changed perceptions of how the human brain records and perceives by identifying truths long before science recognized them. It narrows the gap between science and the arts in the most engaging way. What an expansive brain Jonah Lehrer has! I have already bought eight copies to give to friends for Christmas. And I can't wait to read Jonah Lehrer's new book, ""How We Decide"" about how we make up our minds - and how we might do a better job of it. "

Each chapter was well contained but also contributed to the general theme. I found myself sharing little tidbits from the book with my friends as I read it. However, like all pop-science books I've read there were moments where I felt the conclusions drawn were too simplified or particulars were glossed over, resulting in possible misinterpretations. But these occasions were few and far between and far from egregious.This short, easy-reading book expressed my sense of the nature of our minds extremely clearly. I would highly recommend it to anyone."

I enjoyed the chapters on Gertrude Stein, Virginia Woolf, and Walt Whitman but was particularly interested in Paul Cezanne, Igor Stravinsky, and Auguste Escoffier (probably because I learned some entirely new things from those about how the brain processes visual information, sound, and taste)."

For example, he explains the neurological discovery that smell and taste are the only senses that connect directly to the hippocampus, the center of the brain's long term memory. Therefore, he concludes that the madeleine that Proust ate really would have been key in summoning up his past. Other chapters are about the chef Escoffier, Cezanne, and Stravinsky.

Will say more about that later. But here's a hot tip for those who have made it this far in the review: our memories of events change each time we recall and tell the story of that event!

This book is an inspiring reminder that the best art and the best science are both pursued with an open mind and a willingness to integrate new information, and a reminder that art and science need each other.

Other worlds (journalism, the humanities) use unsystematically selected quotes as evidence.Either way, it's a nice metaphor to demonstrate the way artists illustrated psychological principles decades prior to their scientific vindication.

The most fascinating chapters, to me, were on Escoffier (how the brain registers taste), Cezanne (how sight is mostly interpretation), and Virginia Woolf (how the mind constructs a notion of 'self'), but all of them are interesting and well-written.

This is an excellent pop-science book. As one who doesn't consider myself an artist or a scientist, but am passionate about both, I have always found common threads going through both fields, especially in the visual arts. Lehrer articulates this relationship in such a great and entertaining way. "

This would make an excellent text for a science/language arts interdisciplinary class. As I read, I imagined a wealth of lessons, trips, and activities for teaching with this book.

Unless you're really interested in these artists, I suggest going to radiolab.org and listening to some of the great podcasts they did based on some of the science that was discussed here, which is really the cool part."

His framework for analyzing then - i.e., by their singular abilities to ""predict"" or ""foreshadow"" the ultimate findings of science was engaging. However, at times the arguments, examples and writing seemed repetitive and a bit disjointed.

You learn about the artists and their work (Woolf, Stravinsky, Cezanne, Proust, et al.) as well as about the current scientific knowledge we have about why those artists' interpretations made sense. It's history of ideas mixed with science lite--my favorite."

The topics range from how we remember, to how we sense to how we become self. The controversies of the science discussed are often ignored, but that isn't really the point. Instead, it gives the reader a chance to contemplate numerous principles with which both scientists and non-scientists alike struggle."

Now I'm finished and Claude has taken it over, I realize how close its subject(s) is to lots of different things I have been mulling over these past years, so that it serves to unify them. For instance, it fits very well with another neuroscientist's experience, one of the most emailed Ted Talks around: http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/ji... . "
