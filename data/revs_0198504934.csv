0,0198504934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/281380-anton,5,"Very difficult, but worth it, as it's totally amazing in its chain of reasoning and speculation: demonstrates the possibility of life evolving from inert chemicals to the present day via accident alone. Essential reading for anyone trying to really understand how we might have come into existence (without resorting to theology or mysticism). "
1,0198504934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16397506-dietmar,4,"A comprehensive review of key events that are proposed by the two authors during the evolution of life. Apparently the target of the book is all readers with interests in biology and the formation of complexity of life. Therefore there are some passages in the book that are basic biology that can be easily jumped over by biologists. Nevertheless, the book gives a quite up-to-date review on both theoretical and practical aspects of research about origin of life.Part of the discussion is rather theoretical (or even philosophical), without much technical aspect involved. For readers with more background in biology (molecular biology, biochemistry, and evolutionary biology), and for readers that need more details about revolution, Ernst Meyr's ""What is evolution"" can be an interesting companion to this book.The most inspiring fact mentioned by the authors (though a basic one) is that although there is a one-to-one correspondence between triplets of bases in the gene and amino acids, there is no such correspondence between genes (genotype) and parts of the body (phenotype). As the authors pointed out, ""there is not a gene responsible for the nail on your left little finger, and another for the fifteenth eyelash of your right eye"". Instead, most structures (a specialized form of phenotype) are influenced by many genes, and most genes influence several structures.This suggests that so-far the most prevalent method of single-gene based analysis is bound to fail. Though it is statistically appealing to assume genes are independent from each other, the assumption poses a very strong constrain on how we interpret biological data and understand biology with them.

2,0198504934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73548608-helio,2,"This book was a disappointment. It gave a bunch of descriptive aspects of lifeforms but not much on how the diversity came about. For instance saying an early eurkoyote might have accidently swallowed some nutrious particle which led to mouths. That is like saying if someone ran into the back of a VW Beetle it might take the shape of the rear end of a VW Rabbit. And then if there was another impact it might knock the engine from the rear to the front. Another calamity might have something fall on the roof going from curved to flat and hence after a series of such bashes viola > an evolved VW. You could cry foul and point out that changes have to ocur at the manufacturing stage and so with the organism the change has to be with the DNA not some accidental crumbling of a cell wall. The authors shamelessly use examples from human technology (which are intellectually guided). It is like saying it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, swims like a ducs and looks like a duck but its not a duck. Having to choose between Creationism and Evolutionary Theory is like having to decide if a rainbow is black or white; they are both two dimensional solutions to a five dimensional problem. The chapter on the Origins of Language is a misnomer; it might have been called tidbits on language; there is little about origins much less explain how human language became intricate and embedded in our psyche."
3,0198504934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59603090-santhosh-totiger,5,"Very concise, not a single word is superfluous. A must read for anyone who is willing to understand how life originated be it on earth or extra terrestrial planet. Now I plan to read their Major transitions. For me this book served its purpose of understanding fundamental ideas behind origin of life."
4,0198504934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8010964-dhananjay,3,Too dense. Many concepts are heavy so would have preferred more illustrations/explanations. But still overall important book.Might be outdated about a few chapters/ points.
5,0198504934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5021642-betsy-curlin,4,"A good chronological account of how life began and evolved, up through humans and the origin of language."
6,0198504934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88097329-clydas,4,"This book kindled my interest in evolutionary biology. I have a science degree but no specific training in biology, and I found it to be pitched at an appropriate level. It's great at giving the big picture and putting all the pieces in their conceptual positions, and would serve well as a prelude to a (layman's) study of evolution.As a popular condensed version of the authors' magnum opus The major transitions of evolution, the book moves sequentially through the 8 so-called major transitions of evolution: single replicators -> groups of replicators; groups of replicators -> chromosomes; RNA -> DNA & proteins; prokaryotes -> eukaryotes; asexual -> sexual; protists -> animals, plants & fungi; individuals -> colonies; primate societies -> human societies & language.At only 170 pages, it's not too much of a commitment for the casual reader. While not exactly light reading, the writing style is clear and concise, so I give it high marks on readability. Nevertheless, some sections were obscure and probably could have been written better (particularly the chapter on the evolution of sexual reproduction). Given when the book was written, some of the theories favoured by the authors may or may not be outdated now, but I still consider it a worthwhile read and one which has given me much to think about."
7,0198504934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15287795-suat-aydin,5,A good but tough one.
8,0198504934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4761202-richard,4,Too hard for me at the moment in many places (my lack of biological knowledge). But fascinating nonetheless.
9,0198504934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107060433-gazi-tu-rul,5,"Zorlu ve nefes kesici bir kitap. Bizi evrimin son halkasının dil olduğu gerçeğine adım adım, temelden götürüyor."
10,0198504934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114217294-heidi-kroth,4,"Objectively, a great book. Personally, not the best one to read after taking the MCAT and stressing about science for months."
11,0198504934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/822732-jon,4,"Fascinating, if lacking in depth"
12,0198504934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180066-eric,3,"It's hard to write good, clear general science books. A very interesting premise, but somehow didn't grab me very well...but I had just read a really great novel, so that's hard to match with non-fiction."
13,0198504934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6232625-xin,5,"A wonderful book about evolution, especially the major evolutionary transitions such as the emergence of self-replicating molecules and the first multiceullar organisms. The author is a famed evolutionary biologist. "
14,0198504934,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7358-jen,4,"Not a light read by any stretch, but informative and a great compendium of current research on how complex life developed."
