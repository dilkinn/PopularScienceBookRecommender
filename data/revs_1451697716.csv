0,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30350016-bethany-johnsen,2,"I'm kind of ""eh"" on this book. It bills itself as a ""surprising exploration into the wonder of consciousness,"" I guess because it shares a few fun facts about octopus neurology (e.g. THEY HAVE NEURONS IN THEIR ARMS!) and references a few philosophers of mind (e.g. Thomas Nagel) in passing. Maybe it's the former philosophy major in me, but IMHO saying ""Hmm, I REALLY wonder what it would be like to be an octopus! Can we even know?"" does not qualify as an exploration into the wonders of consciousness. (Also, the answer is NO. Very obviously no.)I would have been less bothered by philosophical shortcomings if there was more actual information about octopuses. Many of the anecdotes are not that surprising to someone who knows anything about octopuses to begin with. There's something to be learned for sure, but most of the book is not educating you about octopuses. It's mostly a memoir of the author hanging out at an aquarium getting to touch octopuses, which is super cool, and also learning to scuba dive and swim with them. It wasn't that exciting just to read about it. The first chapter of this book was originally an article that went viral, and it seems like the amount of content here is more suitable for something article-length. As an octopus lover your time might be better spent watching a documentary or reading a different book.Also, as an animal lover, I would have appreciated more consideration of the ethics of keeping wild sea creatures in tanks. The only mention of this occurs when Montgomery describes how a certain individual who catches wild octopuses for aquariums has no regrets because displaying octopuses to the public is necessary for people to care about their preservation in the wild. We don't actually get any evidence that this is true, and it seemed to me like a flip way to dismiss the very real concerns that I had when I learned about a young, growing octopus being kept in a dark 50-gallon tank with no mental stimulation, all because an older display octopus didn't die as early as anticipated. These are very intelligent animals (the main takeaway of the book)---they need stimulation! They hunt and explore in the ocean all day. It seems downright abusive. Other bad things happen to octopuses in the book that are unsettling, and left me wondering about the intelligence of our own species."

I already loved octopuses, but this book deepened and strengthened my love for them, and all cephalopods. It's an easy read, and by the time you're finished, you'll be asking yourself questions about consciousness, inter-species communication, and maybe even feeling a little more of a bond with the fishes who live in your aquarium ... I know that I did."
2,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,2,"I had previously read Journey of the Pink Dolphins: An Amazon Quest by this author and had to give it up because it contained very little fact, an awful lot of conjecture and far too much about Sy Montgomery who obviously finds the preoccupations of her spiritual soul far more fascinating than I do. So this time, wanting to read about octopuses I thought I would listen to the book. It was worse!This is because the author read it herself and it's purpleness, it's fruitiness was increased by her emphasis on meaningless similes, one after the other. Her favourite word is, 'like' as in the egg trails of the octopus are like a wedding veil but more beautiful than any.... Simile on the next line too, about gossamer cobwebs, diamond air bubbles and golden... AFAIR. Why write one when two can fill the space?After several boring chapters on the author learning to scuba dive along with descriptions of her tutors and friends including their neurological problems how they had come about their nicknames and lots of similes, I finally got to this all in two paragraphs. ""my air rising in silver bubbles like a song of praise.... """"nurse sharks peaceful as a prayer""""the fish wheel in unison like birds in the sky""""I feel elation cresting into ecstasy""""Like in a dream the impossible unfolds before me and yet I accept it unquestioningly""and, ""Beneath the water I find myself in an altered state of consciousness with a focus and range and clarity of perception that are dramatically changed. Is this what Kali and Octavia [her two favourite octopuses) feel like all the time? The Ocean for me is what LSD is to Timothy Leary...""That's why I said finally. DNF.Not enough science, too much conjecture, I don't really believe that octopuses tease people for a joke and get their own back on people and then float with smirking expressions she has imagined on their imaginary faces. Remind me never to read another Sy Montgomery book.2.5 stars rounded down. One and a half stars because I did learn something about the individuality of octopuses which I would really like to know more of and an extra star because she is very good friends with the brilliant anthropologist and ethologist Elizabeth Marshall Thomas who is one of my very favourite authors."

Although occasionally repetitive, The Soul of an Octopus is a tearful, informative, and memorable love note to octopuses - those strange yet wondrous creatures, intelligent and brimming with personality, that captivate and terrify in equal measure. "
4,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin,5,"I had to read this book today because it was due back on Overdrive, so this is going to be a short review until I get my OWN paperback copy. This book made me cry!!! The creatures and the people both had me torn up at times. I'm a wildlife lover and activist so I try to branch out into different books on creatures I know nothing about. I was worried this was going to be another textbook style read and I don't like those. This is about a woman (the author) who gets to study octopuses <--- (not octopi) at The New England Aquarium. I never even thought an octopus could have such a wonderful memory, could play, could hug you in their own way or shoot water in your face if they didn't like you or wanted to play. There are so many other things I learned. The people in the book were amazing too. I don't agree with everything but these were people that did the best they could for their animals and family members. There is even a little girl in the book who is helped by the Octopuses with her Autism and her suicide attempt. This was just a wonderful book and I will do a more in depth review, hopefully with some of their pictures and some stories. "
5,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16019981-jessica,1,"The only “surprising” thing about this “exploration into the wonder of consciousness” is that the author so thoroughly convinces us of Octopuses beauty, intelligence and individual personalities yet sees no conflict with keeping them captive, often in cruel conditions. Most of the Octopuses intimately investigated in the book were wild caught and are now captive in public aquariums, namely the New England Aquarium in Boston. They were not rescued due to an injury nor born in captivity and imprinted making a return to the wild difficult. These were all caught and sold for the purpose of being publicly displayed. Montgomery takes an obscene amount of pleasure in her “wonderful Wednesday” visits to the NEAQ, as if her entertainment was the octopus's purpose. The most horrible thing recounted in the book is an octopus that due to space constraints has to live for 8 months in a tiny pickle barrel with no stimuli beyond the humans bothering her. She is visibly distressed and tries to escape every time the lid is lifted. How was the author and everyone okay with this? It was terrible to read. Finally, the writing was sappy and self-absorbed. While I did learn a lot of interesting things about Cephalopod anatomy, biology and behavior, those bits of knowledge only strengthened my distaste for the questionable ethics of the author and the book. Shame on the National Book Award judges nominating this book for the non-fiction award."
6,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s,4,"3.5 Though simply written I found this book to be both informative and delightful. I knew nothing about the octopus except for pictures in National Geographic, so this was all new to me. So surprising to learn how clever these creatures are, the variations in size, from six inches with 23 inch tentacles to the giants of the sea. How they use these tentacles like conveyors belts to feed, how they change colors based on mood, how they can show displeasure. How clever they are, escape artists, can use misdirection, and so much more. The author comes to personally relate with three different types of this species and grows to care about them all. Other sea life are also mentioned as are the people who work with them. Such a unique job, not sure it would be but I found the descriptions fascinating. Actually I found everything in this book fascinating. Such clever creatures, who knew?"
7,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller,4,"It was interesting reading other GR reviews about this book. Some folks complained it wasn't sciency enough, or that it claims to do things that it doesn't, finally, do. I can understand folks' frustration with Montgomery's approach. For people looking for a hard-core science book, maybe this isn't the one. Montgomery is essentially telling the story of her journey of studying octopuses, which can't stop at the octopus, because they are part of a larger world. I think that's some of the message here. One cannot study an octopus in a vacuum (though an octopus may be able to occupy one with dazzling dexterity). There are a lot of things Montgomery learns and shares in this book while learning about the octopus, and they may seem extraneous, but I don't think they are.Montgomery's first visit with an octopus at an aquarium excites her imagination. She learns that octopuses can be dangerous, but also that their curiosity and need for connection are not so unlike our own. Of course, the octopus can learn a lot about us by tasting our skin with their tentacles. We don't do that. Though I think sometimes we can use our senses to determine if someone is a serious coffee drinker or pack a day smoker. We just might not draw away from such a person as the octopus does after tasting of the not so delectable flavor. Right away, according to the narrative, Montgomery experiences a sense affection and wonder for the octopus, and she tells us all about the octopuses she gets to know in captivity, and also there is a cast of human characters she gets to know while getting to know the octopuses. So, this book is about a person learning about octopuses, and a person spending time at an aquarium and getting to know other people who work there. Furthermore Montgomery decides to learn to scuba dive because she wants to see octopuses who aren't in captivity. This is a book that wanders around a bit, and doesn't stay as zoomed in on science and octopuses per say, but I found it to be gripping and delightful. I agree with some reviewers that it is hard to read about animals being captured and kept in captivity. It is a practice I also dislike. But it would be happening whether or not Montgomery writes this book so I guess I'd like to and learn what I can.The question of octopus consciousness doesn't of course get answered in here. Montgomery thinks they have souls. (Maybe even plural, given that each tentacle is a bit of creature of their own.) I think the concept of the soul is one that tries to separate planetary creatures into those whose lives are worth something and those whose lives are expendable. So, I prefer to ask different questions and leave the soul out of most things unless I'm feeling poetic. But I appreciate that Montgomery looks at her octopus friends as individuals with their own personalities, experiences, desires, etc. I don't think making a personal narrative about her emotional and social experiences with octopuses makes it less scientific. It just makes it more nuanced and rich. The book is broken up into parts names after octopuses kept at the aquarium. There is Octavia, Kali, Karma. (I can't remember if there were other sections. Book is back at the library.) We get to see octopuses interact with each other, with people, with their environments. We see a mother lay and tend her unfertilized eggs, we see some octopuses die and some get released back into the ocean so that they can enjoy the end of their lives in their home-habitat. We see octopuses push people away, pull them closer, tease people, lash out, weaken, die, expand and thrive. Octopuses change shape, change color, express pleasure and loneliness and longing. And we see a community of people become more attuned to their environments and more sensitive to the lives of seemingly incomprehensible others, simply by connecting with the octopus. Being read (and tasted) by the octopus seems to bring people a sense of calm and peace. People who spend time with octopuses seem to believe in the intensity of intelligence of other beings, which can be a shock to them, particularly as relates to a creature which has probably not been thought of until recently as having the personality and intelligence more along the lines of mammals than cephalopods. Of course, many people still like to believe humans are the only intelligent animal. Which is proof in itself that human intelligence can be a truly paradoxical pair of words. It makes sense that this book celebrates our relationships with each other, and with the many other intelligent beings in our midst, particularly, the octopus. I can only hope a heightened awareness of our interconnectivity might bring us to our senses some day.Here are some quotes.AWARENESS OF THE MOODS OF SEA LIFE“I smell fish stress.” The scent is subtle—I cannot smell it at all—but the low-tide odor Scott detects, he explained at the time, is that of heat-shock proteins. These are intracellular proteins that were first discovered to be released, in both plants and animals, in response to heat, and are now known to be associated with other stresses as well. (73)SLIMEIt might be more appealing to describe octopuses as slippery. But a banana peel is slippery; slime is a very specialized and essential substance, and there’s no denying that octopuses have slime in spades. Almost everyone who lives in the water does. ‘More of the ocean’s residents use, deploy, or are made up of slime than I ever expected,’ marine scientist Ellen Prager observes. ‘The undersea world is a seriously slimy place.’ Slime helps sea animals reduce drag while moving through the water, capture and eat food, keep their skin healthy, escape predators, protect their eggs. Tube worms like Bill’s feather dusters secrete slime to build a leathery tube, like a flower stalk, to protect their bodies and keep them attached to a rock or coral. For some fishes—Scott’s Amazon discus and cichlids among them—slime is the piscine equivalent of mother’s milk. The babies actually feed off the parents’ nutritious slime coat, an activity called ‘glancing.’ The brightly colored mandarin fish exudes bad-tasting slime to deflect its enemies; the deep-sea vampire squid, an octopus relative, produces glowing slime to startle predators. Bermuda fire worms signal with luminous slime to attract mates like fireflies flashing on a summer night. The female fire worms glow to attract the mass; the males then flash, after which the two please eggs and sperm in tandem. “Kali’s and Octavia’s slime isn’t bad,"" I told Jody. ""Anyway, they’re way less slimy than a hagfish.""A creature of the ocean bottom, a hagfish grows to about 17 inches long, and yet, in mere minutes, it can fill seven buckets with slime—so much slime it can slip from almost any predator’s grip. The hagfish would be in danger of suffocating on its own mucous, except it has learned, like a person with a cold, to blow it out its nose. But sometimes it produces too much slime for even a hagfish… (75)THEORY OF MIND/SOPHISTICATED AWARENESS OF OTHERSFrom building shelters to shooting ink to changing color, the vulnerable octopus must be ready to outwit dozens of species of animals, some of which it pursues, others it must escape. How do you plan fro so many possibilities? Doing so demands, to some degree, anticipating the actions—in other words, imagining the minds—of other individualsThe ability to ascribe thoughts to others, thoughts that might differ from out own, is a sophisticated cognitive skill, known as ‘theory of mind.’ Once it was thought to be unique to humans. In typical children, theory of mind is believed to emerge around age three or four. The classic experiment goes like this: A toddler views a video of a girl who leaves a box of candy behind in her room. While she’s gone, an adult replaces the candy in the box with pencils. Now the child comes back to open up her box again. The experimenter asks the tot, what does the little girl expect to find in the box? The toddler will say: pencils. Only an older child will understand that the little girl would expect to find candy, even though that’s not what’s really there. Theory of mind is considered an important component of consciousness, because it implies self-awareness. (83)Of course, there are many other examples. The birds of prey with whom falconers hunt look to the falconer, or to her dogs, to flush game. African honey badgers follow certain birds (known as honey guides) to find bees’ nests. Both parties seem to realize that when badgers open up the nests to eat the honey, the birds can then feast on the bee larvae. (85)TENTACLESIt’s even possible that the octopuses have some shy arms and some bold arms. University of Vienna researcher Ruth Byrne reported that her captive octopuses always choose a favorite arm to explore new objects or mazes—even though all of their limbs are equally dexterous…Her team counted the octopuses using only forty-nine different combinations of one, two or three arms for manipulating objects, when, according to her calculations, 448 combinations were actually possible…(160)“Octopus arms really are like separate creatures,” Scott agrees. Not only can they grow new arms when needed, there is evidence that, on occasion, an octopus chooses to detach its won arm, even in the absence of a predator….Is this like what happens when Siamese twins fight? (161)"
8,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2905141-yodamom,4,"When I started this I expected a scientific journal watered down for the non scientific reader. I did not expect it to be a personal journal with some scientific facts thrown in. I was looking for more science, more facts then offered. I was a bit miffed at the personal moments, her diving lessons, her ear troubles, relationships of companions. I wanted more information on the octopus and it fascinating life. Fascinating they are, and there is so much more that we still are far from understanding.I did gain a new appreciation for the octopus. I was amazed by the interactions between the various beings and humans. They are so much more than taught in school. They are complex living creatures with different personalities, moods and fears. Understanding their types of communications comes from a lot of time spent interacting with them. They have gifts that we do not, which makes it hard for us to relate to them. That does not mean that they are brainless, unfeeling beings without conscious thoughts. The octopus has amazing abilities, their brain can have as many as 75 lobes compared to the human 4. It can see in panoramic views. There is new evidence that they may be able to see with their skin to get the perfect camouflage. This is just a small bit of their abilities, they are truly amazing.There is some information on other species in the sea. Some fascinating facts and tidbits to wow you with the gifts of the sea.I really enjoyed the book even with the slow journal sections that just didn't interest this reader. I did enjoy her focus of the emotional connections she saw. I may go find her Pig book and give it a go."
9,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32532051-montzalee-wittmann,5,"Soul of An Octopus by Sy Montgomery, and narrated by the author, is such a delightful book that warmed my heart and I didn't want it to end. I felt so entranced by the love of the sea life, especially these precious octopuses, that I felt I knew them. Warning, make sure you have tissue handy for happy times and grieving moments. This book was a true blessing! I felt so in touch with life, the universe, and my own personal thoughts after listening to this. It was a soothing balm for the soul!Often I cringe when I know the author is going to do the narration but her voice is so nice and she told it with her own emotions. Touching. This book is for anyone who loves animals or those that don't. Maybe they will when they finish. I had mixed feelings going into it about getting wild octopuses for zoos and Aquariums but I think I understand better now. I did learn that more than one octopus is NOT called octopi! Lol!"
10,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36819318-scott,2,"Octopuses get a bum rap in popular culture. They've starred in numerous books and films, pulling sailors (and sometimes ships) into briny graves, lurking about in holes waiting to ambush unsuspecting divers and even attacking submarines. They've long been a shorthand for 'monster' - there's a reason Cthulhu has an octopus for a head - but these sensitive, smart beasties have been unfairly maligned.Sy Montgomery's book, The Soul of an Octopus is an antidote to these negative perceptions, and does an excellent job of showing how amazing and intriguing Octopuses are, and the relationships that humans can have with them. Beyond that, however, this book didn't live up to my expectations.Have you ever watched a race where a runner lunges off the starting line, smashes world records for the first fifty meters then stumbles, trips and face-plants into a twisted heap before the halfway mark?That’s a little how this book felt for me.The first hundred pages of The Soul of an Octopus are amazing. While reading the first few chapters I was regaling friends with scintillating Octopus facts- their multiple hearts, the way their neurons are distributed throughout their limbs, seemingly giving each arm a mind of its own, the way they can taste with their suckers, and their impressive, curious intelligence. It was a torrent of engaging and fascinating facts, told with an interesting and empathetic voice. I learned a lot (I’d always thought the plural of octopus was ‘octopi’ – how wrong I was…) and my existing interest in cephalopods (Octopuses, cuttlefish and the like) was fired way up. I was watching octopus videos online, thinking about visiting the local aquarium, and talking to my partner about making a snorkeling trip to a nearby pier known for its sealife - Montgomery had turned me into an octopus fanboy.And then… the content kind of dried up. As the book goes on less and less interesting octopus related information is presented. The discussion of scientific studies drops off, and the book mainly becomes a tale of the author’s friendship with several Octopuses in the Boston aquarium. While these relationships are interesting, it is the earlier section of the book, which blends the author’s experiences in with informative and compelling revelations about Octopus anatomy and behavior that gets the balance right.In the later sections I found myself becoming bored, that most fatal of feelings for a reader, and I felt as though I was reading a memoir, rather than an exploration of ideas and science. I generally dig personal-journey-through-a-scientific/historical/political-minefield style books, where the author inserts themselves in the story, such as John Safran's Murder in Mississippi. I love the way a well-written personal story can sneak facts, debates, arguments and other tasty morsels into a book in ways that can trick my lazy brain into learning without even realizing it. Unfortunately, by about two-thirds in Montgomery's story starts to feel repetitive, and overall it lacks the depth of content I look for in books of this type.After reading Montgomery's book I discovered that its beginnings are to be found in an article that the author wrote, an article that later became the first sections of this larger work. Considering how interesting the first section of The Soul of an Octopus is I can see how it would make a great article, and I can heartily recommend reading perhaps the first hundred pages. Beyond that point there was little to engage me, although if you like Montgomery's writing voice you may find her personal connection with several aquarium octopuses to be enough to sustain your interest.This isn’t a bad book, it just isn’t what it could have been. Its starts out very strongly, but runs out of puff a fair way from the finish line."
11,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10361042-jailyn,3,"I have a love hate relationship with this book. I listened to the audiobook, which was narrated by the author and she did a great job of narrating. The descriptions of the octupuses were beautiful and the discussions about their habits, emotions, and intelligence were very interesting. But (and you knew this was coming), I don't think aquariums should catch or pay to catch animals from the wild for their exhibits. Even though the people in the book cared about their charges, in reading you could see how the conditions for the animals was sometimes cruel (Kali in particular).I know accidents and deaths can happen, but it seemed like the aquarium went through its animals relentlessly. Why can't they be enjoyed by scuba divers or in electronic exhibits rather than in person? If these creatures are so intelligent (and I have no doubt they are), why do we abduct them and keep them in a life of captivity?The mindset is alien to me, just as my mindset is probably alien to them.The book was beautiful, but oh so sad for someone who believes animals should have the right to their freedom and their own lives."
12,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35118411-amy-other-amy,2,"The service is conducted in Tahitian, a language I don't understand. But I understand the power of worship, and the importance of contemplating mystery - whether in a church or diving a coral reef. The mystery that congregants seek here is no different, really, from the one I have sought in my interactions with Athena and Kali, Karma and Octavia. It is no different from the mystery we pursue in all our relationships, in all our deepest wonderings. We seek to fathom the soul. [...] But I am certain of one thing as I sit in my pew: If I have a soul-and I think I do-an octopus has a soul, too.I have been writing this review in my head for a couple of weeks now, and it's time to be done with it, so here I go. Part of the difficulty in reviewing this particular book is that I review things for what they are, but this book doesn't know what it is. The subtitle suggests both popular science and philosophical tract, but it really isn't either of those. It fails spectacularly as journalism. The reader is left with a kind of memoir, a sort of 'my neat experiences with an aquarium' (focusing of course on that aquarium's octopi*), but even that is rather shallow. Looking back over the whole thing, this book was not what it wants to be or pretends to be, and as such I remain a disappointed reader. (However, book length treatments focusing mainly on the octopus are not particularly plentiful, so the book still has some value even with its many flaws.)There is science in this book, yes (did you know an octopus has more neurons in its arms than its brain?), but it is more a collection of hodgepodge of facts (how about that they can taste with their skin?) strung together through the author's rambling (in fact, they may be able to see with their skin, but only maybe) stories about her adventures making friends at the aquarium (an octopus' eye has no blind spot, can detect polarized light, is panoramic instead of binocular, and can swivel independently, but sight is limited to about an 8 foot range), learning to scuba dive (the octopus is the chameleon of the sea, but much, much more finely tuned and capable than a chameleon), and above all her repeated stabs at a vague, semi-mystical notion of consciousness (cephalopods can disappear on a checkerboard and have done so in labs) which are unfortunately laced through with all manner of religious references the author does not really appear to understand (this camouflage thing is fantastic; look at this; the octopus starts at 1:50). There are no footnotes or endnotes (although there is the obligatory index and a nice bibliography), which makes it difficult to track down a lot of the science that is presented (they are strong enough to resist perhaps 100 times their body wait in pull, and for the big ones that may be almost 4,000 pounds) in the same wide-eyed fashion as the philosophy (I could go on like this all day, but I actually would like to finish this review, so I'll stop now).The quote I pulled above gives a pretty good idea of the tone I'm talking about: The author attends a Protestant service held in a church that now occupies the site of a former temple to the octopus in Tahiti. Even though she doesn't speak the language, she happily assumes she understands enough to use the experience as her springboard into musings on the soul. (I have the advantage of having come from a Protestant tradition, and I can fairly say she is probably directly wrong as to the contents of the service.) Add to this the fact that the questions we ask give us the answers we get, and the author is determined to ask stupid questions. (Can we ever understand the octopus? Lady, I can't understand my family, friends, and neighbors. What on God's blue earth makes you think we can understand another species? It's like Hume never happened for this woman.)Or she is determined to avoid asking the questions. The book give two fairly uncomfortable portrayals of these lovely (and, yes, very, very intelligent) animals in distress: Octavia is brought to the aquarium near adulthood due to Athena's sudden demise, and shows clear distress over her change in environment, while Kali is kept for an unexpectedly long time in a barrel behind the scenes as Octavia takes much longer than anticipated to die after egg laying; Kali also exhibits clear distress and boredom. A journalist would have been forced to ask some probing questions here about the ethics of these practices with wild animals who appear to be at least as smart as, say, the family dog. No such questioning arises. The author relates the situation, but she does not investigate the different sides of the argument. (She does later present the thoughts of an obtainer of octopi, who takes the animals from the wild for aquariums, and who does what he does because people must learn about them to protect them, but that is as far as it goes.) Given the obvious controversy here (and the traditional close relation between studies of an organism's level of consciousness and the ethical questions of how to relate to that organism accordingly), this refusal to dive in is especially disappointing.As a memoir, this functions on about the same level of 
Inside of a Dog: What Dogs See, Smell, and Know
, another book that promised to explore the science but was ultimately bound to the idiosyncratic interpretations and ideas of its author. This is a decent enough read to get a passel of facts, but not the survey of the wonder of octopus intelligence the title seems to promise. I have moved on to 
The Cultural Lives of Whales and Dolphins
, which seems to be a more promising treatment of a similar subject, although not, unfortunately, of the wondrous octopus.*I am aware (indeed this book immediately makes the reader aware) of the current pushback by grammar hounds against the marvelous word 'octopi' on the grounds that 'octopus' is a word of Greek origin, meaning you cannot have the Latin plural 'octopi' but must instead have either the regular English plural 'octopuses' or the Greek plural 'octopodes' (which is almost never heard outside of this debate and remains generally unrecognized). I am not generally one to join in choruses of 'Is that even a word?' and this round of that game is particularly offensive. It ignores the wonderful capability of the English language to make an inspired mistake, and the fact that this is an inspired mistake. It is better as a word, on almost every level, than the regular plural form, so unless my fellow English speakers suddenly accept that Greek business on a widespread basis, I'm keeping it. Grammar hounds who don't like that can take a long walk off a short pier. Maybe they will meet some octopi.

13,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/324370-lisa,5,"This was a lovely book—both fascinating and deeply kind, with a lot to interest a broad swath of readers. The science is accessible without being dumb, and at the same time Montgomery brings the octopuses (NOT octopi!) and their personalities (yes, they have 'em) really vividly to life. Plus I love reading about any interest that attracts the oddballs among us, and octopuses definitely seem to fall into that category—I guess I can count myself among those oddballs now. Thus ends any pulpo consumption for me ever again, and no big loss. "

I remain agnostic on the subject of octopus souls but they most certainly have brains. They use tools and solve puzzles. They seem to play. They recognize and react to different humans--both by tasting them with their suckers, but also by seeing them with their remarkable eyes. Most of all, octopuses have personalities, the octopuses we meet in Sy Montgomery's wonderful book are distinct and rather lovable individuals. No one who has ever had a dog or cat will be surprised that animals have personalities, but we are talking about a mollusc a creature like a clam or oyster!Octopuses have very strange brains. While the human brain has four different lobes each associated with different functions. ""An octopus brain...has as many as 50 to 75 different lobes. And most of an octopus's neurons aren't even in the brain but are in the arms."" Octopuses are adapted to extreme multi-tasking--all those arms can act independently and the arms seem to be able to both taste and see. Octopuses are all predators and while the ones Montgomery describes seem gentle enough she is warned never to let the tentacles near her face since they could easily take out a human eye. Their interest in us may not be entirely pacific. One octopus had a 'thing' for people in wheelchairs or using canes. Another was particularly interested in watching small children. Often captive land predators like tigers show such preferences too. Do they recognize easy prey? The thought makes this picture somewhat sinister....Since Octopuses have no bones they are able to squeeze themselves through tiny holes and they are amazing escape artists. I have to admit this video of an octopus crawling off the deck of a ship and back to water creeped me out big time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yHIs...Sy Montgomery loves them, though, and has what is to my mind a weird fondness for having her arms wrapped up in octopus tentacles--à chacun son goût. And speaking of taste, I suspect that anyone who reads this book will think twice before eating octopus or for that matter swallowing a raw oyster. Montgomery's love of octopuses was so intense that it even got to me. I didn't think I could tear-up reading about the death of an octopus but these eight armed molluscs have so much personality and alien intelligence they seem rather like ET in the movie. Unfortunately there are rather a lot of octopus deaths in the book since they only live about 3 or 4 years.Part of the pleasure of this book for me is getting a behind the scenes look at one of the most wondrous places in Boston, the New England Aquarium. Montgomery takes time out from the octopuses to describe many of the thousands of fish, birds and other animals at the aquarium. My favorite is Myrtle, a 350 pound green sea turtle, about 80 years old, who dominates even the sharks, stealing squid right out of their toothy mouths. Right now there is a special exhibit on at the NEAQ of octopuses, squid and other tentacled creatures. I can hardly wait for my next day off!UPDATE: Spotted the two New England Aquarium Giant Pacific octopuses, Sy and Anna. Sy was in the front tank reaching out with thin tentacles to feel (?) taste (?) see (?) a spiny sea urchin. Amazingly the urchin was also reaching out, waving and stretching its tube feet to meet Sy's tentacles. They explored each other very delicately and deliberately for some minutes. What were they sensing? Is this Friend or Foe? Dinner or Danger?Anna was in the back tank, pale grey, very quiet and hard to see. A volunteer told me she has laid infertile eggs and is guarding them. Readers of the Soul of An Octopus will know that (view spoiler)[The last act of a female octopus before dying is to lay and guard her eggs. As the volunteer told me about the eggs I could not hide my dismay. ""We thought she was younger,"" she said in a sad whisper as our eyes met.  (hide spoiler)]""But with octopuses you never know."" And there we stood in communion--two humans, minds and feelings briefly joined--as an octopus watched."

(Also, among the myriad things I learned about this incredibly smart and empathetic animal is this: the plural is not octopi.) This is a lovely and wise book that will remind you of just how much we share with creatures that seem spectacularly foreign to us -- such as the octopus. "
16,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1292594-helen,1,"*Spoiler alert of epic proportions*The subtitle of Sy Montgomery’s The Soul of an Octopus: A Surprising Exploration into the Wonder of Consciousness clearly states Montgomery’s purpose. And she starts her exploration off well enough. She’s meeting Athena, the New England Aquarium’s 40 pound, two and a half year old, octopus for the first time. Montgomery is charmed. I’m charmed. For “those who work with octopuses report seeing things that, according to the way we’ve learned the world normally works, should not be happening.” Montgomery proceeds to eloquently make her case; octopuses are intelligent, emotional beings with distinct personalities and memory. So imagine my surprise, no my dismay, when she reveals that “in [her] quest to get to know an octopus better, [she] had been looking into acquiring one of [her] own.” Yes, Montgomery feels a need to possess an animal that she herself, in the very title of her own book, acknowledges possesses a soul. She goes on to say,“… whether you’re a person or a monkey, a bird or a turtle, an octopus or a clam, the physiological changes that accompany our deepest-felt emotions appear to be the same. Even a brainless scallop’s little heart beats faster when the mollusk is approached by a predator, just like yours or mine would do were we to be accosted by a mugger.” Or captured in your ocean home by a strange creature, and transferred to a barren tank in that creature’s otherwise uninhabitable living room.Fast-forward…Athena has died. Octopuses, we know from chapter one “live fast and die young. Giant Pacific octopuses are probably among the longest-lived of the species, and they usually live only about three or four years.” Thus, the aquarium is now home to Octavia, who is nearing the end of her life, and Kali, Octavia’s replacement who lives in a dark, 50 gallon barrel. The flower pot Montgomery had given her to hide in has been removed from her barrel for lack of space.At which point Montgomery decides she needs to experience the ocean; would “love to be actually in the real ocean with them.” She wants to be in the very ocean home denied the same octopus she wants to be in the real ocean with. Huh.Montgomery describes the ascent from her final dive: “I ascend with [Rob] slowly, like a dying soul reluctant to leave its body, and we watch the silver trail of our bubbles rising above us like shooting stars.” Is this how Kali felt on her final ocean ascent? Is this how Kali feels in her barrel right now? Fast-forward again… after living in a dark 50 gallon barrel for roughly six months, Kali has finally been transferred to a new, temporary enclosure. The first night she escapes and dies; somewhat reminiscent of an only slightly less tragic escape scene at the end of Finding Nemo. Of the incident Montgomery and aquarium staff says:""Kali was extremely lucky to have lived as long as she did. Most octopuses die as paralarvae. Only two in 100,000 hatchlings survive to sexual maturity – otherwise the sea would be overrun with octopuses. “And at least we know she had a good last day.” I said. “Yes,” said Wilson. “She had a day of freedom. And that she got out tells you a phenomenally inquisitive and intelligent creature wanted her freedom. We know, clearly, it must have taken a lot of effort to get out. A stupid animal wouldn’t do that.”“She died like a great explorer,” I said. Like the astronauts who died blasting off in Challenger, or the brave men who perished in an attempt to find the source of the Nile, penetrate the Amazon, visit the poles, Kali had chosen to face unknown danger in the quest to widen the horizons of her world.“Octopuses have their own intelligence that we can’t match,” Wilson said. “And hopefully we’ll learn from our mistakes. That’s the best we can do. After all,” he said, “we’re only human.”I’m not convinced the comparison to astronauts and African explorers is valid. For those souls chose a life of adventure and Kali was not on a “quest to widen the horizons” of “her” world. She was on a quest to widen the horizons of an artificial world forced upon her. Nor am I convinced that Kali enjoyed one happy day. In Wilson’s own words, “…that she got out tells us…[she] wanted her freedom.” She didn’t get it. Like Wilson, I too, hoped they would learn from their mistakes. So imagine my surprise when, eight days after Kali’s escape the aquarium has ordered another octopus off the internet. She will be named Karma. With no permanent tank for her, they put her in Kali’s dark prison barrel. Leaving me unclear as to what any of them have learned. Except that instead of planning ahead, and putting kindness before profit, when tragedy strikes we shrug our shoulders and claim we’re innocent…because we’re human.I picked up The Soul of an Octopus because, ten years ago, I was utterly enamored with Mongtomery’s The Good Good Pig. My expectations were so high that the contrast between what I learned about the inner lives of octopuses, and the Stockholm Syndromesque relationships between they and their keepers became too disappointing, too enraging, and just too tiring. While I imagine Montgomery’s aim is to paint a portrait of herself and her aquarium colleagues as fighting the good conservation fight, she has unwittingly lumped her book in the same category of documentaries like Blackfish, and books like David Kirby’s Death at Sea World."
17,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2014608-lisa-see,5,"I had read an op ed by the author, Sy Montgomery, and felt compelled to buy the book. Who know I would be so captivated?"
18,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,5,"Until I read ‘The Soul of an Octopus’, by Sy Montgomery, talented amateur scientist (journalist) octopuses were almost not ever in my thoughts in any way. As I have learned in reading this book, this was a serious deficiency in my education. First of all, giant Pacific octopuses have been living near my home all my life in Seattle, a port city. I have walked and partied on Seattle’s beaches all of my life and ate seafood at restaurants with beachside tables on Seattle’s piers. The Seattle Aquarium has a few octopuses, and some of them are Youtube stars. Secondly, the Aquarium catches them in Elliot Bay, just off the pier where the Aquarium was built. Third, the local diving clubs see them all of the time, posting videos of them, including one video of baby octopuses hatching from eggs, while their dying mother waves them on. The babies are cute as buttons, literally, being the size of tiny pearl collar buttons. Mom octopuses die shortly after the babies begin hatching because the moms starve themselves on guard duty while the eggs grow after being laid. : (They have been under my feet all my life, so to speak. I learned to look up only after I married my husband, a small plane pilot. Did you know the most beautiful clouds are in Seattle, huge, puffy, beautiful? I should have also been looking down, and out across the water, which often was within walking distance of my rented apartments. I certainly have owned boats, and had boyfriends with boats. My only excuse is the water is very very cold. And maybe, I am thick in the head. Why did I think on most days the bays, lakes, rivers and ocean near me were only for getting a tan?o _ OOctopuses are, like, A-listers of the aquatic world. They are powerful, smart, alpha dogs, or maybe like real black-ops guys - a Navy Seal Team? Hehe. They have to be, since their bodies are like pudding with muscles. They hunt to eat, mostly crabs, but things like to hunt for them, too. But once they reach their full size, watch out. They have been caught on video killing sharks. Yeah. Sharks, man.Below is a link to a talk given by the author, posted on Youtube. She reads from the book, so, you don’t really have to read the book, I guess, if you want the condensed version. It is as interesting as the book is. However, the book goes into more detail about many of the employees and volunteers who work with octopuses at the Boston New England Aquarium. The book also describes how the author learned to scuba dive, and the observations she made of sea life.https://youtu.be/_N2yDf7_1ocAs I read the ebook, I discovered more videos by clicking on the links provided by the author in the back of the book in the Selected Bibliography section. They are excellent! people can be so generous. As the author notes, octopuses can be generous, too. When they get to know a person (they recognize individual humans!), they allow people to pet them, at least the ones they like. They have preferences. If they don’t like you, you might get hosed. Yes, they are slimy, but. Wouldn’t you give a body part to pet an octopus? Plus, they are playful, moody, and are able to escape from almost anything - covered tank or barrel, tied up plastic bag, jar with a lid screwed on (there are videos showing octopuses can unscrew lids from inside the jar- if there is a minimum of a one- or two-inch gap anywhere - only their beak doesn’t squish small. Being adventurous, they have been discovered outside of their tanks laying on aquarium floors drying out, or having taken up residence in other nearby fish tanks, which had been full of fish, somehow escaping from their own tank. However, the octopus may now be all alone in its new tank it chose as a new home, and all of those expensive rare fish have mysteriously disappeared. An octopus that is maybe forty pounds can drown you, too, as they are way powerful. Their bite can kill you as they can inject you with a neurotoxin which is flesh-eating. It is a good thing they almost never bite the hands that feed them, eh? But what they enjoy is grabbing their caretakers’ hands, arms, pulling lightly (sometimes not so lightly) with their suckers ( maybe up to 1500 of them, each capable of individual manipulation!), tasting, smelling, feeling you - and maybe liking it. What they like about us, well. Their caretakers like to assume they like us for our loving natures, right? However, they get bored easily, and they like toys. Maybe we are a toy? Given their clever hunting skills including the ability to change their appearance into anything - fish, rocks, sandy floors, their ability to flash colors like a disco dance floor to attract us, their enormous strength, I suspect we are interesting toys to them. At best. Caretakers, keep petting and caressing those octopuses when you feed them! They then have a reason to keep YOU around...The book also has an Index section and photographs. There never are enough photos! Of course, I am now a major fan of octopuses. They can kill sharks. Sharks. Holy shit."
19,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,3,"""Soul is the fingerprint of God.""- Sy MontgomeryI love octopuses. Sy Montgomery loves octopuses. I would love to discover a logical expression that would allow me, however, to love Sy Montgomery's book on Octopuses. The dialogue was plastic and the book was just too mawkish and too, for me, focused on the human experiences with the octopuses and not enough on the SOUL or the OCTOPUS. An octopus has 3 hearts, perhaps I just have none. Could be the case. Could also be true that I am not the target audience. This book seems oriented towards enthusiastic teenagers or aquarium volunteers (both of which, admittedly are generally fantastic). It just wasn't for me. Also, note to future writers about the ocean. Rob's rule: you can use wine-dark sea ONCE without acknowledging Homer, but if you use it multiple times, you gotta name drop the blind poet, son of the river Meles. If Soul of an Octopus wasn't so short, I would have removed an arm and tried to escape. One of the positives of this book (there were several) was how its setting was largely the New England Aquarium. I recently visited this aquarium a year ago, after my son had his surgery at Boston Children's (very near the time this picture I borrowed from NEA was taken of Freya the giant Pacific octopus), so I guess I am a bit sentimental about somethings I guess and Boston's famous aquarium is not a bad choice for sentimentality.I'd recommend Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness instead."
20,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4886576-cody,5,"The Soul of an Octopus by Sy Montgomery is an entertaining, highly personal, and very informative look at the intelligence and consciousness of one of the worlds most fascinating animals. Thinking of intelligent creatures on our planet, it's quick to point to the ability of chimpanzees to learn sign language or German shepherds in policing and military environments to sniff out bombs, but an Octopus is an even more intriguing subject on the matter. Octopuses are invertebrates, but who thinks of a class of the animal kingdom that includes slugs and clams as having traits associated with intelligence? There's a bias there certainly, and as Montgomery explains, we certainly have much more to learn about our world and the creatures that inhabit it.Covering four different Octopuses lives at the New England aquarium, Montgomery's book is quite touching and even tear jerking as she develops such personal relationships with all of them. It's amazing the level of consciousness these animals have, from their individuality to problem solving skills to recognizing the people they interact with. The almost taboo subject of animal consciousness quickly becomes the underlining theme here in relation not just to octopuses, but other creatures on both land and sea. Not too long ago biologists like Jane Goodall were hesitant to apply psychological traits associated with humanity to animals, and only just recently has the scientific community been able to really push forward these studies on various subjects in the animal kingdom. Montgomery provides such a passionate analysis that the reader should walk away with that very same passion and respect for these wonderful animals."

22,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6016465-lauri,5,"I loved this book. Actually, I've loved all the books I've read by Sy Montgomery. She writes beautifully, and she has an amazing ability to create a nonfiction book that is a real page turner. Through Sy's visits to the New England Aquarium and the Seattle Aquarium, and through her scuba adventures in the wild (which truly were adventurous), you'll learn a lot about octopuses (apparently, the plural is NOT octopi, as I had previously thought), and you'll enjoy every minute of it. Although octopuses are mollusks, more closely related to snails than to mammals, they are very smart and clearly have moods and personalities. Sy becomes very well acquainted with a few octopuses in particular, and her interactions with them are fascinating. The book raises questions about the meaning of intelligence, nurturing, interspecies relationships and play - obviously, these are very intelligent creatures, even though their brains and neural systems bear very little resemblance to our own. I will never look at an octopus the same way again. I highly recommend this book and this author. She has a gift. "
23,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6753400-gabrielle,3,"I love octopuses. I have always found them fascinating, graceful and absolutely beautiful in that utterly alien way. Their otherness actually inspired one of my favorite tattoos, a Pacific octopus on my left leg, that coils around my ankle and foot (which subsequently led to my getting bombarded with octopus-themed stuff every birthday and Christmas – from shower curtains, salt and pepper shakers, mugs, purses, bottle of booze that happen to have a cephalopod on the label; you name, I got it). The love story with cephalopods started when I read an article about those fascinating little creatures, and learned some astounding facts: they have the ability to change color (according to mood or environment), they are experts at escaping tight spaces (capable of squeezing their entire bodies through tiny tubes!), they have extremely sophisticated eye structures, problem-solving intelligence, use their tentacles to taste their environment and have three hearts! They are such a strange animal and they inspired me and caught my imagination.When I heard of this book, I immediately wanted to read it, even knowing that it wouldn’t be a hard-science book and more of a personal memoir with the general “What I learned hanging out with a bunch of octopuses” kind of thing. The question of the consciousness, awareness of the world and personality is a very intriguing topic, but it’s also rather metaphysical. I was afraid of the book being a bit more wishy-washy than I was looking for…Let me reassure you, the book is very informative: Montgomery spent time with a lot of experts, aquarists and octopus-handlers (for lack of a better word), who shared their knowledge and experience of working with the fascinating little creatures. I learned a bunch of new things, that built on what I was already aware of when it comes to octopuses: they each have distinct personalities, are incredibly curious, strong and very creative. Not unlike other “smart” animals, they need a lot of stimulation or they will get bored and find - often destructive - ways of alleviating their boredom. They can be playful, stubborn, friendly… and they can run! “The Soul of an Octopus” is also very well written (though the prose is a tad more purple than I had expected!), and spends a lot of time exploring the questions of “animal” intelligence, perception and inter-species interaction. This is all very interesting, but I do wish there had been a bit more science and a tad less philosophy. I already share the author’s sense of wonder and deep affection for the little creatures, so every passage discussing how wonderful they are was basically preaching to the choir. I appreciate the respect she has for the octopuses she encounters, how she really treats them like individuals. Her observation about the possibility that they observe us just as much as we observe them is a tantalizing idea: we can’t begin to imagine how they must perceive and understand their interactions with us and what it means to them, but it’s an interesting exercise of mind to ponder that question.That means that this book is more anecdotal than anything else, which is fine because Montgomery has a palpable tenderness for her subject, and she expresses inspiring compassion towards all the squishies she gets to meet. That makes her book a very charming and entertaining read, but it also felt somewhat superficial. I feel like she could have added more biology and observational data instead of waxing poetic about consciousness, to make the book a little more thorough.Insightful, charming and interesting, but not quite enough to fully satisfying this octopus enthusiast."
24,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9185509-melissa-mel-s-bookshelf,3,"This was an enjoyable book about a couple of friendly octopuses (yes that is the correct plural term, I looked it up!) and an extremely enthusiastic octopus-loving author.Sy Montgomery also narrates the audio version of this non-fiction memoir about her time at the New England Aquarium with these octopuses over a period of a few years. Why a few years? Because they only live to be a few years old. Did I teach you something new? Because I had no idea they had such short lives! This book really taught me a lot that I had no clue about, nor would I have particularly cared about prior to listening if I'm honest.But wow, octopuses are pretty amazing creatures. For such a short life, they make quite an intelligent package. And I am amazed at their ability to manoeuvre themselves through extremely tight spaces!Did you know that octopuses need a lot of intellectual stimulation and can solve complex puzzles? It blew my mind how strange these creatures are!As fascinating as some of these octopus facts were, this book however, didn't amaze me. I enjoyed it and found it fascinating at times, but I feel maybe it would have been a bit better with some visuals, as a documentary or something. I'm not sure if there are any visuals in the paper version, I couldn't find any files in the audio one.What did I think of the audio?I enjoyed the narrator, and I always give extra points when an author narrates their own work and does a good job!Something about it just fell flat for me. I'm not sure exactly what it was. I was expecting/hoping to get completely WOWed about the consciousness aspect, and sure it had some very interesting moments and theories, but I was left feeling slightly underwhelmed. There was a lot of the authors speculations about the motives behind the behaviours of the octopuses.It did however inspire a video search of octopuses on YouTube and I found some AMAZING documentaries and videos and was blown away by some of them. I wouldn't have even thought to look them up prior to reading this book.Would I Recommend The Soul of an Octopus?It was an enjoyable, educational and somewhat touching story. It didn't grip me as I was expecting, but I still enjoyed it and it inspired me to want to learn more about these creatures. If you like this kind of book then I am sure you will enjoy it too.* I purchased The Soul of an Octopus at my own expense on audible.com"

I did not go into this book fascinated with Octopuses; I read it because it claimed to explore consciousness and the soul. A topic I'm fascinated with given my grandmother's diagnosis and long and losing battle with Alzheimer's Disease. In fact, in terms of the subject matter of this book, I'm still not sure I'd really want to commune with an octopus in the same way as the author. For a hot second I imagined being in the author's shoes and visiting an aquarium to let an octopus entwine one (or several) of it's slimy, suckered arms around my own, and that thought did nothing but fill me with anxiety. That being said, I did become fascinated with Octopuses. And I even grew an affectionate attitude towards them - albeit from a safe distance. They are, after all, fascinating creatures, utterly foreign to ourselves; but so curious, so individual, so intelligent you can't learn about them and not wonder about them and contemplate their similarities to ourselves. And I am fascinated by their crazy anatomy, their unusual behavior, their intelligence, their ability to problem solve, and their incredible connection with the people who have the privilege to get to know them. It explores profound questions like what is intelligence? What is it to be conscious? And what does it mean to have a soul? All through attempting to understand Octopuses - these are questions that illuminate more about ourselves when explored through the lens of creatures so utterly alien to us.Sy Montgomery wrote a book, part memoir, part science book, part Octopus love story, that was so compelling, and so full of compassion, affection, tenderness, and at times pathos that I found myself in tears. Several times. If you told me I'd ever cry about octopuses, I'd have told you you're crazy. But there you have it."
26,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2610234-caren,4,"Sometimes, when the news from the human world is just too depressing, I like to escape into a book about the natural world. This book allowed me a look into a world entirely unknown to me, the oceanic world of octopuses (and yes, it is 'octopuses', not 'octopi'). Most of the octopus friends the author introduces live in aquariums, in particular, the New England Aquarium. They have short lives, usually just three years (and that is in captivity), but they are truly amazing, intelligent creatures. The author speaks of these octopuses as being her close personal friends. Telling the reader, in a conversational manner, of the research being done by scientists, and of her own observations, she allows us a glimpse into their hidden world. The author considered getting her own octopus, but decided against it since she often travels, which would throw the care of the creature onto her husband. She has so many stories of others who either keep or work with octopuses. From page 65, here is one:""Ceph keeper Nancy King discovered that her two-spot, Ollie, didn't always see where the live crabs she dropped in to feed her had landed. So she took to helping her, using her index finger on the outside of the aquarium to show her where the prey was hiding. Ollie soon figured out the meaning of the pointing finger. (This is a very specialized skill. Dogs---but not their direct ancestors, wolves---are among the tiny handful of species other than humans who can do this. ) 'In this way', she charmingly wrote, 'Ollie and Nancy hunted crabs together'. ""Here is another account from page 214:[On a dive, a researcher is observing and photographing octopuses.]""How can you decide which of your subjects is more photogenic, when both change color and shape before your eyes? Keith chose to stick with the first one, who crawled around the side of a rock. As Keith was photographing it, the second octopus traveled up and over a higher rock nearby, stood up tall on its arms, as if on tiptoe, and, with what looked like keen interest, leaned toward Keith and the other octopus he was photographing. 'It actively positioned itself so it could observe me,' Keith said. 'It was so amazing to be observed like that. In all my years photographing animals underwater---sharks, tuna, turtles, fish---I've never encountered anything that watched me like this. It was like a person watching a model at a fashion-photo shoot, or watching a pro football player at a game. Most of the time, fish observe you and notice you. But they don't look at you like this, like they are watching and learning. It was one of the most incredible experiences of my life.' ""Ms. Montgomery's joy is infectious. She often visited the octopuses at the New England Aquarium and spent time stroking them and letting them taste her arms with their suckers. From page 90, she says:""While stroking an octopus, it is easy to fall into reverie. To share such a moment of deep tranquility with another being, especially one as different from us as the octopus, is a humbling privilege. It's a shared sweetness, a gentle miracle, an uplink to universal consciousness---the notion, first advanced by pre-Socratic Greek philosopher Anaxagoras in 480 BC, of sharing an intelligence that animates and organizes all life.""In addition to her weekly aquarium visits, the author took part in a number of deep-sea dives and shares that experience, as well as some wonderful photographs, in the book.In her bibliography, she includes some interesting links to videos of octopuses in action. I also discovered a very nice talk she gave about octopuses and the idea of consciousness in creatures other than humans. Here is that talk:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI4II...Here is a video of her friend from the New England Aquarium interacting with an octopus:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6DWQ...Here is an octopus using a coconut shell as shelter, even carrying it with him:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BULXK...Here is a wily octopus hunting a crab:http://aeon.co/video/science/drole-dh...And finally, here is a video of an octopus who stole a diver's camera:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5DyB...This was a great summer read. When the days are hot, you can immerse yourself in an intriguing and alien underwater world through Ms. Montgomery's lucid prose."
27,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23813866-richard,5,"I never expected octopuses to be so fascinating. Sy Montgomery weaves a story that centers on her connections with various octopuses at the New England Aquarium in Boston to show how intelligent and interactive these cephalopods actually are. And more significantly, how they can make connections to individual humans. The book covers a number of years and the octopuses come and go, partly because they have quite a short lifespan, about 3 years, something I never would have expected. The author weaves in biological data about octopuses but she does it in a way that doesn’t bog down the narrative. I had picked this title up a few years ago because it was a National Book Award finalist and I’m glad I finally got around to reading it. "
28,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20498957-claudia,2,"The title is somehow misleading: it is more of an exploration into the author’s feelings and her excitement when meeting an octopus. The very few scientific data could be easily found on Wikipedia and the writing style is, to put it mildly, childish. But then I read that the author wrote some children’s books also – aha, so there’s the explanation.But on the other hand, it was a light and mostly ok read. Nothing new about octopodes* if you have seen a documentary or two about them, but I enjoyed reading about their encounters with the author and the personnel from Boston’s New England Aquarium (that’s where the author conducted this “study”). There are also details about other residents from the Aquarium: Myrtle the turtle, the Sunflower starfish (I don’t recall the name, if it has one) and various other fish. There are a lot of details too about the stuff and volunteers working at the Aquarium; if I were them, I would have mind so many personal details to be used in the book. But that’s just me.Bottom line is, if you like octopodes (and other ocean creatures) and want a relaxing reading in order not to stress your neurons too much, there you have it.* :) Make your own choice :https://www.merriam-webster.com/words..."
29,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5204784-vonia,5,"The Soul of an Octopus: A Surprising Exploration into the Wonder of Consciousness (2015) Author: Sy Montgomery Read: 3/21/20  Rating: 4.5/5 stars Octopuses, not octopi- since ""-i"" is Latin, while octopus is a Greek word. This invertebrate, a simple mollusk? Think again! Eight legs, three hearts. Over 2,000 suction cups- called suckers- from diameters b ranging from mm to a couple inches. Two-thirds of its neurons are in the arms. Ink squirters that can squeeze their entire hundred pounds bodies into spaces the size of a quarter. Inherently solitary and even reclusive creatures, these highly individual cephalopods are widely known to have personalities. Think ""theory of mind""- observation and studies have shown that octopuses possess self-awareness; aware that others may know what they do not. Keen, sly, self-aware; so forget human beings- here's a true love's tale! Powerful and strong? Understatement. they can lift up to 40 times their own weight! Commanders of camouflage, octopuses can change color pattern, texture, and some species can actually impersonate other creatures. They change into a myriad of different colors, their meanings mostly unknown- though it had been acknowledged that white generally means peaceful and red shows excitement. Octopuses have two eyes, yes, but one eye is always dominant. They are color blind, but because they can see and taste with their skin, they probably notice more than most of us! These incredible sea creatures grab their food with their long tentacles a nd pull them into their beaks- yes, beaks! It's no wonder this is a little known fact- these beaks are hidden in their undersides and are rarely seen. Like lizards, they can regenerate missing limbs. Unlike lizard tails though, their regenerated missing arms- which happens in weeks- are as good as new. Furthermore, detached octopus tentacles have been seen to have a life of their own- that's eight autonomous parts! Unlike humans, all octopuses that reach old age experience a form of dementia. Sad as it is, it is what marks the end of their short lives. Limited by reproduction, males die only a few months after they mate; females die  shortly after their eggs hatch. Live fast, die young. Some species live only 6 months, the longest living species, Giant Pacific Octopuses, still only live 3-5 years. Females lay up to 100,000 eggs. In captivity, none of these ever fertilize because the female would have had to mate while in the wild- though they are guarded with an impressive protectiveness nevertheless. (The Seattle Aquarium had found a way around this problem by hosting an annual Valentine's Day Octopus Blind Date.) Come underwater- Discover the secret worlds of these hidden souls! Sy Montgomery is a renown naturalist that writes with an irrefutable intellect and a palpable passion for what she does. The lifetime of experiences with animals grants her invaluable insight that she graciously imparts to readers. Borrowing from biology, ethology, psychology, and philosophy, ""The Soul of an Octopus"" is part memoir, part love letter, part reference book- and one hundred percent enlightening. My fave animal has long been the octopus- and now I know why! Further Reading: https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/... https://komonews.com/news/local/aquar... #Haibun #ReviewPoem #animals #Boston #explorer #friendship #misfits #nature #NewEngland #nonfiction #onaboat #philosophy #psychology #Seattle #subculture #worldwide "
30,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1884689-amberbug-com,5,"www.shelfnotes.com reviewDear Reader,The first thing I learned from this book was the correct pluralization is not octopi but octopuses. Go ahead, have a laugh... it made me giggle too but I'm also a little sad that octopi doesn't exist (THE word). Anywho... I want to be best friends with Sy Montgomery, not only because she writes about amazing animals but she usually calls her friends up to join in these adventures. Oh, how I would have loved to be the one to meet her at the New England Aquarium for the chance to ""pet"" an octopus. Died! I would have died from excitement. I don't know why these non-furry creatures give me such a thrill? Okay, I admit that after reading this book... I clearly know why... THEY FRAKIN' RULE.Let's get this over with... shall we? I mean, we all know I'm going to list off some fascinating facts from the book, right? Please turn your head or galavant down to the bottom paragraph if you would like to read this book blindly. I won't blame you. The facts you'll learn will have you ""Ooo0ing"" and ""Ahhhing"" quite often. However, I can't begrudge those who won't pick this book up... NO! I must convince them that reading about octopuses is entirely worth it. Which, by the way... It IS!My friend Marsha (Hi Marsha!) sent me a link to this amazing video that pretty much goes over all these amazing facts (plus the narrator is to die for!!) I highly recommend watching it AND reading this book. CLICK here to watch the amazing video!Fascinating fact #1: When an octopus is relaxed, it will appear white. Other colors can range all across the rainbow, giving them one of the most impressive camouflaging ability in the animal kingdom. As the author states in the book, ""They can change color, pattern, and texture in seven tenths of a second.""Fascinating fact #2: An octopus has three hearts (Whovian?) and a brain that wraps around its throat. Now THAT is redonkulous but guess what? It gets better. An octopus can also regrow its arm if broken off. Why? Because ""three fifths of octopus' neurons are not in the brain but the arms."" Dumbfounded. Where did these creatures come from?I was going to keep listing facts but I decided the best thing would be for you to experience the book for yourself. The Author is amazing, she really knows how to write a book about something that could mind numbing boring (in a scientific way) but manages to do the exact opposite. I can't wait to read more books from her. She even mentions Victor Hugo (LOVE) and many other literary and cultural references that had me excited. She also compared an octopus to a dog, how she could ""pet his head or scratch his forehead... he loves it"". My mission in life is to pet an octopus now. The Author also brings to life this mysterious animal. She makes this story real, not just scientific. We get to hear all about the the people who have been changed from interacting with these animals, in a wonderful heartfelt way. If you think octopuses are scary, believe me... after reading this, you'll feel differently. Happy Reading,AmberBug"
31,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54489623-the-captain,5,"Ahoy there mateys! Okay I now kinda have a thing for books that combine memoirs with science and fun animal facts. So far, I have read about ravens, hawks, owls, and snails (seriously snails are AMAZING). So when I saw this one about denizens of the deep, I just had to read it. I have always loved octopuses and was excited to learn more about them. I knew that they be masters of escape and are highly intelligent. I did not know facts like these:""A lion is a mammal like us; an octopus is put together completely differently, with three hearts, a brain that wraps around its throat, and a covering of slime instead of hair. Even their blood is a different color from ours; it’s blue, because copper, not iron, carries its oxygen.""― Sy Montgomery, The Soul of an Octopus: A Surprising Exploration into the Wonder of ConsciousnessLearning about the author’s life and those of the octopuses she befriends was absolutely fascinating. I loved the octopuses – “gentle Athena, assertive Octavia, curious Kali, and joyful Karma.” I loved the group of people that these creatures bring together. I loved learning more about the science of these beautiful creatures. I seriously was in awe of the personalities of the octopuses and was heartily cheering them on. There is some sadness to the tales as the larger octopus lives on average less than five years. But the octopus is a natural wonder that I now appreciate more fully. Should humans become extinct then mehaps octopuses can take over the flooded world! I highly recommend this book and would certainly read more of the author’s work.

32,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,3,"This is more than I wanted to know about Pacific Octopus in particular, but not as much about their soul as I expected. It starts well and she has an interesting tone, but it is difficult at times to get to the real tracking or testing or trials that I find far more purposeful than the feelings she has over companionship or emotive understandings. Some who like their science as real, real ""light science""- might like this more than I did.I did learn some things about how they taste through their suckers. And also the photos were marvelous. And it did give me pause for some of the science fiction I've read which has these as an alien line or creatures quite chemically different and with ""out of order"" body sections. The giant squid descriptions and observed behaviors, the measurements especially- that was also some of the material I was glad I read."
33,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1607230-shelleyrae-at-book-d-out,5,"I would probably not have given this book a second glance except that just days before it was offered to me for review I had read Turtle Reef, an Australian contemporary romance novel, in which the heroine, working at a marine park, befriended an octopus. I was intrigued by the relationship and was delighted by the opportunity to learn more.The Soul of an Octopus: A Surprising Exploration into the Wonder of Consciousness, is written by Sy Montgomery, an author, naturalist, documentary scriptwriter, and radio commentator. It offers a very readable and rather unique blend of personal experience, scientific knowledge and philosophical opinion about what is understood, and unknown, about the nature of octopuses.I knew little about octopuses—not even that the scientifically correct plural is not octopi, as I had always believed (it turns out you can’t put a Latin ending—i—on a word derived from Greek, such as octopus). But what I did know intrigued me. Here is an animal with venom like a snake, a beak like a parrot, and ink like an old-fashioned pen. It can weigh as much as a man and stretch as long as a car, yet it can pour its baggy, boneless body through an opening the size of an orange. It can change color and shape. It can taste with its skin. Most fascinating of all, I had read that octopuses are smart.""What Montogomery is able to show in The Soul of an Octopus is that octopuses are complex creatures who exhibit personality, intelligence and emotion, despite having neural systems completely alien to our own. During her time spent at the New England Aquarium she befriended several individual octopuses including Athena, who was the subject of a popular 2011 Orion magazine piece, ""Deep Intellect"" which went viral and was the inspiration for this book, Octavia, Kali and Karma. Through her study of, and interaction with, these extraordinary creatures she shares what she learns from both science and her experiences, while musing on the mystery of the 'inner lives' of the octopus, who grow from the size of a grain of rice and live for, on average, just four short years.The Soul of an Octopus is as smart, playful, curious and surprising as the creature it features. A fascinating read I'd highly recommend. "
34,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2945070-thom,3,"Got this book expecting science on consciousness, intelligence, or instinct. Found instead a memoir / travelogue, with occasional anecdotes about the octopus. Yes, I learned a few things, and the audio book was read by the author. The octopus really is quite alien from us, with neurons in their arms (which can go on living after the death of the head), and I was really hoping to read some new insights about this fascinating species. Less anecdotes, more science."
35,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35457176-kate,3,"I've always found octopuses interesting to look at, and I've watched a few documentaries about how smart they are. I enjoyed the author's descriptions of her experiences with Kali, Octavia, and the other captive octopuses at the aquarium. However, I found it sad when Octavia, who had no opportunity to mate, brooded over her huge clutch of infertile eggs, until her death from octopus old age. As others have said in their reviews, this situation felt wrong somehow. The octopus Kali dying when she successfully escaped her aquarium was also terrible to read about. I get that no aquarium can be perfectly escape-proof when such an intelligent creature gets bored, but it seems a shame that she died in the middle of the floor. I also get that an aquarium needs a display octopus for public relations and educational purposes. So I don't really have a point, I just wish the captive octopuses had better lives."
36,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/688965-sean,1,"This is not a popular science book, as the title implies. It doesn't ""explore the wonder of consciousness"" in any way whatsoever, unless you consider someone anthropomorphizing every aspect of an octopus's behavior to count as scientific inquiry. Various facts about octopuses are supplied, but they're precious few. Most of the book is about the author going to an aquarium and touching the octopuses and explaining how great she is for doing it and how special the love of the octopuses makes her feel, and how all the other rubes who come to the aquarium just don't get octopuses like she does.She explains how the intelligence of the octopus is vast and strange and unknowable by we humans--their arms acts as brains, their extent of their senses are a mystery, they hunt and fight and camoflauge themselves--they're amazing! All true! Then, no matter what the octopuses do, she tells us what they're thinking. Because she's been touching them. She can see into their souls!Worst of all--and it's really terrible--is her total lack of empathy for these animals she claims to love so very much. The fact that these octopuses are captured in the wild and forced to live their lives on display in little tanks doesn't bother her at all. When one is kept in a tiny barrel, she can only talk about how cute it is, or how odd it is that it always tries to get out whenever they take the top off. Ha ha! Crazy octopus.Then they stick that octopus in a tank not built for octopuses, it quickly finds a way out, and dies on the floor of the aquarium. I guess someone should have told that dumb octopus that it wouldn't live nearly so long in the wild as it would in an aquarium, the one excuse the author provides for why trapping and imprisoning these animals is fine with her. After this horrible death, her only sympathy lies with the aquarium employees who might blame themselves. Yes, they might, mightn't they? She's more interested in waxing rhapsodic about how the octopus touched her life than in actually caring about the octopus. Which sums up the whole book. This isn't a book about octopuses at all; they're merely the vehicle through which Sy Montgomery finds herself. In short, they're expendable. You can always catch another one.Every page of this book made me angrier than the last. The one thing octopuses have to fear more than their short lives in the wild is the ""love"" of humans like Montgomery."
37,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12889617-anne,3,"(3.5) What I enjoyed the most about this was the author's passion, enthusiasm, and awe for octopuses! I listened to the audio version (narrated by the author), and she did a wonderful job of expressing a genuine rapture that was quite contagious. I found myself thinking: ""Aaaaw, they sound so wonderful and playful, and I'd love to experience touching one too"".... BUT then I looked up a couple of youtube videos of Giant Pacific Octopuses, and I was totally reminded just how big and slimy and weird looking they really are ! HA! This is less of a scientific book and more a personal memoir/manifesto, but there's still some plenty of interesting things to learn about the octopuses physiology and behaviors. Someone looking for more in-depth scientific information will not find that in this book, but Sy Montgomery tells a colorful and interesting story about this period in her life when she interacted and learned about octopuses for a few years. She's an admirable naturalist who has traveled to some of the worlds most remote wildernesses in her endeavors, and she's written 13 award-winning books about those experiences."
38,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/374456-kerri-anne,2,"Have I mentioned I LOVE (books about) marine life? Okay, good. This book? NOPE. I tried, you guys. I really really tried. But it's so tone-deaf and entitled that it's both excruciating and ridiculous.< begin octopus-laden novella >I have dichotomous and very strong feelings about aquariums, zoos, and any organization that takes wild specimens from the ocean (or forests, or any other natural habitat) in order for them to be studied and kept behind bars, plastic walls, within contrived habitats, no matter how beloved they come to be while there. Bred in captivity or rescued to be rehabilitated and released is one thing, but plucked from the wild ocean and put into a tank for human educational and/or entertainment consumption is quite another. It feels wasteful, and like it's stealing. A female octopus would at least stand a chance of producing viable offspring in the wild. Snatch her from the Pacific Ocean and put her in a tank and though she may still lay eggs (as is evidenced upon more than one occasion in this book), none of them will be fertilized. The idea that those 100,000 eggs are wasted instead of added to the overall oceanic ecosystem and a food chain that needs them makes me profoundly sad. And the author comparing unfertilized octopus eggs to unfertilized chicken eggs is maybe one of the dumbest analogies I've ever read from a so-called ""naturalist."" Present-day hens have been entirely domesticated by humans to be a steadfast food source. They aren't endangered and they aren't ""wild."" That isn't even remotely true of octopuses. But the biggest factor Montgomery simply ignores in this book is that we are raping and pillaging the oceans at alarming rates, and so the idea of 100,000 octopus eggs not being needed in the ocean is so short-sighted and ridiculous as to be malicious. Sy Montgomery, the author of this book, and so the lens from which readers get to know some of these amazing creatures, quite unfortunately but very honestly comes across as almost entirely pretentious and elitist from start to finish, as if she has the right to know an octopus ""intimately"" simply because she('s bored and unfilled and) wants to. Her and her aquarium colleagues feel terrible when a beloved octopus in the prime of her life escapes her tank the night they put her in it (after living 99% of her life in captivity in a dark barrel much too small for her), but then move on to another octopus caught in the wild a few weeks later. She justifies interfering with an octopus' life in the wild by asserting they protect it and entertain it. Time and time again they're beloved pets and ""friends"" when they ought to be allowed to live wild and free. The man in charge of snatching octopuses from the wild and delivering them to aquariums across the continent doesn't have any regrets. Likely in large part because he's paid well for the effort. He deems them ""ambassadors from the wild"" and asserts they live longer in captivity, a statement which is blatantly false, and especially ridiculous when, as admitted only a few pages later, marine scientists know very little about the mating habits and social structures of octopuses, and have documented cases of colonies of octopuses living together and mating many times over a span of forty years (most octopuses in captivity live no longer than a year). Kali (the octopus who died after being out of her tank on the floor all night) would have very likely lead a long and fulfilling life had she been left in the ocean to swim and explore and eat and breed outside of the needy eyes of people occupying the Boston Aquarium. Ultimately, I maintain that a creature's right to exist in the wild supersedes our desire (and what some would deem a ""right"" but that feels more like ""entitlement"" to me) to study and interact and ""know"" it on our own terms. I also maintain that most aquariums and zoos and other tourist-heavy parks are businesses before they're anything else. When it's more about profit, tourism, and capitalism than it is about science, conservation, and/or rehabilitation, I begin to feel uneasy. Large portions of most zoos and aquariums leave me with a pervading sense of dread and regret, and if I paid to get in—complicity. Wild animals, wild octopuses, wild snails, wild anything—they don't exist for our amusement, knowledge, curiosity, or enjoyment. They have every right to exist independent of us, without us meddling in their already characteristically and somewhat tragically short life-spans. I'll admit to hating the premise that people need to know a place or a creature before they'll endeavor to protect it. What happened to common sense and decency? What happened to protecting wild places and creatures because they deserve to exist, regardless of how we *feel* about them? Maybe that's fantasy, but oh how I wish it were reality. Do I believe in scientific exploration and curiosity and study of our marine ecosystems? Of course I do. But I also believe it can be done without plucking wild animals from their wild habitats and forcing them to lead wholly captive lives when they were otherwise free to contribute to and interact with their oceanic homeland. 
All of that to say:
 I'm not entirely sure how I finished this book. I kept hoping the author might wake up and become aware of her own entitlement and at times utterly ridiculous and reckless behavior. But that didn't happen. So often that just doesn't happen. We as humans can often only see through our own lens of wants and needs, and the tragedy continues to be that those desires often do long-term damage to our planet and the other creatures inhabiting it. The fragile marine ecosystems on which all creatures on this earth (including us as human beings) depend for life and breath and sustenance doesn't need more pillaging for science or progress or because we're laden with existential ennui and wish to peer into the void, and into the fantastic world of the octopus. Our oceans need more conservation, protection, and respect. They need it and they deserve it and unless we wake up to the cruelty and waste prevalent in oceans around the world, I fear we really are doomed. And we'll have no one to blame but ourselves, and our greed, and this incessant need to touch and taste and take, as if by simply existing, the world and everything in it is owed to us, and open to commercial and emotional profiteering. < / end octopus-laden novella > [Two stars for Kali and Octavia, who—just to be clear—are octopuses and not people.]"
39,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2644090-erica,4,"SPOILER ALERT:This is a book about how often octopuses die; it's all Game of Thrones up in here! I did not expect that.In the beginning, the author mentions a few times that octopuses and squid and their kin have historically been considered frightening and monstrous.

I knew that. I didn't know that they were still considered scary things to be afraid of, though I suppose we do kinda keep pushing that narrative...

Maybe it's because I'm from and live in a landlocked state so ocean fauna isn't something that worries me.Except saltwater crocodiles, which should be illegal because WHY do they get to chase you out of the ocean to eat you? Seriously! That is nightmare fuel right there.I was out to dinner with some friends, all younger than myself, and asked them how they felt about octopuses. Most of them said that they thought they were smart. I asked if they felt they were scary in any way and nobody remembered learning to be afraid of any cephalopods, though they all know not to step on a jellyfish.I mention this because I was confused about the more-than-one reference to octopuses as something of a terror in society's consciousness. Do people really consider them dangerous and worrisome, something that will attack and eat you if you bleed in the water?

Most of my octopus knowledge came from my incredible friend, Aspen who has been an octopus aficionado and fan for as long as I've known her, as well as from Ze Frank's True Facts About the Octopus. And, honestly, if you've watched that, none of the octopus facts in this book will surprise you.But this book is not about facts. It's about characters. Montgomery, a naturalist and something of an investigative reporter, meets a bunch of octopuses and falls in love with them, sharing her journey into cephalamour (new word!) with the reader. We also follow the makings of her friendships with other marine life and bipedal land dwellers alike.Montgomery shares her experiences with different octopuses and their personalities at the New England Aquarium which, by the way, was the first aquarium I ever visited. I don't remember an octopus; I only remember walking round and round, up and up, a giant glass tube full of water and sharks. I think I was 9.It's her discovery of how people and ocean animals create unique and distinct relationships that makes this book compelling. It also makes it awful because, as I began with, octopuses die. Like by the handful and so I had to get misty-eyed several times throughout the book while I was working. At work. Where people could see me.I also learned that aquariums often people their exhibits with wild-caught animals. I'm not sure why that surprised me as much as it did. Maybe because the zoos near me get most of their animals from other zoos, from rescue operations, or because their animals have babies. I don't believe the zoos near me typically go out and procure animals from their wild places and when they do, it's usually part of a conservation effort. I mean, I suppose they could be lying but they're pretty up front with the provenance of most of their critters. I guess I thought aquarium animals were also from other aquariums or had been born in captivity or had been rescued. Now I'm a little upset to find that's not the case. Octavia the octopus illustrates that point nicely - she's from the wild but she spends the rest of her life in the aquarium and while Montgomery lists the pros and cons of capturing a wild animal and housing it away from the ocean, they're all human-centric points. Sure, Octavia may have lived longer and she always had food and she seemed to have liked her people friends and she was safe but do those things matter to an octopus? If given the choice, would an octopus be all, ""Yes, I absolutely want to live in safety where I can explore things and people will play with me and I will always have food!"" But there's no way to know until we figure out how to communicate with these smart ocean dwellers which, now, thanks to this book, I really want to learn to do. I guess I should start by becoming more sciencey."
40,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6296289-tyler-j-gray,5,"I promised a review so dang it i'm gonna try. It's not that I don't want to, I want to shout about my love for this book and wish everyone would read it! My issue is I feel I don't have a whole lot to say besides that.I was captivated from beginning to end. I've always loved animals and Octopuses have always fascinated me in particular but I didn't really know much about them. I also do believe in the concept of souls (this book isn't preaching any religion or anything like that, though they do go to a Church of the Octopus somewhere later in the book) and believe that all living creatures, which of course includes Octopuses, have a soul. Also that different animals evolved differently, that doesn't make them stupid. So I didn't think of Octopuses below us humans, and I was STILL blown away by how amazingly smart and individual these animals are!This book made me realize I need to quit making my tabs mean anything by color because then I will quickly run out of certain colored tabs and have to change it up, so now my tab colors mean nothing but i'm still color coding by highlighters. And I was highlighting SO MUCH through-out this book! And that is a huge compliment to how much I loved this!I learned so much about Octopuses that I never knew. I also learned about some other marine animals in the Aquarium in Boston as well as about the people who love them. Several different people, sharing in their love for these animals. And the animals would show it back, but of course many people will just roll their eyes at that but this goes into detail and shows you just how these animals do that.Each Octopuses had a different personality and they all came alive in the book. Each time one would pass away I ended up crying. But I was also choking/tearing up at other parts of the book. I went into the book expecting to like it and learn about Octopuses, and I got that and so much more. I don't know how much more I could really say so i'll tell you I felt it was awesome from beginning to end, getting even better as it went on and my glowing recommendation!""One person consistently fed a particular octopus, and another always touched it with a bristly stick. Within a week, at first sight of the people-looking up at them through the water, without even touching or tasting them-most of the octopuses moved toward the feeder and away from the irritator. Sometimes the octopus would aim its water-shooting funnel, the siphon near the side of the head with which an octopus jets through the sea, at the person who had touched it with the bristly stick.""I'd love to add more quotes (and I know there are far more powerful ones but I don't want to spoil them!) but then I just want to go down a rabbit hole and quote the entire book when really I just want everyone to experience it for themselves. I learned a lot, it never felt like a text book, and I got attached to both the people and the animals. I will revisit this book again and again and I honestly just feel like I can't find adequate words to say how much I loved this book! Can I live in this book now please?Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Tumblr | Instagram"
41,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,4,"Just as wonderful as I expected. Of course, I had a fantasy that the book would have even more evidence of octopuses' cognitive abilities, and even more science, zookeeping, and philosophical connections. But we (human scientists) are only just beginning to be willing to think of other animals as intelligent, self-aware, etc., and we actually know very little about octopuses. This is an 'exploration' and a primer, and a fascinating, mostly enjoyable read. (There were some sad bits.) I do recommend you read this on, or with, web-connected device, because there are lots of things you'll want to investigate. There are not nearly enough photos included in the book. There is an index and a selected (but still long, and not annotated) bibliography.An older book I still have on my to-read list is When Elephants Weep: The Emotional Lives of Animals. An older book I loved is The Minds of Birds. Of course you want to read Mongomery's other books, and Alex & Me: How a Scientist and a Parrot Discovered a Hidden World of Animal Intelligence—and Formed a Deep Bond in the Process. And I'm about to start the quite new Animal Wise: The Thoughts and Emotions of Our Fellow Creatures. ""Dolphins were recently discovered sharing a certain toxic puffer fish, gently passing it from one cetacean snout to another, as people would pass a joint, after which the dolphins seem to enter a trancelike state.""""Above the surface, we move and think like wiggly children, or like teens who twitch away at their computer-phones, multi-tasking but never focusing. But the ocean forces you to move more slowly, more purposefully, and yet more pliantly. By entering it, you are bathed in a grace and power you don't experience in air....""From a conversation upon the sudden death of a mutual friend: ""I guess what I've discovered,"" [young friend] Anna said to me, ""is what you do today doesn't affect yesterday.... Yesterday remains perfect.""I will continue to read more by Montgomery, including a children's bio of my hero. Temple Grandin: How the Girl Who Loved Cows Embraced Autism and Changed the World"
42,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17951043-perri,4,"""There's nothing as peculiar as an octopus"". Pretty much-I can hardly imagine some beings from Mars being described in more alien terms. Their arms are almost like separate beings, their ink has hormones like oxytocin, their skin not only changes in a kaleidoscope of color and pattern but texture as well. I don't share Montgomery's passion for these critters, but her wonder is contagious. We've learned a lot in a fairly short time , but it's obvious we've scratched the surface. While I found this book informative and entertaining, it was easy to put down and read at leisure. For when you're in the mood for an easy educational read. "

 by Sy Montgomery Update: Marked as read although not read as I'd have liked because as i wrote below awhile back there's ''so' much to love here I ended up pre-ordering a print copy and it can't release quick enough for my liking. I cannot wait to be able to share some quotes, facts, and the pure fascinating, intriguing Beauty of what's in between theses pages!! Soon........I've had it on pre-order for what seems like forever!! My earlier thoughts Not a review yet. I was granted access to a DRC of this book by Atria Books from edelwiess.abovethetreeline so I want to say Thank you for that to #AtriaBooks and #edelwiess). It only took being into the book a very short time for it to have captured my Heart. I know a lot of that had to do with the synopsis as well, but while I was reading I couldn't get over the fascination of the facts that were given immediately and the beginnings of the connection between the MC, the octopus, Athena, and how quickly and deeply it poured into my Heart. I'm literally tearing up writing this. I've always had a deep love for sea ""creatures"", mammals of all kinds and adored 

 by Joshua Horwitz so I knew right away that this book was a needed in print book. If I highlighted anything on the DRC it would have looked like a Christmas tree of highlights. I'm going to keep reading this until the print copy is available because it's pulling at me constantly to go back to it, however the vast amount of facts are Beautiful, stunning, fascinating, they'll pull at your Heart and feed your soul like nothing I've ever read before. I'm in profound awe of what this book is feeding me and I cannot wait for the print to be available. One where I can highlight, underline and put sticky notes in to my hearts wishes, which will most definitely be every page. This is a treasure to be cherished. I want to spill all the facts I've read about so far, but I can't because it's an unfinished proof and there are so many !! Not to mention the immediate bond between octopus and human. Something I learned which I had no idea was that the plural form of octopus isn't octupi, rather octopuses. ""Can't put and 'i' on a word derived from Greek"", and that the size of the octopuses eggs is the size of a grain of rice but can grow the size longer and heavier than a man in three years. My God, this book is something incredibly special and its a keeper. I want to not just dive into the book, I want to dive onto the tank with the MC. I want to post all the facts and the words she's talking about that are forming the bond. I also loved the reference to Victor Hugo's words from the book 

 by Victor Hugo I'm dying with Joy here over this book and couldn't be more happy that I was given a chance to read it. It's a book that all lovers for marine life will adore, appreciate, love and want to cherish forever. I know I will and I recommend it to 'everyone' else who has that same love. Touching, full, bonding, stunning, informative, educational, Beautiful.....Thank you #AtriaBooks #SimonandSchuster and #edelweiss I'm still reading this, but I can barely contain my excitement for the print copy to be available. My Gratitude for this is immeasurable! "

The concept is touched upon in this book but not really resolved. It suggests that it is not to necessarily a good habit to fall into in scientific study but it seems like the humans in this book all fill in any effort they might have made to avoid the trap.It is always interesting to listen to an audible book that is actually read by the author. That is the case with this book. I am the author is just effusive with her love of the animals. The extraordinarily detailed descriptions of the relationships between people and octopuses indeed does make you want to be able to have the experience yourself. Anyone who has had the experience of the death of a beloved pet can understand the feelings the author expresses in the occasions in the book where she describes the death of a beloved octopus.On one field trip she actually goes to what she refers to as an octopus church. She is literally into the soul concept in the absolutely religious point of view. Some of the studies that were undertaken to attempt to better understand the various feelings of octopuses did leave me wondering about the value of scientific research. Better people should study the octopus rather than build more atomic weapons but that is about as far as I can go with the concept.I thought the book was pretty much a feel good effort about The octopus but it didn’t try very hard to convince me why I should really be too enthralled with the idea. My older daughter is enthralled with the octopus and that is really what attracted me to this book. So it is possible that I expected too much.
45,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata,4,"Sy Montgomery spent many hours getting to know various octopuses at an aquarium. She described their actions, their personalities, their changing colours; it’s fascinating how such alien-looking creatures can also share some traits with us. While octopuses’ movement evokes a certain amount of shuddering in me, I’m also now tremendously fascinated by these many-armed, inquisitive and playful creatures, thanks to Sy Montgomery’s excitement and love for them. Her enthusiasm for octopuses and their intelligence comes through clearly in this book."
46,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440212-linda,3,"I enjoyed this overall as I learned quite a lot about octopuses that I had previously had no idea about. The book contained a bit of filler than I care for, though, and I could hear the pages being turned by the author as she narrated the audiobook. I think I might have enjoyed this more if I had read the print book. "
47,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1505281-julie-suzanne,4,"I am the perfect audience for this book! I knew next to nothing about octopuses and listened to this audiobook with rapt attention. I'm fascinated, touched, more knowledgeable and even more curious than before. I've changed my beliefs about aquariums based on Montgomery's experiences and now plan to visit one some day. Listening to this book read by the author herself was an experience I likely won't forget. "
48,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4230132-jennifer-hendzlik,4,"As I have built my listening to people talk about books skills one thing has become fairly obvious. If someone can't shut up about a book they read-it got to them on a deep level that often even they can't explain. When you hear that-pay attention. In a committee meeting of fiction gurus, I heard this happen with this title. Nonfiction is tough for me, I approach it like I have to master the subject. I am constantly looking things up and enhancing the original book. Yet, I wrote the title down, requested an ARC and here we are.Montgomery immersed herself into the world of the Octopus spending time in both aquariums and the ocean to learn more about these alien creatures that often mystify us. A mixture of octopus facts, stories from the author as well as the staff she spent time with and the octopuses(did you know octopi has no etymological basis?) she grew to know lets the reader see how incredibly intelligent and curious these creatures are to the point they can be their own worst enemy when they get bored. I've been bombarding people with Octopus facts for weeks. Sorry/not sorry. "
49,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12436728-debbicat,5,"I checked this out from the library. I renewed it. I also listened some of the time on audio via the library app, Hoopla. The author narrates it herself...and she is very good at it. When I read, held the book in my hand, I read this book slowly, taking it all in. I savored it. Learned from it. Felt SO MANY emotions. Joy, anger, outrage, sadness, surprise, relief, pain, curiosity, suffering. More. Much more.I don't feel I can even begin to review this at this time. I don't know what I fully feel just yet. But I FEEL a lot! And, it changed me. And had a great impact on me. I wanna hug an Octopus. And be their friend. More thoughts another time. I am still absorbing it. "
50,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5745485-christopher,4,"It's an exercise in empathy: how much can you understand the life and feelings of something so alien as an octopus? Does it get lonely? Does it think it's funny when it squirts you with a stream of water from its siphon? Would it feel a sense of companionship if you were to reach into the briny water of its tank and hold its tentacle?This book isn't just a list of cool facts about octopuses; it's a plea for you to put yourself in others' shoes...or, suckers or flippers or paws or slimy little feet. It's a reminder to stop and think, don't be so wrapped up in yourself that you forget the world around you and all of the souls that live in it. "
51,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1063661-woodge,4,"Hey! A fun book (with pictures) about octopuses! And octopuses is the correct plural form since the root word is from Greek, not Latin. The author spends a lot of time at the New England Aquarium and gets to know several Giant Pacific octopuses. She also learns to scuba dive so she can observe them in the wild as well. At barely 250 pages, this is a great introduction to a fascinating animal. Among other things I learned that octopuses taste with their skin; most of their neurons are not in the brains, but in their arms; they are very strong -- one sucker might lift 30 pounds, and that they would be crazy-expensive pets. "
52,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"The plural of octopus is octopuses, not octopi. That's because it has a Greek origin, not a Latin origin. At least that's the scientifically correct answer. But I'm sure many people still say octopi. An octopus is ""an animal with venom like a snake, a beak like a parrot, and ink like an old-fashioned pen. It can weigh as much as a man and stretch as long as a car, yet it can pour its baggy, boneless body through an opening the size of an orange. It can change color and shape. It can taste with its skin. Most fascinating of all, I have read that octopuses are smart."" If you haven't yet heard the story of Inky the Octopus, here it is: http://daily.jstor.org/flight-inky-oc... And here is the Bill Murphy video posted on You Tube in 2007: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6DWQ... We tend to look at invertebrates as so different than us. It is difficult for humans to conceive of that branch of life as feeling pain or engaged in any thinking process. Invertebrates include mollusks, slugs, snails, clams. The author states ""Clams don't even have brains."" We tend to fear anything different. That probably applies to fearing other humans as well. It certainly applies to snakes, spiders, and other creatures we look on as ""slimy"" or ""gross."" ""There's always an effort to minimize emotion and intelligence in other species. The prejudice is particularly strong in fish and invertebrates.""--Tony LaCasse from the New England Aquarium. It was Renee Descartes who is famous for the idea that animals are just machines and have no souls. Thus, he performed horrendous experiments on them. Animal rights groups often still hate him for it. Perhaps that is the reason for the word ""soul"" in the title.Jane Goodall was ""too intimidated to publish some of her most intriguing observations of wild chimpanzees for twenty years. . . . Her long delay in writing stemmed from a fear that other scientists would accuse her of anthropomorphizing . . . her study subjects."" I have always hated watching fish caught in a net. They look miserable. It seems so cruel to me. Here's a group called Fish Feel: http://fishfeel.org/?version=meter%20...""Three fifths of octopuses' neurons are not in the brain but in the arms. If an arm is severed from an octopuses' body, the arm will often carry on as if nothing has happened for several hours."" Here is the link to The Cephalopod Page: http://www.thecephalopodpage.org/An octopus brain is the size of a walnut, same size as an African gray parrot, which can learn about one hundred spoken words. Brain size isn't everything. Neurons matter. An octopus has 300 million neurons. A rat, 200 million. A frog, around 16 million. A pond snail, at most 16,000. A human has 100 billion. The human brain is organized into four lobes, but the octopus has 50 to 75 different lobes. And most of the octopus's neurons are in the arms, not in the brain. Octopuses showed examples of play: squirting a plastic bottle around, what a scientist called ""bouncing the ball!"" Octopuses have their own new magazine, published by and for octopuses: https://www.tonmo.com/My first complaint. The author speaks of getting a ""pet"" octopus. I'm not a fan of pets from the wild. I accept large aquariums run by scientists for study and spreading a love of living things. But I'm pretty sure a lot of pets end up dying or being released in the wrong spots. She also mentions it would cost thousands of dollars. That money would be better spent on investing in the planet rather than adding to the harm. Eventually, she does not go through with her desire for a pet octopus. Octavia the octopus takes care of her unfertilized eggs. How does she know how to do this? Its certainly an argument for the lack of free will. Living things follow actions passed down through millions of years. Australian philosopher David Chalmers calls consciousness ""the hard problem."" Many philosophers suggest that the self is an idea without basis. Psychologist Susan Blackmore writes, ""Science does not need an inner self but most people are quite sure we are one."" She also writes, ""The self is just a fleeting impression that arises with each experience and fades away again. . . . There is no inner self, only multiple parallel processes that give rise to a benign inner delusion--a useful fiction."" She argues that consciousness itself is a fiction. The Buddha denied the existence of persisting selves. At the end of life, the self dissolves into eternity. I agree with Ms. Blackmore. I find my answers in science. I think it is important to remember the word ""useful."" It is a ""useful fiction."" I live my life ""as if"" it were real. All the usual hormones are found in octopuses: estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, corticosterone. All animals have physiological changes that accompany our deepest felt emotions. And they appear to be the same. ""Even a brainless scallop's little heart beats faster when the mollusk is approached by a predator, just like yours or mine would do were we to be accosted by a mugger."" Each octopus arm enjoys a great deal of autonomy. Much of what goes on there ""never makes it to the brain."" They are ""really like separate creatures."" Octopuses can grow new arms. On occasion, they can detach an arm. Only two in 100,000 octopus hatchlings survive to sexual maturity. Otherwise the sea would be ""overrun with octopuses.""

53,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/304492-darrell,3,"""Hormones and neurotransmitters, the chemicals associated with human desire, fear, love, joy, and sadness, ""are highly conserved across taxa,"" Jennifer said. This means that whether you're a person or a monkey, a bird or a turtle, an octopus or a clam, the physiological changes that accompany our deepest-felt emotions appear to be the same.""Octopuses (and this is the correct plural) are very alien creatures. They can taste with their skin, they have blue blood and three hearts, but they're repelled by fresh water. They mostly live in the ocean, but can survive up to half an hour on land.An octopus bite can inject a neurotoxic venom and octopus saliva can dissolve flesh. They shoot out ink to escape from predators, which can be poisonous to them in a tank. Octopus ink irritates eyes and clogs the gills of other sea animals, perhaps drugging them too. Their ink contains an enzyme that blocks oxytocin and vasopressin, and contains dopamine. (As a side note, dolphins have been known to pass around toxic puffer fish like a joint, presumably to get high.)One of the fastest-growing animals on the planet, an octopus hatches from an egg the size of a grain of rice and grows bigger than a human within three years. Octopuses can weigh as much as man, stretch out as big as a car, but can squeeze through an area the size of an orange. A giant Pacific octopus can lift 30 pounds with each of its 1600 suckers. An octopus the size of your hand is stronger than you are. They can control each sucker individually. Each sucker's grip is so fine, they can untie knots.However, they only live about 3 to 4 years. Males die after mating and females die when their eggs hatch, although females can go without eating for years while tending to their eggs.Three fifths of their neurons are in the arms and each arm seems to have a mind of its own, some curious about new things, some cowering. Octopuses sometimes detach an arm, which continues moving hours after being severed. Lost arms can regenerate good as new, unlike a lizard's tail which doesn't grow back quite the same.They're better at camouflage than chameleons, able to make 30 to 50 different patterns. They can change color, pattern, and texture in less than a second, including the use of polarized light colors which humans can't see. An octopus can use camouflage to make it appear to be moving when it's standing still. They have red and bumpy skin when excited, white and smooth skin when calm or about to die.Unlike humans, they have no blind spot, can see polarized light, and have panoramic vision with eyes pointing in two different directions. However, they can only see eight feet ahead of them. Their eyes are color blind, but given their camouflage expertise, they may be able to see with their skin.Unlike humans, they can actually multitask. Each octopus has an individual personality. They're one of the very few animals who can understand what pointing means, which implies they have theory of mind, the knowledge that others know things they do not. Which seems to be the case since they use different camouflage techniques against different species. They recognize people on sight and shoot water at people they don't like using the funnel they use for propulsion.Octopuses are mostly solitary creatures (the pacific striped octopuses are a notable exception, since they live in large groups). They can arrange rocks in front of a dwelling like a wall, and demonstrate tool use by carrying coconut shells around with them to hide in. One octopus was witnessed killing sharks not for food, but as a preemptive attack.Na Kika, a Gilbert Islands octopus god, pushed the islands up from the sea. In Hawaiian myths, there was a previous creation, the only survivor of which was the octopus who slipped between the cracks between worlds.This book is largely about the author's visits to an aquarium and a couple scuba diving excursions, with the interesting facts about octopuses sprinkled in. We get to know the personalities of a few octopuses who live at the aquarium. Their short lives made all the more tragic by how intelligent they are."
54,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35645863-lena,5,"Yesterday I set off on a one mile walk with my dog and this audiobook - that mile became four because I didn't want to stop listening. I made dinner and listened. I ate dinner and listened. Tucked in my bed I listened into the wee hours. I woke up, brushed my teeth and listened. In short, I am completely hooked by this audiobook. This is a warm, intelligent, funny, empathic outreach tale. Mostly it's about her experiences with the resident octopuses of the New England Aquarium as well as the other residents, keepers, and fellow enthusiasts. These cold creatures need more people like Sy Montgomery writing on their behalf. I consider myself an animal person but I would have never attributed companion behavior to snakes and sharks. I had thought of them as robotic. I was wrong. Octopuses, I had known were intelligent and clever but I hadn't thought of them as companionable. After all, these are self raised creatures of the dangerous dark depths, solitary and mysterious. So why are they so touchy, gregarious, friendly, and gently thoughtfully inquisitive?  The Battle Royal it takes for an octopus to reach maturity would have knocked the nice right out of me. The answer postulated in the book: Their intelligence is not our intelligence. A simple answer to a fathom of possibilities and complications. An octopus evolved based on a different set of needs. None of this kept Sy from reaching out and taking me with her. Warm is the word I keep returning to in my mind, this is a warm story. Her voice, animal descriptions, friendships, really everything but the icy Pacific water and its inhabitants, lol. I didn't want this to end. I'm starting it over then giving it to my mother for Christmas."
55,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,5,"Was there any doubt that I would love this book?! Part memoir, part science, Sy Montgomery tells of her emersion into the fascinating world of octopuses at the New England Aquarium as guided by the extremely knowledgable and caring experts who work there. Her love and wonder of the animals in captivity lead her to explorations in the wild, where she sees her beloved friends in their natural environment.I admit it: I don't like octopuses. While their camouflage skills are second to none, they are kind of ugly. More than that, as a diver, I have heard (though never witnesses) horrifying stories of octopuses that adhere to the mask and regulator of divers, pulling the life-sustaining equipment from their bodies, and leaving them without sight and/or oxygen at depth.These may very well be old wives tales but they terrify me. So much in fact that I have had nightmares after dives where I have caught glimpse of these elusive predators.But, Montgomery exposes another side of the animals. She depicts them as naturally curious, highly intelligent, capable of recognizing and liking people, and -- a once bold claim that is gaining scientific support -- possessive of a consciousness that allows them to assess their surroundings and make actual choices.Montgomery invited us into her life, and the lives of octopuses, in an entertaining, engaging, and educational way. I may not want to rush out and give wild octopuses a big hug, but I am going to spend more time at the octopus tank next time I go to the New England Aquarium."
56,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16803629-hank,4,"A book about aquariums, diving, consciousness but most of all octopusses (not octopi). What fascinating and smart creatures! Montgomery has clearly fallen for them which shows in her writing. She sometimes gets a bit too effusive about octopus intelligence and there are a bit too many passages about plunging her arms into cold water for the octopuses to feel her but overall a fantastic book. There are seemiingly endless, funny and interesting tidbits about octopuses. Personalities, life span, size, capabilites all things I had no idea about.Who needs science fiction when there are fantastical things existing in reality."

The science behind how these creatures interact with their surroundings is interesting and takes some imagination to understand. Wait, the mouth isn't part of the head? They taste with their arms? Strange, yet makes sense. The author also gets into what these creatures experience beyond the physical and illustrates how they express emotion like anger, sadness, and joy. Plausible, but some of this goes a bit too far and seems more like the author's own projection which she works very hard to get others to agree. And oddly, the one thing she seems to miss altogether is how the octopus may react differently by virtue of being in captivity. She eventually participates in a deep sea dive where she sees a few in the wild but she doesn't reconcile that with their captive behavior. As a book that meshes 'science lite' with existential thinking about an unusual deep sea animal, it's a nice lyrical read. "
59,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2110092-preeti,5,"Update April 2016: This awesome book is now available in paperback!Where do I begin with this? Well, first off to chide myself on not having read enough Sy Montgomery books. She’s one of my favorite authors so what’s my problem?*****I’d been looking forward to this book since I first heard about it last year. Sy Montgomery has written some excellent books and pieces on animals and the natural world – one of which was in Orion Magazine a few years ago: Deep Intellect. This piece chronicled her experiences with a particular octopus and touched upon their intelligence. Orion Magazine even hosted a chat on the subject shortly after the article was published – probably because it proved to be so popular!This book is basically an extension of that article – Montgomery meets more octopuses, both in aquariums and in the wild. She explores their world, taking the reader on both a scientific, but largely philosophical journey through the octopus’ intellect and on the concept of their consciousness, if such a thing exists.A large part of the book is spent at the New England Aquarium in Boston, where Montgomery meets and gets to know a few octopuses as well as their keepers, and other employees and volunteers. She even gets to know some of the other animals there and explores a bit of their worlds as well. For example, on a sea star that shared a tank with one of the octopuses:I wonder: Can a brainless animal feel curiosity? Does it want to play? Or does it only ""want"" toys or food the way a plant ""wants"" the sun? Does a sea star experience consciousness? If it does, what does consciousness feel like to a sea star? (p20)The concept of animals being smart is fairly new to science. Just a decade or two ago, it was unfathomable to most people. And the idea of a “lower” group of animals like octopuses displaying intelligence? Crazy talk! But over time, the idea has become more accepted and it’s hard to imagine a world in which it wasn’t.There are some amazing videos on YouTube and elsewhere, showing the things octopuses are capable of doing. But the thing that strikes me is how different an octopus is compared to us. They have three hearts! They have multiple brains! They can sense and taste with their tentacles! They can change into a kaleidoscope of colors, while being color blind (or having monochromatic vision – I need to learn more about this)! They have eight arms! So what does that mean for our understanding of their world, much less their intellect?Assessing the mind of a creature this alien demands that we be extraordinarily flexible in our own thinking. Marine biologist James Wood suggests our hubris gets in our way. (p50)And what else is out there that we haven’t even explored, thought about, considered in a different way?""So if an octopus is this smart,"" Steve asked Bill, ""what other animals are out there that could be this smart—that we don't think of as being sentient and having personality and memories and all these things?"" (p48)Beyond smarts, what about personality? It’s quite clear that many people who have pets that they have personalities. They’re not automatons that respond in the same way to stimuli. And that’s the case not only for octopus, but for so many other animals that people are lucky enough to get close to, whether in the wild or elsewhere. Montgomery talks about some of these stories as well, as she explores the world of the octopus.But what I like the most is that through her writing, you feel like you are there with her, hanging out with octopuses and getting to know them. At the end of the book, when one of the octopuses Montgomery got to know very well was close to death, Montgomery felt it as if she were losing a friend – which she was. And I felt it too. I read that particular section with tears in my eyes, as if I, too, were losing a friend.Now I’m on a quest of my own to try to get to know an octopus too – or at least see one in the wild. Just getting a tiny taste of their world would be such an amazing experience, and such a great way to bring all the feelings in this book to life.An amazing Day octopus I watched for a while at the California Academy of Sciences."
60,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6840223-erika,1,"I was still on an ocean hangover from a trip to Coronado when I bought this book. The ocean fascinates me and I'm particularly intrigued by jellyfish and octopus. It should be noted that the author of his book, Sy Montgomery, is a seasoned writer, investigative explorer, and recipient of lifetime achievement awards from the Humane Society. I believe her to be a caring and conscientious animal lover who holds animals' best interests in high regard--BUT, the her book is plagued with many instances of overreach. Montgomery documents her research of four octopuses housed at the New England Aquarium. Facts and statistics are dispersed throughout the book, one of which reveals that octopuses taste through their suckers and can literally taste your skin. On one visit to the aquarium, Montgomery brings a friend who is a smoker. The octopus reacts harshly to the friend and Montgomery wonders if it is because the octopus could taste the nicotine on her friend's skin. Another time, the author ponders whether or not the octopus will interact with her since she recently dyed her hair and perhaps the octopus wouldn't like the chemicals. Yet, she plunges her hands and arms in the water anyway. Montgomery herself even acknowledges the danger of this: ""[...] the skin of an octopus is one giant, fantastically sensitive mucous membrane. Steinhart Aquarium's assistant curator J. Charles Delbeek has likened cephalopod skin to the lining of the mammalian gut, with the result that 'levels of chemicals, nutrients, pollutants, etc. that are seemingly not toxic to other species and inverts can be toxic to cephs.'"" Moreover, the entire book revolves around Montgomery's quest to prove the consciousness of an octopus, yet a great portion of the book focuses on the suffocating handling of the octopus named Kali. Kali was procured from the wild by the aquarium and kept in a darkened barrel--void of stimulation, as well noted by the author--for approximately nine months because the aquarium did not have the space for her. (They needed her to replace an aging octopus already on display in the event that the older invertebrate died.) Eventually, it becomes evident that older (Octavia) and younger (Kali) must switch places. It's a risky move and one that proves fatal for Kali--she escaped through a two-inch hole in the lid of the tank. I have no doubt her staff and volunteers were devastated by her loss. However, when Wilson, one of her handlers says, ""'She had a day of freedom [in the new tank]. And that she got out tells you a phenomenally inquisitive and intelligent creature wanted her freedom. We know, clearly, it must have taken a lot of effort to get out.'"" And clearly, Wilson, it should tell you, Montgomery, and the aquarium that her ""freedom"" was not a tank. Captured at an approximate age of nine months, left in a barrel for nine more, only to die on the aquarium floor...disgraceful. Considering that only a few (like, less than five) out of 100,000 eggs survive to sexual maturity, it would appear imperative to allow these animals to flourish in the wild. Greatly disappointed with this book. "
61,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,4,"Octopus is a very intelligent animal with a radically different style of neurological and psychological organization from us. ""Is there a scene of self at all, a center of experience? If not, that involves imagination something so different from us it might be impossible to think of. .... If there is no central consciousness, does an octopus have a ""collaborative, cooperative, but distributed mind"", as Peter suggest? Does it have a sense of multiple selves? Does each arm literally have a mind of its own?"" The Soul of an Octopus includes many octopuses (not ocopi, by the way, as octopus is a Greek word, not a Latin word): Athena, Octavia, Kali and Karma, all of them lived in New England Aquarium in Boston. Sy Montgomery is a science journalist. The book is a collection of the author's encounter with these octopuses in captivity, as well as octopuses in the wild (Caribbean and Pacific Ocean in particular). ""The ocean, for me, is what LSD was to Timothy Leary. "" I never tried LSD (or any other drugs), but I tend to agree with the author: the wondrous and capacious nature provides endless possibilities to keep me wowed forever."

My second favorite thing, that no one has mentioned, is the SECRET HIDDEN FLIP BOOK made up of the pictures on the bottom corners of the pages. Maybe I'm just a dork, but this gave me great joy. A whole book, so engagingly written, by a scientist who becomes taken with octopuses to such an extent that she gets SCUBA certified just to visit their world. It's how I felt two years ago when I came upon a harbor seal ""bottling"" in the ocean as I was kayaking near home - I was compelled to reach out to the New England Aquarium to ask them about it, then visit for a personal meet and greet with one of their resident seals, then join so that I can go to the aquarium whenever I want (which is how I ended up with this book last Tuesday, in the gift shop). All because of wonder and a little excitement. I want to read more of Sy's adventures now. Thanks for the ever so personal stories of not just the octopuses, but the people and fellow aquarium residents, too. "
63,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25338445-angie-reisetter,5,"Wow. This woman loves octopuses, and the sea and its creatures in general. Her enthusiasm is contagious. She not only fills this book with facts about sea life and descriptions of the personalities of the octopuses she knows, but also just the general comraderie of being an aquarium groupie. She makes me want to go and hang out with fishes more often. There's so much that we're still learning about our fellow creatures, so much to be explored. This is just a thoroughly enjoyable read that has rekindled my love for the world below the water line.More thoughts on this book here: http://www.steepedinscience.com/2015/...I got a copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley."

When the marine biologist then confides that she too had tried to commit suicide, the author's response is to point to a nearby octopus in a tank and say in bewilderment ""You would leave THIS?!""Because apparently in this author's mind the simple task of working with an octopus should cancel out the impulse to self-extinction. Any other employment or life circumstances? No, then suicide makes sense.So I think I've had just about enough of this deranged author's masturbatory prose-poetry non-scientific cephalopod rants."

The essay is very moving and incredibly revealing about the otherness and being of an octopus as well as the connection that is possible between such a being and a human.While the essay felt distilled, rich, with no extra weight, the books feels chatty, padded, diluted."

69,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1373260-jaclyn-day,4,"This was a wonderful, captivating peek into the mysteries of the natural world. If you love the ocean and the creatures that inhabit it, you’ll feel an instant commiseration with Montgomery’s wonder at exploring octopuses in their natural habitats and in her home base aquarium in Boston. (The correct plural is octopuses, not octopi, she explains.) The book is fascinating. More of a memoir than a scientific study, but that makes it no less educational. But (and this is a big “but”), one huge faulty area is in Montgomery’s refusal to address the plight of octopus captivity and the aquarium octopus trade that she even participates in at one point. Octopuses are plucked from the ocean at just the right age and transported into small containers with their own fecal matter to whichever aquarium puts out an APB. There, they’re left to grow old--in a matter of years, octopuses don’t often live past 5--tending to unfertilized eggs (they’re rarely mated), growing larger in barrels ill-suited to their size, and getting increasingly bored and in need of stimuli. This is all from Montgomery’s book, mind you. It’s talked about lightly or skimmed over in favor of a safer topic. At one point, Montgomery argues that aquarium capture and captivity of octopuses is necessary to protect the species and educate the general public, and it’s a decent argument under certain circumstances. There are many aquariums, including the New England Aquarium, doing wonderful things for education and conservation. But, while education is important, Montgomery’s connection to the aquarium was the lifeline of her book--this book--and the captivity topic feels purposefully ignored in favor of her continued VIP access to Boston's prized octopuses. So, how do you write a book about the potential consciousness of a highly intelligent, remarkable species while mostly observing it in a captive environment? An environment that is, she admits, often stressful to the animal? There’s no doubt that she and the other volunteers and professionals at the aquarium cared deeply about the animals she writes about: Athena, Octavia, Kali, Karma. I just couldn’t get over the void left by Montgomery’s blatant refusal to go near the ethical or moral implications of captivity where her octopus consciousness questions were concerned. Could Montgomery have written the same book by observing octopuses living in their natural ocean habitats? I think so. She does do some of this, but she’s not a natural ocean swimmer or skilled diver (as she notes). Her open ocean dives seem more disappointing to her than illuminating to her understanding of the species. On the diving trips, she expresses that she can’t wait to get back to the aquarium and her friends there. She can’t wait to see the captive octopuses that can’t hide in their dens, or camouflage their escape route. She can’t wait to visit with the ones that are so bored that they may have no option but to interact with humans--for the sake of their food, their sanity, their survival. Montgomery expresses frequent awe at her interactions with the creatures. She swears they remember people. She talks about them embracing her arms, not roughly or aggressively, but in a warm, friendly greeting. That anthropomorphizing compromises her objectivity about what she’s writing about and the circumstances that she’s keeping quiet about in order to do so. This is a pretty intense critique, but to be clear--I read this book fast, in less than a few hours. I did love it, or wanted to. I loved the idea of it. I loved the science, the insight into such beautiful, weird, alien creatures. That only made it all the harder when I tried to reconcile Montgomery’s search for octopus consciousness with her willful ignorance--at least in the book--of the captive circumstances that made a good portion of her writing possible. I’d like to read a follow-up from her someday. I hope she writes it."
70,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17792052-amy,4,"I don't always have an easy time with non-fiction, so I really try to choose it well. Its important for me to get swept up in it somehow, to get a feeling or interest in the story. This one did - I got involved with it. I looked forward to picking it up. It wasn't just a slog through to learn something. I felt it. And it was set up to be a hard sell - why? Because why I love my dog dearly, and have been raised with animals/pets, I am not one for strange animals, or anything slippery. In fact one would go as far as to say that I outright dislike and have an anathema for ocean animals, underwater animals. To say - not my thing - would be an understatement. I live in Boston, my children have had an opportunity, I hope more than one to visit our amazing aquarium. I never have gone, wouldn't ever, and not in any city. I am not proud of this. Its an embarrassment to share I don't care for underwater animals. Its a funny thing I actually hope my children don't find out, or make too much of. Scuba, snorkeling, deep sea diving. I'll be on the beach reading. Luckily enough, no one else in the family has shown an interest. We prefer to walk the tide, and my sons would be playing volleyball, or football, or frisbee or something. Maybe my husband and I might have playing cards on a sandy blanket. The underwater world holds zero appeal for me.But this book? I actually really enjoyed it, and I'm glad I read it. That says a lot, because its non-fiction, and on a topic seriously not likely to draw me. But, consciousness, relationship, love, that is my thing. The thing that draws me every time. I actually truly loved reading this book. I also (in my own distanced way) fell in love with Octavia, Kali, Karma, and the first one - the beautiful Octopus our author fell in love with first. Funny, I actually throughout the book had to remind myself she was female. I kept picturing her male, and there was nothing remotely male about her. I loved thinking about how animals protect their young instinctively, even though there is nothing to protect, and how they turn to their relationships at various stages in their lives. I loved the mating scene, it was strange and beautiful. I loved how this Octopus moved various special needs children and adults, an elderly couple, a man losing his wife, and a whole family of people, tied through the love of these octopuses. (Funny, I thought it was octopi too…). Now, another plug for PBT - I wouldn't have really ever read this book, though I noticed it when it went around. But it felt clear to me that I would, when animals became the November tag. I'm very glad I had the opportunity. I really feel like I am a better person for having learned something, felt, and experienced these four friends, and what they meant and what they have taught and brought us. I'm a little proud of Boston, too. Maybe find a way to send my six year old soon? Seriously, I am grateful for the opportunity.What am I reading next? Well I am taking a brief six week course on three plays of Tennessee Williams, so I am about to review the Glass Menagerie, and this week I will be re-reading A Streetcar named Desire. Also will be starting the Zookeepers Wife. On Deck for November is the Muse, which I checked out of the library but haven't gotten to, To the Bright Edge of the World, which for some odd reason scares me a little, despite its glowing reviews. And the November read for Jewish Book Club - the Pinch. Is that right? Then there is for my own book club, my friends' book on Integrative Music Therapy - a Journey of Healing, so no November ""flurry"" for me. That's where I'm at. Octopus goes back to the library. So does Glass Menagerie, Pig Meets Pug, and on we go. "
71,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,5,"Is it possible to weep for an octopus' death?Sy Montgomery combines scientific inquiry with her own moving meditations on the purpose of life, the perception of time, and the possibilities of connection in this book. Her subject is the giant Pacific octopus, and she relates her intimate interactions with four of them, residents of the New England Aquarium in Boston. When she touches her first, an octopus named Athena, she is surprised.  “...[H]er head is silky and softer than custard. Her skin is flecked with ruby and silver, a night sky reflected in the wine-dark sea. As I stroke her with my fingertips, her skin goes white beneath my touch. White is the color of a relaxed octopus....” (Location 104) Montgomery's book is not a didactic scientific tome. Instead, she intersperses fascinating facts into a lyrical narrative of discovery. Octopuses have more neurons than a rat. The neurons are distributed throughout the tentacles. Motor control ranges from delicate exploration to a crushing grip. Each sucker can flex like a gentle kiss or pinch like a vice. The octopus smells and tastes through its skin. Montgomery notices Athena looking at her face while tasting her arms. Should she allow Athena to taste her face? Bill Murphy, senior aquarist, responds with a decisive “No.” The suckers could easily pull her eye out.An octopus named Octavia demonstrates remarkable camouflage abilities. Three layers of skin comprised of three types of cells enable shifts to multiple colors, patterns and textures, a canvas of liquid iridescence.This book is special, however, because Montgomery encounters so many examples of octopus personality: curiosity, memory, preferences, trust, playfulness, intelligence, and even deception. There is something tragic about an animal so like us in many ways having such a short lifespan — only 3-4 years. It lives a solitary life, hoarding its secrets. When born it is the size of a grain of rice. It grows, explores, learns, breeds and then, its life cycle completed, it becomes lethargic, senescent and dies. Montgomery's writing arouses a feeling of profound awe.The parallel story Montgomery tells is of the dedicated staff that attends these creatures. Montgomery describes them with such vividness that you feel you know them enough to greet them on the street. In the outside world their interests and individuality make them anomalies; in the aquarium they are part of a tight empathetic family. The memories they share with these octopuses are stored like a string of precious pearls. One interviewee likens the octopuses, caught from the wild, as ambassadors from their world to ours. It's an apt metaphor. Montgomery describes numerous occasions when adults as well as children are converted from uninvolved gawkers to sympathetic and curious admirers. The octopuses, in turn, seem curious about both the visitors and their environs, designed with painstaking attention to naturalism and security in mind. In addition, one of the most challenging tasks is designing puzzles to stave off octopus boredom. Would the octopus choose to give up its freedom to experience these unknown adventures? Of course, to even ask such a question is to lapse into anthropomorphism. Yet, I like to think that these octopuses live and die without regrets. So, returning to my opening question, if we weep, it is perhaps not from grief over the octopus as much as grief over the unfathomable mystery of life for all of us."
72,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361541-barb-middleton,4,"This narrative nonfiction story reveals the author's scientific study, care, and love of octopuses mainly at the New England aquarium. Her passion for the invertebrates is obvious and drew me into the story from the get-go. I learned more than I ever thought about how difficult it is to transfer and keep these Houdini-like creatures in their cages, as well as, their range of colors, ability to play, and unique senses and neurons that are in their arms. Some passages are very scientific but the density is lightened by the author's narration making for good pacing most of the time. The end narrative text started to sound a bit repetitive with the diving in the wild and the octopuses getting old and dying as it happens several times throughout the text, but overall it is an excellent book. If you like science and animals then I recommend it. The author's passion for animals shows in that she tries to prove that the intelligent octopus creature has a soul. I thought the argument as a whole in the book weak. She does mention philosophers and different theories. They are spread throughout the book so none of it is overwhelming and she recognizes that to define a soul is really not possible; that some say it is an inner being that gives people senses and intelligence, others it gives life meaning and purpose. ""Perhaps none of these definitions is true. Perhaps all of them are. But I am certain of one thing as I sit in my pew: If I have a soul-and I think I do-an octopus has a soul, too."" Her stance is clear from the start, but she doesn't get into the different theories much. Maybe that is a good thing considering the target audience.Her writing reminded me of ""The Secret Garden"" where Colin is so moved by nature that he is miraculously healed in his soul and stands up to recite the Doxology. The author is so moved by octopuses that her emotional descriptions show a passion that is deeply felt: ""Perhaps, I muse, this is the pace at which the Creator thinks, in the weighty, graceful, liquid manner-like blood flows, not like synapses fire."" She has terrific writing with plenty of similes and metaphors to help readers picture the creatures and their environment in the aquarium or wild.The book does explain mating and covers the loss of beloved animals either as pets or from an aquarium's caretaker's perspective. I learned more about scuba diving than I expected and she describes the tight friendship she developed from working at the aquarium and diving. These friendships add a human element that is a nice balance to the scientific narrative. I did not know anything about octopuses before reading this book and a knowledgeable reader might have a completely different reading experience than me. "
73,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,4,"‘The Soul of an Octopus’ is a charming, very readable memoir of encounters with octopodes. The author became fascinated with these mysterious creatures after getting to know one at an aquarium. She describes her octo-pals with such love that it’s hard not to want to meet one yourself once you’ve finished the book. I previously knew very little about octopodes, so was fascinated by their oddness. For example, I learned that octopus neurons are distributed among their tentacles, which appear genuinely able to think for themselves. A key theme of the book is the intelligence of octopodes and how difficult it is to compare with mammalian conceptions thereof. Montgomery makes a strong case that each octopus she has known had a distinctive personality and formed a bond with her.On the other hand, I found the chapters in which Montgomery learns to scuba dive a little hair-raising, as personally I fear and distrust deep water. (As an aside, I once tried out a friend’s VR goggles and explored a simulated ocean floor. That was pretty great - if it was made more interactive, what a lovely way to come close to ocean life without disturbing ecosystems or risking your personal safety.) Back at the aquarium, her account of the group of friends meeting weekly to spend time with an octopus was poignant and sweet. There are no great insights into consciousness to be found in this book, as it is more personal than scientific. Montgomery isn’t trying to give you the full history and biology of octopodes, she’s sharing portraits, anecdotes, and appealing facts. The writing is engaging and I enjoyed being reminded both of how little is known about ocean fauna and of the strong bonds that humans can form with other creatures. I’ve also been inspired to look up my nearest aquarium. "
74,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565471-rift-vegan,3,"Octopuses are fascinating, but I don't know much about them, other than a couple of PBS nature shows. This was a great first book for me, a little peek into someone else's obsession. The things I learned made me hungry for more... Octopuses are actually colour blind, except they can probably experience colour in their tentacles (rather than their eyes)!! And all their arms have neural connections... So interesting to think about having brains spread out all over your body!I would have rated this 4 stars out of 5, except for the sad fact that Montgomery barely touched the surface of the ethics of kidnapping and imprisoning such intelligent creatures. Granted, we know a lot more about octopuses because scientists observe them and experiment with them in captive situations. But I don't believe the end justifies the means. For just a couple paragraphs, she talks to a man who does the actual kidnapping and asks him if he thinks it's ethical. (ha, the truism by Upton Sinclair: It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.) He says the octopuses that he kidnaps and sells to zoos are ambassadors of the species, and people would not care about their fate in the wild if they don't get to see them in zoos. uh huh. Poor Kali, who knew the freedom of the entire ocean was kept in a barrel for months before she escaped and died. And it sounded like she may have died on purpose, but that was not addressed in the book at all. Sad, very sad.So, yes, mixed feelings about this book. And that's okay! It's great to think about things like this and work out my own opinions! "
75,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44349312-jeff,1,"Just how many times can Montgomery describe putting arms into a tank to have an octopus suck on them? Read this book to find out. It's clear over and over again that an octopus's senses differ from our own, yet Montgomery insists on waxing poetic about her own anthropomorphic speculations of what the octopus is ""feeling"" or ""thinking"" at the very moment it puts its many suckers on human arms. I think I was fooled by the popularity of this book, thinking that I would find something more about actual scientific research indicating that an octopus can readily identify ""self,"" but instead I was left with a broken record of the lives and deaths of short-lived cephalopods and the ad nauseam mourning of slightly deranged caretakers and onlookers afterward. Sprinkle in some story about SCUBA lessons and diving off Cozumel and bingo, you've transformed what should be a brief essay into a best selling book. Can we forge connections with animals? Sure. Does signing a ""Declaration of Consciousness"" prove that animals have a conscious? I respond with an emphatic ""NO!"" Like a typical biographer, Montgomery elevates the octopus on a pedestal and skirts the edge of implying that the animal might possibly be the pinnacle of conscious existence. This could (and should) have remained an essay and it would have been just fine. "

Montgomery explores the wonderful world of octopuses in this touching non-fiction that is half memoir and half expose on these smart and personable ocean creatures.I enjoyed the book very much and found it surprisingly interesting. I learned a lot of interesting facts about octopus that I would have never guessed prior to reading the book (I'll let you discover those facts for yourself). Her writing style is very engaging and she is able to impart a lot of knowledge while making it seem like she is just telling you a story. This book will be a favorite but I didn't give it 5 stars for a few reasons. First, I think she often attributes thoughts, emotions and intentions to the octopuses at times. While I don't disagree that they have all those things, I question her ability to seem to attribute the exact emotion/thought/intention in certain instances. Second, I have to admit that it bothered me that someone who loved them so much (enough to write a whole book on them) would contemplate buying one to keep as a pet. "
77,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4604943-sarai,3,"3.5 StarsThis book focuses on Montgomery's experiences while conducting research on octopuses and their emotional intelligence. She meets various researchers and staff from the New England aquarium, and dives to observe octopuses in their natural habitat. Throughout the book, she shares interesting facts about octopuses, fish, and other mammals and will back some of these up with snippets of research. Most of the book reads like a memoir. Montgomery introduces the people she meets, shares personal interactions with various octopuses in the aquarium, and describes the connection she feels to them and to the staff. While I enjoyed the writing style very much--it reads like she's having coffee with you and sharing her cool experiences--I wanted more. I felt like Montgomery had just as many questions as I did, and not many answers. This book made me want to pick up another book on octopuses, fish, etc. with more cool facts backed by research. Overall it's a very enjoyable book, and I would recommend it to anyone who would maybe shy away from reading a scientific book but loves a good memoir--this would be a great choice, as it blends both genres into a fun, quick read."

She had me hooked from the start when she informs the reader the plural of Octopus is Octopuses not Octopi. I thought to myself, what else don't I know about these 8 legged monsters...Well I quickly discovered they are not monsters and in fact appear to be intelligent and sensitive creatures who recognize individual people in an aquarium setting and will display actions indicating if they love or hate you!Before reading The Soul of an Octopus all I really knew about them was they had 8 tentacles and could squeeze themselves into small jars. I never imagined I would be captivated as I was by Sy's experiences. I laughed and cried right along with her. Half way through I was telling my boyfriend if I had read this book 20 years ago I probably would have gone to school to study octopuses.

Didn't realise just how interesting it would be, there were so many intriguing facts and anecdotes about octopuses, everything from their anatomy to their behaviour to their individual personalities were mentioned. The way the author wrote about the octopuses she encountered made them seem almost impossible and mythical, it was like reading about another world at times. The most engrossing parts were definitely the author's interactions with the octopuses at the aquarium she saw day in and day out, it was fascinating getting updates on Athena, Octavia, and Kali. I wasn't so keen on the author's time trying to scuba dive or the other parts which weren't really focused on octopuses."

I've always felt that at least the dogs and cats I've known in my life share these characteristics with me, but now I find out that even cephalopods experience all of these traits, too. And to think, we eat these creatures. Not me, because I'm quickly becoming a vegetarian (this book hastened the process). Read it. You will be gobsmacked by nature."

(We learn on practically the first page that the proper plural for octopus is not octopi -- but rather ""octopuses"" in keeping with the word's Greek origins.)

Sy Montgomery finds an engaging way to write more than 200 pages about the neurobiology of the octopus that I think would entertain most readers. If you have even rudimentary interest in the natural world, this book is very accessible, and Montgomery's enthusiasm about animals in general and octopuses in general shines through.The majority of the book focuses on three octopuses that come through the aquarium in Boston, Massachusetts. Montgomery's habit of guessing at the emotional life of animals annoyed me a bit in The Good Good Pig: The Extraordinary Life of Christopher Hogwood, and somehow is worse when it comes to a non-mammal, but at the same time, I can't fault her completely because it is part of what makes the book entertaining. The animals seem so relatable that the reader truly cares what happens to them. And that brings me to my giant frustration, not so much with the book, but with the tale of the octopuses in the aquarium.The rest of this review truly is a spoiler, but what really caused me to knock stars off of this book is some hypocrisy that I just couldn't bring myself to ignore. So rare for me because normally I take stories at face value and focus on the writing, the entertainment, and the character development - - but this is non-fiction, so it's basically impossible to completely banish the thoughts I had while reading it. And I don't even share the worst of it below.(view spoiler)[ So, I really have a problem with how these animals were handled, and I'm certainly no animal rights activist. The whole book posits how intelligent the octopuses are and even imbues them with consciousness and to some degree, emotions. So, in what world does their process for handling these creatures make any sense. The oldest octopus, Octavia, is in a decent tank, and she's currently healthy, but reaching the end of her life span. So the Aquarium obtains a new octopus, Kali. Kali is relegated to a 50 gallon barrel (my oil tank in my house is 6 times the size). And every time the barrel is opened, she eagerly tries to explore outside it suggesting she's bored at best. Later, they determine she tried to chew her way out of it. But well before that point, it's quite clear that if you really believe the animal is intelligent then a barrel is no place for it. At first, I rationalized this to myself thinking ""well, perhaps the lead time for getting a new octopus is super long so they don't want to wait until Octavia dies because they won't have a replacement for their exhibit, and I get how that might not be optimal."" Um. Yeah. No. They get a third octopus in 8 days. Which also tries to eat its way out of the barrel. So in my mind, this book is pretty much an exercise in complete hypocrisy . . .if you truly believe that this animal is as intelligent and emotional as they make it out to be, you don't treat it like this and then get all excited that it seems happy when you open the barrel to visit with it.  (hide spoiler)]Bottom line, read this one if you want to learn about octopuses, but just be forewarned that you may not really like the author much after you finish it."
90,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6840223-erika,1,"I was still on an ocean hangover from a trip to Coronado when I bought this book. The ocean fascinates me and I'm particularly intrigued by jellyfish and octopus. It should be noted that the author of his book, Sy Montgomery, is a seasoned writer, investigative explorer, and recipient of lifetime achievement awards from the Humane Society. I believe her to be a caring and conscientious animal lover who holds animals' best interests in high regard--BUT, the her book is plagued with many instances of overreach. Montgomery documents her research of four octopuses housed at the New England Aquarium. Facts and statistics are dispersed throughout the book, one of which reveals that octopuses taste through their suckers and can literally taste your skin. On one visit to the aquarium, Montgomery brings a friend who is a smoker. The octopus reacts harshly to the friend and Montgomery wonders if it is because the octopus could taste the nicotine on her friend's skin. Another time, the author ponders whether or not the octopus will interact with her since she recently dyed her hair and perhaps the octopus wouldn't like the chemicals. Yet, she plunges her hands and arms in the water anyway. Montgomery herself even acknowledges the danger of this: ""[...] the skin of an octopus is one giant, fantastically sensitive mucous membrane. Steinhart Aquarium's assistant curator J. Charles Delbeek has likened cephalopod skin to the lining of the mammalian gut, with the result that 'levels of chemicals, nutrients, pollutants, etc. that are seemingly not toxic to other species and inverts can be toxic to cephs.'"" Moreover, the entire book revolves around Montgomery's quest to prove the consciousness of an octopus, yet a great portion of the book focuses on the suffocating handling of the octopus named Kali. Kali was procured from the wild by the aquarium and kept in a darkened barrel--void of stimulation, as well noted by the author--for approximately nine months because the aquarium did not have the space for her. (They needed her to replace an aging octopus already on display in the event that the older invertebrate died.) Eventually, it becomes evident that older (Octavia) and younger (Kali) must switch places. It's a risky move and one that proves fatal for Kali--she escaped through a two-inch hole in the lid of the tank. I have no doubt her staff and volunteers were devastated by her loss. However, when Wilson, one of her handlers says, ""'She had a day of freedom [in the new tank]. And that she got out tells you a phenomenally inquisitive and intelligent creature wanted her freedom. We know, clearly, it must have taken a lot of effort to get out.'"" And clearly, Wilson, it should tell you, Montgomery, and the aquarium that her ""freedom"" was not a tank. Captured at an approximate age of nine months, left in a barrel for nine more, only to die on the aquarium floor...disgraceful. Considering that only a few (like, less than five) out of 100,000 eggs survive to sexual maturity, it would appear imperative to allow these animals to flourish in the wild. Greatly disappointed with this book. "
91,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,4,"Octopus is a very intelligent animal with a radically different style of neurological and psychological organization from us. ""Is there a scene of self at all, a center of experience? If not, that involves imagination something so different from us it might be impossible to think of. .... If there is no central consciousness, does an octopus have a ""collaborative, cooperative, but distributed mind"", as Peter suggest? Does it have a sense of multiple selves? Does each arm literally have a mind of its own?"" The Soul of an Octopus includes many octopuses (not ocopi, by the way, as octopus is a Greek word, not a Latin word): Athena, Octavia, Kali and Karma, all of them lived in New England Aquarium in Boston. Sy Montgomery is a science journalist. The book is a collection of the author's encounter with these octopuses in captivity, as well as octopuses in the wild (Caribbean and Pacific Ocean in particular). ""The ocean, for me, is what LSD was to Timothy Leary. "" I never tried LSD (or any other drugs), but I tend to agree with the author: the wondrous and capacious nature provides endless possibilities to keep me wowed forever."

My second favorite thing, that no one has mentioned, is the SECRET HIDDEN FLIP BOOK made up of the pictures on the bottom corners of the pages. Maybe I'm just a dork, but this gave me great joy. A whole book, so engagingly written, by a scientist who becomes taken with octopuses to such an extent that she gets SCUBA certified just to visit their world. It's how I felt two years ago when I came upon a harbor seal ""bottling"" in the ocean as I was kayaking near home - I was compelled to reach out to the New England Aquarium to ask them about it, then visit for a personal meet and greet with one of their resident seals, then join so that I can go to the aquarium whenever I want (which is how I ended up with this book last Tuesday, in the gift shop). All because of wonder and a little excitement. I want to read more of Sy's adventures now. Thanks for the ever so personal stories of not just the octopuses, but the people and fellow aquarium residents, too. "

She not only fills this book with facts about sea life and descriptions of the personalities of the octopuses she knows, but also just the general comraderie of being an aquarium groupie. She makes me want to go and hang out with fishes more often. There's so much that we're still learning about our fellow creatures, so much to be explored. This is just a thoroughly enjoyable read that has rekindled my love for the world below the water line.More thoughts on this book here: http://www.steepedinscience.com/2015/...I got a copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley."
94,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/287915-name-redacted,2,"When a marine biologist tells the non-scientist author that her non-scientist friend committed suicide, the author responds with sympathy. When the marine biologist then confides that she too had tried to commit suicide, the author's response is to point to a nearby octopus in a tank and say in bewilderment ""You would leave THIS?!""Because apparently in this author's mind the simple task of working with an octopus should cancel out the impulse to self-extinction. Any other employment or life circumstances? No, then suicide makes sense.So I think I've had just about enough of this deranged author's masturbatory prose-poetry non-scientific cephalopod rants."
95,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/777369-jessica,3,"Sy Montgomery is a good writer but I strongly recommend the essay she wrote for Orion a few years back over this book. The essay is very moving and incredibly revealing about the otherness and being of an octopus as well as the connection that is possible between such a being and a human.While the essay felt distilled, rich, with no extra weight, the books feels chatty, padded, diluted."

99,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1373260-jaclyn-day,4,"This was a wonderful, captivating peek into the mysteries of the natural world. If you love the ocean and the creatures that inhabit it, you’ll feel an instant commiseration with Montgomery’s wonder at exploring octopuses in their natural habitats and in her home base aquarium in Boston. (The correct plural is octopuses, not octopi, she explains.) The book is fascinating. More of a memoir than a scientific study, but that makes it no less educational. But (and this is a big “but”), one huge faulty area is in Montgomery’s refusal to address the plight of octopus captivity and the aquarium octopus trade that she even participates in at one point. Octopuses are plucked from the ocean at just the right age and transported into small containers with their own fecal matter to whichever aquarium puts out an APB. There, they’re left to grow old--in a matter of years, octopuses don’t often live past 5--tending to unfertilized eggs (they’re rarely mated), growing larger in barrels ill-suited to their size, and getting increasingly bored and in need of stimuli. This is all from Montgomery’s book, mind you. It’s talked about lightly or skimmed over in favor of a safer topic. At one point, Montgomery argues that aquarium capture and captivity of octopuses is necessary to protect the species and educate the general public, and it’s a decent argument under certain circumstances. There are many aquariums, including the New England Aquarium, doing wonderful things for education and conservation. But, while education is important, Montgomery’s connection to the aquarium was the lifeline of her book--this book--and the captivity topic feels purposefully ignored in favor of her continued VIP access to Boston's prized octopuses. So, how do you write a book about the potential consciousness of a highly intelligent, remarkable species while mostly observing it in a captive environment? An environment that is, she admits, often stressful to the animal? There’s no doubt that she and the other volunteers and professionals at the aquarium cared deeply about the animals she writes about: Athena, Octavia, Kali, Karma. I just couldn’t get over the void left by Montgomery’s blatant refusal to go near the ethical or moral implications of captivity where her octopus consciousness questions were concerned. Could Montgomery have written the same book by observing octopuses living in their natural ocean habitats? I think so. She does do some of this, but she’s not a natural ocean swimmer or skilled diver (as she notes). Her open ocean dives seem more disappointing to her than illuminating to her understanding of the species. On the diving trips, she expresses that she can’t wait to get back to the aquarium and her friends there. She can’t wait to see the captive octopuses that can’t hide in their dens, or camouflage their escape route. She can’t wait to visit with the ones that are so bored that they may have no option but to interact with humans--for the sake of their food, their sanity, their survival. Montgomery expresses frequent awe at her interactions with the creatures. She swears they remember people. She talks about them embracing her arms, not roughly or aggressively, but in a warm, friendly greeting. That anthropomorphizing compromises her objectivity about what she’s writing about and the circumstances that she’s keeping quiet about in order to do so. This is a pretty intense critique, but to be clear--I read this book fast, in less than a few hours. I did love it, or wanted to. I loved the idea of it. I loved the science, the insight into such beautiful, weird, alien creatures. That only made it all the harder when I tried to reconcile Montgomery’s search for octopus consciousness with her willful ignorance--at least in the book--of the captive circumstances that made a good portion of her writing possible. I’d like to read a follow-up from her someday. I hope she writes it."
100,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17792052-amy,4,"I don't always have an easy time with non-fiction, so I really try to choose it well. Its important for me to get swept up in it somehow, to get a feeling or interest in the story. This one did - I got involved with it. I looked forward to picking it up. It wasn't just a slog through to learn something. I felt it. And it was set up to be a hard sell - why? Because why I love my dog dearly, and have been raised with animals/pets, I am not one for strange animals, or anything slippery. In fact one would go as far as to say that I outright dislike and have an anathema for ocean animals, underwater animals. To say - not my thing - would be an understatement. I live in Boston, my children have had an opportunity, I hope more than one to visit our amazing aquarium. I never have gone, wouldn't ever, and not in any city. I am not proud of this. Its an embarrassment to share I don't care for underwater animals. Its a funny thing I actually hope my children don't find out, or make too much of. Scuba, snorkeling, deep sea diving. I'll be on the beach reading. Luckily enough, no one else in the family has shown an interest. We prefer to walk the tide, and my sons would be playing volleyball, or football, or frisbee or something. Maybe my husband and I might have playing cards on a sandy blanket. The underwater world holds zero appeal for me.But this book? I actually really enjoyed it, and I'm glad I read it. That says a lot, because its non-fiction, and on a topic seriously not likely to draw me. But, consciousness, relationship, love, that is my thing. The thing that draws me every time. I actually truly loved reading this book. I also (in my own distanced way) fell in love with Octavia, Kali, Karma, and the first one - the beautiful Octopus our author fell in love with first. Funny, I actually throughout the book had to remind myself she was female. I kept picturing her male, and there was nothing remotely male about her. I loved thinking about how animals protect their young instinctively, even though there is nothing to protect, and how they turn to their relationships at various stages in their lives. I loved the mating scene, it was strange and beautiful. I loved how this Octopus moved various special needs children and adults, an elderly couple, a man losing his wife, and a whole family of people, tied through the love of these octopuses. (Funny, I thought it was octopi too…). Now, another plug for PBT - I wouldn't have really ever read this book, though I noticed it when it went around. But it felt clear to me that I would, when animals became the November tag. I'm very glad I had the opportunity. I really feel like I am a better person for having learned something, felt, and experienced these four friends, and what they meant and what they have taught and brought us. I'm a little proud of Boston, too. Maybe find a way to send my six year old soon? Seriously, I am grateful for the opportunity.What am I reading next? Well I am taking a brief six week course on three plays of Tennessee Williams, so I am about to review the Glass Menagerie, and this week I will be re-reading A Streetcar named Desire. Also will be starting the Zookeepers Wife. On Deck for November is the Muse, which I checked out of the library but haven't gotten to, To the Bright Edge of the World, which for some odd reason scares me a little, despite its glowing reviews. And the November read for Jewish Book Club - the Pinch. Is that right? Then there is for my own book club, my friends' book on Integrative Music Therapy - a Journey of Healing, so no November ""flurry"" for me. That's where I'm at. Octopus goes back to the library. So does Glass Menagerie, Pig Meets Pug, and on we go. "
101,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,5,"Is it possible to weep for an octopus' death?Sy Montgomery combines scientific inquiry with her own moving meditations on the purpose of life, the perception of time, and the possibilities of connection in this book. Her subject is the giant Pacific octopus, and she relates her intimate interactions with four of them, residents of the New England Aquarium in Boston. When she touches her first, an octopus named Athena, she is surprised.  “...[H]er head is silky and softer than custard. Her skin is flecked with ruby and silver, a night sky reflected in the wine-dark sea. As I stroke her with my fingertips, her skin goes white beneath my touch. White is the color of a relaxed octopus....” (Location 104) Montgomery's book is not a didactic scientific tome. Instead, she intersperses fascinating facts into a lyrical narrative of discovery. Octopuses have more neurons than a rat. The neurons are distributed throughout the tentacles. Motor control ranges from delicate exploration to a crushing grip. Each sucker can flex like a gentle kiss or pinch like a vice. The octopus smells and tastes through its skin. Montgomery notices Athena looking at her face while tasting her arms. Should she allow Athena to taste her face? Bill Murphy, senior aquarist, responds with a decisive “No.” The suckers could easily pull her eye out.An octopus named Octavia demonstrates remarkable camouflage abilities. Three layers of skin comprised of three types of cells enable shifts to multiple colors, patterns and textures, a canvas of liquid iridescence.This book is special, however, because Montgomery encounters so many examples of octopus personality: curiosity, memory, preferences, trust, playfulness, intelligence, and even deception. There is something tragic about an animal so like us in many ways having such a short lifespan — only 3-4 years. It lives a solitary life, hoarding its secrets. When born it is the size of a grain of rice. It grows, explores, learns, breeds and then, its life cycle completed, it becomes lethargic, senescent and dies. Montgomery's writing arouses a feeling of profound awe.The parallel story Montgomery tells is of the dedicated staff that attends these creatures. Montgomery describes them with such vividness that you feel you know them enough to greet them on the street. In the outside world their interests and individuality make them anomalies; in the aquarium they are part of a tight empathetic family. The memories they share with these octopuses are stored like a string of precious pearls. One interviewee likens the octopuses, caught from the wild, as ambassadors from their world to ours. It's an apt metaphor. Montgomery describes numerous occasions when adults as well as children are converted from uninvolved gawkers to sympathetic and curious admirers. The octopuses, in turn, seem curious about both the visitors and their environs, designed with painstaking attention to naturalism and security in mind. In addition, one of the most challenging tasks is designing puzzles to stave off octopus boredom. Would the octopus choose to give up its freedom to experience these unknown adventures? Of course, to even ask such a question is to lapse into anthropomorphism. Yet, I like to think that these octopuses live and die without regrets. So, returning to my opening question, if we weep, it is perhaps not from grief over the octopus as much as grief over the unfathomable mystery of life for all of us."
102,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361541-barb-middleton,4,"This narrative nonfiction story reveals the author's scientific study, care, and love of octopuses mainly at the New England aquarium. Her passion for the invertebrates is obvious and drew me into the story from the get-go. I learned more than I ever thought about how difficult it is to transfer and keep these Houdini-like creatures in their cages, as well as, their range of colors, ability to play, and unique senses and neurons that are in their arms. Some passages are very scientific but the density is lightened by the author's narration making for good pacing most of the time. The end narrative text started to sound a bit repetitive with the diving in the wild and the octopuses getting old and dying as it happens several times throughout the text, but overall it is an excellent book. If you like science and animals then I recommend it. The author's passion for animals shows in that she tries to prove that the intelligent octopus creature has a soul. I thought the argument as a whole in the book weak. She does mention philosophers and different theories. They are spread throughout the book so none of it is overwhelming and she recognizes that to define a soul is really not possible; that some say it is an inner being that gives people senses and intelligence, others it gives life meaning and purpose. ""Perhaps none of these definitions is true. Perhaps all of them are. But I am certain of one thing as I sit in my pew: If I have a soul-and I think I do-an octopus has a soul, too."" Her stance is clear from the start, but she doesn't get into the different theories much. Maybe that is a good thing considering the target audience.Her writing reminded me of ""The Secret Garden"" where Colin is so moved by nature that he is miraculously healed in his soul and stands up to recite the Doxology. The author is so moved by octopuses that her emotional descriptions show a passion that is deeply felt: ""Perhaps, I muse, this is the pace at which the Creator thinks, in the weighty, graceful, liquid manner-like blood flows, not like synapses fire."" She has terrific writing with plenty of similes and metaphors to help readers picture the creatures and their environment in the aquarium or wild.The book does explain mating and covers the loss of beloved animals either as pets or from an aquarium's caretaker's perspective. I learned more about scuba diving than I expected and she describes the tight friendship she developed from working at the aquarium and diving. These friendships add a human element that is a nice balance to the scientific narrative. I did not know anything about octopuses before reading this book and a knowledgeable reader might have a completely different reading experience than me. "
103,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,4,"‘The Soul of an Octopus’ is a charming, very readable memoir of encounters with octopodes. The author became fascinated with these mysterious creatures after getting to know one at an aquarium. She describes her octo-pals with such love that it’s hard not to want to meet one yourself once you’ve finished the book. I previously knew very little about octopodes, so was fascinated by their oddness. For example, I learned that octopus neurons are distributed among their tentacles, which appear genuinely able to think for themselves. A key theme of the book is the intelligence of octopodes and how difficult it is to compare with mammalian conceptions thereof. Montgomery makes a strong case that each octopus she has known had a distinctive personality and formed a bond with her.On the other hand, I found the chapters in which Montgomery learns to scuba dive a little hair-raising, as personally I fear and distrust deep water. (As an aside, I once tried out a friend’s VR goggles and explored a simulated ocean floor. That was pretty great - if it was made more interactive, what a lovely way to come close to ocean life without disturbing ecosystems or risking your personal safety.) Back at the aquarium, her account of the group of friends meeting weekly to spend time with an octopus was poignant and sweet. There are no great insights into consciousness to be found in this book, as it is more personal than scientific. Montgomery isn’t trying to give you the full history and biology of octopodes, she’s sharing portraits, anecdotes, and appealing facts. The writing is engaging and I enjoyed being reminded both of how little is known about ocean fauna and of the strong bonds that humans can form with other creatures. I’ve also been inspired to look up my nearest aquarium. "
104,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565471-rift-vegan,3,"Octopuses are fascinating, but I don't know much about them, other than a couple of PBS nature shows. This was a great first book for me, a little peek into someone else's obsession. The things I learned made me hungry for more... Octopuses are actually colour blind, except they can probably experience colour in their tentacles (rather than their eyes)!! And all their arms have neural connections... So interesting to think about having brains spread out all over your body!I would have rated this 4 stars out of 5, except for the sad fact that Montgomery barely touched the surface of the ethics of kidnapping and imprisoning such intelligent creatures. Granted, we know a lot more about octopuses because scientists observe them and experiment with them in captive situations. But I don't believe the end justifies the means. For just a couple paragraphs, she talks to a man who does the actual kidnapping and asks him if he thinks it's ethical. (ha, the truism by Upton Sinclair: It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.) He says the octopuses that he kidnaps and sells to zoos are ambassadors of the species, and people would not care about their fate in the wild if they don't get to see them in zoos. uh huh. Poor Kali, who knew the freedom of the entire ocean was kept in a barrel for months before she escaped and died. And it sounded like she may have died on purpose, but that was not addressed in the book at all. Sad, very sad.So, yes, mixed feelings about this book. And that's okay! It's great to think about things like this and work out my own opinions! "
105,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44349312-jeff,1,"Just how many times can Montgomery describe putting arms into a tank to have an octopus suck on them? Read this book to find out. It's clear over and over again that an octopus's senses differ from our own, yet Montgomery insists on waxing poetic about her own anthropomorphic speculations of what the octopus is ""feeling"" or ""thinking"" at the very moment it puts its many suckers on human arms. I think I was fooled by the popularity of this book, thinking that I would find something more about actual scientific research indicating that an octopus can readily identify ""self,"" but instead I was left with a broken record of the lives and deaths of short-lived cephalopods and the ad nauseam mourning of slightly deranged caretakers and onlookers afterward. Sprinkle in some story about SCUBA lessons and diving off Cozumel and bingo, you've transformed what should be a brief essay into a best selling book. Can we forge connections with animals? Sure. Does signing a ""Declaration of Consciousness"" prove that animals have a conscious? I respond with an emphatic ""NO!"" Like a typical biographer, Montgomery elevates the octopus on a pedestal and skirts the edge of implying that the animal might possibly be the pinnacle of conscious existence. This could (and should) have remained an essay and it would have been just fine. "

Montgomery explores the wonderful world of octopuses in this touching non-fiction that is half memoir and half expose on these smart and personable ocean creatures.I enjoyed the book very much and found it surprisingly interesting. I learned a lot of interesting facts about octopus that I would have never guessed prior to reading the book (I'll let you discover those facts for yourself). Her writing style is very engaging and she is able to impart a lot of knowledge while making it seem like she is just telling you a story. This book will be a favorite but I didn't give it 5 stars for a few reasons. First, I think she often attributes thoughts, emotions and intentions to the octopuses at times. While I don't disagree that they have all those things, I question her ability to seem to attribute the exact emotion/thought/intention in certain instances. Second, I have to admit that it bothered me that someone who loved them so much (enough to write a whole book on them) would contemplate buying one to keep as a pet. "
107,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4604943-sarai,3,"3.5 StarsThis book focuses on Montgomery's experiences while conducting research on octopuses and their emotional intelligence. She meets various researchers and staff from the New England aquarium, and dives to observe octopuses in their natural habitat. Throughout the book, she shares interesting facts about octopuses, fish, and other mammals and will back some of these up with snippets of research. Most of the book reads like a memoir. Montgomery introduces the people she meets, shares personal interactions with various octopuses in the aquarium, and describes the connection she feels to them and to the staff. While I enjoyed the writing style very much--it reads like she's having coffee with you and sharing her cool experiences--I wanted more. I felt like Montgomery had just as many questions as I did, and not many answers. This book made me want to pick up another book on octopuses, fish, etc. with more cool facts backed by research. Overall it's a very enjoyable book, and I would recommend it to anyone who would maybe shy away from reading a scientific book but loves a good memoir--this would be a great choice, as it blends both genres into a fun, quick read."

She had me hooked from the start when she informs the reader the plural of Octopus is Octopuses not Octopi. I thought to myself, what else don't I know about these 8 legged monsters...Well I quickly discovered they are not monsters and in fact appear to be intelligent and sensitive creatures who recognize individual people in an aquarium setting and will display actions indicating if they love or hate you!Before reading The Soul of an Octopus all I really knew about them was they had 8 tentacles and could squeeze themselves into small jars. I never imagined I would be captivated as I was by Sy's experiences. I laughed and cried right along with her. Half way through I was telling my boyfriend if I had read this book 20 years ago I probably would have gone to school to study octopuses. I look forward to the next time I find myself at an aquarium- the octopus will be my first stop for sure!! I have learned never dismiss the simplest creature because there is so much more than meets the eye!"

Didn't realise just how interesting it would be, there were so many intriguing facts and anecdotes about octopuses, everything from their anatomy to their behaviour to their individual personalities were mentioned. The way the author wrote about the octopuses she encountered made them seem almost impossible and mythical, it was like reading about another world at times. The most engrossing parts were definitely the author's interactions with the octopuses at the aquarium she saw day in and day out, it was fascinating getting updates on Athena, Octavia, and Kali. I wasn't so keen on the author's time trying to scuba dive or the other parts which weren't really focused on octopuses."

How arrogant we have been. This is one amazing book, well researched yet charming in its narrative, and thanks to Sy Montgomery, I am thoroughly smitten by these wonderful animals. I've always felt that at least the dogs and cats I've known in my life share these characteristics with me, but now I find out that even cephalopods experience all of these traits, too. And to think, we eat these creatures. Not me, because I'm quickly becoming a vegetarian (this book hastened the process). Read it. You will be gobsmacked by nature."
111,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22941942-amy-morgan,5,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I learned so many things about octopuses and am now completely fascinated by them. I loved how easy to read this story was and how beautifully the author described her interactions with these unique creatures. You could really feel the love she felt for them and the other creatures in the aquarium just flowing off the pages. Getting to know an octopus is definitely on my bucket list now!

Sy Montgomery reads her story with enthusiasm and I learned tremendous amounts of information about the octopus! A complete wild card - would never have thought I would be so hooked on this kind of audiobook, but it worked out well and was a very pleasant and lovely change in my reading - something I needed at the moment."

117,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8783847-ginger-bensman,4,"I enjoyed this book. Sy Montgomery makes a compelling case that the octopus is a playful, complex, intelligent, social, and empathetic animal, and she does it through the lens of her own personal and life affirming experiences with octopuses. (We learn on practically the first page that the proper plural for octopus is not octopi -- but rather ""octopuses"" in keeping with the word's Greek origins.) I was hoping for more science mixed in with the memoir and personal anecdotes, but my interest in octopuses has been expanded and I'll seek out more information from the list of references in the book."

I appreciated the sense of wonder and respect for creatures Montgomery has. I disagree with some of her implied conclusions, but the observations she makes and shares beg the question ""why is man so different, despite being so similar?"""
119,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,4,"So teetering between a 3 and a 4 on this book, but I think on all the typical qualities on which I assess a book, it deserves the 4. Sy Montgomery finds an engaging way to write more than 200 pages about the neurobiology of the octopus that I think would entertain most readers. If you have even rudimentary interest in the natural world, this book is very accessible, and Montgomery's enthusiasm about animals in general and octopuses in general shines through.The majority of the book focuses on three octopuses that come through the aquarium in Boston, Massachusetts. Montgomery's habit of guessing at the emotional life of animals annoyed me a bit in The Good Good Pig: The Extraordinary Life of Christopher Hogwood, and somehow is worse when it comes to a non-mammal, but at the same time, I can't fault her completely because it is part of what makes the book entertaining. The animals seem so relatable that the reader truly cares what happens to them. And that brings me to my giant frustration, not so much with the book, but with the tale of the octopuses in the aquarium.The rest of this review truly is a spoiler, but what really caused me to knock stars off of this book is some hypocrisy that I just couldn't bring myself to ignore. So rare for me because normally I take stories at face value and focus on the writing, the entertainment, and the character development - - but this is non-fiction, so it's basically impossible to completely banish the thoughts I had while reading it. And I don't even share the worst of it below.(view spoiler)[ So, I really have a problem with how these animals were handled, and I'm certainly no animal rights activist. The whole book posits how intelligent the octopuses are and even imbues them with consciousness and to some degree, emotions. So, in what world does their process for handling these creatures make any sense. The oldest octopus, Octavia, is in a decent tank, and she's currently healthy, but reaching the end of her life span. So the Aquarium obtains a new octopus, Kali. Kali is relegated to a 50 gallon barrel (my oil tank in my house is 6 times the size). And every time the barrel is opened, she eagerly tries to explore outside it suggesting she's bored at best. Later, they determine she tried to chew her way out of it. But well before that point, it's quite clear that if you really believe the animal is intelligent then a barrel is no place for it. At first, I rationalized this to myself thinking ""well, perhaps the lead time for getting a new octopus is super long so they don't want to wait until Octavia dies because they won't have a replacement for their exhibit, and I get how that might not be optimal."" Um. Yeah. No. They get a third octopus in 8 days. Which also tries to eat its way out of the barrel. So in my mind, this book is pretty much an exercise in complete hypocrisy . . .if you truly believe that this animal is as intelligent and emotional as they make it out to be, you don't treat it like this and then get all excited that it seems happy when you open the barrel to visit with it.  (hide spoiler)]Bottom line, read this one if you want to learn about octopuses, but just be forewarned that you may not really like the author much after you finish it."
120,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6840223-erika,1,"I was still on an ocean hangover from a trip to Coronado when I bought this book. The ocean fascinates me and I'm particularly intrigued by jellyfish and octopus. It should be noted that the author of his book, Sy Montgomery, is a seasoned writer, investigative explorer, and recipient of lifetime achievement awards from the Humane Society. I believe her to be a caring and conscientious animal lover who holds animals' best interests in high regard--BUT, the her book is plagued with many instances of overreach. Montgomery documents her research of four octopuses housed at the New England Aquarium. Facts and statistics are dispersed throughout the book, one of which reveals that octopuses taste through their suckers and can literally taste your skin. On one visit to the aquarium, Montgomery brings a friend who is a smoker. The octopus reacts harshly to the friend and Montgomery wonders if it is because the octopus could taste the nicotine on her friend's skin. Another time, the author ponders whether or not the octopus will interact with her since she recently dyed her hair and perhaps the octopus wouldn't like the chemicals. Yet, she plunges her hands and arms in the water anyway. Montgomery herself even acknowledges the danger of this: ""[...] the skin of an octopus is one giant, fantastically sensitive mucous membrane. Steinhart Aquarium's assistant curator J. Charles Delbeek has likened cephalopod skin to the lining of the mammalian gut, with the result that 'levels of chemicals, nutrients, pollutants, etc. that are seemingly not toxic to other species and inverts can be toxic to cephs.'"" Moreover, the entire book revolves around Montgomery's quest to prove the consciousness of an octopus, yet a great portion of the book focuses on the suffocating handling of the octopus named Kali. Kali was procured from the wild by the aquarium and kept in a darkened barrel--void of stimulation, as well noted by the author--for approximately nine months because the aquarium did not have the space for her. (They needed her to replace an aging octopus already on display in the event that the older invertebrate died.) Eventually, it becomes evident that older (Octavia) and younger (Kali) must switch places. It's a risky move and one that proves fatal for Kali--she escaped through a two-inch hole in the lid of the tank. I have no doubt her staff and volunteers were devastated by her loss. However, when Wilson, one of her handlers says, ""'She had a day of freedom [in the new tank]. And that she got out tells you a phenomenally inquisitive and intelligent creature wanted her freedom. We know, clearly, it must have taken a lot of effort to get out.'"" And clearly, Wilson, it should tell you, Montgomery, and the aquarium that her ""freedom"" was not a tank. Captured at an approximate age of nine months, left in a barrel for nine more, only to die on the aquarium floor...disgraceful. Considering that only a few (like, less than five) out of 100,000 eggs survive to sexual maturity, it would appear imperative to allow these animals to flourish in the wild. Greatly disappointed with this book. "
121,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,4,"Octopus is a very intelligent animal with a radically different style of neurological and psychological organization from us. ""Is there a scene of self at all, a center of experience? If not, that involves imagination something so different from us it might be impossible to think of. .... If there is no central consciousness, does an octopus have a ""collaborative, cooperative, but distributed mind"", as Peter suggest? Does it have a sense of multiple selves? Does each arm literally have a mind of its own?"" The Soul of an Octopus includes many octopuses (not ocopi, by the way, as octopus is a Greek word, not a Latin word): Athena, Octavia, Kali and Karma, all of them lived in New England Aquarium in Boston. Sy Montgomery is a science journalist. The book is a collection of the author's encounter with these octopuses in captivity, as well as octopuses in the wild (Caribbean and Pacific Ocean in particular). ""The ocean, for me, is what LSD was to Timothy Leary.

My second favorite thing, that no one has mentioned, is the SECRET HIDDEN FLIP BOOK made up of the pictures on the bottom corners of the pages. Maybe I'm just a dork, but this gave me great joy. A whole book, so engagingly written, by a scientist who becomes taken with octopuses to such an extent that she gets SCUBA certified just to visit their world. It's how I felt two years ago when I came upon a harbor seal ""bottling"" in the ocean as I was kayaking near home - I was compelled to reach out to the New England Aquarium to ask them about it, then visit for a personal meet and greet with one of their resident seals, then join so that I can go to the aquarium whenever I want (which is how I ended up with this book last Tuesday, in the gift shop). All because of wonder and a little excitement. I want to read more of Sy's adventures now. Thanks for the ever so personal stories of not just the octopuses, but the people and fellow aquarium residents, too. "

She not only fills this book with facts about sea life and descriptions of the personalities of the octopuses she knows, but also just the general comraderie of being an aquarium groupie. She makes me want to go and hang out with fishes more often. There's so much that we're still learning about our fellow creatures, so much to be explored. This is just a thoroughly enjoyable read that has rekindled my love for the world below the water line.More thoughts on this book here: http://www.steepedinscience.com/2015/...I got a copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley."

When the marine biologist then confides that she too had tried to commit suicide, the author's response is to point to a nearby octopus in a tank and say in bewilderment ""You would leave THIS?!""Because apparently in this author's mind the simple task of working with an octopus should cancel out the impulse to self-extinction. Any other employment or life circumstances? No, then suicide makes sense.So I think I've had just about enough of this deranged author's masturbatory prose-poetry non-scientific cephalopod rants."

The essay is very moving and incredibly revealing about the otherness and being of an octopus as well as the connection that is possible between such a being and a human.While the essay felt distilled, rich, with no extra weight, the books feels chatty, padded, diluted."

129,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1373260-jaclyn-day,4,"This was a wonderful, captivating peek into the mysteries of the natural world. If you love the ocean and the creatures that inhabit it, you’ll feel an instant commiseration with Montgomery’s wonder at exploring octopuses in their natural habitats and in her home base aquarium in Boston. (The correct plural is octopuses, not octopi, she explains.) The book is fascinating. More of a memoir than a scientific study, but that makes it no less educational. But (and this is a big “but”), one huge faulty area is in Montgomery’s refusal to address the plight of octopus captivity and the aquarium octopus trade that she even participates in at one point. Octopuses are plucked from the ocean at just the right age and transported into small containers with their own fecal matter to whichever aquarium puts out an APB. There, they’re left to grow old--in a matter of years, octopuses don’t often live past 5--tending to unfertilized eggs (they’re rarely mated), growing larger in barrels ill-suited to their size, and getting increasingly bored and in need of stimuli. This is all from Montgomery’s book, mind you. It’s talked about lightly or skimmed over in favor of a safer topic. At one point, Montgomery argues that aquarium capture and captivity of octopuses is necessary to protect the species and educate the general public, and it’s a decent argument under certain circumstances. There are many aquariums, including the New England Aquarium, doing wonderful things for education and conservation. But, while education is important, Montgomery’s connection to the aquarium was the lifeline of her book--this book--and the captivity topic feels purposefully ignored in favor of her continued VIP access to Boston's prized octopuses. So, how do you write a book about the potential consciousness of a highly intelligent, remarkable species while mostly observing it in a captive environment? An environment that is, she admits, often stressful to the animal? There’s no doubt that she and the other volunteers and professionals at the aquarium cared deeply about the animals she writes about: Athena, Octavia, Kali, Karma. I just couldn’t get over the void left by Montgomery’s blatant refusal to go near the ethical or moral implications of captivity where her octopus consciousness questions were concerned. Could Montgomery have written the same book by observing octopuses living in their natural ocean habitats? I think so. She does do some of this, but she’s not a natural ocean swimmer or skilled diver (as she notes). Her open ocean dives seem more disappointing to her than illuminating to her understanding of the species. On the diving trips, she expresses that she can’t wait to get back to the aquarium and her friends there. She can’t wait to see the captive octopuses that can’t hide in their dens, or camouflage their escape route. She can’t wait to visit with the ones that are so bored that they may have no option but to interact with humans--for the sake of their food, their sanity, their survival. Montgomery expresses frequent awe at her interactions with the creatures. She swears they remember people. She talks about them embracing her arms, not roughly or aggressively, but in a warm, friendly greeting. That anthropomorphizing compromises her objectivity about what she’s writing about and the circumstances that she’s keeping quiet about in order to do so. This is a pretty intense critique, but to be clear--I read this book fast, in less than a few hours. I did love it, or wanted to. I loved the idea of it. I loved the science, the insight into such beautiful, weird, alien creatures. That only made it all the harder when I tried to reconcile Montgomery’s search for octopus consciousness with her willful ignorance--at least in the book--of the captive circumstances that made a good portion of her writing possible. I’d like to read a follow-up from her someday. I hope she writes it."
130,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17792052-amy,4,"I don't always have an easy time with non-fiction, so I really try to choose it well. Its important for me to get swept up in it somehow, to get a feeling or interest in the story. This one did - I got involved with it. I looked forward to picking it up. It wasn't just a slog through to learn something. I felt it. And it was set up to be a hard sell - why? Because why I love my dog dearly, and have been raised with animals/pets, I am not one for strange animals, or anything slippery. In fact one would go as far as to say that I outright dislike and have an anathema for ocean animals, underwater animals. To say - not my thing - would be an understatement. I live in Boston, my children have had an opportunity, I hope more than one to visit our amazing aquarium. I never have gone, wouldn't ever, and not in any city. I am not proud of this. Its an embarrassment to share I don't care for underwater animals. Its a funny thing I actually hope my children don't find out, or make too much of. Scuba, snorkeling, deep sea diving. I'll be on the beach reading. Luckily enough, no one else in the family has shown an interest. We prefer to walk the tide, and my sons would be playing volleyball, or football, or frisbee or something. Maybe my husband and I might have playing cards on a sandy blanket. The underwater world holds zero appeal for me.But this book? I actually really enjoyed it, and I'm glad I read it. That says a lot, because its non-fiction, and on a topic seriously not likely to draw me. But, consciousness, relationship, love, that is my thing. The thing that draws me every time. I actually truly loved reading this book. I also (in my own distanced way) fell in love with Octavia, Kali, Karma, and the first one - the beautiful Octopus our author fell in love with first. Funny, I actually throughout the book had to remind myself she was female. I kept picturing her male, and there was nothing remotely male about her. I loved thinking about how animals protect their young instinctively, even though there is nothing to protect, and how they turn to their relationships at various stages in their lives. I loved the mating scene, it was strange and beautiful. I loved how this Octopus moved various special needs children and adults, an elderly couple, a man losing his wife, and a whole family of people, tied through the love of these octopuses. (Funny, I thought it was octopi too…). Now, another plug for PBT - I wouldn't have really ever read this book, though I noticed it when it went around. But it felt clear to me that I would, when animals became the November tag. I'm very glad I had the opportunity. I really feel like I am a better person for having learned something, felt, and experienced these four friends, and what they meant and what they have taught and brought us. I'm a little proud of Boston, too. Maybe find a way to send my six year old soon? Seriously, I am grateful for the opportunity.What am I reading next? Well I am taking a brief six week course on three plays of Tennessee Williams, so I am about to review the Glass Menagerie, and this week I will be re-reading A Streetcar named Desire. Also will be starting the Zookeepers Wife. On Deck for November is the Muse, which I checked out of the library but haven't gotten to, To the Bright Edge of the World, which for some odd reason scares me a little, despite its glowing reviews. And the November read for Jewish Book Club - the Pinch. Is that right? Then there is for my own book club, my friends' book on Integrative Music Therapy - a Journey of Healing, so no November ""flurry"" for me. That's where I'm at. Octopus goes back to the library. So does Glass Menagerie, Pig Meets Pug, and on we go. "
131,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,5,"Is it possible to weep for an octopus' death?Sy Montgomery combines scientific inquiry with her own moving meditations on the purpose of life, the perception of time, and the possibilities of connection in this book. Her subject is the giant Pacific octopus, and she relates her intimate interactions with four of them, residents of the New England Aquarium in Boston. When she touches her first, an octopus named Athena, she is surprised.  “...[H]er head is silky and softer than custard. Her skin is flecked with ruby and silver, a night sky reflected in the wine-dark sea. As I stroke her with my fingertips, her skin goes white beneath my touch. White is the color of a relaxed octopus....” (Location 104) Montgomery's book is not a didactic scientific tome. Instead, she intersperses fascinating facts into a lyrical narrative of discovery. Octopuses have more neurons than a rat. The neurons are distributed throughout the tentacles. Motor control ranges from delicate exploration to a crushing grip. Each sucker can flex like a gentle kiss or pinch like a vice. The octopus smells and tastes through its skin. Montgomery notices Athena looking at her face while tasting her arms. Should she allow Athena to taste her face? Bill Murphy, senior aquarist, responds with a decisive “No.” The suckers could easily pull her eye out.An octopus named Octavia demonstrates remarkable camouflage abilities. Three layers of skin comprised of three types of cells enable shifts to multiple colors, patterns and textures, a canvas of liquid iridescence.This book is special, however, because Montgomery encounters so many examples of octopus personality: curiosity, memory, preferences, trust, playfulness, intelligence, and even deception. There is something tragic about an animal so like us in many ways having such a short lifespan — only 3-4 years. It lives a solitary life, hoarding its secrets. When born it is the size of a grain of rice. It grows, explores, learns, breeds and then, its life cycle completed, it becomes lethargic, senescent and dies. Montgomery's writing arouses a feeling of profound awe.The parallel story Montgomery tells is of the dedicated staff that attends these creatures. Montgomery describes them with such vividness that you feel you know them enough to greet them on the street. In the outside world their interests and individuality make them anomalies; in the aquarium they are part of a tight empathetic family. The memories they share with these octopuses are stored like a string of precious pearls. One interviewee likens the octopuses, caught from the wild, as ambassadors from their world to ours. It's an apt metaphor. Montgomery describes numerous occasions when adults as well as children are converted from uninvolved gawkers to sympathetic and curious admirers. The octopuses, in turn, seem curious about both the visitors and their environs, designed with painstaking attention to naturalism and security in mind. In addition, one of the most challenging tasks is designing puzzles to stave off octopus boredom. Would the octopus choose to give up its freedom to experience these unknown adventures? Of course, to even ask such a question is to lapse into anthropomorphism. Yet, I like to think that these octopuses live and die without regrets. So, returning to my opening question, if we weep, it is perhaps not from grief over the octopus as much as grief over the unfathomable mystery of life for all of us."
132,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361541-barb-middleton,4,"This narrative nonfiction story reveals the author's scientific study, care, and love of octopuses mainly at the New England aquarium. Her passion for the invertebrates is obvious and drew me into the story from the get-go. I learned more than I ever thought about how difficult it is to transfer and keep these Houdini-like creatures in their cages, as well as, their range of colors, ability to play, and unique senses and neurons that are in their arms. Some passages are very scientific but the density is lightened by the author's narration making for good pacing most of the time. The end narrative text started to sound a bit repetitive with the diving in the wild and the octopuses getting old and dying as it happens several times throughout the text, but overall it is an excellent book. If you like science and animals then I recommend it. The author's passion for animals shows in that she tries to prove that the intelligent octopus creature has a soul. I thought the argument as a whole in the book weak. She does mention philosophers and different theories. They are spread throughout the book so none of it is overwhelming and she recognizes that to define a soul is really not possible; that some say it is an inner being that gives people senses and intelligence, others it gives life meaning and purpose. ""Perhaps none of these definitions is true. Perhaps all of them are. But I am certain of one thing as I sit in my pew: If I have a soul-and I think I do-an octopus has a soul, too."" Her stance is clear from the start, but she doesn't get into the different theories much. Maybe that is a good thing considering the target audience.Her writing reminded me of ""The Secret Garden"" where Colin is so moved by nature that he is miraculously healed in his soul and stands up to recite the Doxology. The author is so moved by octopuses that her emotional descriptions show a passion that is deeply felt: ""Perhaps, I muse, this is the pace at which the Creator thinks, in the weighty, graceful, liquid manner-like blood flows, not like synapses fire."" She has terrific writing with plenty of similes and metaphors to help readers picture the creatures and their environment in the aquarium or wild.The book does explain mating and covers the loss of beloved animals either as pets or from an aquarium's caretaker's perspective. I learned more about scuba diving than I expected and she describes the tight friendship she developed from working at the aquarium and diving. These friendships add a human element that is a nice balance to the scientific narrative. I did not know anything about octopuses before reading this book and a knowledgeable reader might have a completely different reading experience than me. "
133,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,4,"‘The Soul of an Octopus’ is a charming, very readable memoir of encounters with octopodes. The author became fascinated with these mysterious creatures after getting to know one at an aquarium. She describes her octo-pals with such love that it’s hard not to want to meet one yourself once you’ve finished the book. I previously knew very little about octopodes, so was fascinated by their oddness. For example, I learned that octopus neurons are distributed among their tentacles, which appear genuinely able to think for themselves. A key theme of the book is the intelligence of octopodes and how difficult it is to compare with mammalian conceptions thereof. Montgomery makes a strong case that each octopus she has known had a distinctive personality and formed a bond with her.On the other hand, I found the chapters in which Montgomery learns to scuba dive a little hair-raising, as personally I fear and distrust deep water. (As an aside, I once tried out a friend’s VR goggles and explored a simulated ocean floor. That was pretty great - if it was made more interactive, what a lovely way to come close to ocean life without disturbing ecosystems or risking your personal safety.) Back at the aquarium, her account of the group of friends meeting weekly to spend time with an octopus was poignant and sweet. There are no great insights into consciousness to be found in this book, as it is more personal than scientific. Montgomery isn’t trying to give you the full history and biology of octopodes, she’s sharing portraits, anecdotes, and appealing facts. The writing is engaging and I enjoyed being reminded both of how little is known about ocean fauna and of the strong bonds that humans can form with other creatures. I’ve also been inspired to look up my nearest aquarium. "
134,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565471-rift-vegan,3,"Octopuses are fascinating, but I don't know much about them, other than a couple of PBS nature shows. This was a great first book for me, a little peek into someone else's obsession. The things I learned made me hungry for more... Octopuses are actually colour blind, except they can probably experience colour in their tentacles (rather than their eyes)!! And all their arms have neural connections... So interesting to think about having brains spread out all over your body!I would have rated this 4 stars out of 5, except for the sad fact that Montgomery barely touched the surface of the ethics of kidnapping and imprisoning such intelligent creatures. Granted, we know a lot more about octopuses because scientists observe them and experiment with them in captive situations. But I don't believe the end justifies the means. For just a couple paragraphs, she talks to a man who does the actual kidnapping and asks him if he thinks it's ethical. (ha, the truism by Upton Sinclair: It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.) He says the octopuses that he kidnaps and sells to zoos are ambassadors of the species, and people would not care about their fate in the wild if they don't get to see them in zoos. uh huh. Poor Kali, who knew the freedom of the entire ocean was kept in a barrel for months before she escaped and died. And it sounded like she may have died on purpose, but that was not addressed in the book at all. Sad, very sad.So, yes, mixed feelings about this book. And that's okay! It's great to think about things like this and work out my own opinions! "
135,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44349312-jeff,1,"Just how many times can Montgomery describe putting arms into a tank to have an octopus suck on them? Read this book to find out. It's clear over and over again that an octopus's senses differ from our own, yet Montgomery insists on waxing poetic about her own anthropomorphic speculations of what the octopus is ""feeling"" or ""thinking"" at the very moment it puts its many suckers on human arms. I think I was fooled by the popularity of this book, thinking that I would find something more about actual scientific research indicating that an octopus can readily identify ""self,"" but instead I was left with a broken record of the lives and deaths of short-lived cephalopods and the ad nauseam mourning of slightly deranged caretakers and onlookers afterward. Sprinkle in some story about SCUBA lessons and diving off Cozumel and bingo, you've transformed what should be a brief essay into a best selling book. Can we forge connections with animals? Sure. Does signing a ""Declaration of Consciousness"" prove that animals have a conscious? I respond with an emphatic ""NO!"" Like a typical biographer, Montgomery elevates the octopus on a pedestal and skirts the edge of implying that the animal might possibly be the pinnacle of conscious existence. This could (and should) have remained an essay and it would have been just fine. "
136,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21152376-jen,4,"4 stars + ♡Full review to follow with videos on our blog this week.Who knew that Octopuses could be so fascinating? Montgomery explores the wonderful world of octopuses in this touching non-fiction that is half memoir and half expose on these smart and personable ocean creatures.I enjoyed the book very much and found it surprisingly interesting. I learned a lot of interesting facts about octopus that I would have never guessed prior to reading the book (I'll let you discover those facts for yourself). Her writing style is very engaging and she is able to impart a lot of knowledge while making it seem like she is just telling you a story. This book will be a favorite but I didn't give it 5 stars for a few reasons. First, I think she often attributes thoughts, emotions and intentions to the octopuses at times. While I don't disagree that they have all those things, I question her ability to seem to attribute the exact emotion/thought/intention in certain instances. Second, I have to admit that it bothered me that someone who loved them so much (enough to write a whole book on them) would contemplate buying one to keep as a pet. "
137,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4604943-sarai,3,"3.5 StarsThis book focuses on Montgomery's experiences while conducting research on octopuses and their emotional intelligence. She meets various researchers and staff from the New England aquarium, and dives to observe octopuses in their natural habitat. Throughout the book, she shares interesting facts about octopuses, fish, and other mammals and will back some of these up with snippets of research. Most of the book reads like a memoir. Montgomery introduces the people she meets, shares personal interactions with various octopuses in the aquarium, and describes the connection she feels to them and to the staff. While I enjoyed the writing style very much--it reads like she's having coffee with you and sharing her cool experiences--I wanted more. I felt like Montgomery had just as many questions as I did, and not many answers. This book made me want to pick up another book on octopuses, fish, etc. with more cool facts backed by research. Overall it's a very enjoyable book, and I would recommend it to anyone who would maybe shy away from reading a scientific book but loves a good memoir--this would be a great choice, as it blends both genres into a fun, quick read."
138,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2658488-tara,5,"The purpose of an author is to draw you in their story and Sy has done her job perfectly! She had me hooked from the start when she informs the reader the plural of Octopus is Octopuses not Octopi. I thought to myself, what else don't I know about these 8 legged monsters...Well I quickly discovered they are not monsters and in fact appear to be intelligent and sensitive creatures who recognize individual people in an aquarium setting and will display actions indicating if they love or hate you!Before reading The Soul of an Octopus all I really knew about them was they had 8 tentacles and could squeeze themselves into small jars. I never imagined I would be captivated as I was by Sy's experiences. I laughed and cried right along with her. Half way through I was telling my boyfriend if I had read this book 20 years ago I probably would have gone to school to study octopuses. I look forward to the next time I find myself at an aquarium- the octopus will be my first stop for sure!! I have learned never dismiss the simplest creature because there is so much more than meets the eye!"
139,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4596358-ferdy,4,"Wanted to read about a subject I knew next to nothing about, so randomly decided to pick this up. Didn't realise just how interesting it would be, there were so many intriguing facts and anecdotes about octopuses, everything from their anatomy to their behaviour to their individual personalities were mentioned. The way the author wrote about the octopuses she encountered made them seem almost impossible and mythical, it was like reading about another world at times. The most engrossing parts were definitely the author's interactions with the octopuses at the aquarium she saw day in and day out, it was fascinating getting updates on Athena, Octavia, and Kali. I wasn't so keen on the author's time trying to scuba dive or the other parts which weren't really focused on octopuses."

How arrogant we have been. This is one amazing book, well researched yet charming in its narrative, and thanks to Sy Montgomery, I am thoroughly smitten by these wonderful animals. I've always felt that at least the dogs and cats I've known in my life share these characteristics with me, but now I find out that even cephalopods experience all of these traits, too. And to think, we eat these creatures. Not me, because I'm quickly becoming a vegetarian (this book hastened the process). Read it. You will be gobsmacked by nature."
141,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22941942-amy-morgan,5,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I learned so many things about octopuses and am now completely fascinated by them. I loved how easy to read this story was and how beautifully the author described her interactions with these unique creatures. You could really feel the love she felt for them and the other creatures in the aquarium just flowing off the pages. Getting to know an octopus is definitely on my bucket list now!

Sy Montgomery reads her story with enthusiasm and I learned tremendous amounts of information about the octopus! A complete wild card - would never have thought I would be so hooked on this kind of audiobook, but it worked out well and was a very pleasant and lovely change in my reading - something I needed at the moment."
143,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22299570-kaytee-cobb,5,"Warning: I am recklessly sentimental. And this book is recklessly sentimental for a memoir. It is saccharine sweet at parts, but also completely amazed at the complexity and awesomeness of octopuses, and i became super attached to each of the creatures she encounters. I loved it, but Your Mileage May Vary."
144,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5907780-joe-m,4,"Fascinating book-my mind was definitely blown several times learning about these incredible creatures.

147,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8783847-ginger-bensman,4,"I enjoyed this book. Sy Montgomery makes a compelling case that the octopus is a playful, complex, intelligent, social, and empathetic animal, and she does it through the lens of her own personal and life affirming experiences with octopuses. (We learn on practically the first page that the proper plural for octopus is not octopi -- but rather ""octopuses"" in keeping with the word's Greek origins.) I was hoping for more science mixed in with the memoir and personal anecdotes, but my interest in octopuses has been expanded and I'll seek out more information from the list of references in the book."

I appreciated the sense of wonder and respect for creatures Montgomery has. I disagree with some of her implied conclusions, but the observations she makes and shares beg the question ""why is man so different, despite being so similar?"""
149,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,4,"So teetering between a 3 and a 4 on this book, but I think on all the typical qualities on which I assess a book, it deserves the 4. Sy Montgomery finds an engaging way to write more than 200 pages about the neurobiology of the octopus that I think would entertain most readers. If you have even rudimentary interest in the natural world, this book is very accessible, and Montgomery's enthusiasm about animals in general and octopuses in general shines through.The majority of the book focuses on three octopuses that come through the aquarium in Boston, Massachusetts. Montgomery's habit of guessing at the emotional life of animals annoyed me a bit in The Good Good Pig: The Extraordinary Life of Christopher Hogwood, and somehow is worse when it comes to a non-mammal, but at the same time, I can't fault her completely because it is part of what makes the book entertaining. The animals seem so relatable that the reader truly cares what happens to them. And that brings me to my giant frustration, not so much with the book, but with the tale of the octopuses in the aquarium.The rest of this review truly is a spoiler, but what really caused me to knock stars off of this book is some hypocrisy that I just couldn't bring myself to ignore. So rare for me because normally I take stories at face value and focus on the writing, the entertainment, and the character development - - but this is non-fiction, so it's basically impossible to completely banish the thoughts I had while reading it. And I don't even share the worst of it below.(view spoiler)[ So, I really have a problem with how these animals were handled, and I'm certainly no animal rights activist. The whole book posits how intelligent the octopuses are and even imbues them with consciousness and to some degree, emotions. So, in what world does their process for handling these creatures make any sense. The oldest octopus, Octavia, is in a decent tank, and she's currently healthy, but reaching the end of her life span. So the Aquarium obtains a new octopus, Kali. Kali is relegated to a 50 gallon barrel (my oil tank in my house is 6 times the size). And every time the barrel is opened, she eagerly tries to explore outside it suggesting she's bored at best. Later, they determine she tried to chew her way out of it. But well before that point, it's quite clear that if you really believe the animal is intelligent then a barrel is no place for it. At first, I rationalized this to myself thinking ""well, perhaps the lead time for getting a new octopus is super long so they don't want to wait until Octavia dies because they won't have a replacement for their exhibit, and I get how that might not be optimal."" Um. Yeah. No. They get a third octopus in 8 days. Which also tries to eat its way out of the barrel. So in my mind, this book is pretty much an exercise in complete hypocrisy . . .if you truly believe that this animal is as intelligent and emotional as they make it out to be, you don't treat it like this and then get all excited that it seems happy when you open the barrel to visit with it.  (hide spoiler)]Bottom line, read this one if you want to learn about octopuses, but just be forewarned that you may not really like the author much after you finish it."
150,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6840223-erika,1,"I was still on an ocean hangover from a trip to Coronado when I bought this book. The ocean fascinates me and I'm particularly intrigued by jellyfish and octopus. It should be noted that the author of his book, Sy Montgomery, is a seasoned writer, investigative explorer, and recipient of lifetime achievement awards from the Humane Society. I believe her to be a caring and conscientious animal lover who holds animals' best interests in high regard--BUT, the her book is plagued with many instances of overreach. Montgomery documents her research of four octopuses housed at the New England Aquarium. Facts and statistics are dispersed throughout the book, one of which reveals that octopuses taste through their suckers and can literally taste your skin. On one visit to the aquarium, Montgomery brings a friend who is a smoker. The octopus reacts harshly to the friend and Montgomery wonders if it is because the octopus could taste the nicotine on her friend's skin. Another time, the author ponders whether or not the octopus will interact with her since she recently dyed her hair and perhaps the octopus wouldn't like the chemicals. Yet, she plunges her hands and arms in the water anyway. Montgomery herself even acknowledges the danger of this: ""[...] the skin of an octopus is one giant, fantastically sensitive mucous membrane. Steinhart Aquarium's assistant curator J. Charles Delbeek has likened cephalopod skin to the lining of the mammalian gut, with the result that 'levels of chemicals, nutrients, pollutants, etc. that are seemingly not toxic to other species and inverts can be toxic to cephs.'"" Moreover, the entire book revolves around Montgomery's quest to prove the consciousness of an octopus, yet a great portion of the book focuses on the suffocating handling of the octopus named Kali. Kali was procured from the wild by the aquarium and kept in a darkened barrel--void of stimulation, as well noted by the author--for approximately nine months because the aquarium did not have the space for her. (They needed her to replace an aging octopus already on display in the event that the older invertebrate died.) Eventually, it becomes evident that older (Octavia) and younger (Kali) must switch places. It's a risky move and one that proves fatal for Kali--she escaped through a two-inch hole in the lid of the tank. I have no doubt her staff and volunteers were devastated by her loss. However, when Wilson, one of her handlers says, ""'She had a day of freedom [in the new tank]. And that she got out tells you a phenomenally inquisitive and intelligent creature wanted her freedom. We know, clearly, it must have taken a lot of effort to get out.'"" And clearly, Wilson, it should tell you, Montgomery, and the aquarium that her ""freedom"" was not a tank. Captured at an approximate age of nine months, left in a barrel for nine more, only to die on the aquarium floor...disgraceful. Considering that only a few (like, less than five) out of 100,000 eggs survive to sexual maturity, it would appear imperative to allow these animals to flourish in the wild. Greatly disappointed with this book. "
151,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,4,"Octopus is a very intelligent animal with a radically different style of neurological and psychological organization from us. ""Is there a scene of self at all, a center of experience? If not, that involves imagination something so different from us it might be impossible to think of. .... If there is no central consciousness, does an octopus have a ""collaborative, cooperative, but distributed mind"", as Peter suggest? Does it have a sense of multiple selves? Does each arm literally have a mind of its own?"" The Soul of an Octopus includes many octopuses (not ocopi, by the way, as octopus is a Greek word, not a Latin word): Athena, Octavia, Kali and Karma, all of them lived in New England Aquarium in Boston. Sy Montgomery is a science journalist. The book is a collection of the author's encounter with these octopuses in captivity, as well as octopuses in the wild (Caribbean and Pacific Ocean in particular). ""The ocean, for me, is what LSD was to Timothy Leary. "" I never tried LSD (or any other drugs), but I tend to agree with the author: the wondrous and capacious nature provides endless possibilities to keep me wowed forever."

My second favorite thing, that no one has mentioned, is the SECRET HIDDEN FLIP BOOK made up of the pictures on the bottom corners of the pages. Maybe I'm just a dork, but this gave me great joy. A whole book, so engagingly written, by a scientist who becomes taken with octopuses to such an extent that she gets SCUBA certified just to visit their world. It's how I felt two years ago when I came upon a harbor seal ""bottling"" in the ocean as I was kayaking near home - I was compelled to reach out to the New England Aquarium to ask them about it, then visit for a personal meet and greet with one of their resident seals, then join so that I can go to the aquarium whenever I want (which is how I ended up with this book last Tuesday, in the gift shop). All because of wonder and a little excitement. I want to read more of Sy's adventures now. Thanks for the ever so personal stories of not just the octopuses, but the people and fellow aquarium residents, too. "
153,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25338445-angie-reisetter,5,"Wow. This woman loves octopuses, and the sea and its creatures in general. Her enthusiasm is contagious. She not only fills this book with facts about sea life and descriptions of the personalities of the octopuses she knows, but also just the general comraderie of being an aquarium groupie. She makes me want to go and hang out with fishes more often. There's so much that we're still learning about our fellow creatures, so much to be explored. This is just a thoroughly enjoyable read that has rekindled my love for the world below the water line.More thoughts on this book here: http://www.steepedinscience.com/2015/...I got a copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley."
154,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/287915-name-redacted,2,"When a marine biologist tells the non-scientist author that her non-scientist friend committed suicide, the author responds with sympathy. When the marine biologist then confides that she too had tried to commit suicide, the author's response is to point to a nearby octopus in a tank and say in bewilderment ""You would leave THIS?!""Because apparently in this author's mind the simple task of working with an octopus should cancel out the impulse to self-extinction. Any other employment or life circumstances? No, then suicide makes sense.So I think I've had just about enough of this deranged author's masturbatory prose-poetry non-scientific cephalopod rants."
155,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/777369-jessica,3,"Sy Montgomery is a good writer but I strongly recommend the essay she wrote for Orion a few years back over this book. The essay is very moving and incredibly revealing about the otherness and being of an octopus as well as the connection that is possible between such a being and a human.While the essay felt distilled, rich, with no extra weight, the books feels chatty, padded, diluted."

159,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1373260-jaclyn-day,4,"This was a wonderful, captivating peek into the mysteries of the natural world. If you love the ocean and the creatures that inhabit it, you’ll feel an instant commiseration with Montgomery’s wonder at exploring octopuses in their natural habitats and in her home base aquarium in Boston. (The correct plural is octopuses, not octopi, she explains.) The book is fascinating. More of a memoir than a scientific study, but that makes it no less educational. But (and this is a big “but”), one huge faulty area is in Montgomery’s refusal to address the plight of octopus captivity and the aquarium octopus trade that she even participates in at one point. Octopuses are plucked from the ocean at just the right age and transported into small containers with their own fecal matter to whichever aquarium puts out an APB. There, they’re left to grow old--in a matter of years, octopuses don’t often live past 5--tending to unfertilized eggs (they’re rarely mated), growing larger in barrels ill-suited to their size, and getting increasingly bored and in need of stimuli. This is all from Montgomery’s book, mind you. It’s talked about lightly or skimmed over in favor of a safer topic. At one point, Montgomery argues that aquarium capture and captivity of octopuses is necessary to protect the species and educate the general public, and it’s a decent argument under certain circumstances. There are many aquariums, including the New England Aquarium, doing wonderful things for education and conservation. But, while education is important, Montgomery’s connection to the aquarium was the lifeline of her book--this book--and the captivity topic feels purposefully ignored in favor of her continued VIP access to Boston's prized octopuses. So, how do you write a book about the potential consciousness of a highly intelligent, remarkable species while mostly observing it in a captive environment? An environment that is, she admits, often stressful to the animal? There’s no doubt that she and the other volunteers and professionals at the aquarium cared deeply about the animals she writes about: Athena, Octavia, Kali, Karma. I just couldn’t get over the void left by Montgomery’s blatant refusal to go near the ethical or moral implications of captivity where her octopus consciousness questions were concerned. Could Montgomery have written the same book by observing octopuses living in their natural ocean habitats? I think so. She does do some of this, but she’s not a natural ocean swimmer or skilled diver (as she notes). Her open ocean dives seem more disappointing to her than illuminating to her understanding of the species. On the diving trips, she expresses that she can’t wait to get back to the aquarium and her friends there. She can’t wait to see the captive octopuses that can’t hide in their dens, or camouflage their escape route. She can’t wait to visit with the ones that are so bored that they may have no option but to interact with humans--for the sake of their food, their sanity, their survival. Montgomery expresses frequent awe at her interactions with the creatures. She swears they remember people. She talks about them embracing her arms, not roughly or aggressively, but in a warm, friendly greeting. That anthropomorphizing compromises her objectivity about what she’s writing about and the circumstances that she’s keeping quiet about in order to do so. This is a pretty intense critique, but to be clear--I read this book fast, in less than a few hours. I did love it, or wanted to. I loved the idea of it. I loved the science, the insight into such beautiful, weird, alien creatures. That only made it all the harder when I tried to reconcile Montgomery’s search for octopus consciousness with her willful ignorance--at least in the book--of the captive circumstances that made a good portion of her writing possible. I’d like to read a follow-up from her someday. I hope she writes it."
160,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17792052-amy,4,"I don't always have an easy time with non-fiction, so I really try to choose it well. Its important for me to get swept up in it somehow, to get a feeling or interest in the story. This one did - I got involved with it. I looked forward to picking it up. It wasn't just a slog through to learn something. I felt it. And it was set up to be a hard sell - why? Because why I love my dog dearly, and have been raised with animals/pets, I am not one for strange animals, or anything slippery. In fact one would go as far as to say that I outright dislike and have an anathema for ocean animals, underwater animals. To say - not my thing - would be an understatement. I live in Boston, my children have had an opportunity, I hope more than one to visit our amazing aquarium. I never have gone, wouldn't ever, and not in any city. I am not proud of this. Its an embarrassment to share I don't care for underwater animals. Its a funny thing I actually hope my children don't find out, or make too much of. Scuba, snorkeling, deep sea diving. I'll be on the beach reading. Luckily enough, no one else in the family has shown an interest. We prefer to walk the tide, and my sons would be playing volleyball, or football, or frisbee or something. Maybe my husband and I might have playing cards on a sandy blanket. The underwater world holds zero appeal for me.But this book? I actually really enjoyed it, and I'm glad I read it. That says a lot, because its non-fiction, and on a topic seriously not likely to draw me. But, consciousness, relationship, love, that is my thing. The thing that draws me every time. I actually truly loved reading this book. I also (in my own distanced way) fell in love with Octavia, Kali, Karma, and the first one - the beautiful Octopus our author fell in love with first. Funny, I actually throughout the book had to remind myself she was female. I kept picturing her male, and there was nothing remotely male about her. I loved thinking about how animals protect their young instinctively, even though there is nothing to protect, and how they turn to their relationships at various stages in their lives. I loved the mating scene, it was strange and beautiful. I loved how this Octopus moved various special needs children and adults, an elderly couple, a man losing his wife, and a whole family of people, tied through the love of these octopuses. (Funny, I thought it was octopi too…). Now, another plug for PBT - I wouldn't have really ever read this book, though I noticed it when it went around. But it felt clear to me that I would, when animals became the November tag. I'm very glad I had the opportunity. I really feel like I am a better person for having learned something, felt, and experienced these four friends, and what they meant and what they have taught and brought us. I'm a little proud of Boston, too. Maybe find a way to send my six year old soon? Seriously, I am grateful for the opportunity.What am I reading next? Well I am taking a brief six week course on three plays of Tennessee Williams, so I am about to review the Glass Menagerie, and this week I will be re-reading A Streetcar named Desire. Also will be starting the Zookeepers Wife. On Deck for November is the Muse, which I checked out of the library but haven't gotten to, To the Bright Edge of the World, which for some odd reason scares me a little, despite its glowing reviews. And the November read for Jewish Book Club - the Pinch. Is that right? Then there is for my own book club, my friends' book on Integrative Music Therapy - a Journey of Healing, so no November ""flurry"" for me. That's where I'm at. Octopus goes back to the library. So does Glass Menagerie, Pig Meets Pug, and on we go. "
161,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,5,"Is it possible to weep for an octopus' death?Sy Montgomery combines scientific inquiry with her own moving meditations on the purpose of life, the perception of time, and the possibilities of connection in this book. Her subject is the giant Pacific octopus, and she relates her intimate interactions with four of them, residents of the New England Aquarium in Boston. When she touches her first, an octopus named Athena, she is surprised.  “...[H]er head is silky and softer than custard. Her skin is flecked with ruby and silver, a night sky reflected in the wine-dark sea. As I stroke her with my fingertips, her skin goes white beneath my touch. White is the color of a relaxed octopus....” (Location 104) Montgomery's book is not a didactic scientific tome. Instead, she intersperses fascinating facts into a lyrical narrative of discovery. Octopuses have more neurons than a rat. The neurons are distributed throughout the tentacles. Motor control ranges from delicate exploration to a crushing grip. Each sucker can flex like a gentle kiss or pinch like a vice. The octopus smells and tastes through its skin. Montgomery notices Athena looking at her face while tasting her arms. Should she allow Athena to taste her face? Bill Murphy, senior aquarist, responds with a decisive “No.” The suckers could easily pull her eye out.An octopus named Octavia demonstrates remarkable camouflage abilities. Three layers of skin comprised of three types of cells enable shifts to multiple colors, patterns and textures, a canvas of liquid iridescence.This book is special, however, because Montgomery encounters so many examples of octopus personality: curiosity, memory, preferences, trust, playfulness, intelligence, and even deception. There is something tragic about an animal so like us in many ways having such a short lifespan — only 3-4 years. It lives a solitary life, hoarding its secrets. When born it is the size of a grain of rice. It grows, explores, learns, breeds and then, its life cycle completed, it becomes lethargic, senescent and dies. Montgomery's writing arouses a feeling of profound awe.The parallel story Montgomery tells is of the dedicated staff that attends these creatures. Montgomery describes them with such vividness that you feel you know them enough to greet them on the street. In the outside world their interests and individuality make them anomalies; in the aquarium they are part of a tight empathetic family. The memories they share with these octopuses are stored like a string of precious pearls. One interviewee likens the octopuses, caught from the wild, as ambassadors from their world to ours. It's an apt metaphor. Montgomery describes numerous occasions when adults as well as children are converted from uninvolved gawkers to sympathetic and curious admirers. The octopuses, in turn, seem curious about both the visitors and their environs, designed with painstaking attention to naturalism and security in mind. In addition, one of the most challenging tasks is designing puzzles to stave off octopus boredom. Would the octopus choose to give up its freedom to experience these unknown adventures? Of course, to even ask such a question is to lapse into anthropomorphism. Yet, I like to think that these octopuses live and die without regrets. So, returning to my opening question, if we weep, it is perhaps not from grief over the octopus as much as grief over the unfathomable mystery of life for all of us."
162,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361541-barb-middleton,4,"This narrative nonfiction story reveals the author's scientific study, care, and love of octopuses mainly at the New England aquarium. Her passion for the invertebrates is obvious and drew me into the story from the get-go. I learned more than I ever thought about how difficult it is to transfer and keep these Houdini-like creatures in their cages, as well as, their range of colors, ability to play, and unique senses and neurons that are in their arms. Some passages are very scientific but the density is lightened by the author's narration making for good pacing most of the time. The end narrative text started to sound a bit repetitive with the diving in the wild and the octopuses getting old and dying as it happens several times throughout the text, but overall it is an excellent book. If you like science and animals then I recommend it. The author's passion for animals shows in that she tries to prove that the intelligent octopus creature has a soul. I thought the argument as a whole in the book weak. She does mention philosophers and different theories. They are spread throughout the book so none of it is overwhelming and she recognizes that to define a soul is really not possible; that some say it is an inner being that gives people senses and intelligence, others it gives life meaning and purpose. ""Perhaps none of these definitions is true. Perhaps all of them are. But I am certain of one thing as I sit in my pew: If I have a soul-and I think I do-an octopus has a soul, too."" Her stance is clear from the start, but she doesn't get into the different theories much. Maybe that is a good thing considering the target audience.Her writing reminded me of ""The Secret Garden"" where Colin is so moved by nature that he is miraculously healed in his soul and stands up to recite the Doxology. The author is so moved by octopuses that her emotional descriptions show a passion that is deeply felt: ""Perhaps, I muse, this is the pace at which the Creator thinks, in the weighty, graceful, liquid manner-like blood flows, not like synapses fire."" She has terrific writing with plenty of similes and metaphors to help readers picture the creatures and their environment in the aquarium or wild.The book does explain mating and covers the loss of beloved animals either as pets or from an aquarium's caretaker's perspective. I learned more about scuba diving than I expected and she describes the tight friendship she developed from working at the aquarium and diving. These friendships add a human element that is a nice balance to the scientific narrative. I did not know anything about octopuses before reading this book and a knowledgeable reader might have a completely different reading experience than me. "
163,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,4,"‘The Soul of an Octopus’ is a charming, very readable memoir of encounters with octopodes. The author became fascinated with these mysterious creatures after getting to know one at an aquarium. She describes her octo-pals with such love that it’s hard not to want to meet one yourself once you’ve finished the book. I previously knew very little about octopodes, so was fascinated by their oddness. For example, I learned that octopus neurons are distributed among their tentacles, which appear genuinely able to think for themselves. A key theme of the book is the intelligence of octopodes and how difficult it is to compare with mammalian conceptions thereof. Montgomery makes a strong case that each octopus she has known had a distinctive personality and formed a bond with her.On the other hand, I found the chapters in which Montgomery learns to scuba dive a little hair-raising, as personally I fear and distrust deep water. (As an aside, I once tried out a friend’s VR goggles and explored a simulated ocean floor. That was pretty great - if it was made more interactive, what a lovely way to come close to ocean life without disturbing ecosystems or risking your personal safety.) Back at the aquarium, her account of the group of friends meeting weekly to spend time with an octopus was poignant and sweet. There are no great insights into consciousness to be found in this book, as it is more personal than scientific. Montgomery isn’t trying to give you the full history and biology of octopodes, she’s sharing portraits, anecdotes, and appealing facts. The writing is engaging and I enjoyed being reminded both of how little is known about ocean fauna and of the strong bonds that humans can form with other creatures. I’ve also been inspired to look up my nearest aquarium. "
164,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565471-rift-vegan,3,"Octopuses are fascinating, but I don't know much about them, other than a couple of PBS nature shows. This was a great first book for me, a little peek into someone else's obsession. The things I learned made me hungry for more... Octopuses are actually colour blind, except they can probably experience colour in their tentacles (rather than their eyes)!! And all their arms have neural connections... So interesting to think about having brains spread out all over your body!I would have rated this 4 stars out of 5, except for the sad fact that Montgomery barely touched the surface of the ethics of kidnapping and imprisoning such intelligent creatures. Granted, we know a lot more about octopuses because scientists observe them and experiment with them in captive situations. But I don't believe the end justifies the means. For just a couple paragraphs, she talks to a man who does the actual kidnapping and asks him if he thinks it's ethical. (ha, the truism by Upton Sinclair: It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.) He says the octopuses that he kidnaps and sells to zoos are ambassadors of the species, and people would not care about their fate in the wild if they don't get to see them in zoos. uh huh. Poor Kali, who knew the freedom of the entire ocean was kept in a barrel for months before she escaped and died. And it sounded like she may have died on purpose, but that was not addressed in the book at all. Sad, very sad.So, yes, mixed feelings about this book. And that's okay! It's great to think about things like this and work out my own opinions! "
165,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44349312-jeff,1,"Just how many times can Montgomery describe putting arms into a tank to have an octopus suck on them? Read this book to find out. It's clear over and over again that an octopus's senses differ from our own, yet Montgomery insists on waxing poetic about her own anthropomorphic speculations of what the octopus is ""feeling"" or ""thinking"" at the very moment it puts its many suckers on human arms. I think I was fooled by the popularity of this book, thinking that I would find something more about actual scientific research indicating that an octopus can readily identify ""self,"" but instead I was left with a broken record of the lives and deaths of short-lived cephalopods and the ad nauseam mourning of slightly deranged caretakers and onlookers afterward. Sprinkle in some story about SCUBA lessons and diving off Cozumel and bingo, you've transformed what should be a brief essay into a best selling book. Can we forge connections with animals? Sure. Does signing a ""Declaration of Consciousness"" prove that animals have a conscious? I respond with an emphatic ""NO!"" Like a typical biographer, Montgomery elevates the octopus on a pedestal and skirts the edge of implying that the animal might possibly be the pinnacle of conscious existence. This could (and should) have remained an essay and it would have been just fine. "

Montgomery explores the wonderful world of octopuses in this touching non-fiction that is half memoir and half expose on these smart and personable ocean creatures.I enjoyed the book very much and found it surprisingly interesting. I learned a lot of interesting facts about octopus that I would have never guessed prior to reading the book (I'll let you discover those facts for yourself). Her writing style is very engaging and she is able to impart a lot of knowledge while making it seem like she is just telling you a story. This book will be a favorite but I didn't give it 5 stars for a few reasons. First, I think she often attributes thoughts, emotions and intentions to the octopuses at times. While I don't disagree that they have all those things, I question her ability to seem to attribute the exact emotion/thought/intention in certain instances. Second, I have to admit that it bothered me that someone who loved them so much (enough to write a whole book on them) would contemplate buying one to keep as a pet. "
167,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4604943-sarai,3,"3.5 StarsThis book focuses on Montgomery's experiences while conducting research on octopuses and their emotional intelligence. She meets various researchers and staff from the New England aquarium, and dives to observe octopuses in their natural habitat. Throughout the book, she shares interesting facts about octopuses, fish, and other mammals and will back some of these up with snippets of research. Most of the book reads like a memoir. Montgomery introduces the people she meets, shares personal interactions with various octopuses in the aquarium, and describes the connection she feels to them and to the staff. While I enjoyed the writing style very much--it reads like she's having coffee with you and sharing her cool experiences--I wanted more. I felt like Montgomery had just as many questions as I did, and not many answers. This book made me want to pick up another book on octopuses, fish, etc. with more cool facts backed by research. Overall it's a very enjoyable book, and I would recommend it to anyone who would maybe shy away from reading a scientific book but loves a good memoir--this would be a great choice, as it blends both genres into a fun, quick read."
168,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2658488-tara,5,"The purpose of an author is to draw you in their story and Sy has done her job perfectly! She had me hooked from the start when she informs the reader the plural of Octopus is Octopuses not Octopi. I thought to myself, what else don't I know about these 8 legged monsters...Well I quickly discovered they are not monsters and in fact appear to be intelligent and sensitive creatures who recognize individual people in an aquarium setting and will display actions indicating if they love or hate you!Before reading The Soul of an Octopus all I really knew about them was they had 8 tentacles and could squeeze themselves into small jars. I never imagined I would be captivated as I was by Sy's experiences. I laughed and cried right along with her. Half way through I was telling my boyfriend if I had read this book 20 years ago I probably would have gone to school to study octopuses. I look forward to the next time I find myself at an aquarium- the octopus will be my first stop for sure!! I have learned never dismiss the simplest creature because there is so much more than meets the eye!"
169,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4596358-ferdy,4,"Wanted to read about a subject I knew next to nothing about, so randomly decided to pick this up. Didn't realise just how interesting it would be, there were so many intriguing facts and anecdotes about octopuses, everything from their anatomy to their behaviour to their individual personalities were mentioned. The way the author wrote about the octopuses she encountered made them seem almost impossible and mythical, it was like reading about another world at times. The most engrossing parts were definitely the author's interactions with the octopuses at the aquarium she saw day in and day out, it was fascinating getting updates on Athena, Octavia, and Kali. I wasn't so keen on the author's time trying to scuba dive or the other parts which weren't really focused on octopuses."

How arrogant we have been. This is one amazing book, well researched yet charming in its narrative, and thanks to Sy Montgomery, I am thoroughly smitten by these wonderful animals. I've always felt that at least the dogs and cats I've known in my life share these characteristics with me, but now I find out that even cephalopods experience all of these traits, too. And to think, we eat these creatures. Not me, because I'm quickly becoming a vegetarian (this book hastened the process). Read it. You will be gobsmacked by nature."
171,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22941942-amy-morgan,5,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I learned so many things about octopuses and am now completely fascinated by them. I loved how easy to read this story was and how beautifully the author described her interactions with these unique creatures. You could really feel the love she felt for them and the other creatures in the aquarium just flowing off the pages. Getting to know an octopus is definitely on my bucket list now!

Sy Montgomery reads her story with enthusiasm and I learned tremendous amounts of information about the octopus!

Sy Montgomery makes a compelling case that the octopus is a playful, complex, intelligent, social, and empathetic animal, and she does it through the lens of her own personal and life affirming experiences with octopuses. (We learn on practically the first page that the proper plural for octopus is not octopi -- but rather ""octopuses"" in keeping with the word's Greek origins.) I was hoping for more science mixed in with the memoir and personal anecdotes, but my interest in octopuses has been expanded and I'll seek out more information from the list of references in the book."

I appreciated the sense of wonder and respect for creatures Montgomery has. I disagree with some of her implied conclusions, but the observations she makes and shares beg the question ""why is man so different, despite being so similar?"""
179,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,4,"So teetering between a 3 and a 4 on this book, but I think on all the typical qualities on which I assess a book, it deserves the 4. Sy Montgomery finds an engaging way to write more than 200 pages about the neurobiology of the octopus that I think would entertain most readers. If you have even rudimentary interest in the natural world, this book is very accessible, and Montgomery's enthusiasm about animals in general and octopuses in general shines through.The majority of the book focuses on three octopuses that come through the aquarium in Boston, Massachusetts. Montgomery's habit of guessing at the emotional life of animals annoyed me a bit in The Good Good Pig: The Extraordinary Life of Christopher Hogwood, and somehow is worse when it comes to a non-mammal, but at the same time, I can't fault her completely because it is part of what makes the book entertaining. The animals seem so relatable that the reader truly cares what happens to them. And that brings me to my giant frustration, not so much with the book, but with the tale of the octopuses in the aquarium.The rest of this review truly is a spoiler, but what really caused me to knock stars off of this book is some hypocrisy that I just couldn't bring myself to ignore. So rare for me because normally I take stories at face value and focus on the writing, the entertainment, and the character development - - but this is non-fiction, so it's basically impossible to completely banish the thoughts I had while reading it. And I don't even share the worst of it below.(view spoiler)[ So, I really have a problem with how these animals were handled, and I'm certainly no animal rights activist. The whole book posits how intelligent the octopuses are and even imbues them with consciousness and to some degree, emotions. So, in what world does their process for handling these creatures make any sense. The oldest octopus, Octavia, is in a decent tank, and she's currently healthy, but reaching the end of her life span. So the Aquarium obtains a new octopus, Kali. Kali is relegated to a 50 gallon barrel (my oil tank in my house is 6 times the size). And every time the barrel is opened, she eagerly tries to explore outside it suggesting she's bored at best. Later, they determine she tried to chew her way out of it. But well before that point, it's quite clear that if you really believe the animal is intelligent then a barrel is no place for it. At first, I rationalized this to myself thinking ""well, perhaps the lead time for getting a new octopus is super long so they don't want to wait until Octavia dies because they won't have a replacement for their exhibit, and I get how that might not be optimal."" Um. Yeah. No. They get a third octopus in 8 days. Which also tries to eat its way out of the barrel. So in my mind, this book is pretty much an exercise in complete hypocrisy . . .if you truly believe that this animal is as intelligent and emotional as they make it out to be, you don't treat it like this and then get all excited that it seems happy when you open the barrel to visit with it.  (hide spoiler)]Bottom line, read this one if you want to learn about octopuses, but just be forewarned that you may not really like the author much after you finish it."
180,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6840223-erika,1,"I was still on an ocean hangover from a trip to Coronado when I bought this book. The ocean fascinates me and I'm particularly intrigued by jellyfish and octopus. It should be noted that the author of his book, Sy Montgomery, is a seasoned writer, investigative explorer, and recipient of lifetime achievement awards from the Humane Society. I believe her to be a caring and conscientious animal lover who holds animals' best interests in high regard--BUT, the her book is plagued with many instances of overreach. Montgomery documents her research of four octopuses housed at the New England Aquarium. Facts and statistics are dispersed throughout the book, one of which reveals that octopuses taste through their suckers and can literally taste your skin. On one visit to the aquarium, Montgomery brings a friend who is a smoker. The octopus reacts harshly to the friend and Montgomery wonders if it is because the octopus could taste the nicotine on her friend's skin. Another time, the author ponders whether or not the octopus will interact with her since she recently dyed her hair and perhaps the octopus wouldn't like the chemicals. Yet, she plunges her hands and arms in the water anyway. Montgomery herself even acknowledges the danger of this: ""[...] the skin of an octopus is one giant, fantastically sensitive mucous membrane. Steinhart Aquarium's assistant curator J. Charles Delbeek has likened cephalopod skin to the lining of the mammalian gut, with the result that 'levels of chemicals, nutrients, pollutants, etc. that are seemingly not toxic to other species and inverts can be toxic to cephs.'"" Moreover, the entire book revolves around Montgomery's quest to prove the consciousness of an octopus, yet a great portion of the book focuses on the suffocating handling of the octopus named Kali. Kali was procured from the wild by the aquarium and kept in a darkened barrel--void of stimulation, as well noted by the author--for approximately nine months because the aquarium did not have the space for her. (They needed her to replace an aging octopus already on display in the event that the older invertebrate died.) Eventually, it becomes evident that older (Octavia) and younger (Kali) must switch places. It's a risky move and one that proves fatal for Kali--she escaped through a two-inch hole in the lid of the tank. I have no doubt her staff and volunteers were devastated by her loss. However, when Wilson, one of her handlers says, ""'She had a day of freedom [in the new tank]. And that she got out tells you a phenomenally inquisitive and intelligent creature wanted her freedom. We know, clearly, it must have taken a lot of effort to get out.'"" And clearly, Wilson, it should tell you, Montgomery, and the aquarium that her ""freedom"" was not a tank. Captured at an approximate age of nine months, left in a barrel for nine more, only to die on the aquarium floor...disgraceful. Considering that only a few (like, less than five) out of 100,000 eggs survive to sexual maturity, it would appear imperative to allow these animals to flourish in the wild. Greatly disappointed with this book. "
181,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,4,"Octopus is a very intelligent animal with a radically different style of neurological and psychological organization from us. ""Is there a scene of self at all, a center of experience? If not, that involves imagination something so different from us it might be impossible to think of. .... If there is no central consciousness, does an octopus have a ""collaborative, cooperative, but distributed mind"", as Peter suggest? Does it have a sense of multiple selves? Does each arm literally have a mind of its own?"" The Soul of an Octopus includes many octopuses (not ocopi, by the way, as octopus is a Greek word, not a Latin word): Athena, Octavia, Kali and Karma, all of them lived in New England Aquarium in Boston. Sy Montgomery is a science journalist. The book is a collection of the author's encounter with these octopuses in captivity, as well as octopuses in the wild (Caribbean and Pacific Ocean in particular).

My second favorite thing, that no one has mentioned, is the SECRET HIDDEN FLIP BOOK made up of the pictures on the bottom corners of the pages. Maybe I'm just a dork, but this gave me great joy. A whole book, so engagingly written, by a scientist who becomes taken with octopuses to such an extent that she gets SCUBA certified just to visit their world. It's how I felt two years ago when I came upon a harbor seal ""bottling"" in the ocean as I was kayaking near home - I was compelled to reach out to the New England Aquarium to ask them about it, then visit for a personal meet and greet with one of their resident seals, then join so that I can go to the aquarium whenever I want (which is how I ended up with this book last Tuesday, in the gift shop). All because of wonder and a little excitement. I want to read more of Sy's adventures now. Thanks for the ever so personal stories of not just the octopuses, but the people and fellow aquarium residents, too. "

She not only fills this book with facts about sea life and descriptions of the personalities of the octopuses she knows, but also just the general comraderie of being an aquarium groupie. She makes me want to go and hang out with fishes more often. There's so much that we're still learning about our fellow creatures, so much to be explored. This is just a thoroughly enjoyable read that has rekindled my love for the world below the water line.More thoughts on this book here: http://www.steepedinscience.com/2015/...I got a copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley."

When the marine biologist then confides that she too had tried to commit suicide, the author's response is to point to a nearby octopus in a tank and say in bewilderment ""You would leave THIS?!""Because apparently in this author's mind the simple task of working with an octopus should cancel out the impulse to self-extinction. Any other employment or life circumstances? No, then suicide makes sense.So I think I've had just about enough of this deranged author's masturbatory prose-poetry non-scientific cephalopod rants."

189,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1373260-jaclyn-day,4,"This was a wonderful, captivating peek into the mysteries of the natural world. If you love the ocean and the creatures that inhabit it, you’ll feel an instant commiseration with Montgomery’s wonder at exploring octopuses in their natural habitats and in her home base aquarium in Boston. (The correct plural is octopuses, not octopi, she explains.) The book is fascinating. More of a memoir than a scientific study, but that makes it no less educational. But (and this is a big “but”), one huge faulty area is in Montgomery’s refusal to address the plight of octopus captivity and the aquarium octopus trade that she even participates in at one point. Octopuses are plucked from the ocean at just the right age and transported into small containers with their own fecal matter to whichever aquarium puts out an APB. There, they’re left to grow old--in a matter of years, octopuses don’t often live past 5--tending to unfertilized eggs (they’re rarely mated), growing larger in barrels ill-suited to their size, and getting increasingly bored and in need of stimuli. This is all from Montgomery’s book, mind you. It’s talked about lightly or skimmed over in favor of a safer topic. At one point, Montgomery argues that aquarium capture and captivity of octopuses is necessary to protect the species and educate the general public, and it’s a decent argument under certain circumstances. There are many aquariums, including the New England Aquarium, doing wonderful things for education and conservation. But, while education is important, Montgomery’s connection to the aquarium was the lifeline of her book--this book--and the captivity topic feels purposefully ignored in favor of her continued VIP access to Boston's prized octopuses. So, how do you write a book about the potential consciousness of a highly intelligent, remarkable species while mostly observing it in a captive environment? An environment that is, she admits, often stressful to the animal? There’s no doubt that she and the other volunteers and professionals at the aquarium cared deeply about the animals she writes about: Athena, Octavia, Kali, Karma. I just couldn’t get over the void left by Montgomery’s blatant refusal to go near the ethical or moral implications of captivity where her octopus consciousness questions were concerned. Could Montgomery have written the same book by observing octopuses living in their natural ocean habitats? I think so. She does do some of this, but she’s not a natural ocean swimmer or skilled diver (as she notes). Her open ocean dives seem more disappointing to her than illuminating to her understanding of the species. On the diving trips, she expresses that she can’t wait to get back to the aquarium and her friends there. She can’t wait to see the captive octopuses that can’t hide in their dens, or camouflage their escape route. She can’t wait to visit with the ones that are so bored that they may have no option but to interact with humans--for the sake of their food, their sanity, their survival. Montgomery expresses frequent awe at her interactions with the creatures. She swears they remember people. She talks about them embracing her arms, not roughly or aggressively, but in a warm, friendly greeting. That anthropomorphizing compromises her objectivity about what she’s writing about and the circumstances that she’s keeping quiet about in order to do so. This is a pretty intense critique, but to be clear--I read this book fast, in less than a few hours. I did love it, or wanted to. I loved the idea of it. I loved the science, the insight into such beautiful, weird, alien creatures. That only made it all the harder when I tried to reconcile Montgomery’s search for octopus consciousness with her willful ignorance--at least in the book--of the captive circumstances that made a good portion of her writing possible. I’d like to read a follow-up from her someday. I hope she writes it."

Its important for me to get swept up in it somehow, to get a feeling or interest in the story. This one did - I got involved with it. I looked forward to picking it up. It wasn't just a slog through to learn something. I felt it. And it was set up to be a hard sell - why? Because why I love my dog dearly, and have been raised with animals/pets, I am not one for strange animals, or anything slippery. In fact one would go as far as to say that I outright dislike and have an anathema for ocean animals, underwater animals. To say - not my thing - would be an understatement. I live in Boston, my children have had an opportunity, I hope more than one to visit our amazing aquarium. I never have gone, wouldn't ever, and not in any city. I am not proud of this. Its an embarrassment to share I don't care for underwater animals. Its a funny thing I actually hope my children don't find out, or make too much of. Scuba, snorkeling, deep sea diving. I'll be on the beach reading. Luckily enough, no one else in the family has shown an interest. We prefer to walk the tide, and my sons would be playing volleyball, or football, or frisbee or something. Maybe my husband and I might have playing cards on a sandy blanket. The underwater world holds zero appeal for me.But this book? I actually really enjoyed it, and I'm glad I read it. That says a lot, because its non-fiction, and on a topic seriously not likely to draw me. But, consciousness, relationship, love, that is my thing. The thing that draws me every time. I actually truly loved reading this book. I also (in my own distanced way) fell in love with Octavia, Kali, Karma, and the first one - the beautiful Octopus our author fell in love with first. Funny, I actually throughout the book had to remind myself she was female. I kept picturing her male, and there was nothing remotely male about her. I loved thinking about how animals protect their young instinctively, even though there is nothing to protect, and how they turn to their relationships at various stages in their lives. I loved the mating scene, it was strange and beautiful. I loved how this Octopus moved various special needs children and adults, an elderly couple, a man losing his wife, and a whole family of people, tied through the love of these octopuses. (Funny, I thought it was octopi too…). Now, another plug for PBT - I wouldn't have really ever read this book, though I noticed it when it went around. But it felt clear to me that I would, when animals became the November tag. I'm very glad I had the opportunity. I really feel like I am a better person for having learned something, felt, and experienced these four friends, and what they meant and what they have taught and brought us. I'm a little proud of Boston, too. Maybe find a way to send my six year old soon? Seriously, I am grateful for the opportunity.What am I reading next? Well I am taking a brief six week course on three plays of Tennessee Williams, so I am about to review the Glass Menagerie, and this week I will be re-reading A Streetcar named Desire. Also will be starting the Zookeepers Wife. On Deck for November is the Muse, which I checked out of the library but haven't gotten to, To the Bright Edge of the World, which for some odd reason scares me a little, despite its glowing reviews. And the November read for Jewish Book Club - the Pinch. Is that right? Then there is for my own book club, my friends' book on Integrative Music Therapy - a Journey of Healing, so no November ""flurry"" for me. That's where I'm at. Octopus goes back to the library. So does Glass Menagerie, Pig Meets Pug, and on we go. "
191,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,5,"Is it possible to weep for an octopus' death?Sy Montgomery combines scientific inquiry with her own moving meditations on the purpose of life, the perception of time, and the possibilities of connection in this book. Her subject is the giant Pacific octopus, and she relates her intimate interactions with four of them, residents of the New England Aquarium in Boston. When she touches her first, an octopus named Athena, she is surprised.  “...[H]er head is silky and softer than custard. Her skin is flecked with ruby and silver, a night sky reflected in the wine-dark sea. As I stroke her with my fingertips, her skin goes white beneath my touch. White is the color of a relaxed octopus....” (Location 104) Montgomery's book is not a didactic scientific tome. Instead, she intersperses fascinating facts into a lyrical narrative of discovery. Octopuses have more neurons than a rat. The neurons are distributed throughout the tentacles. Motor control ranges from delicate exploration to a crushing grip. Each sucker can flex like a gentle kiss or pinch like a vice. The octopus smells and tastes through its skin. Montgomery notices Athena looking at her face while tasting her arms. Should she allow Athena to taste her face? Bill Murphy, senior aquarist, responds with a decisive “No.” The suckers could easily pull her eye out.An octopus named Octavia demonstrates remarkable camouflage abilities. Three layers of skin comprised of three types of cells enable shifts to multiple colors, patterns and textures, a canvas of liquid iridescence.This book is special, however, because Montgomery encounters so many examples of octopus personality: curiosity, memory, preferences, trust, playfulness, intelligence, and even deception. There is something tragic about an animal so like us in many ways having such a short lifespan — only 3-4 years. It lives a solitary life, hoarding its secrets. When born it is the size of a grain of rice. It grows, explores, learns, breeds and then, its life cycle completed, it becomes lethargic, senescent and dies. Montgomery's writing arouses a feeling of profound awe.The parallel story Montgomery tells is of the dedicated staff that attends these creatures. Montgomery describes them with such vividness that you feel you know them enough to greet them on the street. In the outside world their interests and individuality make them anomalies; in the aquarium they are part of a tight empathetic family. The memories they share with these octopuses are stored like a string of precious pearls. One interviewee likens the octopuses, caught from the wild, as ambassadors from their world to ours. It's an apt metaphor. Montgomery describes numerous occasions when adults as well as children are converted from uninvolved gawkers to sympathetic and curious admirers. The octopuses, in turn, seem curious about both the visitors and their environs, designed with painstaking attention to naturalism and security in mind. In addition, one of the most challenging tasks is designing puzzles to stave off octopus boredom. Would the octopus choose to give up its freedom to experience these unknown adventures? Of course, to even ask such a question is to lapse into anthropomorphism. Yet, I like to think that these octopuses live and die without regrets. So, returning to my opening question, if we weep, it is perhaps not from grief over the octopus as much as grief over the unfathomable mystery of life for all of us."
192,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361541-barb-middleton,4,"This narrative nonfiction story reveals the author's scientific study, care, and love of octopuses mainly at the New England aquarium. Her passion for the invertebrates is obvious and drew me into the story from the get-go. I learned more than I ever thought about how difficult it is to transfer and keep these Houdini-like creatures in their cages, as well as, their range of colors, ability to play, and unique senses and neurons that are in their arms. Some passages are very scientific but the density is lightened by the author's narration making for good pacing most of the time. The end narrative text started to sound a bit repetitive with the diving in the wild and the octopuses getting old and dying as it happens several times throughout the text, but overall it is an excellent book. If you like science and animals then I recommend it. The author's passion for animals shows in that she tries to prove that the intelligent octopus creature has a soul. I thought the argument as a whole in the book weak. She does mention philosophers and different theories. They are spread throughout the book so none of it is overwhelming and she recognizes that to define a soul is really not possible; that some say it is an inner being that gives people senses and intelligence, others it gives life meaning and purpose. ""Perhaps none of these definitions is true. Perhaps all of them are. But I am certain of one thing as I sit in my pew: If I have a soul-and I think I do-an octopus has a soul, too."" Her stance is clear from the start, but she doesn't get into the different theories much. Maybe that is a good thing considering the target audience.Her writing reminded me of ""The Secret Garden"" where Colin is so moved by nature that he is miraculously healed in his soul and stands up to recite the Doxology. The author is so moved by octopuses that her emotional descriptions show a passion that is deeply felt: ""Perhaps, I muse, this is the pace at which the Creator thinks, in the weighty, graceful, liquid manner-like blood flows, not like synapses fire."" She has terrific writing with plenty of similes and metaphors to help readers picture the creatures and their environment in the aquarium or wild.The book does explain mating and covers the loss of beloved animals either as pets or from an aquarium's caretaker's perspective. I learned more about scuba diving than I expected and she describes the tight friendship she developed from working at the aquarium and diving. These friendships add a human element that is a nice balance to the scientific narrative. I did not know anything about octopuses before reading this book and a knowledgeable reader might have a completely different reading experience than me. "
193,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,4,"‘The Soul of an Octopus’ is a charming, very readable memoir of encounters with octopodes. The author became fascinated with these mysterious creatures after getting to know one at an aquarium. She describes her octo-pals with such love that it’s hard not to want to meet one yourself once you’ve finished the book. I previously knew very little about octopodes, so was fascinated by their oddness. For example, I learned that octopus neurons are distributed among their tentacles, which appear genuinely able to think for themselves. A key theme of the book is the intelligence of octopodes and how difficult it is to compare with mammalian conceptions thereof. Montgomery makes a strong case that each octopus she has known had a distinctive personality and formed a bond with her.On the other hand, I found the chapters in which Montgomery learns to scuba dive a little hair-raising, as personally I fear and distrust deep water. (As an aside, I once tried out a friend’s VR goggles and explored a simulated ocean floor. That was pretty great - if it was made more interactive, what a lovely way to come close to ocean life without disturbing ecosystems or risking your personal safety.) Back at the aquarium, her account of the group of friends meeting weekly to spend time with an octopus was poignant and sweet. There are no great insights into consciousness to be found in this book, as it is more personal than scientific. Montgomery isn’t trying to give you the full history and biology of octopodes, she’s sharing portraits, anecdotes, and appealing facts. The writing is engaging and I enjoyed being reminded both of how little is known about ocean fauna and of the strong bonds that humans can form with other creatures. I’ve also been inspired to look up my nearest aquarium. "
194,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565471-rift-vegan,3,"Octopuses are fascinating, but I don't know much about them, other than a couple of PBS nature shows. This was a great first book for me, a little peek into someone else's obsession. The things I learned made me hungry for more... Octopuses are actually colour blind, except they can probably experience colour in their tentacles (rather than their eyes)!! And all their arms have neural connections... So interesting to think about having brains spread out all over your body!I would have rated this 4 stars out of 5, except for the sad fact that Montgomery barely touched the surface of the ethics of kidnapping and imprisoning such intelligent creatures. Granted, we know a lot more about octopuses because scientists observe them and experiment with them in captive situations. But I don't believe the end justifies the means. For just a couple paragraphs, she talks to a man who does the actual kidnapping and asks him if he thinks it's ethical. (ha, the truism by Upton Sinclair: It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.) He says the octopuses that he kidnaps and sells to zoos are ambassadors of the species, and people would not care about their fate in the wild if they don't get to see them in zoos. uh huh. Poor Kali, who knew the freedom of the entire ocean was kept in a barrel for months before she escaped and died. And it sounded like she may have died on purpose, but that was not addressed in the book at all. Sad, very sad.So, yes, mixed feelings about this book. And that's okay! It's great to think about things like this and work out my own opinions! "
195,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44349312-jeff,1,"Just how many times can Montgomery describe putting arms into a tank to have an octopus suck on them? Read this book to find out. It's clear over and over again that an octopus's senses differ from our own, yet Montgomery insists on waxing poetic about her own anthropomorphic speculations of what the octopus is ""feeling"" or ""thinking"" at the very moment it puts its many suckers on human arms. I think I was fooled by the popularity of this book, thinking that I would find something more about actual scientific research indicating that an octopus can readily identify ""self,"" but instead I was left with a broken record of the lives and deaths of short-lived cephalopods and the ad nauseam mourning of slightly deranged caretakers and onlookers afterward. Sprinkle in some story about SCUBA lessons and diving off Cozumel and bingo, you've transformed what should be a brief essay into a best selling book. Can we forge connections with animals? Sure. Does signing a ""Declaration of Consciousness"" prove that animals have a conscious? I respond with an emphatic ""NO!"" Like a typical biographer, Montgomery elevates the octopus on a pedestal and skirts the edge of implying that the animal might possibly be the pinnacle of conscious existence. This could (and should) have remained an essay and it would have been just fine. "
196,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21152376-jen,4,"4 stars + ♡Full review to follow with videos on our blog this week.Who knew that Octopuses could be so fascinating? Montgomery explores the wonderful world of octopuses in this touching non-fiction that is half memoir and half expose on these smart and personable ocean creatures.I enjoyed the book very much and found it surprisingly interesting. I learned a lot of interesting facts about octopus that I would have never guessed prior to reading the book (I'll let you discover those facts for yourself). Her writing style is very engaging and she is able to impart a lot of knowledge while making it seem like she is just telling you a story. This book will be a favorite but I didn't give it 5 stars for a few reasons. First, I think she often attributes thoughts, emotions and intentions to the octopuses at times. While I don't disagree that they have all those things, I question her ability to seem to attribute the exact emotion/thought/intention in certain instances. Second, I have to admit that it bothered me that someone who loved them so much (enough to write a whole book on them) would contemplate buying one to keep as a pet. "
197,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4604943-sarai,3,"3.5 StarsThis book focuses on Montgomery's experiences while conducting research on octopuses and their emotional intelligence. She meets various researchers and staff from the New England aquarium, and dives to observe octopuses in their natural habitat. Throughout the book, she shares interesting facts about octopuses, fish, and other mammals and will back some of these up with snippets of research. Most of the book reads like a memoir. Montgomery introduces the people she meets, shares personal interactions with various octopuses in the aquarium, and describes the connection she feels to them and to the staff. While I enjoyed the writing style very much--it reads like she's having coffee with you and sharing her cool experiences--I wanted more. I felt like Montgomery had just as many questions as I did, and not many answers. This book made me want to pick up another book on octopuses, fish, etc. with more cool facts backed by research. Overall it's a very enjoyable book, and I would recommend it to anyone who would maybe shy away from reading a scientific book but loves a good memoir--this would be a great choice, as it blends both genres into a fun, quick read."

She had me hooked from the start when she informs the reader the plural of Octopus is Octopuses not Octopi. I thought to myself, what else don't I know about these 8 legged monsters...Well I quickly discovered they are not monsters and in fact appear to be intelligent and sensitive creatures who recognize individual people in an aquarium setting and will display actions indicating if they love or hate you!Before reading The Soul of an Octopus all I really knew about them was they had 8 tentacles and could squeeze themselves into small jars. I never imagined I would be captivated as I was by Sy's experiences. I laughed and cried right along with her. Half way through I was telling my boyfriend if I had read this book 20 years ago I probably would have gone to school to study octopuses. I look forward to the next time I find myself at an aquarium- the octopus will be my first stop for sure!! I have learned never dismiss the simplest creature because there is so much more than meets the eye!"

Didn't realise just how interesting it would be, there were so many intriguing facts and anecdotes about octopuses, everything from their anatomy to their behaviour to their individual personalities were mentioned. The way the author wrote about the octopuses she encountered made them seem almost impossible and mythical, it was like reading about another world at times. The most engrossing parts were definitely the author's interactions with the octopuses at the aquarium she saw day in and day out, it was fascinating getting updates on Athena, Octavia, and Kali. I wasn't so keen on the author's time trying to scuba dive or the other parts which weren't really focused on octopuses."

How arrogant we have been. This is one amazing book, well researched yet charming in its narrative, and thanks to Sy Montgomery, I am thoroughly smitten by these wonderful animals. I've always felt that at least the dogs and cats I've known in my life share these characteristics with me, but now I find out that even cephalopods experience all of these traits, too. And to think, we eat these creatures. Not me, because I'm quickly becoming a vegetarian (this book hastened the process). Read it. You will be gobsmacked by nature."
201,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22941942-amy-morgan,5,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I learned so many things about octopuses and am now completely fascinated by them. I loved how easy to read this story was and how beautifully the author described her interactions with these unique creatures. You could really feel the love she felt for them and the other creatures in the aquarium just flowing off the pages. Getting to know an octopus is definitely on my bucket list now!

Sy Montgomery makes a compelling case that the octopus is a playful, complex, intelligent, social, and empathetic animal, and she does it through the lens of her own personal and life affirming experiences with octopuses. (We learn on practically the first page that the proper plural for octopus is not octopi -- but rather ""octopuses"" in keeping with the word's Greek origins.) I was hoping for more science mixed in with the memoir and personal anecdotes, but my interest in octopuses has been expanded and I'll seek out more information from the list of references in the book."

209,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,4,"So teetering between a 3 and a 4 on this book, but I think on all the typical qualities on which I assess a book, it deserves the 4. Sy Montgomery finds an engaging way to write more than 200 pages about the neurobiology of the octopus that I think would entertain most readers. If you have even rudimentary interest in the natural world, this book is very accessible, and Montgomery's enthusiasm about animals in general and octopuses in general shines through.The majority of the book focuses on three octopuses that come through the aquarium in Boston, Massachusetts. Montgomery's habit of guessing at the emotional life of animals annoyed me a bit in The Good Good Pig: The Extraordinary Life of Christopher Hogwood, and somehow is worse when it comes to a non-mammal, but at the same time, I can't fault her completely because it is part of what makes the book entertaining. The animals seem so relatable that the reader truly cares what happens to them. And that brings me to my giant frustration, not so much with the book, but with the tale of the octopuses in the aquarium.The rest of this review truly is a spoiler, but what really caused me to knock stars off of this book is some hypocrisy that I just couldn't bring myself to ignore. So rare for me because normally I take stories at face value and focus on the writing, the entertainment, and the character development - - but this is non-fiction, so it's basically impossible to completely banish the thoughts I had while reading it. And I don't even share the worst of it below.(view spoiler)[ So, I really have a problem with how these animals were handled, and I'm certainly no animal rights activist. The whole book posits how intelligent the octopuses are and even imbues them with consciousness and to some degree, emotions. So, in what world does their process for handling these creatures make any sense. The oldest octopus, Octavia, is in a decent tank, and she's currently healthy, but reaching the end of her life span. So the Aquarium obtains a new octopus, Kali. Kali is relegated to a 50 gallon barrel (my oil tank in my house is 6 times the size). And every time the barrel is opened, she eagerly tries to explore outside it suggesting she's bored at best. Later, they determine she tried to chew her way out of it. But well before that point, it's quite clear that if you really believe the animal is intelligent then a barrel is no place for it. At first, I rationalized this to myself thinking ""well, perhaps the lead time for getting a new octopus is super long so they don't want to wait until Octavia dies because they won't have a replacement for their exhibit, and I get how that might not be optimal."" Um. Yeah. No. They get a third octopus in 8 days. Which also tries to eat its way out of the barrel. So in my mind, this book is pretty much an exercise in complete hypocrisy . . .if you truly believe that this animal is as intelligent and emotional as they make it out to be, you don't treat it like this and then get all excited that it seems happy when you open the barrel to visit with it.  (hide spoiler)]Bottom line, read this one if you want to learn about octopuses, but just be forewarned that you may not really like the author much after you finish it."
210,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6840223-erika,1,"I was still on an ocean hangover from a trip to Coronado when I bought this book. The ocean fascinates me and I'm particularly intrigued by jellyfish and octopus. It should be noted that the author of his book, Sy Montgomery, is a seasoned writer, investigative explorer, and recipient of lifetime achievement awards from the Humane Society. I believe her to be a caring and conscientious animal lover who holds animals' best interests in high regard--BUT, the her book is plagued with many instances of overreach. Montgomery documents her research of four octopuses housed at the New England Aquarium. Facts and statistics are dispersed throughout the book, one of which reveals that octopuses taste through their suckers and can literally taste your skin. On one visit to the aquarium, Montgomery brings a friend who is a smoker. The octopus reacts harshly to the friend and Montgomery wonders if it is because the octopus could taste the nicotine on her friend's skin. Another time, the author ponders whether or not the octopus will interact with her since she recently dyed her hair and perhaps the octopus wouldn't like the chemicals. Yet, she plunges her hands and arms in the water anyway. Montgomery herself even acknowledges the danger of this: ""[...] the skin of an octopus is one giant, fantastically sensitive mucous membrane. Steinhart Aquarium's assistant curator J. Charles Delbeek has likened cephalopod skin to the lining of the mammalian gut, with the result that 'levels of chemicals, nutrients, pollutants, etc. that are seemingly not toxic to other species and inverts can be toxic to cephs.'"" Moreover, the entire book revolves around Montgomery's quest to prove the consciousness of an octopus, yet a great portion of the book focuses on the suffocating handling of the octopus named Kali. Kali was procured from the wild by the aquarium and kept in a darkened barrel--void of stimulation, as well noted by the author--for approximately nine months because the aquarium did not have the space for her. (They needed her to replace an aging octopus already on display in the event that the older invertebrate died.) Eventually, it becomes evident that older (Octavia) and younger (Kali) must switch places. It's a risky move and one that proves fatal for Kali--she escaped through a two-inch hole in the lid of the tank. I have no doubt her staff and volunteers were devastated by her loss. However, when Wilson, one of her handlers says, ""'She had a day of freedom [in the new tank]. And that she got out tells you a phenomenally inquisitive and intelligent creature wanted her freedom. We know, clearly, it must have taken a lot of effort to get out.'"" And clearly, Wilson, it should tell you, Montgomery, and the aquarium that her ""freedom"" was not a tank. Captured at an approximate age of nine months, left in a barrel for nine more, only to die on the aquarium floor...disgraceful. Considering that only a few (like, less than five) out of 100,000 eggs survive to sexual maturity, it would appear imperative to allow these animals to flourish in the wild. Greatly disappointed with this book. "
211,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,4,"Octopus is a very intelligent animal with a radically different style of neurological and psychological organization from us. ""Is there a scene of self at all, a center of experience? If not, that involves imagination something so different from us it might be impossible to think of. .... If there is no central consciousness, does an octopus have a ""collaborative, cooperative, but distributed mind"", as Peter suggest? Does it have a sense of multiple selves? Does each arm literally have a mind of its own?"" The Soul of an Octopus includes many octopuses (not ocopi, by the way, as octopus is a Greek word, not a Latin word): Athena, Octavia, Kali and Karma, all of them lived in New England Aquarium in Boston.

My second favorite thing, that no one has mentioned, is the SECRET HIDDEN FLIP BOOK made up of the pictures on the bottom corners of the pages. Maybe I'm just a dork, but this gave me great joy. A whole book, so engagingly written, by a scientist who becomes taken with octopuses to such an extent that she gets SCUBA certified just to visit their world. It's how I felt two years ago when I came upon a harbor seal ""bottling"" in the ocean as I was kayaking near home - I was compelled to reach out to the New England Aquarium to ask them about it, then visit for a personal meet and greet with one of their resident seals, then join so that I can go to the aquarium whenever I want (which is how I ended up with this book last Tuesday, in the gift shop). All because of wonder and a little excitement. I want to read more of Sy's adventures now. Thanks for the ever so personal stories of not just the octopuses, but the people and fellow aquarium residents, too. "

She not only fills this book with facts about sea life and descriptions of the personalities of the octopuses she knows, but also just the general comraderie of being an aquarium groupie. She makes me want to go and hang out with fishes more often. There's so much that we're still learning about our fellow creatures, so much to be explored. This is just a thoroughly enjoyable read that has rekindled my love for the world below the water line.More thoughts on this book here: http://www.steepedinscience.com/2015/...I got a copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley."

When the marine biologist then confides that she too had tried to commit suicide, the author's response is to point to a nearby octopus in a tank and say in bewilderment ""You would leave THIS?!""Because apparently in this author's mind the simple task of working with an octopus should cancel out the impulse to self-extinction. Any other employment or life circumstances? No, then suicide makes sense.So I think I've had just about enough of this deranged author's masturbatory prose-poetry non-scientific cephalopod rants."

219,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1373260-jaclyn-day,4,"This was a wonderful, captivating peek into the mysteries of the natural world. If you love the ocean and the creatures that inhabit it, you’ll feel an instant commiseration with Montgomery’s wonder at exploring octopuses in their natural habitats and in her home base aquarium in Boston. (The correct plural is octopuses, not octopi, she explains.) The book is fascinating. More of a memoir than a scientific study, but that makes it no less educational. But (and this is a big “but”), one huge faulty area is in Montgomery’s refusal to address the plight of octopus captivity and the aquarium octopus trade that she even participates in at one point. Octopuses are plucked from the ocean at just the right age and transported into small containers with their own fecal matter to whichever aquarium puts out an APB. There, they’re left to grow old--in a matter of years, octopuses don’t often live past 5--tending to unfertilized eggs (they’re rarely mated), growing larger in barrels ill-suited to their size, and getting increasingly bored and in need of stimuli. This is all from Montgomery’s book, mind you. It’s talked about lightly or skimmed over in favor of a safer topic. At one point, Montgomery argues that aquarium capture and captivity of octopuses is necessary to protect the species and educate the general public, and it’s a decent argument under certain circumstances. There are many aquariums, including the New England Aquarium, doing wonderful things for education and conservation. But, while education is important, Montgomery’s connection to the aquarium was the lifeline of her book--this book--and the captivity topic feels purposefully ignored in favor of her continued VIP access to Boston's prized octopuses. So, how do you write a book about the potential consciousness of a highly intelligent, remarkable species while mostly observing it in a captive environment? An environment that is, she admits, often stressful to the animal? There’s no doubt that she and the other volunteers and professionals at the aquarium cared deeply about the animals she writes about: Athena, Octavia, Kali, Karma. I just couldn’t get over the void left by Montgomery’s blatant refusal to go near the ethical or moral implications of captivity where her octopus consciousness questions were concerned. Could Montgomery have written the same book by observing octopuses living in their natural ocean habitats? I think so. She does do some of this, but she’s not a natural ocean swimmer or skilled diver (as she notes). Her open ocean dives seem more disappointing to her than illuminating to her understanding of the species. On the diving trips, she expresses that she can’t wait to get back to the aquarium and her friends there. She can’t wait to see the captive octopuses that can’t hide in their dens, or camouflage their escape route. She can’t wait to visit with the ones that are so bored that they may have no option but to interact with humans--for the sake of their food, their sanity, their survival. Montgomery expresses frequent awe at her interactions with the creatures. She swears they remember people. She talks about them embracing her arms, not roughly or aggressively, but in a warm, friendly greeting. That anthropomorphizing compromises her objectivity about what she’s writing about and the circumstances that she’s keeping quiet about in order to do so. This is a pretty intense critique, but to be clear--I read this book fast, in less than a few hours. I did love it, or wanted to. I loved the idea of it. I loved the science, the insight into such beautiful, weird, alien creatures. That only made it all the harder when I tried to reconcile Montgomery’s search for octopus consciousness with her willful ignorance--at least in the book--of the captive circumstances that made a good portion of her writing possible. I’d like to read a follow-up from her someday. I hope she writes it."
220,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17792052-amy,4,"I don't always have an easy time with non-fiction, so I really try to choose it well. Its important for me to get swept up in it somehow, to get a feeling or interest in the story. This one did - I got involved with it. I looked forward to picking it up. It wasn't just a slog through to learn something. I felt it. And it was set up to be a hard sell - why? Because why I love my dog dearly, and have been raised with animals/pets, I am not one for strange animals, or anything slippery. In fact one would go as far as to say that I outright dislike and have an anathema for ocean animals, underwater animals. To say - not my thing - would be an understatement. I live in Boston, my children have had an opportunity, I hope more than one to visit our amazing aquarium. I never have gone, wouldn't ever, and not in any city. I am not proud of this. Its an embarrassment to share I don't care for underwater animals. Its a funny thing I actually hope my children don't find out, or make too much of. Scuba, snorkeling, deep sea diving. I'll be on the beach reading. Luckily enough, no one else in the family has shown an interest. We prefer to walk the tide, and my sons would be playing volleyball, or football, or frisbee or something. Maybe my husband and I might have playing cards on a sandy blanket. The underwater world holds zero appeal for me.But this book? I actually really enjoyed it, and I'm glad I read it. That says a lot, because its non-fiction, and on a topic seriously not likely to draw me. But, consciousness, relationship, love, that is my thing. The thing that draws me every time. I actually truly loved reading this book. I also (in my own distanced way) fell in love with Octavia, Kali, Karma, and the first one - the beautiful Octopus our author fell in love with first. Funny, I actually throughout the book had to remind myself she was female. I kept picturing her male, and there was nothing remotely male about her. I loved thinking about how animals protect their young instinctively, even though there is nothing to protect, and how they turn to their relationships at various stages in their lives. I loved the mating scene, it was strange and beautiful. I loved how this Octopus moved various special needs children and adults, an elderly couple, a man losing his wife, and a whole family of people, tied through the love of these octopuses. (Funny, I thought it was octopi too…). Now, another plug for PBT - I wouldn't have really ever read this book, though I noticed it when it went around. But it felt clear to me that I would, when animals became the November tag. I'm very glad I had the opportunity. I really feel like I am a better person for having learned something, felt, and experienced these four friends, and what they meant and what they have taught and brought us. I'm a little proud of Boston, too. Maybe find a way to send my six year old soon? Seriously, I am grateful for the opportunity.What am I reading next? Well I am taking a brief six week course on three plays of Tennessee Williams, so I am about to review the Glass Menagerie, and this week I will be re-reading A Streetcar named Desire. Also will be starting the Zookeepers Wife. On Deck for November is the Muse, which I checked out of the library but haven't gotten to, To the Bright Edge of the World, which for some odd reason scares me a little, despite its glowing reviews. And the November read for Jewish Book Club - the Pinch. Is that right? Then there is for my own book club, my friends' book on Integrative Music Therapy - a Journey of Healing, so no November ""flurry"" for me. That's where I'm at. Octopus goes back to the library. So does Glass Menagerie, Pig Meets Pug, and on we go. "
221,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,5,"Is it possible to weep for an octopus' death?Sy Montgomery combines scientific inquiry with her own moving meditations on the purpose of life, the perception of time, and the possibilities of connection in this book. Her subject is the giant Pacific octopus, and she relates her intimate interactions with four of them, residents of the New England Aquarium in Boston. When she touches her first, an octopus named Athena, she is surprised.  “...[H]er head is silky and softer than custard. Her skin is flecked with ruby and silver, a night sky reflected in the wine-dark sea. As I stroke her with my fingertips, her skin goes white beneath my touch. White is the color of a relaxed octopus....” (Location 104) Montgomery's book is not a didactic scientific tome. Instead, she intersperses fascinating facts into a lyrical narrative of discovery. Octopuses have more neurons than a rat. The neurons are distributed throughout the tentacles. Motor control ranges from delicate exploration to a crushing grip. Each sucker can flex like a gentle kiss or pinch like a vice. The octopus smells and tastes through its skin. Montgomery notices Athena looking at her face while tasting her arms. Should she allow Athena to taste her face? Bill Murphy, senior aquarist, responds with a decisive “No.” The suckers could easily pull her eye out.An octopus named Octavia demonstrates remarkable camouflage abilities. Three layers of skin comprised of three types of cells enable shifts to multiple colors, patterns and textures, a canvas of liquid iridescence.This book is special, however, because Montgomery encounters so many examples of octopus personality: curiosity, memory, preferences, trust, playfulness, intelligence, and even deception. There is something tragic about an animal so like us in many ways having such a short lifespan — only 3-4 years. It lives a solitary life, hoarding its secrets. When born it is the size of a grain of rice. It grows, explores, learns, breeds and then, its life cycle completed, it becomes lethargic, senescent and dies. Montgomery's writing arouses a feeling of profound awe.The parallel story Montgomery tells is of the dedicated staff that attends these creatures. Montgomery describes them with such vividness that you feel you know them enough to greet them on the street. In the outside world their interests and individuality make them anomalies; in the aquarium they are part of a tight empathetic family. The memories they share with these octopuses are stored like a string of precious pearls. One interviewee likens the octopuses, caught from the wild, as ambassadors from their world to ours. It's an apt metaphor. Montgomery describes numerous occasions when adults as well as children are converted from uninvolved gawkers to sympathetic and curious admirers. The octopuses, in turn, seem curious about both the visitors and their environs, designed with painstaking attention to naturalism and security in mind. In addition, one of the most challenging tasks is designing puzzles to stave off octopus boredom. Would the octopus choose to give up its freedom to experience these unknown adventures? Of course, to even ask such a question is to lapse into anthropomorphism. Yet, I like to think that these octopuses live and die without regrets. So, returning to my opening question, if we weep, it is perhaps not from grief over the octopus as much as grief over the unfathomable mystery of life for all of us."
222,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361541-barb-middleton,4,"This narrative nonfiction story reveals the author's scientific study, care, and love of octopuses mainly at the New England aquarium. Her passion for the invertebrates is obvious and drew me into the story from the get-go. I learned more than I ever thought about how difficult it is to transfer and keep these Houdini-like creatures in their cages, as well as, their range of colors, ability to play, and unique senses and neurons that are in their arms. Some passages are very scientific but the density is lightened by the author's narration making for good pacing most of the time. The end narrative text started to sound a bit repetitive with the diving in the wild and the octopuses getting old and dying as it happens several times throughout the text, but overall it is an excellent book. If you like science and animals then I recommend it. The author's passion for animals shows in that she tries to prove that the intelligent octopus creature has a soul. I thought the argument as a whole in the book weak. She does mention philosophers and different theories. They are spread throughout the book so none of it is overwhelming and she recognizes that to define a soul is really not possible; that some say it is an inner being that gives people senses and intelligence, others it gives life meaning and purpose. ""Perhaps none of these definitions is true. Perhaps all of them are. But I am certain of one thing as I sit in my pew: If I have a soul-and I think I do-an octopus has a soul, too."" Her stance is clear from the start, but she doesn't get into the different theories much. Maybe that is a good thing considering the target audience.Her writing reminded me of ""The Secret Garden"" where Colin is so moved by nature that he is miraculously healed in his soul and stands up to recite the Doxology. The author is so moved by octopuses that her emotional descriptions show a passion that is deeply felt: ""Perhaps, I muse, this is the pace at which the Creator thinks, in the weighty, graceful, liquid manner-like blood flows, not like synapses fire."" She has terrific writing with plenty of similes and metaphors to help readers picture the creatures and their environment in the aquarium or wild.The book does explain mating and covers the loss of beloved animals either as pets or from an aquarium's caretaker's perspective. I learned more about scuba diving than I expected and she describes the tight friendship she developed from working at the aquarium and diving. These friendships add a human element that is a nice balance to the scientific narrative. I did not know anything about octopuses before reading this book and a knowledgeable reader might have a completely different reading experience than me. "
223,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,4,"‘The Soul of an Octopus’ is a charming, very readable memoir of encounters with octopodes. The author became fascinated with these mysterious creatures after getting to know one at an aquarium. She describes her octo-pals with such love that it’s hard not to want to meet one yourself once you’ve finished the book. I previously knew very little about octopodes, so was fascinated by their oddness. For example, I learned that octopus neurons are distributed among their tentacles, which appear genuinely able to think for themselves. A key theme of the book is the intelligence of octopodes and how difficult it is to compare with mammalian conceptions thereof. Montgomery makes a strong case that each octopus she has known had a distinctive personality and formed a bond with her.On the other hand, I found the chapters in which Montgomery learns to scuba dive a little hair-raising, as personally I fear and distrust deep water. (As an aside, I once tried out a friend’s VR goggles and explored a simulated ocean floor. That was pretty great - if it was made more interactive, what a lovely way to come close to ocean life without disturbing ecosystems or risking your personal safety.) Back at the aquarium, her account of the group of friends meeting weekly to spend time with an octopus was poignant and sweet. There are no great insights into consciousness to be found in this book, as it is more personal than scientific. Montgomery isn’t trying to give you the full history and biology of octopodes, she’s sharing portraits, anecdotes, and appealing facts. The writing is engaging and I enjoyed being reminded both of how little is known about ocean fauna and of the strong bonds that humans can form with other creatures. I’ve also been inspired to look up my nearest aquarium. "
224,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565471-rift-vegan,3,"Octopuses are fascinating, but I don't know much about them, other than a couple of PBS nature shows. This was a great first book for me, a little peek into someone else's obsession. The things I learned made me hungry for more... Octopuses are actually colour blind, except they can probably experience colour in their tentacles (rather than their eyes)!! And all their arms have neural connections... So interesting to think about having brains spread out all over your body!I would have rated this 4 stars out of 5, except for the sad fact that Montgomery barely touched the surface of the ethics of kidnapping and imprisoning such intelligent creatures. Granted, we know a lot more about octopuses because scientists observe them and experiment with them in captive situations. But I don't believe the end justifies the means. For just a couple paragraphs, she talks to a man who does the actual kidnapping and asks him if he thinks it's ethical. (ha, the truism by Upton Sinclair: It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.) He says the octopuses that he kidnaps and sells to zoos are ambassadors of the species, and people would not care about their fate in the wild if they don't get to see them in zoos. uh huh. Poor Kali, who knew the freedom of the entire ocean was kept in a barrel for months before she escaped and died. And it sounded like she may have died on purpose, but that was not addressed in the book at all. Sad, very sad.So, yes, mixed feelings about this book. And that's okay! It's great to think about things like this and work out my own opinions! "
225,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44349312-jeff,1,"Just how many times can Montgomery describe putting arms into a tank to have an octopus suck on them? Read this book to find out. It's clear over and over again that an octopus's senses differ from our own, yet Montgomery insists on waxing poetic about her own anthropomorphic speculations of what the octopus is ""feeling"" or ""thinking"" at the very moment it puts its many suckers on human arms. I think I was fooled by the popularity of this book, thinking that I would find something more about actual scientific research indicating that an octopus can readily identify ""self,"" but instead I was left with a broken record of the lives and deaths of short-lived cephalopods and the ad nauseam mourning of slightly deranged caretakers and onlookers afterward. Sprinkle in some story about SCUBA lessons and diving off Cozumel and bingo, you've transformed what should be a brief essay into a best selling book. Can we forge connections with animals? Sure. Does signing a ""Declaration of Consciousness"" prove that animals have a conscious? I respond with an emphatic ""NO!"" Like a typical biographer, Montgomery elevates the octopus on a pedestal and skirts the edge of implying that the animal might possibly be the pinnacle of conscious existence. This could (and should) have remained an essay and it would have been just fine. "

Montgomery explores the wonderful world of octopuses in this touching non-fiction that is half memoir and half expose on these smart and personable ocean creatures.I enjoyed the book very much and found it surprisingly interesting. I learned a lot of interesting facts about octopus that I would have never guessed prior to reading the book (I'll let you discover those facts for yourself). Her writing style is very engaging and she is able to impart a lot of knowledge while making it seem like she is just telling you a story. This book will be a favorite but I didn't give it 5 stars for a few reasons. First, I think she often attributes thoughts, emotions and intentions to the octopuses at times. While I don't disagree that they have all those things, I question her ability to seem to attribute the exact emotion/thought/intention in certain instances. Second, I have to admit that it bothered me that someone who loved them so much (enough to write a whole book on them) would contemplate buying one to keep as a pet. "
227,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4604943-sarai,3,"3.5 StarsThis book focuses on Montgomery's experiences while conducting research on octopuses and their emotional intelligence. She meets various researchers and staff from the New England aquarium, and dives to observe octopuses in their natural habitat. Throughout the book, she shares interesting facts about octopuses, fish, and other mammals and will back some of these up with snippets of research. Most of the book reads like a memoir. Montgomery introduces the people she meets, shares personal interactions with various octopuses in the aquarium, and describes the connection she feels to them and to the staff. While I enjoyed the writing style very much--it reads like she's having coffee with you and sharing her cool experiences--I wanted more. I felt like Montgomery had just as many questions as I did, and not many answers. This book made me want to pick up another book on octopuses, fish, etc. with more cool facts backed by research. Overall it's a very enjoyable book, and I would recommend it to anyone who would maybe shy away from reading a scientific book but loves a good memoir--this would be a great choice, as it blends both genres into a fun, quick read."

She had me hooked from the start when she informs the reader the plural of Octopus is Octopuses not Octopi. I thought to myself, what else don't I know about these 8 legged monsters...Well I quickly discovered they are not monsters and in fact appear to be intelligent and sensitive creatures who recognize individual people in an aquarium setting and will display actions indicating if they love or hate you!Before reading The Soul of an Octopus all I really knew about them was they had 8 tentacles and could squeeze themselves into small jars. I never imagined I would be captivated as I was by Sy's experiences. I laughed and cried right along with her. Half way through I was telling my boyfriend if I had read this book 20 years ago I probably would have gone to school to study octopuses. I look forward to the next time I find myself at an aquarium- the octopus will be my first stop for sure!!

Didn't realise just how interesting it would be, there were so many intriguing facts and anecdotes about octopuses, everything from their anatomy to their behaviour to their individual personalities were mentioned. The way the author wrote about the octopuses she encountered made them seem almost impossible and mythical, it was like reading about another world at times. The most engrossing parts were definitely the author's interactions with the octopuses at the aquarium she saw day in and day out, it was fascinating getting updates on Athena, Octavia, and Kali. I wasn't so keen on the author's time trying to scuba dive or the other parts which weren't really focused on octopuses."

How arrogant we have been. This is one amazing book, well researched yet charming in its narrative, and thanks to Sy Montgomery, I am thoroughly smitten by these wonderful animals. I've always felt that at least the dogs and cats I've known in my life share these characteristics with me, but now I find out that even cephalopods experience all of these traits, too. And to think, we eat these creatures. Not me, because I'm quickly becoming a vegetarian (this book hastened the process). Read it. You will be gobsmacked by nature."

Sy Montgomery makes a compelling case that the octopus is a playful, complex, intelligent, social, and empathetic animal, and she does it through the lens of her own personal and life affirming experiences with octopuses. (We learn on practically the first page that the proper plural for octopus is not octopi -- but rather ""octopuses"" in keeping with the word's Greek origins.) I was hoping for more science mixed in with the memoir and personal anecdotes, but my interest in octopuses has been expanded and I'll seek out more information from the list of references in the book."

239,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,4,"So teetering between a 3 and a 4 on this book, but I think on all the typical qualities on which I assess a book, it deserves the 4. Sy Montgomery finds an engaging way to write more than 200 pages about the neurobiology of the octopus that I think would entertain most readers. If you have even rudimentary interest in the natural world, this book is very accessible, and Montgomery's enthusiasm about animals in general and octopuses in general shines through.The majority of the book focuses on three octopuses that come through the aquarium in Boston, Massachusetts. Montgomery's habit of guessing at the emotional life of animals annoyed me a bit in The Good Good Pig: The Extraordinary Life of Christopher Hogwood, and somehow is worse when it comes to a non-mammal, but at the same time, I can't fault her completely because it is part of what makes the book entertaining. The animals seem so relatable that the reader truly cares what happens to them. And that brings me to my giant frustration, not so much with the book, but with the tale of the octopuses in the aquarium.The rest of this review truly is a spoiler, but what really caused me to knock stars off of this book is some hypocrisy that I just couldn't bring myself to ignore. So rare for me because normally I take stories at face value and focus on the writing, the entertainment, and the character development - - but this is non-fiction, so it's basically impossible to completely banish the thoughts I had while reading it. And I don't even share the worst of it below.(view spoiler)[ So, I really have a problem with how these animals were handled, and I'm certainly no animal rights activist. The whole book posits how intelligent the octopuses are and even imbues them with consciousness and to some degree, emotions. So, in what world does their process for handling these creatures make any sense. The oldest octopus, Octavia, is in a decent tank, and she's currently healthy, but reaching the end of her life span. So the Aquarium obtains a new octopus, Kali. Kali is relegated to a 50 gallon barrel (my oil tank in my house is 6 times the size). And every time the barrel is opened, she eagerly tries to explore outside it suggesting she's bored at best. Later, they determine she tried to chew her way out of it. But well before that point, it's quite clear that if you really believe the animal is intelligent then a barrel is no place for it. At first, I rationalized this to myself thinking ""well, perhaps the lead time for getting a new octopus is super long so they don't want to wait until Octavia dies because they won't have a replacement for their exhibit, and I get how that might not be optimal."" Um. Yeah. No. They get a third octopus in 8 days. Which also tries to eat its way out of the barrel. So in my mind, this book is pretty much an exercise in complete hypocrisy . . .if you truly believe that this animal is as intelligent and emotional as they make it out to be, you don't treat it like this and then get all excited that it seems happy when you open the barrel to visit with it.  (hide spoiler)]Bottom line, read this one if you want to learn about octopuses, but just be forewarned that you may not really like the author much after you finish it."
240,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6840223-erika,1,"I was still on an ocean hangover from a trip to Coronado when I bought this book. The ocean fascinates me and I'm particularly intrigued by jellyfish and octopus. It should be noted that the author of his book, Sy Montgomery, is a seasoned writer, investigative explorer, and recipient of lifetime achievement awards from the Humane Society. I believe her to be a caring and conscientious animal lover who holds animals' best interests in high regard--BUT, the her book is plagued with many instances of overreach. Montgomery documents her research of four octopuses housed at the New England Aquarium. Facts and statistics are dispersed throughout the book, one of which reveals that octopuses taste through their suckers and can literally taste your skin. On one visit to the aquarium, Montgomery brings a friend who is a smoker. The octopus reacts harshly to the friend and Montgomery wonders if it is because the octopus could taste the nicotine on her friend's skin. Another time, the author ponders whether or not the octopus will interact with her since she recently dyed her hair and perhaps the octopus wouldn't like the chemicals. Yet, she plunges her hands and arms in the water anyway. Montgomery herself even acknowledges the danger of this: ""[...] the skin of an octopus is one giant, fantastically sensitive mucous membrane. Steinhart Aquarium's assistant curator J. Charles Delbeek has likened cephalopod skin to the lining of the mammalian gut, with the result that 'levels of chemicals, nutrients, pollutants, etc. that are seemingly not toxic to other species and inverts can be toxic to cephs.'"" Moreover, the entire book revolves around Montgomery's quest to prove the consciousness of an octopus, yet a great portion of the book focuses on the suffocating handling of the octopus named Kali. Kali was procured from the wild by the aquarium and kept in a darkened barrel--void of stimulation, as well noted by the author--for approximately nine months because the aquarium did not have the space for her. (They needed her to replace an aging octopus already on display in the event that the older invertebrate died.) Eventually, it becomes evident that older (Octavia) and younger (Kali) must switch places. It's a risky move and one that proves fatal for Kali--she escaped through a two-inch hole in the lid of the tank. I have no doubt her staff and volunteers were devastated by her loss. However, when Wilson, one of her handlers says, ""'She had a day of freedom [in the new tank]. And that she got out tells you a phenomenally inquisitive and intelligent creature wanted her freedom. We know, clearly, it must have taken a lot of effort to get out.'"" And clearly, Wilson, it should tell you, Montgomery, and the aquarium that her ""freedom"" was not a tank. Captured at an approximate age of nine months, left in a barrel for nine more, only to die on the aquarium floor...disgraceful. Considering that only a few (like, less than five) out of 100,000 eggs survive to sexual maturity, it would appear imperative to allow these animals to flourish in the wild. Greatly disappointed with this book. "

""Is there a scene of self at all, a center of experience? If not, that involves imagination something so different from us it might be impossible to think of. .... If there is no central consciousness, does an octopus have a ""collaborative, cooperative, but distributed mind"", as Peter suggest? Does it have a sense of multiple selves? Does each arm literally have a mind of its own?"" The Soul of an Octopus includes many octopuses (not ocopi, by the way, as octopus is a Greek word, not a Latin word): Athena, Octavia, Kali and Karma, all of them lived in New England Aquarium in Boston. Sy Montgomery is a science journalist. The book is a collection of the author's encounter with these octopuses in captivity, as well as octopuses in the wild (Caribbean and Pacific Ocean in particular). ""The ocean, for me, is what LSD was to Timothy Leary. "" I never tried LSD (or any other drugs), but I tend to agree with the author: the wondrous and capacious nature provides endless possibilities to keep me wowed forever."

My second favorite thing, that no one has mentioned, is the SECRET HIDDEN FLIP BOOK made up of the pictures on the bottom corners of the pages. Maybe I'm just a dork, but this gave me great joy. A whole book, so engagingly written, by a scientist who becomes taken with octopuses to such an extent that she gets SCUBA certified just to visit their world. It's how I felt two years ago when I came upon a harbor seal ""bottling"" in the ocean as I was kayaking near home - I was compelled to reach out to the New England Aquarium to ask them about it, then visit for a personal meet and greet with one of their resident seals, then join so that I can go to the aquarium whenever I want (which is how I ended up with this book last Tuesday, in the gift shop). All because of wonder and a little excitement. I want to read more of Sy's adventures now. Thanks for the ever so personal stories of not just the octopuses, but the people and fellow aquarium residents, too. "

She not only fills this book with facts about sea life and descriptions of the personalities of the octopuses she knows, but also just the general comraderie of being an aquarium groupie. She makes me want to go and hang out with fishes more often. There's so much that we're still learning about our fellow creatures, so much to be explored. This is just a thoroughly enjoyable read that has rekindled my love for the world below the water line.More thoughts on this book here: http://www.steepedinscience.com/2015/...I got a copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley."

When the marine biologist then confides that she too had tried to commit suicide, the author's response is to point to a nearby octopus in a tank and say in bewilderment ""You would leave THIS?!""Because apparently in this author's mind the simple task of working with an octopus should cancel out the impulse to self-extinction. Any other employment or life circumstances? No, then suicide makes sense.So I think I've had just about enough of this deranged author's masturbatory prose-poetry non-scientific cephalopod rants."

The essay is very moving and incredibly revealing about the otherness and being of an octopus as well as the connection that is possible between such a being and a human.While the essay felt distilled, rich, with no extra weight, the books feels chatty, padded, diluted."

249,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1373260-jaclyn-day,4,"This was a wonderful, captivating peek into the mysteries of the natural world. If you love the ocean and the creatures that inhabit it, you’ll feel an instant commiseration with Montgomery’s wonder at exploring octopuses in their natural habitats and in her home base aquarium in Boston. (The correct plural is octopuses, not octopi, she explains.) The book is fascinating. More of a memoir than a scientific study, but that makes it no less educational. But (and this is a big “but”), one huge faulty area is in Montgomery’s refusal to address the plight of octopus captivity and the aquarium octopus trade that she even participates in at one point. Octopuses are plucked from the ocean at just the right age and transported into small containers with their own fecal matter to whichever aquarium puts out an APB. There, they’re left to grow old--in a matter of years, octopuses don’t often live past 5--tending to unfertilized eggs (they’re rarely mated), growing larger in barrels ill-suited to their size, and getting increasingly bored and in need of stimuli. This is all from Montgomery’s book, mind you. It’s talked about lightly or skimmed over in favor of a safer topic. At one point, Montgomery argues that aquarium capture and captivity of octopuses is necessary to protect the species and educate the general public, and it’s a decent argument under certain circumstances. There are many aquariums, including the New England Aquarium, doing wonderful things for education and conservation. But, while education is important, Montgomery’s connection to the aquarium was the lifeline of her book--this book--and the captivity topic feels purposefully ignored in favor of her continued VIP access to Boston's prized octopuses. So, how do you write a book about the potential consciousness of a highly intelligent, remarkable species while mostly observing it in a captive environment? An environment that is, she admits, often stressful to the animal? There’s no doubt that she and the other volunteers and professionals at the aquarium cared deeply about the animals she writes about: Athena, Octavia, Kali, Karma. I just couldn’t get over the void left by Montgomery’s blatant refusal to go near the ethical or moral implications of captivity where her octopus consciousness questions were concerned. Could Montgomery have written the same book by observing octopuses living in their natural ocean habitats? I think so. She does do some of this, but she’s not a natural ocean swimmer or skilled diver (as she notes). Her open ocean dives seem more disappointing to her than illuminating to her understanding of the species. On the diving trips, she expresses that she can’t wait to get back to the aquarium and her friends there. She can’t wait to see the captive octopuses that can’t hide in their dens, or camouflage their escape route. She can’t wait to visit with the ones that are so bored that they may have no option but to interact with humans--for the sake of their food, their sanity, their survival. Montgomery expresses frequent awe at her interactions with the creatures. She swears they remember people. She talks about them embracing her arms, not roughly or aggressively, but in a warm, friendly greeting. That anthropomorphizing compromises her objectivity about what she’s writing about and the circumstances that she’s keeping quiet about in order to do so. This is a pretty intense critique, but to be clear--I read this book fast, in less than a few hours. I did love it, or wanted to. I loved the idea of it. I loved the science, the insight into such beautiful, weird, alien creatures. That only made it all the harder when I tried to reconcile Montgomery’s search for octopus consciousness with her willful ignorance--at least in the book--of the captive circumstances that made a good portion of her writing possible. I’d like to read a follow-up from her someday. I hope she writes it."
250,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17792052-amy,4,"I don't always have an easy time with non-fiction, so I really try to choose it well. Its important for me to get swept up in it somehow, to get a feeling or interest in the story. This one did - I got involved with it. I looked forward to picking it up. It wasn't just a slog through to learn something. I felt it. And it was set up to be a hard sell - why? Because why I love my dog dearly, and have been raised with animals/pets, I am not one for strange animals, or anything slippery. In fact one would go as far as to say that I outright dislike and have an anathema for ocean animals, underwater animals. To say - not my thing - would be an understatement. I live in Boston, my children have had an opportunity, I hope more than one to visit our amazing aquarium. I never have gone, wouldn't ever, and not in any city. I am not proud of this. Its an embarrassment to share I don't care for underwater animals. Its a funny thing I actually hope my children don't find out, or make too much of. Scuba, snorkeling, deep sea diving. I'll be on the beach reading. Luckily enough, no one else in the family has shown an interest. We prefer to walk the tide, and my sons would be playing volleyball, or football, or frisbee or something. Maybe my husband and I might have playing cards on a sandy blanket. The underwater world holds zero appeal for me.But this book? I actually really enjoyed it, and I'm glad I read it. That says a lot, because its non-fiction, and on a topic seriously not likely to draw me. But, consciousness, relationship, love, that is my thing. The thing that draws me every time. I actually truly loved reading this book. I also (in my own distanced way) fell in love with Octavia, Kali, Karma, and the first one - the beautiful Octopus our author fell in love with first. Funny, I actually throughout the book had to remind myself she was female. I kept picturing her male, and there was nothing remotely male about her. I loved thinking about how animals protect their young instinctively, even though there is nothing to protect, and how they turn to their relationships at various stages in their lives. I loved the mating scene, it was strange and beautiful. I loved how this Octopus moved various special needs children and adults, an elderly couple, a man losing his wife, and a whole family of people, tied through the love of these octopuses. (Funny, I thought it was octopi too…). Now, another plug for PBT - I wouldn't have really ever read this book, though I noticed it when it went around. But it felt clear to me that I would, when animals became the November tag. I'm very glad I had the opportunity. I really feel like I am a better person for having learned something, felt, and experienced these four friends, and what they meant and what they have taught and brought us. I'm a little proud of Boston, too. Maybe find a way to send my six year old soon? Seriously, I am grateful for the opportunity.What am I reading next? Well I am taking a brief six week course on three plays of Tennessee Williams, so I am about to review the Glass Menagerie, and this week I will be re-reading A Streetcar named Desire. Also will be starting the Zookeepers Wife. On Deck for November is the Muse, which I checked out of the library but haven't gotten to, To the Bright Edge of the World, which for some odd reason scares me a little, despite its glowing reviews. And the November read for Jewish Book Club - the Pinch. Is that right? Then there is for my own book club, my friends' book on Integrative Music Therapy - a Journey of Healing, so no November ""flurry"" for me. That's where I'm at. Octopus goes back to the library. So does Glass Menagerie, Pig Meets Pug, and on we go. "
251,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,5,"Is it possible to weep for an octopus' death?Sy Montgomery combines scientific inquiry with her own moving meditations on the purpose of life, the perception of time, and the possibilities of connection in this book. Her subject is the giant Pacific octopus, and she relates her intimate interactions with four of them, residents of the New England Aquarium in Boston. When she touches her first, an octopus named Athena, she is surprised.  “...[H]er head is silky and softer than custard. Her skin is flecked with ruby and silver, a night sky reflected in the wine-dark sea. As I stroke her with my fingertips, her skin goes white beneath my touch. White is the color of a relaxed octopus....” (Location 104) Montgomery's book is not a didactic scientific tome. Instead, she intersperses fascinating facts into a lyrical narrative of discovery. Octopuses have more neurons than a rat. The neurons are distributed throughout the tentacles. Motor control ranges from delicate exploration to a crushing grip. Each sucker can flex like a gentle kiss or pinch like a vice. The octopus smells and tastes through its skin. Montgomery notices Athena looking at her face while tasting her arms. Should she allow Athena to taste her face? Bill Murphy, senior aquarist, responds with a decisive “No.” The suckers could easily pull her eye out.An octopus named Octavia demonstrates remarkable camouflage abilities. Three layers of skin comprised of three types of cells enable shifts to multiple colors, patterns and textures, a canvas of liquid iridescence.This book is special, however, because Montgomery encounters so many examples of octopus personality: curiosity, memory, preferences, trust, playfulness, intelligence, and even deception. There is something tragic about an animal so like us in many ways having such a short lifespan — only 3-4 years. It lives a solitary life, hoarding its secrets. When born it is the size of a grain of rice. It grows, explores, learns, breeds and then, its life cycle completed, it becomes lethargic, senescent and dies. Montgomery's writing arouses a feeling of profound awe.The parallel story Montgomery tells is of the dedicated staff that attends these creatures. Montgomery describes them with such vividness that you feel you know them enough to greet them on the street. In the outside world their interests and individuality make them anomalies; in the aquarium they are part of a tight empathetic family. The memories they share with these octopuses are stored like a string of precious pearls. One interviewee likens the octopuses, caught from the wild, as ambassadors from their world to ours. It's an apt metaphor. Montgomery describes numerous occasions when adults as well as children are converted from uninvolved gawkers to sympathetic and curious admirers. The octopuses, in turn, seem curious about both the visitors and their environs, designed with painstaking attention to naturalism and security in mind. In addition, one of the most challenging tasks is designing puzzles to stave off octopus boredom. Would the octopus choose to give up its freedom to experience these unknown adventures? Of course, to even ask such a question is to lapse into anthropomorphism. Yet, I like to think that these octopuses live and die without regrets. So, returning to my opening question, if we weep, it is perhaps not from grief over the octopus as much as grief over the unfathomable mystery of life for all of us."
252,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361541-barb-middleton,4,"This narrative nonfiction story reveals the author's scientific study, care, and love of octopuses mainly at the New England aquarium. Her passion for the invertebrates is obvious and drew me into the story from the get-go. I learned more than I ever thought about how difficult it is to transfer and keep these Houdini-like creatures in their cages, as well as, their range of colors, ability to play, and unique senses and neurons that are in their arms. Some passages are very scientific but the density is lightened by the author's narration making for good pacing most of the time. The end narrative text started to sound a bit repetitive with the diving in the wild and the octopuses getting old and dying as it happens several times throughout the text, but overall it is an excellent book. If you like science and animals then I recommend it. The author's passion for animals shows in that she tries to prove that the intelligent octopus creature has a soul. I thought the argument as a whole in the book weak. She does mention philosophers and different theories. They are spread throughout the book so none of it is overwhelming and she recognizes that to define a soul is really not possible; that some say it is an inner being that gives people senses and intelligence, others it gives life meaning and purpose. ""Perhaps none of these definitions is true. Perhaps all of them are. But I am certain of one thing as I sit in my pew: If I have a soul-and I think I do-an octopus has a soul, too."" Her stance is clear from the start, but she doesn't get into the different theories much. Maybe that is a good thing considering the target audience.Her writing reminded me of ""The Secret Garden"" where Colin is so moved by nature that he is miraculously healed in his soul and stands up to recite the Doxology. The author is so moved by octopuses that her emotional descriptions show a passion that is deeply felt: ""Perhaps, I muse, this is the pace at which the Creator thinks, in the weighty, graceful, liquid manner-like blood flows, not like synapses fire."" She has terrific writing with plenty of similes and metaphors to help readers picture the creatures and their environment in the aquarium or wild.The book does explain mating and covers the loss of beloved animals either as pets or from an aquarium's caretaker's perspective. I learned more about scuba diving than I expected and she describes the tight friendship she developed from working at the aquarium and diving. These friendships add a human element that is a nice balance to the scientific narrative. I did not know anything about octopuses before reading this book and a knowledgeable reader might have a completely different reading experience than me. "
253,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,4,"‘The Soul of an Octopus’ is a charming, very readable memoir of encounters with octopodes. The author became fascinated with these mysterious creatures after getting to know one at an aquarium. She describes her octo-pals with such love that it’s hard not to want to meet one yourself once you’ve finished the book. I previously knew very little about octopodes, so was fascinated by their oddness. For example, I learned that octopus neurons are distributed among their tentacles, which appear genuinely able to think for themselves. A key theme of the book is the intelligence of octopodes and how difficult it is to compare with mammalian conceptions thereof. Montgomery makes a strong case that each octopus she has known had a distinctive personality and formed a bond with her.On the other hand, I found the chapters in which Montgomery learns to scuba dive a little hair-raising, as personally I fear and distrust deep water. (As an aside, I once tried out a friend’s VR goggles and explored a simulated ocean floor. That was pretty great - if it was made more interactive, what a lovely way to come close to ocean life without disturbing ecosystems or risking your personal safety.) Back at the aquarium, her account of the group of friends meeting weekly to spend time with an octopus was poignant and sweet. There are no great insights into consciousness to be found in this book, as it is more personal than scientific. Montgomery isn’t trying to give you the full history and biology of octopodes, she’s sharing portraits, anecdotes, and appealing facts. The writing is engaging and I enjoyed being reminded both of how little is known about ocean fauna and of the strong bonds that humans can form with other creatures. I’ve also been inspired to look up my nearest aquarium. "
254,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565471-rift-vegan,3,"Octopuses are fascinating, but I don't know much about them, other than a couple of PBS nature shows. This was a great first book for me, a little peek into someone else's obsession. The things I learned made me hungry for more... Octopuses are actually colour blind, except they can probably experience colour in their tentacles (rather than their eyes)!! And all their arms have neural connections... So interesting to think about having brains spread out all over your body!I would have rated this 4 stars out of 5, except for the sad fact that Montgomery barely touched the surface of the ethics of kidnapping and imprisoning such intelligent creatures. Granted, we know a lot more about octopuses because scientists observe them and experiment with them in captive situations. But I don't believe the end justifies the means. For just a couple paragraphs, she talks to a man who does the actual kidnapping and asks him if he thinks it's ethical. (ha, the truism by Upton Sinclair: It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.) He says the octopuses that he kidnaps and sells to zoos are ambassadors of the species, and people would not care about their fate in the wild if they don't get to see them in zoos. uh huh. Poor Kali, who knew the freedom of the entire ocean was kept in a barrel for months before she escaped and died. And it sounded like she may have died on purpose, but that was not addressed in the book at all. Sad, very sad.So, yes, mixed feelings about this book. And that's okay! It's great to think about things like this and work out my own opinions! "
255,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44349312-jeff,1,"Just how many times can Montgomery describe putting arms into a tank to have an octopus suck on them? Read this book to find out. It's clear over and over again that an octopus's senses differ from our own, yet Montgomery insists on waxing poetic about her own anthropomorphic speculations of what the octopus is ""feeling"" or ""thinking"" at the very moment it puts its many suckers on human arms. I think I was fooled by the popularity of this book, thinking that I would find something more about actual scientific research indicating that an octopus can readily identify ""self,"" but instead I was left with a broken record of the lives and deaths of short-lived cephalopods and the ad nauseam mourning of slightly deranged caretakers and onlookers afterward. Sprinkle in some story about SCUBA lessons and diving off Cozumel and bingo, you've transformed what should be a brief essay into a best selling book. Can we forge connections with animals? Sure. Does signing a ""Declaration of Consciousness"" prove that animals have a conscious? I respond with an emphatic ""NO!"" Like a typical biographer, Montgomery elevates the octopus on a pedestal and skirts the edge of implying that the animal might possibly be the pinnacle of conscious existence. This could (and should) have remained an essay and it would have been just fine. "

Montgomery explores the wonderful world of octopuses in this touching non-fiction that is half memoir and half expose on these smart and personable ocean creatures.I enjoyed the book very much and found it surprisingly interesting. I learned a lot of interesting facts about octopus that I would have never guessed prior to reading the book (I'll let you discover those facts for yourself). Her writing style is very engaging and she is able to impart a lot of knowledge while making it seem like she is just telling you a story. This book will be a favorite but I didn't give it 5 stars for a few reasons. First, I think she often attributes thoughts, emotions and intentions to the octopuses at times. While I don't disagree that they have all those things, I question her ability to seem to attribute the exact emotion/thought/intention in certain instances. Second, I have to admit that it bothered me that someone who loved them so much (enough to write a whole book on them) would contemplate buying one to keep as a pet. "
257,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4604943-sarai,3,"3.5 StarsThis book focuses on Montgomery's experiences while conducting research on octopuses and their emotional intelligence. She meets various researchers and staff from the New England aquarium, and dives to observe octopuses in their natural habitat. Throughout the book, she shares interesting facts about octopuses, fish, and other mammals and will back some of these up with snippets of research. Most of the book reads like a memoir. Montgomery introduces the people she meets, shares personal interactions with various octopuses in the aquarium, and describes the connection she feels to them and to the staff. While I enjoyed the writing style very much--it reads like she's having coffee with you and sharing her cool experiences--I wanted more. I felt like Montgomery had just as many questions as I did, and not many answers. This book made me want to pick up another book on octopuses, fish, etc. with more cool facts backed by research. Overall it's a very enjoyable book, and I would recommend it to anyone who would maybe shy away from reading a scientific book but loves a good memoir--this would be a great choice, as it blends both genres into a fun, quick read."

I thought to myself, what else don't I know about these 8 legged monsters...Well I quickly discovered they are not monsters and in fact appear to be intelligent and sensitive creatures who recognize individual people in an aquarium setting and will display actions indicating if they love or hate you!Before reading The Soul of an Octopus all I really knew about them was they had 8 tentacles and could squeeze themselves into small jars. I never imagined I would be captivated as I was by Sy's experiences. I laughed and cried right along with her. Half way through I was telling my boyfriend if I had read this book 20 years ago I probably would have gone to school to study octopuses.

Didn't realise just how interesting it would be, there were so many intriguing facts and anecdotes about octopuses, everything from their anatomy to their behaviour to their individual personalities were mentioned. The way the author wrote about the octopuses she encountered made them seem almost impossible and mythical, it was like reading about another world at times. The most engrossing parts were definitely the author's interactions with the octopuses at the aquarium she saw day in and day out, it was fascinating getting updates on Athena, Octavia, and Kali.

I've always felt that at least the dogs and cats I've known in my life share these characteristics with me, but now I find out that even cephalopods experience all of these traits, too.

I appreciated the sense of wonder and respect for creatures Montgomery has. I disagree with some of her implied conclusions, but the observations she makes and shares beg the question ""why is man so different, despite being so similar?"""
269,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,4,"So teetering between a 3 and a 4 on this book, but I think on all the typical qualities on which I assess a book, it deserves the 4. Sy Montgomery finds an engaging way to write more than 200 pages about the neurobiology of the octopus that I think would entertain most readers. If you have even rudimentary interest in the natural world, this book is very accessible, and Montgomery's enthusiasm about animals in general and octopuses in general shines through.The majority of the book focuses on three octopuses that come through the aquarium in Boston, Massachusetts. Montgomery's habit of guessing at the emotional life of animals annoyed me a bit in The Good Good Pig: The Extraordinary Life of Christopher Hogwood, and somehow is worse when it comes to a non-mammal, but at the same time, I can't fault her completely because it is part of what makes the book entertaining. The animals seem so relatable that the reader truly cares what happens to them. And that brings me to my giant frustration, not so much with the book, but with the tale of the octopuses in the aquarium.The rest of this review truly is a spoiler, but what really caused me to knock stars off of this book is some hypocrisy that I just couldn't bring myself to ignore. So rare for me because normally I take stories at face value and focus on the writing, the entertainment, and the character development - - but this is non-fiction, so it's basically impossible to completely banish the thoughts I had while reading it. And I don't even share the worst of it below.(view spoiler)[ So, I really have a problem with how these animals were handled, and I'm certainly no animal rights activist. The whole book posits how intelligent the octopuses are and even imbues them with consciousness and to some degree, emotions. So, in what world does their process for handling these creatures make any sense. The oldest octopus, Octavia, is in a decent tank, and she's currently healthy, but reaching the end of her life span. So the Aquarium obtains a new octopus, Kali. Kali is relegated to a 50 gallon barrel (my oil tank in my house is 6 times the size). And every time the barrel is opened, she eagerly tries to explore outside it suggesting she's bored at best. Later, they determine she tried to chew her way out of it. But well before that point, it's quite clear that if you really believe the animal is intelligent then a barrel is no place for it. At first, I rationalized this to myself thinking ""well, perhaps the lead time for getting a new octopus is super long so they don't want to wait until Octavia dies because they won't have a replacement for their exhibit, and I get how that might not be optimal."" Um. Yeah. No. They get a third octopus in 8 days. Which also tries to eat its way out of the barrel. So in my mind, this book is pretty much an exercise in complete hypocrisy . . .if you truly believe that this animal is as intelligent and emotional as they make it out to be, you don't treat it like this and then get all excited that it seems happy when you open the barrel to visit with it.  (hide spoiler)]Bottom line, read this one if you want to learn about octopuses, but just be forewarned that you may not really like the author much after you finish it."
270,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6840223-erika,1,"I was still on an ocean hangover from a trip to Coronado when I bought this book. The ocean fascinates me and I'm particularly intrigued by jellyfish and octopus. It should be noted that the author of his book, Sy Montgomery, is a seasoned writer, investigative explorer, and recipient of lifetime achievement awards from the Humane Society. I believe her to be a caring and conscientious animal lover who holds animals' best interests in high regard--BUT, the her book is plagued with many instances of overreach. Montgomery documents her research of four octopuses housed at the New England Aquarium. Facts and statistics are dispersed throughout the book, one of which reveals that octopuses taste through their suckers and can literally taste your skin. On one visit to the aquarium, Montgomery brings a friend who is a smoker. The octopus reacts harshly to the friend and Montgomery wonders if it is because the octopus could taste the nicotine on her friend's skin. Another time, the author ponders whether or not the octopus will interact with her since she recently dyed her hair and perhaps the octopus wouldn't like the chemicals. Yet, she plunges her hands and arms in the water anyway. Montgomery herself even acknowledges the danger of this: ""[...] the skin of an octopus is one giant, fantastically sensitive mucous membrane. Steinhart Aquarium's assistant curator J. Charles Delbeek has likened cephalopod skin to the lining of the mammalian gut, with the result that 'levels of chemicals, nutrients, pollutants, etc. that are seemingly not toxic to other species and inverts can be toxic to cephs.'"" Moreover, the entire book revolves around Montgomery's quest to prove the consciousness of an octopus, yet a great portion of the book focuses on the suffocating handling of the octopus named Kali. Kali was procured from the wild by the aquarium and kept in a darkened barrel--void of stimulation, as well noted by the author--for approximately nine months because the aquarium did not have the space for her. (They needed her to replace an aging octopus already on display in the event that the older invertebrate died.) Eventually, it becomes evident that older (Octavia) and younger (Kali) must switch places. It's a risky move and one that proves fatal for Kali--she escaped through a two-inch hole in the lid of the tank. I have no doubt her staff and volunteers were devastated by her loss. However, when Wilson, one of her handlers says, ""'She had a day of freedom [in the new tank]. And that she got out tells you a phenomenally inquisitive and intelligent creature wanted her freedom. We know, clearly, it must have taken a lot of effort to get out.'"" And clearly, Wilson, it should tell you, Montgomery, and the aquarium that her ""freedom"" was not a tank. Captured at an approximate age of nine months, left in a barrel for nine more, only to die on the aquarium floor...disgraceful. Considering that only a few (like, less than five) out of 100,000 eggs survive to sexual maturity, it would appear imperative to allow these animals to flourish in the wild. Greatly disappointed with this book. "
271,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,4,"Octopus is a very intelligent animal with a radically different style of neurological and psychological organization from us. ""Is there a scene of self at all, a center of experience? If not, that involves imagination something so different from us it might be impossible to think of. .... If there is no central consciousness, does an octopus have a ""collaborative, cooperative, but distributed mind"", as Peter suggest? Does it have a sense of multiple selves? Does each arm literally have a mind of its own?"" The Soul of an Octopus includes many octopuses (not ocopi, by the way, as octopus is a Greek word, not a Latin word): Athena, Octavia, Kali and Karma, all of them lived in New England Aquarium in Boston. Sy Montgomery is a science journalist. The book is a collection of the author's encounter with these octopuses in captivity, as well as octopuses in the wild (Caribbean and Pacific Ocean in particular). ""The ocean, for me, is what LSD was to Timothy Leary. "" I never tried LSD (or any other drugs), but I tend to agree with the author: the wondrous and capacious nature provides endless possibilities to keep me wowed forever."

My second favorite thing, that no one has mentioned, is the SECRET HIDDEN FLIP BOOK made up of the pictures on the bottom corners of the pages. Maybe I'm just a dork, but this gave me great joy. A whole book, so engagingly written, by a scientist who becomes taken with octopuses to such an extent that she gets SCUBA certified just to visit their world. It's how I felt two years ago when I came upon a harbor seal ""bottling"" in the ocean as I was kayaking near home - I was compelled to reach out to the New England Aquarium to ask them about it, then visit for a personal meet and greet with one of their resident seals, then join so that I can go to the aquarium whenever I want (which is how I ended up with this book last Tuesday, in the gift shop). All because of wonder and a little excitement. I want to read more of Sy's adventures now. Thanks for the ever so personal stories of not just the octopuses, but the people and fellow aquarium residents, too. "

She not only fills this book with facts about sea life and descriptions of the personalities of the octopuses she knows, but also just the general comraderie of being an aquarium groupie. She makes me want to go and hang out with fishes more often. There's so much that we're still learning about our fellow creatures, so much to be explored. This is just a thoroughly enjoyable read that has rekindled my love for the world below the water line.More thoughts on this book here: http://www.steepedinscience.com/2015/...I got a copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley."

When the marine biologist then confides that she too had tried to commit suicide, the author's response is to point to a nearby octopus in a tank and say in bewilderment ""You would leave THIS?!""Because apparently in this author's mind the simple task of working with an octopus should cancel out the impulse to self-extinction. Any other employment or life circumstances? No, then suicide makes sense.So I think I've had just about enough of this deranged author's masturbatory prose-poetry non-scientific cephalopod rants."

The essay is very moving and incredibly revealing about the otherness and being of an octopus as well as the connection that is possible between such a being and a human.While the essay felt distilled, rich, with no extra weight, the books feels chatty, padded, diluted."

279,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1373260-jaclyn-day,4,"This was a wonderful, captivating peek into the mysteries of the natural world. If you love the ocean and the creatures that inhabit it, you’ll feel an instant commiseration with Montgomery’s wonder at exploring octopuses in their natural habitats and in her home base aquarium in Boston. (The correct plural is octopuses, not octopi, she explains.) The book is fascinating. More of a memoir than a scientific study, but that makes it no less educational. But (and this is a big “but”), one huge faulty area is in Montgomery’s refusal to address the plight of octopus captivity and the aquarium octopus trade that she even participates in at one point. Octopuses are plucked from the ocean at just the right age and transported into small containers with their own fecal matter to whichever aquarium puts out an APB. There, they’re left to grow old--in a matter of years, octopuses don’t often live past 5--tending to unfertilized eggs (they’re rarely mated), growing larger in barrels ill-suited to their size, and getting increasingly bored and in need of stimuli. This is all from Montgomery’s book, mind you. It’s talked about lightly or skimmed over in favor of a safer topic. At one point, Montgomery argues that aquarium capture and captivity of octopuses is necessary to protect the species and educate the general public, and it’s a decent argument under certain circumstances. There are many aquariums, including the New England Aquarium, doing wonderful things for education and conservation. But, while education is important, Montgomery’s connection to the aquarium was the lifeline of her book--this book--and the captivity topic feels purposefully ignored in favor of her continued VIP access to Boston's prized octopuses. So, how do you write a book about the potential consciousness of a highly intelligent, remarkable species while mostly observing it in a captive environment? An environment that is, she admits, often stressful to the animal? There’s no doubt that she and the other volunteers and professionals at the aquarium cared deeply about the animals she writes about: Athena, Octavia, Kali, Karma. I just couldn’t get over the void left by Montgomery’s blatant refusal to go near the ethical or moral implications of captivity where her octopus consciousness questions were concerned. Could Montgomery have written the same book by observing octopuses living in their natural ocean habitats? I think so. She does do some of this, but she’s not a natural ocean swimmer or skilled diver (as she notes). Her open ocean dives seem more disappointing to her than illuminating to her understanding of the species. On the diving trips, she expresses that she can’t wait to get back to the aquarium and her friends there. She can’t wait to see the captive octopuses that can’t hide in their dens, or camouflage their escape route. She can’t wait to visit with the ones that are so bored that they may have no option but to interact with humans--for the sake of their food, their sanity, their survival. Montgomery expresses frequent awe at her interactions with the creatures. She swears they remember people. She talks about them embracing her arms, not roughly or aggressively, but in a warm, friendly greeting. That anthropomorphizing compromises her objectivity about what she’s writing about and the circumstances that she’s keeping quiet about in order to do so. This is a pretty intense critique, but to be clear--I read this book fast, in less than a few hours. I did love it, or wanted to. I loved the idea of it. I loved the science, the insight into such beautiful, weird, alien creatures. That only made it all the harder when I tried to reconcile Montgomery’s search for octopus consciousness with her willful ignorance--at least in the book--of the captive circumstances that made a good portion of her writing possible. I’d like to read a follow-up from her someday. I hope she writes it."
280,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17792052-amy,4,"I don't always have an easy time with non-fiction, so I really try to choose it well. Its important for me to get swept up in it somehow, to get a feeling or interest in the story. This one did - I got involved with it. I looked forward to picking it up. It wasn't just a slog through to learn something. I felt it. And it was set up to be a hard sell - why? Because why I love my dog dearly, and have been raised with animals/pets, I am not one for strange animals, or anything slippery. In fact one would go as far as to say that I outright dislike and have an anathema for ocean animals, underwater animals. To say - not my thing - would be an understatement. I live in Boston, my children have had an opportunity, I hope more than one to visit our amazing aquarium. I never have gone, wouldn't ever, and not in any city. I am not proud of this. Its an embarrassment to share I don't care for underwater animals. Its a funny thing I actually hope my children don't find out, or make too much of. Scuba, snorkeling, deep sea diving. I'll be on the beach reading. Luckily enough, no one else in the family has shown an interest. We prefer to walk the tide, and my sons would be playing volleyball, or football, or frisbee or something. Maybe my husband and I might have playing cards on a sandy blanket. The underwater world holds zero appeal for me.But this book? I actually really enjoyed it, and I'm glad I read it. That says a lot, because its non-fiction, and on a topic seriously not likely to draw me. But, consciousness, relationship, love, that is my thing. The thing that draws me every time. I actually truly loved reading this book. I also (in my own distanced way) fell in love with Octavia, Kali, Karma, and the first one - the beautiful Octopus our author fell in love with first. Funny, I actually throughout the book had to remind myself she was female. I kept picturing her male, and there was nothing remotely male about her. I loved thinking about how animals protect their young instinctively, even though there is nothing to protect, and how they turn to their relationships at various stages in their lives. I loved the mating scene, it was strange and beautiful. I loved how this Octopus moved various special needs children and adults, an elderly couple, a man losing his wife, and a whole family of people, tied through the love of these octopuses. (Funny, I thought it was octopi too…). Now, another plug for PBT - I wouldn't have really ever read this book, though I noticed it when it went around. But it felt clear to me that I would, when animals became the November tag. I'm very glad I had the opportunity. I really feel like I am a better person for having learned something, felt, and experienced these four friends, and what they meant and what they have taught and brought us. I'm a little proud of Boston, too. Maybe find a way to send my six year old soon? Seriously, I am grateful for the opportunity.What am I reading next? Well I am taking a brief six week course on three plays of Tennessee Williams, so I am about to review the Glass Menagerie, and this week I will be re-reading A Streetcar named Desire. Also will be starting the Zookeepers Wife. On Deck for November is the Muse, which I checked out of the library but haven't gotten to, To the Bright Edge of the World, which for some odd reason scares me a little, despite its glowing reviews. And the November read for Jewish Book Club - the Pinch. Is that right? Then there is for my own book club, my friends' book on Integrative Music Therapy - a Journey of Healing, so no November ""flurry"" for me. That's where I'm at. Octopus goes back to the library. So does Glass Menagerie, Pig Meets Pug, and on we go. "
281,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,5,"Is it possible to weep for an octopus' death?Sy Montgomery combines scientific inquiry with her own moving meditations on the purpose of life, the perception of time, and the possibilities of connection in this book. Her subject is the giant Pacific octopus, and she relates her intimate interactions with four of them, residents of the New England Aquarium in Boston. When she touches her first, an octopus named Athena, she is surprised.  “...[H]er head is silky and softer than custard. Her skin is flecked with ruby and silver, a night sky reflected in the wine-dark sea. As I stroke her with my fingertips, her skin goes white beneath my touch. White is the color of a relaxed octopus....” (Location 104) Montgomery's book is not a didactic scientific tome. Instead, she intersperses fascinating facts into a lyrical narrative of discovery. Octopuses have more neurons than a rat. The neurons are distributed throughout the tentacles. Motor control ranges from delicate exploration to a crushing grip. Each sucker can flex like a gentle kiss or pinch like a vice. The octopus smells and tastes through its skin. Montgomery notices Athena looking at her face while tasting her arms. Should she allow Athena to taste her face? Bill Murphy, senior aquarist, responds with a decisive “No.” The suckers could easily pull her eye out.An octopus named Octavia demonstrates remarkable camouflage abilities. Three layers of skin comprised of three types of cells enable shifts to multiple colors, patterns and textures, a canvas of liquid iridescence.This book is special, however, because Montgomery encounters so many examples of octopus personality: curiosity, memory, preferences, trust, playfulness, intelligence, and even deception. There is something tragic about an animal so like us in many ways having such a short lifespan — only 3-4 years. It lives a solitary life, hoarding its secrets. When born it is the size of a grain of rice. It grows, explores, learns, breeds and then, its life cycle completed, it becomes lethargic, senescent and dies. Montgomery's writing arouses a feeling of profound awe.The parallel story Montgomery tells is of the dedicated staff that attends these creatures. Montgomery describes them with such vividness that you feel you know them enough to greet them on the street. In the outside world their interests and individuality make them anomalies; in the aquarium they are part of a tight empathetic family. The memories they share with these octopuses are stored like a string of precious pearls. One interviewee likens the octopuses, caught from the wild, as ambassadors from their world to ours. It's an apt metaphor. Montgomery describes numerous occasions when adults as well as children are converted from uninvolved gawkers to sympathetic and curious admirers. The octopuses, in turn, seem curious about both the visitors and their environs, designed with painstaking attention to naturalism and security in mind. In addition, one of the most challenging tasks is designing puzzles to stave off octopus boredom. Would the octopus choose to give up its freedom to experience these unknown adventures? Of course, to even ask such a question is to lapse into anthropomorphism. Yet, I like to think that these octopuses live and die without regrets. So, returning to my opening question, if we weep, it is perhaps not from grief over the octopus as much as grief over the unfathomable mystery of life for all of us."
282,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361541-barb-middleton,4,"This narrative nonfiction story reveals the author's scientific study, care, and love of octopuses mainly at the New England aquarium. Her passion for the invertebrates is obvious and drew me into the story from the get-go. I learned more than I ever thought about how difficult it is to transfer and keep these Houdini-like creatures in their cages, as well as, their range of colors, ability to play, and unique senses and neurons that are in their arms. Some passages are very scientific but the density is lightened by the author's narration making for good pacing most of the time. The end narrative text started to sound a bit repetitive with the diving in the wild and the octopuses getting old and dying as it happens several times throughout the text, but overall it is an excellent book. If you like science and animals then I recommend it. The author's passion for animals shows in that she tries to prove that the intelligent octopus creature has a soul. I thought the argument as a whole in the book weak. She does mention philosophers and different theories. They are spread throughout the book so none of it is overwhelming and she recognizes that to define a soul is really not possible; that some say it is an inner being that gives people senses and intelligence, others it gives life meaning and purpose. ""Perhaps none of these definitions is true. Perhaps all of them are. But I am certain of one thing as I sit in my pew: If I have a soul-and I think I do-an octopus has a soul, too."" Her stance is clear from the start, but she doesn't get into the different theories much. Maybe that is a good thing considering the target audience.Her writing reminded me of ""The Secret Garden"" where Colin is so moved by nature that he is miraculously healed in his soul and stands up to recite the Doxology. The author is so moved by octopuses that her emotional descriptions show a passion that is deeply felt: ""Perhaps, I muse, this is the pace at which the Creator thinks, in the weighty, graceful, liquid manner-like blood flows, not like synapses fire."" She has terrific writing with plenty of similes and metaphors to help readers picture the creatures and their environment in the aquarium or wild.The book does explain mating and covers the loss of beloved animals either as pets or from an aquarium's caretaker's perspective. I learned more about scuba diving than I expected and she describes the tight friendship she developed from working at the aquarium and diving. These friendships add a human element that is a nice balance to the scientific narrative. I did not know anything about octopuses before reading this book and a knowledgeable reader might have a completely different reading experience than me. "
283,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,4,"‘The Soul of an Octopus’ is a charming, very readable memoir of encounters with octopodes. The author became fascinated with these mysterious creatures after getting to know one at an aquarium. She describes her octo-pals with such love that it’s hard not to want to meet one yourself once you’ve finished the book. I previously knew very little about octopodes, so was fascinated by their oddness. For example, I learned that octopus neurons are distributed among their tentacles, which appear genuinely able to think for themselves. A key theme of the book is the intelligence of octopodes and how difficult it is to compare with mammalian conceptions thereof. Montgomery makes a strong case that each octopus she has known had a distinctive personality and formed a bond with her.On the other hand, I found the chapters in which Montgomery learns to scuba dive a little hair-raising, as personally I fear and distrust deep water. (As an aside, I once tried out a friend’s VR goggles and explored a simulated ocean floor. That was pretty great - if it was made more interactive, what a lovely way to come close to ocean life without disturbing ecosystems or risking your personal safety.) Back at the aquarium, her account of the group of friends meeting weekly to spend time with an octopus was poignant and sweet. There are no great insights into consciousness to be found in this book, as it is more personal than scientific. Montgomery isn’t trying to give you the full history and biology of octopodes, she’s sharing portraits, anecdotes, and appealing facts. The writing is engaging and I enjoyed being reminded both of how little is known about ocean fauna and of the strong bonds that humans can form with other creatures. I’ve also been inspired to look up my nearest aquarium. "
284,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565471-rift-vegan,3,"Octopuses are fascinating, but I don't know much about them, other than a couple of PBS nature shows. This was a great first book for me, a little peek into someone else's obsession. The things I learned made me hungry for more... Octopuses are actually colour blind, except they can probably experience colour in their tentacles (rather than their eyes)!! And all their arms have neural connections... So interesting to think about having brains spread out all over your body!I would have rated this 4 stars out of 5, except for the sad fact that Montgomery barely touched the surface of the ethics of kidnapping and imprisoning such intelligent creatures. Granted, we know a lot more about octopuses because scientists observe them and experiment with them in captive situations. But I don't believe the end justifies the means. For just a couple paragraphs, she talks to a man who does the actual kidnapping and asks him if he thinks it's ethical. (ha, the truism by Upton Sinclair: It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.) He says the octopuses that he kidnaps and sells to zoos are ambassadors of the species, and people would not care about their fate in the wild if they don't get to see them in zoos. uh huh. Poor Kali, who knew the freedom of the entire ocean was kept in a barrel for months before she escaped and died. And it sounded like she may have died on purpose, but that was not addressed in the book at all. Sad, very sad.So, yes, mixed feelings about this book. And that's okay! It's great to think about things like this and work out my own opinions! "
285,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44349312-jeff,1,"Just how many times can Montgomery describe putting arms into a tank to have an octopus suck on them? Read this book to find out. It's clear over and over again that an octopus's senses differ from our own, yet Montgomery insists on waxing poetic about her own anthropomorphic speculations of what the octopus is ""feeling"" or ""thinking"" at the very moment it puts its many suckers on human arms. I think I was fooled by the popularity of this book, thinking that I would find something more about actual scientific research indicating that an octopus can readily identify ""self,"" but instead I was left with a broken record of the lives and deaths of short-lived cephalopods and the ad nauseam mourning of slightly deranged caretakers and onlookers afterward. Sprinkle in some story about SCUBA lessons and diving off Cozumel and bingo, you've transformed what should be a brief essay into a best selling book. Can we forge connections with animals? Sure. Does signing a ""Declaration of Consciousness"" prove that animals have a conscious? I respond with an emphatic ""NO!"" Like a typical biographer, Montgomery elevates the octopus on a pedestal and skirts the edge of implying that the animal might possibly be the pinnacle of conscious existence. This could (and should) have remained an essay and it would have been just fine. "

Montgomery explores the wonderful world of octopuses in this touching non-fiction that is half memoir and half expose on these smart and personable ocean creatures.I enjoyed the book very much and found it surprisingly interesting. I learned a lot of interesting facts about octopus that I would have never guessed prior to reading the book (I'll let you discover those facts for yourself). Her writing style is very engaging and she is able to impart a lot of knowledge while making it seem like she is just telling you a story. This book will be a favorite but I didn't give it 5 stars for a few reasons. First, I think she often attributes thoughts, emotions and intentions to the octopuses at times. While I don't disagree that they have all those things, I question her ability to seem to attribute the exact emotion/thought/intention in certain instances. Second, I have to admit that it bothered me that someone who loved them so much (enough to write a whole book on them) would contemplate buying one to keep as a pet. "
287,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4604943-sarai,3,"3.5 StarsThis book focuses on Montgomery's experiences while conducting research on octopuses and their emotional intelligence. She meets various researchers and staff from the New England aquarium, and dives to observe octopuses in their natural habitat. Throughout the book, she shares interesting facts about octopuses, fish, and other mammals and will back some of these up with snippets of research. Most of the book reads like a memoir. Montgomery introduces the people she meets, shares personal interactions with various octopuses in the aquarium, and describes the connection she feels to them and to the staff. While I enjoyed the writing style very much--it reads like she's having coffee with you and sharing her cool experiences--I wanted more. I felt like Montgomery had just as many questions as I did, and not many answers. This book made me want to pick up another book on octopuses, fish, etc. with more cool facts backed by research. Overall it's a very enjoyable book, and I would recommend it to anyone who would maybe shy away from reading a scientific book but loves a good memoir--this would be a great choice, as it blends both genres into a fun, quick read."

She had me hooked from the start when she informs the reader the plural of Octopus is Octopuses not Octopi. I thought to myself, what else don't I know about these 8 legged monsters...Well I quickly discovered they are not monsters and in fact appear to be intelligent and sensitive creatures who recognize individual people in an aquarium setting and will display actions indicating if they love or hate you!Before reading The Soul of an Octopus all I really knew about them was they had 8 tentacles and could squeeze themselves into small jars. I never imagined I would be captivated as I was by Sy's experiences. I laughed and cried right along with her. Half way through I was telling my boyfriend if I had read this book 20 years ago I probably would have gone to school to study octopuses. I look forward to the next time I find myself at an aquarium- the octopus will be my first stop for sure!! I have learned never dismiss the simplest creature because there is so much more than meets the eye!"

Didn't realise just how interesting it would be, there were so many intriguing facts and anecdotes about octopuses, everything from their anatomy to their behaviour to their individual personalities were mentioned. The way the author wrote about the octopuses she encountered made them seem almost impossible and mythical, it was like reading about another world at times. The most engrossing parts were definitely the author's interactions with the octopuses at the aquarium she saw day in and day out, it was fascinating getting updates on Athena, Octavia, and Kali. I wasn't so keen on the author's time trying to scuba dive or the other parts which weren't really focused on octopuses."

How arrogant we have been. This is one amazing book, well researched yet charming in its narrative, and thanks to Sy Montgomery, I am thoroughly smitten by these wonderful animals. I've always felt that at least the dogs and cats I've known in my life share these characteristics with me, but now I find out that even cephalopods experience all of these traits, too. And to think, we eat these creatures. Not me, because I'm quickly becoming a vegetarian (this book hastened the process). Read it. You will be gobsmacked by nature."
291,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22941942-amy-morgan,5,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I learned so many things about octopuses and am now completely fascinated by them. I loved how easy to read this story was and how beautifully the author described her interactions with these unique creatures. You could really feel the love she felt for them and the other creatures in the aquarium just flowing off the pages. Getting to know an octopus is definitely on my bucket list now!
292,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3727008-penny-literary-hoarders,4,"This was fascinating! Sy Montgomery reads her story with enthusiasm and I learned tremendous amounts of information about the octopus! A complete wild card - would never have thought I would be so hooked on this kind of audiobook, but it worked out well and was a very pleasant and lovely change in my reading - something I needed at the moment."
293,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22299570-kaytee-cobb,5,"Warning: I am recklessly sentimental. And this book is recklessly sentimental for a memoir. It is saccharine sweet at parts, but also completely amazed at the complexity and awesomeness of octopuses, and i became super attached to each of the creatures she encounters. I loved it, but Your Mileage May Vary."
294,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5907780-joe-m,4,"Fascinating book-my mind was definitely blown several times learning about these incredible creatures. Sy Montgomery has so much love, compassion, and a sense of wonder about octopuses that makes for mesmerizing reading. Looking forward to my next trip to the aquarium!"
295,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3438644-trinity,5,Fascinating if occasionally melancholy book about the magnificent cephalopods.
296,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex,0,"Chris, let me know if this is anywhere near as good as it looks because it looks amazing."
297,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8783847-ginger-bensman,4,"I enjoyed this book. Sy Montgomery makes a compelling case that the octopus is a playful, complex, intelligent, social, and empathetic animal, and she does it through the lens of her own personal and life affirming experiences with octopuses. (We learn on practically the first page that the proper plural for octopus is not octopi -- but rather ""octopuses"" in keeping with the word's Greek origins.) I was hoping for more science mixed in with the memoir and personal anecdotes, but my interest in octopuses has been expanded and I'll seek out more information from the list of references in the book."
298,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12250904-tiffany-rider,3,"3.5 stars.God's creation is truly amazing, and this book is a good reminder of that fact. I appreciated the sense of wonder and respect for creatures Montgomery has. I disagree with some of her implied conclusions, but the observations she makes and shares beg the question ""why is man so different, despite being so similar?"""
299,1451697716,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,4,"So teetering between a 3 and a 4 on this book, but I think on all the typical qualities on which I assess a book, it deserves the 4. Sy Montgomery finds an engaging way to write more than 200 pages about the neurobiology of the octopus that I think would entertain most readers. If you have even rudimentary interest in the natural world, this book is very accessible, and Montgomery's enthusiasm about animals in general and octopuses in general shines through.The majority of the book focuses on three octopuses that come through the aquarium in Boston, Massachusetts. Montgomery's habit of guessing at the emotional life of animals annoyed me a bit in The Good Good Pig: The Extraordinary Life of Christopher Hogwood, and somehow is worse when it comes to a non-mammal, but at the same time, I can't fault her completely because it is part of what makes the book entertaining. The animals seem so relatable that the reader truly cares what happens to them. And that brings me to my giant frustration, not so much with the book, but with the tale of the octopuses in the aquarium.The rest of this review truly is a spoiler, but what really caused me to knock stars off of this book is some hypocrisy that I just couldn't bring myself to ignore. So rare for me because normally I take stories at face value and focus on the writing, the entertainment, and the character development - - but this is non-fiction, so it's basically impossible to completely banish the thoughts I had while reading it. And I don't even share the worst of it below.(view spoiler)[ So, I really have a problem with how these animals were handled, and I'm certainly no animal rights activist. The whole book posits how intelligent the octopuses are and even imbues them with consciousness and to some degree, emotions. So, in what world does their process for handling these creatures make any sense. The oldest octopus, Octavia, is in a decent tank, and she's currently healthy, but reaching the end of her life span. So the Aquarium obtains a new octopus, Kali. Kali is relegated to a 50 gallon barrel (my oil tank in my house is 6 times the size). And every time the barrel is opened, she eagerly tries to explore outside it suggesting she's bored at best. Later, they determine she tried to chew her way out of it. But well before that point, it's quite clear that if you really believe the animal is intelligent then a barrel is no place for it. At first, I rationalized this to myself thinking ""well, perhaps the lead time for getting a new octopus is super long so they don't want to wait until Octavia dies because they won't have a replacement for their exhibit, and I get how that might not be optimal."" Um. Yeah. No. They get a third octopus in 8 days. Which also tries to eat its way out of the barrel. So in my mind, this book is pretty much an exercise in complete hypocrisy . . .if you truly believe that this animal is as intelligent and emotional as they make it out to be, you don't treat it like this and then get all excited that it seems happy when you open the barrel to visit with it.  (hide spoiler)]Bottom line, read this one if you want to learn about octopuses, but just be forewarned that you may not really like the author much after you finish it."
