0,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92128-teresa,5,"This book is packed full of so much information - from why dogs have floppy ears to why some people become homicidal, all approached from an evolutionary perspective. Wilson shows us that a better understanding of evolution leads us to a better understanding of every aspect of our daily lives and social interactions. His goal is to prove that science isn't something accessible only to an elite few, but instead is an exciting and rewarding field that can easily be understood by anyone. Furthermore, it's crucial to our development as a society that we embrace scientific knowledge in order to explain and adapt to the world around us. I especially was interested by his theories on the evolutionary origins of religion in human societies. Overall, I found this book fascinating, and it's a great jumping point for many more books and articles on evolution, religion, and human development if you're so inclined."

That was the case here. I was hoping to read this and get some tidbits for teaching evolution, maybe even assign the book to students. Nope. It’s the vanity project of an well-known, old, white guy touting this evo-psych and group selection garbage. It all just sounds so dated, and he sounds like a writer from another time - the sage scientist, born into wealth, which allowed him to pursue his own bizarre theories. Of course most of the scientists he cites are other men of the same sort. He even manages to make a breast joke when talking about tits (the birds). There’s maybe one or two chapters that could be excerpted and be useful for teaching."
2,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7112986-shawn-smith,2,"""Evolution for Everyone"" includes a fine enough and simple description of natural selection early in the book, but it becomes increasingly laden with ideology after the first few chapters. The author clearly has a socio-political point that he's trying to advance, which would be fine if he had openly disclosed that. As is, the title and description of the book are quite misleading. He should have titled it something like ""How the Theory of Natural Selection Can Be Used to Advance My Ideology."" He works so hard at it that his logic becomes rather muddled, and his data is selective to say the least.For example, he dismisses a lengthy and thorough body of research discrediting the group problem-solving process known as brainstorming by asserting that previous experiments have simply made the mistake of applying brainstorming to the wrong kinds of problems. He constructed his own experiments in support of brainstorming, in which he asked groups to recall previously-learned information. (Previous brainstorming experiments have ask groups to solve creative problems, not list-generating problems, because brainstorming was originally designed for creative problem-solving.) It seems “intuitively obvious,” as professors like to say, that groups will outperform individuals at generating laundry lists, but there is a great deal of research demonstrating that brainstorming fails miserably as a tool for creative problem-solving. In this book, Wilson does an end-run around that fact, essentially saying that existing research findings are wrong if you redact a lot of history. The book is peppered with similar problems in logic.As an author myself, it pains me to write a harsh book review (and in the interest of full disclosure, I only made it about halfway through before skimming the rest and putting it down), but writers need to tread very, very carefully when using science to advance ideology.On the plus side, the first few chapters offer a nice, simple overview of the theory of natural selection."

For example a discussion of how our million years' heritage makes us obese today. The title is misleading, the book is not Darwin 101 but at the Scientific American level with some autobiography added. "
4,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4578245-nelson,2,"I have rarely read a book more grievously mistitled. This isn't evolution for everyone. It isn't even evolution for fellow travelers otherwise well-disposed to the claims of science as explanatory for much of life. This is evolution for the very small set of people who think exactly like DSW, which is to say, those who believe with something akin to religious fervor that the theory of evolution explains literally everything. The theory may in fact do that; it would take a far more careful and self-aware exploration of the issues than this volume manages to make that case. DSW's book suffers from intellectual mission creep. Having gotten his mind around an idea that he rightly regards as key for explaining many facets of biology, he then extends the theory's provenance to everything. Nowhere are the book's shortcomings more apparent than when DSW attempts to colonize other fields for evolution. His grasp of any number of historical trends and philosophical theories is frequently (and embarrassingly) wrong. He has a touching but misplaced naïveté in the work of experts in other fields that he never bothers to vet with the same precision that he might were they biologists he was discussing. Lest one be accused of fundamentalist knee-jerkism, this reviewer has to report himself fully convinced of evolution and not in thrall to fact-denying elements of religious practice in any way: I'm not a believer threatened by Darwin. There are plenty of excellent reasons to question many of the conclusions DSW reaches in his experiments, simply out of a kind of self-awareness or other point of view that DSW himself cannot seem to muster. Obsessed by his own idée fixe, he is as blinkered as the fact-denying religionists he frequently dismisses in his narrative. His enthusiasm and messianic fervor for evolution as the key to unlock every box has a kind of boyish charm; the constant self-reference and discussion of family and friends tends to pall rather quickly however. The book does explain the basics of evolution for those who aren't familiar with them. Many readers will find they could have done without all the self-reference and particularly the cringe-inducing final chapter explaining DSW's long march to science. (It is by turns self-congratulatory and revealing in ways far beyond what its author intends.) DSW's charming obliviousness to the degree which his text nevertheless will put off the devout or, say, reasoning humanists who refuse to see Homer as nothing more than the agglomeration of male kinship groups seeking dominance (it is that, of course, but to say this is to only begin not end the discussion--on the evidence of this text, evolutionary narrative studies have a VERY long way to go) is exceeded only by his confidence that literally everything he thinks is worth putting on the page."
5,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/104526-seth-wilpan,5,"Evolution provides a framework for thinking about all aspects of the human condition. A significant teaching for me is the distinction between the proximate and ultimate cause of an adaptive change. The proximate cause is an immediate response to something in the environment that turns out to be useful for survival. Kids may gather to play because it's fun (the proximate cause), but it makes them safer to be in a group, so the behavior is reinforced (the ultimate cause).It was surprising to find out how limited the application of evolutionary principles are in academia. Surprising that each discipline is so cloistered that it is not even aware of such principles and scholars in different disciplines are parochially resistant to even considering the application of evolutionary thought to their studies.Most thought provoking are the application of evolutionary thinking to the study of culture."

7,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3393514-naum,5,"How discovered/stumbled upon? Twitter (@dkorten) recommendation from author David Korten…What media type? Read on my Kindle, but to my chagrin, noted that it is also available on the shelf of the local library down the street!What is the book about? Evolution, not so much in hard core science sense, although there are some chapters devoted to such experiments, but jargon is toned down for a universal audience, and appeal is made that evolution should be broadly applied, and not just confined to the biology domain. 36 chapters, after a gentle introduction, tilt from specific path carving experiments to general queries on religion, morals, human nature. Is it a easy / medium / difficult read? The author employs a very accommodating writing style that is luring to the reader, very soulfully open in style, and is able to express concepts and ideas concisely, economically and succinctly. The book was a joy to read and after completing, felt a big letdown, where normally, even in books I enjoy and savor, feel relieved and satiated after completion.What are the takeaways author wishes to plant within the reader? That anyone can ""roll up their sleeves"" (a phrase used repeatedly) and do science and become an ""evolutionary"" thinker. That evolution just doesn't apply to biology and even science departments but has implications and applications in every realm, from the lowest life forms to human psychology.Is the author successful in making his case / winning his reader appeal? For the most part -- I would not state 100% as I question some of the material, but definitely, he was successful in stoking my interest in the topic and encouraging a follow through read.Sources author relies upon? Students, inspired by his teaching (or ""used"" books procured) who devoted time to their own experiments and studies, ""dilettante"" (from non-academia) and professional colleagues that spiked his interest, EO Wilson who was a lifelong mentor, his Dad, but the work seems independent and not based on any narrow band of volumes. Author has several previous books I am unfamiliar with.Recommended follow-up points: I bookmarked a few sites mentioned (EvOS) and just ordered *The Literary Animal* from amazon. May take a gander on the psychology recommended titles (do not have the book in front of me now)."
8,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1086452-dia,4,"I was quickly won over by this excitable biologist's presentation of evolutionary theory, mainly because of the fascinating studies he describes (though I'm not sure that they necessarily support the conclusions he wants them to support) and his cheerful, sometimes even dorky, but certainly humble, story of his own development as a scientist. His special take on the meaning of evolutionary theory for us humans at this time is interesting and perhaps heartening but not all that convincing. (He thinks that ""survival of the fittest"" no longer applies to individuals of our species but rather to groups, so cooperative group members are the fittest of our species; but is a group mind really a better mind, and are we willing to let go of even an inch of our sense of ourselves as individuals?) Also, standard evolutionary theory has some big problems which are commonly known but seldom publicly admitted to by scientists -- it is far from a finished theory, but we can't give Creationists any ammunition, it seems -- and Sloan too doesn't adequately address these weaknesses. Still, a stimulating read, especially for those who love science but aren't specialists. "
9,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"Evolutionary theory as a guide to life""The most extraordinary fact about public awareness of evolution is not that 50 percent don't believe the theory but that nearly 100 percent haven't connected it to anything of importance in their lives."" (p. 315)This is a bit curious, but when you consider that Edward O. Wilson's Sociobiology was published only 34 years ago, and further that evolutionary psychology has only recently made its way into the curriculum of our university psychology departments, it is understandable. For my part, like David Sloan Wilson (son of Sloan Wilson who wrote a couple of fiction bestsellers in the 1950s, The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit and A Summer Place), I took to the application of evolutionary ideas to my life the way a duck takes to water. But the overall public awareness and acceptance has lagged, in part due, as Wilson explains, to the failure of the larger academic community to incorporate evolutionary ideas and findings into their fields of study.That is changing fast with evolutionary medicine, evolutionary psychology and other scientific approaches now established fields of study. What David Wilson hopes follows is an awareness of evolutionary ideas and principles in the social sciences and the humanities, which is one of the reasons he wrote this book which grew out a class he taught to undergraduates.The essence of evolutionary thought as applied to our daily lives is to ask the question, how does such and such a behavior or such and such an idea relate to the way evolution works? For example, not so long ago we were urged to drink lots of water every day (probably from studies funded by bottled water companies!). But if you think about the human experience in the Pleistocene in what is called the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptation (EEA) you might ask yourself, how was it possible for humans to drink so much water? Clearly humans would develop an ability to function very well, even optimally, without having to drink so much water, which in those days and climes would have been difficult to do safely. Consequently, doing this ""thought experiment"" I began to doubt the necessity to drink so much water. And lo and behold it came down from newer studies that actually humans don't really need to drink so much water! David Sloan Wilson gives a number of other examples of evolutionary thinking that has helped us to better understand ourselves and our place in the world and our communities. He is very strong on the idea of cooperation as an adaptive force in evolution, especially human evolution.One of the ideas that most impressed me is his recognition of the arms struggle between society and the ""selfish"" individual. Some old-line evolutionists are loath to accept altruism and other seemingly selfless behaviors that benefit the tribe or larger groups as adaptive (other than through kinship) since the genes that code for such behavior would be easily overrun by genes from individuals looking out only for themselves. But what I think is overlooked is the human ability to spot these cheaters and keep them in check or to kick them out of the tribe or worse. Wilson makes the very interesting point that gossip is part of this process. Through gossip a society ""maintains a dossier of information on every member and quickly detects social failings."" (p. 160). Sociopaths don't fare well in communities in which everybody knows everybody else. But of course gossip doesn't work well, and a sociopath can flourish, where almost everyone is a stranger to one another, which is usually the case in our big cities. This lack of communal checks explains in part why there is so much crime in our cities.Another interesting and fundamental idea is what Wilson calls ""dancing with ghosts."" The idea is that the adaptations we made during the EEA in some cases no longer apply effectively to the current environment. Thus the very nice ability to efficiently put on fat when large amounts of sugar, carbs and fats are temporarily available worked well in the prehistory when the dearth of winter or the dry season was to come; but in today's world of supermarkets and a MacDonald's on every corner, this ability has become a detriment leading to obesity and chronic disease. Many people in the West are dancing with the ghosts of ""eat your fill when it's available."" This predictive adaptive response (PAR) is no longer adaptive. Wilson gives some other examples relating to pronghorn antelopes that still ""flee with amazing speed and endurance from predators that no longer populate the American plains"" and baby sea turtles that mistake the lights of the city for the moon shining off the ocean and crawl in the wrong direction. (pp. 52-53)Wilson also argues convincingly for the idea that life in the ghetto is more dangerous than say life in the suburbs because young people in the ghetto must take greater chances in order to be gain status and wealth. For a person like David Sloan Wilson to risk his life for some status gain would be foolish since he is going to gain enough wealth and status to be successful because of his many social and economic advantages. For a guy in the ghetto, it is sometimes worth the risk (or so it seems) to fight another at the drop of an insult because of the gain in status that can lead to better mating opportunities and a greater command of turf. When the environment is ""unstable"" and ""life expectancy"" is ""low,"" a good strategy is to ""take care of immediate needs and reproduce early."" When you have a ""stable environment and high life expectancy"" on the other hand, you should ""plan for the long term, including delayed reproduction.""There is also a lot in this book about religion from an evolutionary point of view, which I don't have space to go into, some of it based on Wilson's earlier book Darwin's Cathedral (2002). --Dennis Littrell, author of “Understanding Evolution and Ourselves”"
10,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4879795-jeffrey,5,"This is a fabulous introduction, not only to evolutionary science, but to evolutionary thinking. It is no hyperbole that reading this book changed my worldview. Dr. Wilson approaches the subject with a light touch and not a hint of dogma. I highly recommend this book to evolution skeptics as well as those who just want to know what evolution is."
11,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20382814-david-bond,4,"I've read a lot of darwin books, this one was really unique, took a look at the evolutionary origins of laughter and other weird things."
12,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20698068-ken-bour,3,"This book was disappointing in that it had been recommended to me by someone in whose judgement I respect and trust. There was entirely too much normative exposition versus defensible explanations. The author clearly had a mission to espouse a viewpoint rather than provide a convincing and persuasive rationale as to why evolutionary thinking is especially useful and helpful. I am being somewhat harsh in this assessment in part because the book seemed to me poorly conceived, organized, and written. I found myself bored and skimming more than a few times although, to be fair, there were several interesting evolutionary theories presented (e.g., pregnancy sickness) although, given the sparse information provided, I was not entirely convinced. In order to write a book suitable for ""everyone,"" he necessarily chose broad swipes and generalizations that the reader is asked to accept on faith or, if so inclined, research independently (plenty of references are offered). After spending 10 days with this book, I have not been converted into something I was not previously. I have always believed in the underlying truth of evolution as the best explanation for the state of the world's flora and fauna; this book did little to advance my understanding or enthusiasm for it. In truth, the most engaging sections for me were the final few chapters in which the author provided a biography of his growth and development in the field peppered with various experiential, educational, and emotional struggles endured along the way... "
13,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59866852-anthony-poselenzny,3,Big chip on his shoulder This book is riddled with the authors resentments and jealousies as well as his name dropping and braggadocio. It’s a bit tough to take. Most of the book has enlightening evolutionary tidbits that must be extracted from this verbose muck. It’s all pretty interesting and applicable until the author believes he is smarter than nature and the evolution he teaches us. Then he becomes your typical egghead professor who loses touch with his own teachings as well as common sense. He could do with a big dose of self awareness.
14,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51224728-deepal,5,Great book for a non-scientists like meThis book and enlightened me in many ways. It allowed me to understand reasoning behind evolution theory and put it into my own words so I can explain it to myself clearly In simple language.It helped me develop an evolutionary perspective when observing human condition.It helped me see religions in better light and from the vantage point of evolutionary theory.
15,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42014146-vishnu-parupati,3,I am bit bored with initial chapters. But the later chapters are very interesting. I somehow manage to finish this book with good ease to connect dots from evolution to religion. 
16,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65057284-doug-robinson,5,Very accessible read on Evolutionary thought.
17,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13542057-friedrich-mencken,1,"Many interesting research examples and a wide array of topics are discussed in this book to give an overview of how wide ranging and useful evolutionary principles are to humans and society. Unfortunately I was very disappointed with how one sided many of the topics where presented.Wilson claims that because a relation can be seen between economic inequality and crime all you have to do is eliminate economic differences and you will not see substantial differences in crime between groups or populations. This is pure Marxism and implicitly denies evolution.If different environments cause different evolutionary pressures then populations that has evolved in different areas have to have different traits developed in different ways otherwise evolution does not work, ie to deny differences between populations is to deny evolution.I agree with Wilson that there is no genetic determinism for crime but the reality of human differences caused by evolution, demands different ways to address problems in society for different groups. There are reasons for success in a certain environment or society that goes beyond simplistic notions of wealth, luck or discrimination that make proposed solutions that solely take PC approved explanations into consideration completely useless. That is why all these efforts taken in western society have failed so miserably the last 60 years. It’s the emotional conviction about human uniformity coupled with a search for one mold fits all solutions that is leading to disaster.For more on this read the book Race, Evolution, and Behavior by Philippe Rushton.The chapter on intelligence and oral vs literate culture is using the old theory of cultural bias, all be it in a new way, to criticize the validity of intelligence as a concept and IQ tests as a tool and implicitly denies that it can measure ability or predict any type of performance. This have been shown time and time again to be a false notion and that certain people from oral cultures do very well on tests and others do not in comparison to literate groups and that the results of a well constructed test that is given in the correct way is an excellent way to predict performance. (See the research of Arthur R. Jensen) It have also been shown that intelligence is selected for by evolutionary pressures just like any other trait. This is very eloquently explained by Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending in the book The 10,000 Year Explosion using Jews as an example. Another point is that the traits needed for success in society should correspond to the traits tested for in order to predict success. If we have a literate society the traits needed for success should be what is tested for, which indeed it is.For more on this read The Bell Curve by Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray.When Wilson use tribes and pre-civilized groups as an example he neglects to tell you that much of the decision making is ruled by culture/tradition/religion/superstition/magic and not open to individual choice. Also most naturalist groups (all I know of) have a leadership hierarchy, usually with “elders” at the top and children at the bottom, similar to the chimpanzee example but (usually) based on merit and trust between the members as opposed to brute force of the chimpanzees.I have personally taken part in experiments on leadership and effective teams and find the section on groupthink very simplistic and misleading. Groups CAN function very well and outperform nominal groups but not so much depending on the task at hand but much more relating to group structure, leadership, communication, participation, decision making and mostly what type of group dynamic (strategy or technique) is created within the group in relation to the psychological profiles of the individuals comprising of the group. This makes groups a double edged sword that are much more difficult to manage and function satisfactory.You can consult pretty much any textbook on leadership and group dynamics for more on this.I really wanted to like this book but in my opinion Wilson is misrepresenting the science discussed in this book to fit his own personal convictions."
18,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/533671-steve,5,"I am writing this review while I am approximately halfway through Evolution for Everyone. Dr. Wilson has written an extremely compelling book about evolution. There are two aspects I find especially endearing: 1) Wilson does not use the standard, now-hackneyed strategy of writing a book on evolution that simply breaks up chapters into such topics as ""why do we laugh?"", ""why do we blush?"" ""how is a bee colony an organism in its own right?"" Instead, he begins with an overview of how evolutionary thinking can lead us to some startling (and startlingly accurate) predictions about the world. After a cogent overview of what he means by evolutionary thinking, he applies this unique brand of thinking to what we know about the world. [I have not yet reached the part of the book in which he discusses religion - which I look forward to.]2) Wilson backs up his lofty evolutionary theory with hard data and does not shy away from the knowledge that some things we think we know today will turn out to be wrong in the future. He reminds the reader that science is not a collection of facts, while simultaneously progresses by collecting facts. He does a great job of making this quasi-paradox disappear by referring repeatedly to the process of science and what science can and can't currently tell us about evolution. If you are the type of nonfiction reader who hates authors' interjecting their personal experiences and stories of their intellectual journeys into their nonfiction books, then you may be slightly put off by this book. I don't personally find the practice invasive. At times I wish nonfiction authors would actually inject more of themselves into their books; these are usually interesting people who have led a life of intellectual curiosity that would satisfy their readers' interest. "
19,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/806170-sarah,2,"I was facinated by the discussion of individuals acting as collective organisms (particularly the discussion of bees) and I found the discussion of cancer in terms of selfish cells intersting as well. One of the most interesting arguments of the book is that humanity's chief adaptation is cooperation, and that we operate like a collective organism. The author presents intersting evidence supporting the fact that our eyes evolved differently from chimps to aid this adaptation and various other examples supported by empirical data to support the assertion that an essential part of what makes us human is the propensity to cooperate.So much for the good. Now for the bad. Somehow in attempting to demonstrate how anyone can use evolutionary theory, the author comes across as very patronizing. I also think he overstates his case now and again. I am interested in the scientific experiments described in the book that show how evolution can shed light on the ""soft"" sciences, but sometimes, particulalry with his discussion of the evolutionary function of religion, the author doesn't offer enough science to back his conclusions. In one chapter he basically gives his manifesto for how countries should behave and whether or not you agree with him (as I tend to) you can't help but wonder what that has to do with evolution."
20,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10404161-alex-shrugged,4,"The author writes well and that makes ""Evolution for Everyone"" a pleasure to read whether you agree with the subject matter or not. Even though ""chapter one"" is really a preface. He can be forgiven. The author points out the various ways evolution has shaped how we have learned to think. While the author is in love with Darwinism he doesn't let fanaticism get in the way of a good presentation. I especially liked (and he proved to me) that people of the Middle Ages thought in a radically different way from the modern day because many people in the Middle Ages could not read and write. It wasn't just a lack of education. Writing materials, such as paper, were expensive. Thus writing was reserved for very important things. To compensate, one learned to memorize rather than write mundane things down on paper. As the mind became crowded with things to remember, they resorted to word association tricks for memorization. That changed the way they thought since the things they memorized had to remain less abstract. They were forced to be less abstract, actually, so as to not crowd out other memories.I'd read it again."
21,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2796168-shea-mastison,3,"This is a good book that explains the essential, and beneficial nature of applying the theory of evolution to every branch of the sciences. Not only that, but it also explains how evolution applies to the ""softer"" sciences; like sociology and psychology. This book has one considerable flaw, in my opinion. The author goes through considerable trouble and rather tedious gymnastic-style contortions to give religion a seal of approval. ""Nevermind facts,"" he seems to say, ""religion has been evolutionarily beneficial in our development as a species. So we must just allow it to function without being too critical of it."" And then he goes further to explain the sinister nature of ""secret"" religions like Objectivism!He goes a bit too far in trying to portray human existence as akin to living in a large hive-like community, and the book could do entirely without the autobiographical sketch of the author that makes up the bulk of the final chapter. If you're into science, and have a reasonable amount of patience, read this book."

It is easy to read and very entertaining. I have read a lot about evolutionary psychology before this book but I still learned a lot from it. Read it - there is something very special about it. It has a personal but still very academical style. David Sloan Wilson just immortalized himself with this book as an expert on evolutionary psychology.Cons: As you already know David Sloan Wilson is a strong supporter of group selection. Possibly because he receives money from The Templeton Foundation. He does tend to undermine some gene selection hypothesis in explaining certain human behaviors. But you can read about those in other evolutionary psychology books. And it does not make it a bad book - in any way. Group selection could actually explain some traits, in principle. But it's empirical basis mostly consists of ""Just-So Stories"". So it's not the most exiting scientific field."
23,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5062630-mantareads,4,"Very revolutionary and ambitious and audacious attempt at trying to bridge the very old chasm between the social sciences/humanities and the 'hard' sciences. Yet Wilson is far from your standard arrogant scientific rationalist of the Dawkins school. He argues for an open, intelligent consideration of evolution in all aspects of our lives, including in religion. In stark contrast to the fiery (and highly entertaining) expositions of Dawkins, Wilson approaches religion and a whole slew of related issues in a very approachable and amiable manner. I find his humility and openness very attractive qualities that we lack in the rhetoric-laced and often acrimonious exchanges of today. Evolution for Everyone offers a template for exactly that - a blueprint for how we can bring scientific theories and thinking back into our daily lives. Science for the everyman. I believe all of us have an innate curiosity of the natural world around us, which has been shut off by the exigencies (or excuses) of work and life. This book is a good place to start again!"

I've read Diamond, Boyer, and other scientists' books but this was harder due to his style. But by the last part it was much better. Chapter 27 was the most interesting to me. I love how he shows how evolution can be and should be used to study and explain all facets of life. "
27,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7252081-allison,3,"it was ok, but it took me forever to read so whenever he kept referring back to little stories or chapters from before I had already forgotten what the hell he was talking about. .. some of the comparative stories were helpful in understanding where he was coming from, but I just felt like his ideas never really became fully formed. he was dancing around topics a lot. nevertheless, this book was a jumping point for many new perspectives for me and I thank Wilson for writing it. maybe I'll read it again some time. I agree that we should be looking at human development from an evolutionary standpoint more often. we're just animals after all."
28,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9709441-claire,5,"This book is full of ""common sense"" insights, which when once pointed out with numerous scientific principals and empirical data to support the view, are made impossible to ignore. For me one of the most striking insights was the idea that the evolution of man, as pertaining to social / cultural development, is towards egalitarianism. Apparently the human ability to cooperate with each other appears to be the catalysis for this most hopeful state of human existence. Imagine, equality for all humans regardless of gender, race, status, whatever... Could this actually happen?! I highly appreciate the idea that it can."

The parts that I was able to wrap my head around were interesting, and I certainly found it worth powering through, as I often do with science books that are just slightly above my level.This is another time where I wish half stars were available.

269,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2455720-fpat-murray,5,"If I could force everyone in the world to read one book, this would be it. "
270,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2051258-josh,0,"An absolutely fantastic book great for anyone interested in evolution. I'm particularly interested in the evolution of cooperative behavior, and this book is the best explanation I've seen. Though I enjoy reading Dawkins, his selfish gene hypothesis has given too much support to those who believe that people are driven only by self interest. Wilson has a far more sophisticated analysis with enormous implications for the design of economic systems that will be able to confront the biophysical crisis faced by society."
271,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2671796-richard,0,"I was struck by the non-atomicity of organisms - how a single human's immune system, senses, emotions, reasoning ability, etc. overlap in space and time, but evolved piece-by-piece and capability-by-capability rather than being a top-down design with consciousness in control. Moreover, our life functions are integrated with processes that extend beyond our bodies. My ""wow"" was realizing the correlation between these overlapping life functions and the concepts of trans-human psychology and vital unconscious, with no mysticism required."
272,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3204605-chrissy,2,"I don't know how this book ended up on my to-read list and where I got the recommendation from, but simply shaking my head (and let me get one thing straight--I have mercilessly pursued the sciences since like the 8th grade and am obviously extremely fascinated by the process of evolution). The first half of this book is interesting because it reads like a shallow animal behavior 101 course, but I wasn't buying the rest of what Dr. Wilson was selling. And not to be a complete asshole, but I just couldn't STAND his writing--it was so self-congratulatory and self-involved. Bah!"
273,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5674968-keith-parrish,4,"Wilson raises some interesting points about the nature of evolution and goes beyond the standard biological aspect. He examines how human behavior and tendencies, including controversial subjects like humor, morality, altruism, and yes religion, have a basis in evolutionary science. While i don't know that I agree with all his conclusions, it does provide food for thought. I did find his tone to be rather self-congratulatory, self-serving and even a tad self-righteous. He also does a good bit of scientific name dropping. Just saying."
274,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4215097-john,4,Wilson write an accessible story of his efforts to expand the application of evolutionary theory in a multitude of useful applications across the entire spectrum of academia. I applaud his effort. William Meller is persuing the same efforts in medicine. Their efforts contain value beyond anyone's imagination. These days D. S. Wilson spends too much time chasing the dubious rabbit-trails of group selection and lamenting the failure of biologists to study Evolutionary Religions Studies (ERS). 
275,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/743198-rochelle,4,"Took me longer than a thought to get through, but I think worth it in the end. Some fascinating concepts that were new to me, but I wanted more. I think this book has inspired me to look into some other areas of life and how they relate to evolution. It was meant to target a non-scientific audience and I think he did a decent job. He had a habit of throwing out terms that he didn't define and that made it a little difficult to read at times. Sometimes it was over my head. "
276,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5976416-dan-kelly,4,"Very readable, presenting basic ideas clearly and slips in a few new ones at the same time. Particularly interesting is one of the most fleshed out ideas, inspired by multi level selection theory, that well organized cooperative groups, even human groups, are proto-organisms. It's the flipside of the idea that what we usually recognize as complex individual organisms are really complex groups that have very efficiently solved most of the problems that arise for cooperation."
277,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216684-john-pedersen,1,"Should be called ""I've Got an Axe to Grind and a Pedantic Superior Attitude and I'm Going to Foist Them on You Until You Surrender"". I'm a big fan of evolutionary theory, but very much not a fan, I've discovered, of David Sloan Wilson. I read the first six chapters, but the rubbing-the-wrong-way started immediately. I skipped around a little, and just gave up. It takes a lot for me to not finish a book, but this book had plenty of that."
278,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2965946-zarah,2,"I read this a few years ago while traveling to Ecuador and Galapagos. The author did a good job of making some of Darwin's most famous observations relevant to modern life and used terms the average high school student could understand. A nice fluffy way to freshen up on evolution, a little bit bland for daily entertainment reading."
279,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16233620-rachael-carmen,3,"It was a pretty good introductory book that explains various applications of evolutionary theory. I recommend this book for anyone that would like a basic understanding of evolutionary theory. Particularly, Wilson has a lot of fantastic examples that make it easy for the reader to understand various every-day phenomena from an evolutionary viewpoint. "
280,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/174646-janine-lund,5,"This book is the best and most fun explanation of evolution and how the theory opens up new perspectives on a wide range of fields, such as psychology and morality and religion. It describes fascinating experiments and multiple resources. It is fun and I am reading it for a second time right now."
281,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39193-markus,4,good for general audience. theres some interesting takes on academic strategies for teaching evolution. DS Wilson runs the EvoS program at Binghamton. If i was in HS right now i would definitely apply there.
282,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/809832-ashley,1,"This book was arrogant and closed minded. Basically the premise is that literally everything human can be explained in terms of evolution, and anyone who cannot except this, is delusional. As someone who enjoys studying evolution, I felt this book went too far, and had a condescending tone. "
283,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1153513-frank-roberts,3,"Very interesting and very accessible to a general audience. The author introduced a bit too much of his own life and personality into the book, which might be a draw to someone else but for me was a distraction. "
284,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1402401-randy,2,"This was an interesting read, for as much of it as I read. The author comes off as a little on the arrogant side much of the time, but while I can't say I agree with all of his claims, he does make some good points."
285,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1000683-kilt,5,"Amazing book, chock-full of fascinating information! It was so good I devoured it, and then as soon as I was done, I went back and read it all the way through again. Excellent and highly reccommended!"
286,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2509415-elizabeth,2,"Would have been a great textbook, but too wordy for a bookshelf read. I kept skimming through it to pick up the main points because I didn't need all the extra comparison's and details. I would have liked for it to be more thought provoking. "
287,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8386525-briankiwi,4,"Plenty to ponder here, even for those who already have a solid grounding in evolutionary theory, and a refreshing reminder that generalists can still make contributions, given a sufficiently powerful theoretical framework within which to operate."
288,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33177343-david-l-pez,4,"A very inspiring book which can change the way you think the world. After this book I am not only in love with the Evolution Theory, but also I want to made a contribution to the scientific knowledge using this."
289,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3967110-tom-roth,3,"Nice, informatieve book about natural selection. The last chapters, however, seem a bit pseudoscientific and some of the hypotheses are far-fatched. Surprisingly, Wilson's selection-based hypotheses seem always to explain with the data."
290,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35881103-rui,3,"Oh man, he really had a hard time on the fight between religion and Darwin. Or he really took the struggles of religious people very seriously, much more than the supposed-to-be more interesting researches. However, the description is quite a flow. It's easy to read and to understand. "
291,0385340214,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53031-leonardo,3,"The writing was a bit chunky (too much ""I did This"" for a science book...) but some of the info was well presented and useful."
