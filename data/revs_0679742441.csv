At least, I don't think so. Unless these are all the names of angels. As regards the book itself, since I sold my copy via Amazon to some geezer in Salt Lake City years ago, I can't remember much about it, so I'm just kind of busking here. This is a bad review. Talking just to be talking, you know. Because I'm reading some long books right now & it'll be ages before I can say anything about those. But that makes me wonder. Because, how we die on Goodreads is .... we suddenly stop responding to messages... stop adding books ... never finish another ""currently reading"".... no, it's too awful to contemplate. Our partners (if book geeks actually have partners) would never bother logging into our GR account and posting ""It is with deep regret that we announce the passing of Barkybarkywoofwoof from cirrhosis of the liver with complications, no flowers please"". Man visits his doctor. Doctor says ""I've got some bad news, and I'm afraid I've got some even worse news."" Guys says ""Okay, I'll have the even worse news first."" Doctor says ""Okay, you have terminal cancer. The other news is that you also have Alzheimer's."" Guy takes a deep breath and says ""Okay - well, at least I haven't got terminal cancer."""
1,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82829-abeer-hoque,4,"On the back of ""How We Die"" Doris Lessing writes it's a must read for anyone over 50. I say anyone over 35. Because you might still have time then to internalise all the dying lessons Dr. Nuland has to teach, and you're past those forever twenties. We've got three score and ten years and most of that could be healthy, but after that, the remainder of our body life is borrowed and breaking down. Towards that end, Dr. Nuland urges us to measure quality of life against mechanical extensions of life, value peace of mind over medical miracles (because your surgeon sure as hell won't), and hold our connections with loved ones above everything. Live your life well, he says, because the end will probably not be pretty, and you want the people around you to remember everything else. Chapter by morbid chapter, and with intimate compassion and poetry, Dr. Nuland charts the major ways we die, all of which have to do with failures of oxygen supply, one way or another: heart attacks and strokes, old age, suicide, murder, accident, Alzheimers, AIDS and other viruses, cancer. The title alone was enough to give me (and everyone around me) pause, when I pulled the book out in public. We should all learn as much as we can about our bodies, their strengths, and their inevitable failings. It will help us deal more gracefully, or at least more knowingly, with the end. This book is as good a place as any to start. "
2,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/321673-jamie-collins,4,"This book is an attempt by the author, a surgeon, to de-mystify the process of death. He feels that our modern expectation of a ""death with dignity"" leads to increased suffering when we confront the ugly reality: most people don't experience a peaceful, pain-free death; they don't die at home surrounded by their loved ones; they don't utter profound last words of comfort to those they leave behind.He offers detailed, technical descriptions of the most common mechanisms of death, including vivid, disturbing details of the various indignities experienced by the dying. He enhances his narrative with deeply moving stories of the end-of-life experiences of his own patients, friends and family members. Alongside the medical details and anecdotes the author waxes philosophical. He talks about the need for the old to die so that the young can prosper. He is appreciative of modern medicine's ability to improve and prolong life, but he expresses concern that a doctor's drive to diagnose and cure can override his duty to provide the most appropriate care when the end of his patient's life becomes inevitable. The book was published in 1993 but only seems out of date in the anguished chapter on AIDS.I was entranced by the technical details and moved to tears by some of the author's personal stories, but his philosophical musings seemed a bit repetitive after a while. Overall a very good book, 4.5 stars."
3,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12504301-paul-corrigan,4,"I felt compelled to reread HOW WE DIE, starting with the chapters on Cancer, after my wife passed away from an aggressive form of breast cancer. Doctor Nuland is right on when he talks about how the specialists, for whom a disease such as cancer becomes a great riddle to solve, somehow withdraw from the patient's presence when the disease they are trying to interdict cannot be stopped with the assortment of chemo drugs and radiation therapy they have in their tool box. Yes, tool box seems like an appropriate metaphor because chemo therapy with the way it devastates the body gives the whole process of treatment a clunky rattling sense to it. Even in the best of treatment centers with the caring technicians, nurses and doctors, the process of getting well is not very pretty, doling out its share of suffering and pain. Doctor Nuland knows this only too well and his sensitive prose explores that point in such treatment when it is best to start exploring other options, such as hospice care. I must say, however, that my wife's oncologists were caring and sensitive, while she was the subject of their attempts to find the right chemo drugs to slow down, and even beat back for a time, the relentless onslaught of an aggressive, triple negative tumor. It was after she was released and returned home, to die shortly after the last treatment at the cancer center, that the oncologists seem to lose interest. Dr. Nuland talks at length about the moment when the specialists pack up their tool kits and it becomes time for the generalists, the GP's and the hospice care nurses and therapists to work their compassion and relieve the pain that the disease has wrought. It is in this arena that Doctor Nuland's humanity and compassion shines through. "

It takes the piss out of heroics,and science, and the Dignified Death; it harshly regards the coldness of medical personnel dedicated to solving what the author calls the Riddle and ignoring the needs of the person that provides it. He is hard on doctors, and hard on himself. Some books please, some entertain, some disappoint. Few,though, change you, and this is one of them. It came at a time when I needed it, when I wasin the process of losing a dear family member. It made me value her life more and, also, my own."
5,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35732074-sean-wyn,4,"It's hard not to compare this to Kalanithi's When Breath Becomes Air. Like Kalanithi, Nuland is a surgeon who has written a book exploring themes/ideas surrounding death. Nuland's account is a lot less personal; for one, he didn't experience dying as he wrote the text. His inspiration for writing was not his own mortality but rather the result of decades upon decades of watching his own patients suffer through the so-called ""hidden"" process of dying. Nuland explores the more common ways that most Americans die in his account, explaining the many possible processes of dying in scientific terms while also weaving in his personal experience and insight.One thing I really liked was how Nuland pointed out how attitudes toward death have changed with the advents of modern medicine, how physicians today focus more on achieving victory in indivudalized cases rather than accepting death as inevitable. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, but an consequence of this is that death has become more concealed from society, so to speak. Since we have the technology to stave off death longer and longer, physicians and society in general have a need to ""hide"" the process of dying in the cases where they fail to slow it, decreasing the frequency of their visits to patients once it's clear that they don't have much time left. This is a pretty stark contrast to the 19th century, where it was the norm for people to drop dead like flies, often in the comforts of their own homes. Doctors then focused more on helping patients die in a comfortable, dignified manner rather than try to combat death in the first place. Most people today still want their long-term dying process to be dignified, but Nuland points out that this often isn't the case, relating a memory where a man with Alzheimer's had to be cleaned of his own feces the year he died.Nuland's conclusion that we try to have the best death possible by living the best life possible might seem unsatisfactory, but this is ultimately the most that anyone can hope for in the wildly unpredictable process of death."
6,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett,2,"My Dad is ninety-three. I bought this book to share with him some time ago as we have been grappling with the Inevitably of Death for some time now. He is relatively healthy and he has always counted on living at least until ninety-six, the age his father died. But this past year his sharp mind has begun to notice his body lagging somewhat. He likes to have his “four wheeler” to help him get around and dozes more frequently sitting in his chair. “Maybe I won’t make it to ninety-six,” he says. I travel from Virginia to Michigan to visit him in his assisted living facility every six to eight weeks. He devoured How We Die: Reflections on Life’s Final Chapter in several days during one of my visits last year. But I had never read it until now.This 1993 book is over twenty years old and with the medical advances in that time you might think that makes this book out of date. But that is not completely true. For example, the book states that “coronary heart disease is America’s number one killer, as it is in every industrialized country of the world.” This is still the case today. In 1993, stroke was the third leading cause of death; today it ranks fourth. The life expectancy (all races, both sexes) was 75.5 years in 1993 and 78.7 years in 2010. (Source: http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A000514...) This 4.2% increase in longevity, while a significant change in when we die, does not, I think, change how we die. I will speak more of the out-of-date factor at the end of the review.We sometimes laugh about death and dying. I think that is a good sign. It shouldn’t scare us to death, if I can use that phrase. My Dad and I have laughed about it as well as talking about his Living Will and DNR order. Here is something from a GR review that shows how we joke about death:  Man visits his doctor. Doctor says “I’ve got some bad news, and I’m afraid I’ve got some even worse news.” Guy says “Okay, I’ll have the even worse news first.” Doctor says “Okay, you have terminal cancer. The other news is that you also have Alzheimer’s.” Guy takes a deep breath and says “Okay – well, at least I haven’t got terminal cancer.” It is January 2014 and singer Pete Seeger has just died at the age of 94. One report is that he died of “natural causes.” You do not hear that very often; it seems we are not allowed to officially die of simple old age. “He was just chopping wood last week,” we are told. And we are pleased to hear that.Everyone wants a dignified death. But author, Dr. Sherwin Nuland, is not much of a believer in death with dignity, thinking from his experience that it “should not be expected by any but a very few people.” He says at the outset, “The quest to achieve true dignity fails when our bodies fail.” Is it possible that dignity is something that has become more achievable with the passage of time, medical advances and the availability of skilled hospice care? At the end of the book he talks about The Riddle: Every medical specialist must admit that he has at times convinced patients to undergo diagnostic or therapeutic measures at a point in illness so far beyond reason that The Riddle might better have remained unsolved. Too often near the end, were the doctor able to see deeply within himself, he might recognize that his decisions and advice are motivated by his inability to give up The Riddle and admit defeat as long as there is any chance of solving it. Though he be kind and considerate of the patient he treats, he allows himself to push his kindness aside because the seduction of The Riddle is so strong and the failure to solve it renders him so weak. What is the job of the doctor and what is Dr. Nuland trying to do in this book?We can only give people the hope they will not die alone if we are totally honest with them about what is happening to their bodies. If a physician from the very beginning of a patient's downhill course allows that patient to become a partner in the knowledge of what is going on, there is no sudden moment when he has to say, 'well, there is nothing more we can do""; there is no sudden moment when she has to turn to a family and say, 'shall I tell this patient?' Dr. Nuland is trying to share with the reader what is going on with the bodies suffering from the most common causes of death. But the fact is that this book contains medical information that is over twenty years old. The success and validity of the approach is threatened by the use of information that the reader is not able to trust to be the most accurate and thus may not be the most empowering. How We Die gives us a glimpse of an approach that can benefit the dying when put into practice by a medical system equipped with the most up to date information. I need to go right now and reread Sherwin Nuland’s 2007 book  The Art of Aging . In the meantime, I am going to give How We Die only two stars: four stars for the concept but one star for being significantly out of date with the implementation data. I hope Nuland’s 2007 book brings his idea successfully into the 21st century. So who is this pessimist about finding a dignified death, this Dr. Nuland? I was surprised to find him on the World Wide Web giving a TED talk about, get this, HOPE! See his twelve minute 2003 talk at http://www.ted.com/talks/sherwin_nula.... "

The bastard offspring of their hyperactive (albeit asexual) “fornicating” are without the resources to do anything but cause trouble and burden the hardworking community around them. Like their progenitors, they are reproductive but not productive. As individuals, they victimize a sedate, conforming society.Cancer cells do not even have the decency to die when they should. All nature recognizes that death is the final step in the process of normal maturation. Malignant cells don’t reach that point—their longevity is not finite.” Excerpt FromHow We DieSherwin B. NulandThis book is full of difficult subject matter on end of life causes and it won the National Book Award for Non-Fiction some 25 years ago.Although this read feels dated today, since both cancer treatments and treatment of HIV have progressed significantly, the conclusions about awareness of end of life decisions and hospice are still spot on.The author, Stewart Nuland, who has since passed away from prostrate cancer was the head of the Yale Medical School. He suffered from mental depression. I don’t know if he wrote this book in a dark place but although it is science based, it is also brutally frank about the pain and discomfort that most dying patients face in their last days and months. 4 stars. Very informative book that is both enlightening and sobering. Best read when in the right place emotionally."

9,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/122610-jef-sneider,4,"Sherwin Nuland, MD, was a well known and successful surgeon at Yale Medical Center for many years. In this book he begins to describe, literally, the way we die. In detail, he explains how infection and cancer and heart disease ravage the body and cause essential systems to fail. As a physician, I found it interesting, but I did not think I would finish the book if that was all there was to it.Then the book began to hold my attention as it developed into an exploration of how people deal with dying, a very different question from how we physically die. Dr. Nuland does a beautiful job with Alzheimer's disease using the slow deterioration of a friend as his example. He helps the reader understand not only the disease, but what the disease process does to the family and friends of the one afflicted. What was most interesting to me as he made his segue into HIV/AIDS, was how his own values as an old time surgeon began to conflict with evolving codes of ethics, patient and family expectations and modern medical practice. After all, while he trained in the era when the doctor and family could collude to keep the true nature of an illness hidden from a patient, he also was part of a generation of surgeons who saw incredible progress in his field. He repeatedly recognizes that modern medicine can go too far, causing and prolonging suffering when treatment is futile, and yet he tells poignant stories about his own close family in which he cannot stop himself from offering that last sliver of hope even if it means risky surgery or incapacitating chemotherapy.He is honest. He admits that sometimes physicians are more interested in solving ""The Riddle"" of the patient's illness even if diagnostic and treatment efforts are unlikely to help relieve suffering. This type of care and thinking are most often to be found in the academic medical center such as the one in which he worked. Academic physicians have a duty to the patient, but they also have a duty to learn and study. Helping the dying patient to an easy death may not always be their priority. But times are changing. The pendulum has swung from the paternalistic physician who could withhold critical information or pursue treatment regardless of the patient's wishes to the empowered patient who can demand treatment even when it is futile or refuse treatment even when it might be life saving. Nuland recognizes the value of the primary care physician to help guide patients through confusing and complicated medical decisions but he only gives this recognition one sentence. He doesn't trust the empowered patient to make correct decisions. He reserves the right to argue, and he admits to using some unfair tactics to get his way. The physician still has power in the relationship.As a primary care physician I had to cringe as he put his own brother through dangerous and difficult surgery even though the chance of cure was close to zero. He asks himself why, after the fact, but he has no good answer. He didn't want to admit, given all the tools of modern medicine and his own prowess as a surgeon (he did not do the surgery) that nothing could be done to save him. He did not want to give up hope, so instead he held out false hope. This book is very easy to read and understand. Nuland does a great job making complex pathophysiology understandable. Unfortunately he could not get past his own guilt and we spend too much time hearing rationalizations for his aggressive (think academic surgeon) treatment of some of his patients. I recommend the book for those interested in how the body works, or doesn't, and how people think about and react to illness and dying. The section on Alzheimer's disease is excellent and beautifully written. The book also gives insight into the mind of the academic surgeon.And, should you ever be in a life threatening situation where difficult decisions have to be made, if time permits I would also recommend a conversation with your primary care physician. It is good to get more than one opinion."

It helped us all live with Mum's condition, has since helped through the passing of other close people and I hope will help us in turn to understand what is likely to happen.

11,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7281872-rebecca,4,"A truly enlightening read for those who want to either know more about the physiological processes of terminal diseases, those with a family member or loved one suffering from one of the six common pathways to death Nuland outlines, or even those who simply wish to expose themselves in a relatively removed environment to the mysterious process of their ultimate fate, How We Die explores just that- the physical, mental, and emotional processes one goes through on the journey to the other side. Nuland attempts to break down the myth of dying as a dignified process so often described by ""poets, essayists, chroniclers, wags, and wise men,"" who ""often write about death but have rarely seen it...[whereas] Physicians and nurses, who see it often, rarely write about it."" Stripped to the core, the ultimate death encountered by all is the deprivation of oxygen which shuts down our core vital centers. No matter which disease or illness one is dying from, our existence as obligate aerobes is our ultimate death sentence, for without oxygen we have no life. For those unaware of the physical turmoils each of these six detailed death sentences encompasses- heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer's (dementia), murder (including suicides and accidents), AIDS, and cancer- Nuland provides an opportunity to walk away with perhaps a more proper dose of understanding and empathy in a world that isolates these victims almost as easily and ambitiously as one quarantines a leper. For those, including myself, who have had the opportunity to observe and endure the deaths of both loved ones and strangers, this book offers validation and biological reasoning to the emotions one feels and the physical signs one witnesses as life passes over from one world to another.Although Nuland's intentions were to ""demythologize the process of dying,"" it is quite difficult to walk away from this book leaving death's grandeur as a mere image of the past. Though he does an excellent job, for both the medically-minded and lay readers, of explaining the undignified physical and physiological tolls disease takes upon one's body, I still remain in awe of this completely natural and life-changing process- both literally for the victim and figuratively for the observer. I cannot deny the immense suffering we as family members and they as victims endure, no amount of literature or scientific proof can ever ease this experience of pain. However, my medical mind cannot deny the abstract beauty that is the process of our cellular beings shutting down- the literal inability for hemoglobin to carry oxygen to keep our most vital centers functioning, the ultimate lack of circulation to bring blood to our hearts and glucose to our brains. These simple acts we take for granted everyday without giving a second thought to them are the same simple acts that cause our hearts to stop beating. And perhaps they are not simple at all, but rather so intensely intricate that true understanding of our design by the ultimate Creator can never be really be grasped. No matter what your beliefs, thoughts, or opinions are on the process of dying, I highly recommend this book to any and all who wish to understand in more detail their time on this earth and their connection to the rest of humanity.

13,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2327546-bob-hoffman,4,"It’s not new (1993), but Sherwin Nuland’s How We Die is a timely treatise on what’s going on under the hood when humans die. We all have to leave this world sooner or later, whether by heart attack, stroke, cancer, or accident, but in our culture, it’s not that common to think about or speak of our own demises. Most of us act, instead, as if we will live forever.In these days there is also a tendency to hide death from view, particularly in nursing homes and hospitals. (As of 1993, 80% of American deaths took place in hospitals, up from 50% in 1949.) And in many of those cases people live out their last days isolated from family and friends attached to ventilators in intensive care units. That isn’t what most of us envision for ourselves. Instead, the greatest percentage of Americans prefer to believe that they will die at home with family nearby.Dr. Nuland’s message to readers is that it is time to take the blinders off. Enjoy life, by all means. Live life to the fullest. But also spend time learning about the ways that people die, and prepare while living for one’s end. We all want dignity in dying, he says. But it is not in the last weeks or days that we compose the message that will be remembered, but in all the decades that preceded them.I picked this up at a library book sale, expecting to read it and then give it back. Instead, I am putting it on my bookshelf. This is a book and a message that I want to keep nearby."

Through the eyes of American surgeon Sherwin B. Nuland, the book examines the current state of healthcare (first published in 1994 but most of what he mentioned in the book is still applicable), analyses the moments when his patients walk on the thin string between life and death scientifically (his anecdote and narrative are both mesmerising and haunting), suggests how we can take control the final days of ourselves and our loved ones.My deep dark fear for death does not be blown away after finishing this book but it has been altered since then, less fear but more acceptance, gratitude and self-improvement.I read the Vietnamese edition (which has some minor errors in spelling and repetitive phrases) but I can't deny how impactful this book is to me, which is one of the very few books I can confidently say so.___[2019] Cái chết luôn là một nỗi sợ hãi thường trực đầy ẩn khuất đối với riêng mình.

Hơn cả, bác tác giả có một sự nhạy cảm mà khi đọc, không cần hô hào nhưng vẫn cảm giác được cái trăn trở làm nghề.Mình cũng tự hỏi, không biết các sinh viên hay người làm lâu trong ngành y có biết gì về quyển này không? Vì nó thật sự đáng trong danh sách phải đọc. Có những điều, ví dụ như cứu chữa cật lực, chưa chắc đã là chuyện nên làm. Hơn 400 trang nhưng thật sự mình cứ chỉ muốn nó dày hơn nữa.Tuy vậy, bản thân khi đọc sách dịch vẫn khó chịu ở các lỗi không đáng có. Dù quyển này dịch rất ổn nhưng lỗi chính tả ít nhưng vẫn rải rác; lỗi lặp từ thì cứ liên tục, nhất là vào chương cuối và câu cú vẫn dài loằng ngoằng.Rating tuyệt đối cốt là để bày tỏ sự tôn trọng cho bản gốc của tác giả và lâu lâu đọc được sách y khoa hay thì sướng thật sự."

Dr. Nuland writes from years of experience on the topic of death, and how really there is no dignity to it. he explores this myth of 'ars moriendi' (the art of dying) and both the pathophysiology and mental/emotional states that accompany it. he argues against the modern 'hospital' death devoid of feeling, he reproaches biomedicine for it's mistakes in prolonging the lives of their patients for their benefit in solving the Riddle, and not for the patient's best interest... ""I have no real quarrell with those who insist upon invoking the laboratory-bred specificity of microscopic pathology in order to satisfy the compulsive demands of the biomedical worldview - I simply think they miss the point."" he explores both his mental processes and emotional ones with personal vignettes. he writes with knowledge of pathophysiology, etymology, history, literature and most importantly, humanity.  ""it is inherent in the art of medicine to appreciate that the testing and medications are of limited usefulness without the talking."" ""The diginity that we seek in dying must be found in the dignity with which we have lived our lives. Ars moriendi is ars vivendi: the art of dying is the art of living."" "

18,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12658-lydia,5,"Nuland died last year at 94 years of age. He wrote “How We Die” as a surgeon in New Haven Connecticut in his 70s looking back on his career and his life. What makes this book stand above most others, is Nuland’s wisdom and wonderful ability to write about how death has affected him both personally when dealing with family members’ deaths, but also outlining how his patients have died from different types of diseases, giving us a full, frank picture of the details and ways we could die personally—what those final weeks and moments are like. I assume most people turn to this book, when they have experienced a death of a family member and realize there is so much they don’t know about death. This was true for me. Nuland outlines the most common forms of death, step-by-step, arteriosclerosis, cancer, alzheimers, and the many forms each take, such as strokes, heart attacks, cancer, AIDS, pneumonia and the general implosion caused by aging. And he talks about why egocentric doctors go into medicine: it is to solve riddles and problems. Finally he has wonderful sections on “hope” and “lessons learned.” It is a gem of a book. The dignity we seek in dying must be found in the dignity, beauty and grace in which we have lived our lives. It takes chapters of kind explanation to arrive at this conclusion—for this reason, it is best to read this book when you need it. To listen to him talk about hope anytime, listen to his TED talk http://www.ted.com/talks/sherwin_nula... "
19,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2173066-patrick-peterson,3,"6 Jan. 2019 - Wow - what a book.I read this book because my folks are 89 and having difficulties, plus many aunts, uncles and pretty close friends died this last year and another friend wrote a very short, but very compelling review here on Goodreads (Reena Kapoor - Thanks Reena). This book was DEFINITELY worth reading for the reasons I mentioned above. But reading it, I found many more reasons why it was worth spending the time to savor it. Here are just some of the reasons, even though I know this is a fairly long list:- The opening description of the author's contact with his first patient... and first death - an incredibly ""gripping"" in more ways than one description of a heart attack.- Amazing prose. The author has a fantastic style of writing. REALLY good.- Seneca quotation on suicide - excellent. Wise relevant words from this ancient philosopher.- Personal, intimate additional descriptions of various deaths that explain what was medically going on. His descriptions were indeed shocking, but not like a slasher movie. They were clinical but also very compassionate. Hard to describe how he did it, but you will probably be amazed and impressed and enlightened too.- One of the biggest reasons why he wrote the book, and what I was hoping to get out of it, which I did, is that he tried explicitly to explain the facts about what actually happens to people and their loved ones, as well as doctors and nurses while people die. This knowledge can turn into power, since it takes away the terror of the unknown! Think about this. Isn't the terror of the unknown what many people are so frightened about? When they learn about the facts of what actually happens, they become stronger and more able to deal with it. I remember how frightened I was about cataract surgery before I went through it. Well, the Dr. had was fantastic about realizing this for most of his patients, so he wrote a book about all the details about how to prepare, what is actually going to happen during the operation and what happens afterwards! Bingo - that did the trick. It lessened my anxiety (if not fear) about the operation at least 50%. He also put some extra info and videos of actual operations and diagrams, etc. on his website that I (and other patients) could view, answering even more questions I had that the book could not quite do the job on. Those lessened my remaining anxiety even more. All this was in addition to the verbal descriptions of everything from him and his assistants. Fantastic. That is partly what this book does too for dying people and their loved ones who care so much about them.-More information about sepsis and how deadly this can be - But I still need more info on this.- The compassion the author shows toward the dying and their loved ones and medical staff - AND how this did not get in the way of his being ruthlessly honest about some motivations of some doctors and the reasons why they may act the way they do. Very insightful and helpful for all. Not always right, but I will explain my critique a bit later.Some questionable things about the book:--------------------------------It was written in 1994, so quite a few things have changed since then, technology, medicines, techniques, procedures, mores, economic conditions such as the general wealth of society, etc.He gave his readers an update in the edition I read's final ""Coda"" chapter, and that helped a lot in clarifying what he thought was important to change, what did and did not change and some specific things that put his philosophy in more clarity than in the rest of the book. And for the most part, I was MUCH more disappointed about his values and lack of insight or foolish ideas on economics, and what can and does make conditions better for medical patients in general and on many specifics.- Economics is about acting man/woman and their choices - it is NOT just about $ and cents. It is NOT just about capital and companies. Because the author was ignorant of basic economics, he misstated some very important problems and his ""solutions"" were well off the mark and some actually more harmful than helpful. Despite his wonderful economic insight when stating: ""that perennial solvent of reluctance, a handful of dollars."" he was far from consistent about his economic statements. He far too often showed a very nasty bias against private voluntary economic incentives and benefits, especially vis a vis coercive government involvement. He seemed almost totally oblivious to coercive government mandates, licences, regulations, subsidies, etc. as the cause of so much wrong in healthcare. He conflated some bad reactions in the private sector with those government causes. Sure they do appear to be all mixed up and interrelated. But there are primary causes and secondary reactions. Confusing the two certainly causes harm by making things worse.- I really liked much of the author's philosophy on dying and suicide, but I think he equivocates on some specifics and acts a bit holier than thou in his scorn for some individuals and organizations. That is not to say that his cautions for action on assisted suicide are not genuine and important, they are. But he seemed to fudge certain issues in my mind.- his statistics and discussion of guns/gun control was very sad and not well done - especially in light of the situation today, when so many foolish and counterproductive laws are being proposed and/or passed.- I am not sure about this statement: ""suicide—a very large proportion of the elderly men and women who kill themselves do it because they suffer from quite remediable depression. With proper medication and therapy, most of them would be relieved of the cloud of oppressive despair that colors all reason gray, would then realize that the edifice topples not quite so much as thought, and that hope of relief is less hopeless than it seemed. I have more than once seen a suicidal old person emerge from depression, and rediscovered thereby a vibrant friend. When such men or women return to a less despondent vision of reality, their loneliness seems to them less stark and their pain more bearable because life has become interesting again and they realize that there are people who need them. "" I need more information on this. Does a ""very large proportion of the elderly"" that commits suicide actually ""suffer from quite remediable depression"" - or are they just being more realistic than Dr. Nuland thinks? Is this statement true or just showing his arrogance at how realistically depressing some situations actually are?- His history of the Flexner Report and the government controls, licensing and involvement that it recommended and came about from it showed the worst part of Sherwin Nuland's philosophical, historical and economic understanding. This was probably one of the worst things to hit the American public, the opposite of what Nuland believes. But to understand why would take quite a bit. So other books and articles are needed.I have much more to say about this book, positive and negative, but I have gone on too long as it is.I bet you can tell that I recommend the book pretty highly. But don't read it without some caution, since he slips in some significant errors that can be harmful from time to time. As Hippocrates said: ""First, do no harm.""If the book had no Coda chapter, I probably would have given it 4 stars, which is usually my highest rating. But since the Coda chapter brought out so many errors in the philosophy political/economic, if not moral, by the author, I really can't give it more than three stars, despite how good all the book before that was (except for some select little parts).Here is the author on why he wrote the book, and the biggest value I got out of it, though I got more of this too, and really appreciated all: Early in the book: ""I have written this book to demythologize the process of dying."" and about half-way through: ""Accurate knowledge of how a disease kills serves to free us from unnecessary terrors of what we might be fated to endure when we die. We may thus be better prepared to recognize the stations at which it is appropriate to ask for relief, or perhaps to begin contemplating whether to end the journey altogether."""
20,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4158121-sarah,3,"It’s no secret or surprise that much of my processing and understanding of life happens through reading. I’ve been a bibliophile since birth (literally– one of my dad’s proudest moments as a father was reading to me on the day that I was born); books are the primary way in which I explore the world, grapple with emotion, and make sense of the human condition. So, naturally, after the death of my grandfather on January 26th, one of my first instincts was to find the right story for this time in my life. ‘How We Die’ is simultaneously a scientific and academic exploration of bodily processes and their various forms of breakdown, as well as a philosophical reflection on the ways in which we try to cope with the mortality of ourselves and those we love. Dr. Sherwin Nuland walks us through the most notorious killers – heart failure, Alzheimer’s, trauma, HIV/AIDS, cancer, etc. – so that we may better understand what’s really happening as the body fights for life and, ultimately, surrenders to death. I think it’s important to note that while Nuland did add a brief coda in 2010, it’s possible that much of this book is outdated from a medical standpoint. I’m no doctor, but I do know that medicine advances every day as our understanding of the human body becomes more nuanced and our technologies allow for more efficient and effective treatments. Published in 1994, this book is obviously not reflective of knowledge gained in the last 25 years. It would be interesting to read an update knowing all that we do now about these same diseases, despite the fact that several seem to remain quite mysterious. One thing I did find particularly interesting about this book (that is as timeless as it is fascinating) was Nuland’s focus on what it means to ‘die with dignity’ and whether or not that’s even possible or something we should obsess over to the extent that we do. He also explored the concept of hope and what that means in the context of terminal diagnoses.My grandfather was 89 years old. Many things killed him, and now I have a better grasp of the mechanisms by which he died. Once again the right book found me at the right time in my life, and I am grateful. Obviously books don’t take away emotional pain or change the circumstances of real life, but they do have the power to put things in context, to shift perspective, or, if nothing else, simply to validate the struggles in which we find ourselves day after day as we do our best to navigate and exist in this strange, magnificent world."
21,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43522572-kim,5,"The writing and story-telling captivated me from the first to the last sentence of this book, including the epilogue. I haven’t been up-to-date on the medical sciences since this book was written in 1994, so I can’t speak to the accuracy of the sciences and techniques, although I think the basics are still valid. I cried at the heartfelt stories because they conveyed successfully the author’s point of view as a medical doctor and as a writer. But there were parts of the book where the technical details were overwhelming, but those details were necessary for the readers to understand the dying process. I love the way this book references art, history, technology, science and ethics. •	But the fact is, death is not a confrontation. It is simply an event in the sequence of nature’s ongoing rhythms. Not death but disease is the real enemy, disease the malign force that requires confrontation.•	Life is dappled with periods of pain, and for some of us is suffused with it. In the course of ordinary living, the pain is mitigated by periods of peace and times of joy. In dying, however, there is only the affliction. Its brief respites and ebbs are known always to be fleeting and soon succeeded by a recurrence of the travail. The peace, and sometimes the joy, that may come occurs with the release. In this sense, there is often a serenity—sometimes even a dignity—in the act of death, but rarely in the process of dying.•	The art of dying is the art of living. The honesty and grace of the years of life that are ending is the real measure of how we die."

Some of the technical descriptions of major bodily functions are gripping, especially from the underlying perspective of their eventual failure towards death.

It was comfort in the brutal transparency and absolute universal reality of death as someone I loved so deeply was actually experiencing it. A must read."

We die, in turn, so that others may live. The tragedy of a single individual becomes, in the balance of natural things, the triumph of ongoing life. All of this makes more precious each hour of those we have been given; it demands that life must be useful and rewarding.""I remember being younger and being captivated by the idea of death. I remember how I would spend countless hours contemplating the meaning of life in the presence of death. How I would try to grasp what it means to die, and in the hold of death, what it means to live. What I came to realize, and what still rings true to me today, is that so much of our lives has a lot to do with the fact that one day our journey must end. In knowing our clocks stop ticking at one point in time, we realize the necessity to live life to the fullest. Yet, no matter how well we may have lived, how successful a life we may have led, how many seeds we've planted and watched flourish under the sun, death is seemingly still unwelcome. It remains a poignant truth that the heart nor the mind can never be truly and completely satiated and satisfied. In this grand complex beautiful world, there is always more to see, more to do, and more to chase. Even as we age and the years become decades, we continuously renew and rehash our identities, making living a continual desire. And so, death then becomes a foe of some kind, one that we bury deep within our minds for later, one that we avoid at all costs. But as we strive for life and actively try to sidestep death, Dr. Nuland poses the question - have we lost touch with our natural course of life? This book has inspired deep thought within me. Both as a layperson and a medically-oriented individual, this book has been thoroughly thought-provoking. Death is what we face at the end of this long journey. It is the finale to every day, week, month, and year that preceded it. And in the modern world, it is the enemy of the medical field. As our knowledge base and expertise has progressed they have paved the path forward to a world wherein our lives are longer and in many ways better than ever before. But there is a cost to be paid for this, one that underpins this book - that we have grown more fearsome and aversive of death than ever before.  ""Dying is ugly and dirty, he points out, and we do not easily tolerate anymore what is ugly and dirty. Death is therefore to be secluded and to occur in sequestered places. Nowadays, the style is to hide death from view.""The hospital has become a vehicle with the purpose, among others of course, to curtail the encroaching steps of death knocking on the door. The trouble comes in when we use extreme measures that are ultimately futile in hopes of elongating life. This book asks that we reexamine our view of death and reconsider the extents we take to avoid it. It asks that we rekindle our relationship with death as a necessary part of life. A hard task to accomplish, but one that we must tackle. Death is made easier by a life lived well. That is what carries us forward into the embrace of death with a lighter heart and more tranquil soul. ""The dignity that we seek in dying must be found in the dignity with which we have lived our lives. It is not in the last weeks or days that we compose the message that will be remembered, but in all the decades that preceded them.""As a medical student, and hopefully a doctor one day, I hope that reading this book will help me deliver a more humane kind of care to my patients. One that is driven by the need to learn about and listen to my patients, by the need to understand the experience and position of my patients as best as possible. Time spent contemplating the mysteries and impact of death is never wasted. Glad to have read this.____________________________________________________________Some quotes that were insightful or resonated with me at some level:""The single most striking observation was also the one most expected: Every one of these twenty-three people had advanced atheromatous disease in the vessels of the heart or the brain, and almost all had it in both, even if they exhibited no symptoms that required treatment until the terminal event. One or the other of these vital engines was close to quits in every one of the old persons studied. Another finding that elicited no surprise was the frequency of nameable disease int he other organs of any individual, which played no part in the patient's death."" - This to me emphasizes the futility of fighting death, and also the importance of accepting its arrival. No matter our efforts, in this day and age of biomedical technological advancement, in the end death always wins. There is a wisdom to be gleaned from that.""The quest of every doctor in approaching serious disease is to make the diagnosis and design and carry out the specific cure. It is every doctor's measure of his own abilities; it is the most important ingredient in his professional self-image.Nevertheless, our most rewarding moments of healing derive not from the works of our hearts but from those of our intellects - it is there that the passion is most intense. As doctors, we must confront that about ourselves every time we undertake to care for another human being; as patients, we must understand that a physician's driving quest to solve the quest will sometimes be at odds with our best interests at the end of life. Too often near the end, were the doctor able to see deeply within himself, he might recognize that his decisions and advice are motivated by his inability to give up the quest and admit defeat as long as there is any chance of solving it.Although my intentions were only to serve what I conceived to be her welfare, I was guilty of the worst sort of paternalism. I had withheld information because I was afraid the patient might use it to make what I though of as a wrong decision. Had I the chance to relive this episode, or some others like it in my career, I would listen more to the patient and ask her less to listen to me. My treatment of my patient was not based on her goals but on mine."" - This highlights the importance of consciously acknowledging your power and motives as a doctor when dealing with patients, and in doing so, also work to establish a partnership dynamic with patients that is founded on mutual understanding and honesty, instead of relying on the practice of paternalism."

Having seen the deaths of some loved ones from close quarters, which gave rise to many difficult questions about the nature of death, the kind of death I want and more importantly why do doctors overreach their responsibilities ( is the reason only commercial or something deeper), this book helped answer many questions while explaining the logic and science behind them. Not only is Nuland's description of biology readable, he has the gift of language and depths of a philosopher to make the most morose and terrying subject of death read beautiful. However, this like many powerful pieces of work will only draw you in when the time is right to receive. ' When my time comes, I seek hope in the knowledge that insofar as possible, I will not be allowed to suffer or be subjected to needless attempts to maintain life; I will seek it in the certainty that I will not be abandoned to die alone; I am seek it now in the way I live my life , so that those who value what I am will have profited from my time on Earth and be left with comforting recollections of what we have meant to one another'"

The author explains the physical processes that occur during death, starting with the process of aging. He then goes into detail about the ways the body can shut down and why. This may be too much information for some and although a little morbid, I found it well worth understanding. He also covers some of the most common types of death scenarios. I agree with the author that most people do not know how to treat those who are dying or what is normal even. Our expectations(namely that people we can always be cured, that hope is lost if the disease is found to be incurable, or that their is a 'right' way to go) can affect how we view and thus react as friends, family, and doctors around those dying. The peoples' stories in the book brought tears to my eyes and made me remember people who have died recently. I feel better prepared to recognize death and to react when I see it. "

So the stories and vignettes highlighted in the book held a medical fascination for me. When I re-read the book 20 years later, wow. The perspective that the years bring really changed my experience. I had that ""it tolls for thee"" moment, and suddenly the stories in the book felt much more personal and possible for me.When I read of Sherwin Nuland's own death, I thought, ""Now he really knows what it's all about."" But if I could talk to him, I'd say thank you. Because even though the book is literally about how we die, and the many modes of death, there's a comfort to it. The book demystifies death to a degree. And the ultimate message is, don't dwell on how you're going to die, but how you're living right now."

I only coincidently “discovered “ this book twelve years later and was fascinated in its reading, especially from the perspective of one who was still alive due to the gift of a donated heart and at 62 years of age, am now again looking to the future where my own mortality gets more interesting with each passing year of living this very fulfilled life post transplant.

Crammed with intriguing scientific findings and useful facts, as well as case histories of dying patients whom Nuland ( Doctors: The Biography of Medicine ) has treated, his report is imbued with wisdom rooted in a belief that the dignity we seek in dying must be found in the art of living life to the fullest.what death means to the doctor, patient, nurse, administrator, and family. Thought provoking and humane, his is not the usual syrup-and-generality approach to this well-worn topic. Fundamental to it are Nuland's experiences with the deaths of his aunt, his older brother, and a longtime patient. With each of these deaths, he made what he now sees as mistakes of denial, false hope, and refusal to abide by a patient's wishes. Disease, not death, is the real enemy, he reminds us, despite the facts that most deaths are unpleasant, painful, or agonized, and to argue otherwise is to plaster over the truth. The doctor, Nuland stresses, should instill in dying patients the hope not for a miraculous cure but for the dignity and high quality of the remainder of their lives as well as of what they have meant--and will continue to mean--to family, friends, and colleagues.Humans are probably the only animals capable of understanding their mortality and envisioning the day of their death. Sherwin B. Nuland shows, however, that while we conceptualize our eventual demise, most people have unrealistic expectations of their death. Misconceptions abound. The expectation of a noble death with loved ones gathered, final farewells, and then eternal slumber forms a common though inaccurate mental image of what many people look forward to in their final moments. There are several themes that permeate Nuland's books. One theme is that death, like birth, is a messy process. Though we may wish for the noble death, more likely we will die slowly from a lack of oxygen in the brain. This, in turn, will result from a failing heart, lungs, or blood vessels. Death does not come easy, and although the final moment is sometime serene and tranquil, months or weeks of painful physical degeneration often precedes it. The second theme in Nuland's book is that death is not only inevitable, it is necessary. While life should be fought for as long as possible, we should all realize that ultimately the battle will be lost. We will die. Nuland takes a dim view of heroic attempts to extend life beyond the point where the body has simply failed and death becomes not only inevitable, but also the proper way for nature to renew herself. Nature uses death to clear the way for new generations, and just as we cannot experience the green buds of spring unless the leaves from last season fall to the ground, the very nature of life demands that when death becomes inevitable we exit the stage for the next generation. Nuland's third point is that the measure of a life is not found so much in how we die, but in how we live and how we are remembered. Few of us can control the way in which we die. For some of us it will be quick, for others death will linger and the process will be slow and painful. Some will find humiliation in the loss of bodily functions or mental facilities. However it comes to anyone of us, death is just a part of our lives and the real meaning in death is in the life remembered.The part that struck me the most came from that final “Lessons Learned” chapter when Dr. Nuland writes:“All of this makes more precious each hour of those we have been given; it demands that life must be useful and rewarding. If by our work and pleasure, our triumphs and our failures, each of us is contributing to an evolving process of continuity not only of our species but of the entire balance of nature, the dignity we create in the time allotted to us becomes a continuum with the dignity we achieve by the altruism of accepting the necessity of death.”see this and more than a hundred other organ donation/transplant related books - many with my personal reviews - at http://www.trioweb.org/resources/book..."

It seems so different from the nothing that preceded life.""This quote was only 3% in and it was immensely comforting for me to think about. Almost like we'd already done this before. I had never thought of death in that way.And then came the rest of the book. Honestly, I thought I was picking up a book about hospice, instead of all the graphic, gruesome ways disease destroys the body and how we succumb to it. I hadn't realized that this had been published at the beginning of the hospice movement in America. (January 1994! I was a month shy of my first birthday.) Obviously, this book is not suited to someone with extreme anxieties about dying. I could feel anxiety attacks coming on at certain parts. Even with that said, it's incredibly well-written and I learned a lot. So much in fact, that I bought a big bag of quinoa and oats to cut down on cholesterol and other unwanted fats. Fortunately, hospice has come a long ways from when this book was initially written, and the promise I've seen in many hospice books is that you don't have to die in pain, and that will be managed. There are many indignities as the body begins to fail, but you don't have to fear suffering.I think the epilogue was probably my favorite bit. So I'll leave this review with this quote:""The honesty and grace of the years of life that are ending is the real measure of how we die. It is not in the last weeks or days that we compose the message that will be remembered, but in all the decades that preceded them."""
34,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17181-jill,4,"I needed this book. However, If you have been involved in care of a chronically ill family member or loved one, or have a loved one who has been killed, you probably don’t want to read all of it. (Or maybe not at all.) Cherry-picking chapters may be wise, to avoid stirring up your grief.Nuland writes about death as someone intimately familiar. He is a poet, and he is gruesome and unsparing. He is persuasive in his love of the body and his wonder with how it works, and then immediately utterly surgical in describing the horror of how things tend to end, including violence at times. I learned more about the specifics of certain diseases and general aging than I ever have via any other thing, and I feel more in love with the human body and its frailties than ever. If you’re at all squeamish, though, or recently bereaved, beware.That said: it feels important. Nuland makes the point that none of us will be spared. We’ll all die, very likely of some root cause described in this book. It seems wise and, really, compassionate to ourselves to acknowledge and try to grok that. And to begin to wrangle with the fact that doctors (at least in the US) are often primarily focused on “The Riddle” of our disease/symptoms, vs wholistic care, especially at the end of life. (This is lately, he points out in the 2010 epilogue, a business issue with capitalist healthcare as well as an issue of training.) It won’t be easy to be advocates for ourselves and the kind of life we want to live, all the way until the end, without some deliberate thinking on the topic."
35,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12375112-arjun-ravichandran,3,"The moth and flames - human beings and death ; Death is the worm at the heart of human consciousness, the janus that propels attraction as well as repulsion. One cultural defence amongst many against this scourge, is the hope for a ""good death"", ars moriendi (the art of dying). But, midst the dispassionately clinical descriptions of oxygen starved muscles, atherosclerosis induced heart failure, trauma, and the other ""doorways into death"" through which nature finally achieves her grim objective, the author (drawing on his years of medical practice) shows how often death is something abrupt, painful, and very often humiliating and detrimental to the human spirit. Yet, death is not an enemy ; if our hope of salvaging dignity from death's final throes is more likely than not to be thwarted, the only measure of dignity that we can gain succour from is the decades of life that preceded it. The art of dying is really the art of living. Death is not an enemy, because the tragedy of an individual demise, when seen in the larger context, is the triumph of nature's self-replenishing. We must die to give way to our children, as those before died for us. Midst this contemplation of life's painful finitude, lies a moral critique of modern day medicine. The latter seeks to dispute that life has a natural and inherent limit, and that when it is time to go, it is time to go. Modern day medicine suffers from an intellectual pride that is somewhat deaf to more personal and banal concerns of the patient at death's door ; treating every terminal disease as simply a puzzle to be solved runs the risk of ruinous medical expenses, a further erosion of dignity, and finally, precisely that which is most yearned to be avoided - an isolated death in the polished squalor of the modern hospital, where the majority of human beings (at least in the developed world) now expire. A dispiriting text, yet profoundly affirmative - there are certain struggles that we cannot win, best we come to terms with it. Perhaps we can make use of Rilke's poignant prayer that the author concludes with : "" Oh Lord, give each of us his own death/ The dying, that issues forth out of the life / In which he had love, meaning and despair.""

Also a little out-of-date in some areas (the book was published in 1994), but more relevant than ever and fascinating all the same.The book really shines when addressing our misconceptions surrounding the dying process, helping us to demystify and come to terms with it in a rational, informed manner. Will definitely revisit this one in the future. Recommended to anyone curious about a universal human experience. ""When it is accepted that there are clearly defined limits to life, then life will be seen to have a symmetry as well. There is a framework of living into which all pleasures and accomplishments fit—and pain, too.

Ranging from precise mechanical descriptions of the physiological common pathways at the end of life, to broad philosophical discussions about the point of the medical profession and life.

Such a contrast to the dry medical texts (/Wikipedia) where I usually read about this stuff.

However, Nuland has taken this challenge head on, analysing the physiology of death. No stone is left unturned as he explores how each key system in the body fails, considering each point of failure using first principles and clearly explaining how the end result comes about. There is a fascinating blend of philosophy together with science in this book, particularly when Nuland considers what people mean when they say that they’ve seen a “white light” or felt total serenity when close to death. He reflects on how he has seen death, in patients, family members and friends, explaining how it influenced his own views on the subject. Definitely a brilliant read."

46,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69318650-nathan,3,"Sherwin Nuland uses his medical experience to explain the biochemical, physical, and emotional processes that occur in some of the most common ways we die: MI, CHF, murder, suicide, Alzheimer’s, cancer, and simply our motors being worn and torn with age beyond repair. In the majority of cases there is not a dignified death; it is ugly, painful, and hard to witness so the crux of the matter is that we need to recognize that this realistic form of death is natural and that prolonging one’s life only to endure more and increased suffering is not always the best decision but dying with the ones we love and more importantly living a life full of love is the way to achieve a dignified death and not go gently into that good night.“Every life is different from any that has gone before it, and so is every death. The uniqueness of each of us extends even to the way we die. Though most people know that various diseases carry us to our final hours by various paths, only very few comprehend the fullness of that endless multitude of ways by which the final forces of the human spirit can separate themselves from the body. Every one of death's diverse appearances is as distinctive as that singular face we each show the world during the days of life. Every man will yield up the ghost in a manner that the heavens have never known before: every woman will go her final way in her own way.”“Decline is most often gradual, with plenty of warnings and much successful treatment before the final summons.”“Because it takes a pressure of approximately 120 millimeters of mercury to generate such a forceful squeeze, the left ventricle muscle is more than half an inch wide, giving it the strongest and thickest wall of all four chambers. Pushing out about 70 milliliters of blood (2/4 ounces) with each contraction, this vigorous pump drives some 7 million milliliters (more than 14.000 pints) each day in 100,000 rhythmic and powerful beats. The mechanism of a living heart is a masterpiece of nature.”“Delay it though we may, then, the victims of coronary atherosclerosis will almost certainly die of their affliction-perhaps un expectedly during a time when they seem to be responding well to treatment, perhaps of the gradual effects of congestive heart failure.”“Every resuscitation is different. Though the general pattern is similar, every sequence, every response to massage and drugs, every heart's willingness to come back-all are different. The only certainty, whether spoken or not, is that the doctors, nurses, and technicians are fighting not only death but their own uncertainties as well. In most resuscitations, those uncertainties can be narrowed down to two main questions: Are we doing the right things? and, Should we be doing anything at all?”“Actuaries seem unable to accept a natural phenomenon unless it is so well defined as to fit neatly into a distinct and easily described classification. The annual report of the federal death accountants is very orderly-not very imaginative, and to my mind not completely reflective of real life (and real death), but nevertheless very orderly. I'm convinced that plenty of people do die of old age.”“For plants and animals, renewal requires that death precede it so that the weary may be replaced by the vigorous. This is what is meant by the cycles of nature. There is nothing pathological or sick about the sequence-in fact, it is the antithesis of sick.”“Of hundreds of known diseases and their predisposing characteristics, some 85 percent of our aging population will succumb to the complications of one of only seven major entities: atherosclerosis, hypertension, adult-onset diabetes, obesity, mental depressing states such as Alzheimer's and other dementias, cancer, and decreased resistance to infection.”“The lesson taught by the twenty-three case histories is simply confirmation of the lesson that daily experience teaches. Whether it is the anarchy of disordered biochemistry or the direct result of its opposite-a carefully orchestrated genetic ride to death-we die of old age because we have been worn and torn and programmed to cave in. The very old do not succumb to disease they implode their way into eternity.”“Never yet has anyone succeeded in borrowing any time… The lesson is never learned-there will always be those who persist in seeking the Fountain of Youth, or at least delaying what is irrevocably ordained.”“Virtually every disease can be described in terms of cause and effect. The symptoms a patient presents to his doctor, and the physical findings elicited on examination, are the direct results of very specific pathological changes within cells, tissues, and organs, or of disorders in biochemical processes. Once these underlying alterations have been identified, they can be shown to have led inevitably to the observed clinical manifestations. It is the purpose of the diagnostic workup to find the cause, using its effects as clues.”“There are no consolations in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The anguish may be mitigated by good nursing care, support groups, and the closeness of friends and family, but in the end it will be necessary for patient and loved ones together to walk through that very tortuous valley of the shadow, in the course of which everything changes forever. There is no dignity in this kind of death.”“The rapid loss of approximately one-half to two-thirds of the body's blood volume is usually sufficient to arrest the heart. Since total blood volume is equal to some 7-8 percent of body weight, a bleed of eight pints in a 170-pound man or six pints in a 130-pound woman can be enough to cause clinical death. With laceration of a vessel the size of the aorta, the process takes less than a minute; a tear in the spleen or liver might take hours, or even days, on those very rare occasions when constant ooze remains unchecked.”“Many do, in this way, avoid a tormented passage; but many others are in physical and mental distress till nearly the last moment, or even at the last moment. There is a nice Victorian reticence in denying the probability of a miserable prelude to mortality, and it is what everyone wants to hear. But if peace and dignity are what we delude ourselves to expect, most of us will die wondering what we, or our doctors, have done wrong.”“No matter the degree to which a man thinks he has convinced himself that the process of dying is not to be dreaded, he will yet approach his final illness with dread.”“Accurate knowledge of how a disease kills serves to free us from unnecessary terrors of what we might be fated to endure when we die. We may thus be better prepared to recognize the stations at which it is appropriate to ask for relief, or perhaps to begin contemplating whether to end the journey altogether.”“I prefer to believe that God has nothing to do with it. We are witnessing in our time one of those cataclysms of nature that have no meaning, no precedent, and, in spite of many claims to the contrary, no useful metaphor.”“And always, the most important charge is to care for those dread fully stricken brothers and sisters of all of us, the sickest of whom are wasted, feverish, swollen, and anemic, their eyes seeking some reassurance and the unspoken promise of relief from their torment, which too often will come only with death. No matter the perseverance and moral strength so many patients muster in the face of lethal certainty, the pitiless process by which they die is dispiriting anew with every reenactment.”“The likeness is to an insidious, groping parasite, attached by sharp-clawed tentacles to the decaying surface of its imperiled prey. The clawing extremities ceaselessly extend the periphery of their malign grip, while the loathsome core of the burrowing beast eats silently away at life, able to digest only what it has first de composed. The process is noiseless; it has no recognizable instant of beginning and it ends only when the despoiler has consumed the final remnants of its host's vital forces.”“The boundaries of medical futility, however, have never been clear, and it may be too much to expect that they ever will be. It is perhaps for this reason that there has arisen the conviction among doctors-more than a mere conviction, it is nowadays felt by many to be a responsibility-that should error occur in the treatment of a patient, it must always be on the side of doing more rather than less.”“When the chips are down, almost no one wants his life to end, and one good way for the conscious mind to avoid it is for the unconscious mind to deny that it is about to happen.”“Though everyone may yearn for a tranquil death, the basic instinct to stay alive is a far more powerful force.”“The greatest dignity to be found in death is the dignity of the life that preceded it. This is a form of hope we can all achieve, and it is the most abiding of all. Hope resides in the meaning of what our lives have been.”“The lesson in all of this is well known. Hope lies not only in an expectation of cure or even of the remission of present distress. For dying patients, the hope of cure will always be shown to be ultimately false, and even the hope of relief too often turns to ashes.”“When my time comes, I will seek hope in the knowledge that insofar as possible I will not be allowed to suffer or be subjected to needless attempts to maintain life; I will seek it in the certainty that I will not be abandoned to die alone; I am seeking it now, in the way I try to live my life, so that those who value what I am will have profited by my time on earth and be left with comforting recollections of what we have meant to one another.”"

I have a deeper understanding of death, dignity, hope, care. If we have to die, we want it quick, but not too quick. We want it dignified and meaningful. Very few of us will get that.Yet for long stretches, the book seems undecided how to approach death. I want to know what it's like to die of cancer, but the book tells me how cancer works, from the outside. There's a long chapter how AIDS was discovered, but little on what it's like to die of AIDS. Much gravity in the language, stilted. Appropriate to the subject, but still. I wish the final chapter, the Coda, from 2010, hadn't been written."
49,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3754944-mm,0,"I read this book because I have started to work as a healthcare professional, and in particular with countless clients who are ""palliative."" What I wanted to know was why, when I review the medical history of some of my clients (patients) with Chronic Heart Failure, and a history of a Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA), and Hypertension, and a CABG (bypass) in 2013, and kidney failure, and... what have these diagnoses done? Are they really dying of all of these things?I don't know how to explain it. I have a client right now, a sweet old lady, cute as can be, who laughs at the end of every breathless sentence she speaks. As is my job in the healthcare team, I ordered her a hospital bed - her doting daughter wishes to keep her at home - and a commode and a wheelchair and a cushion. I assess the redness developing on her coccyx (her bum) and recommend that she be turned at such and such time to prevent bedsores. Here I see an 87 year old lady dying, of course she is dying, and what she wants is rest and relaxation. So we set up her bed by the window, and she keeps her white nightgown on as her legs have edema (swelling), and she lays there with the head of the bed up to help her breath better, and the sunlight steams in, and every once in a while she groans and tries to shift her weight because she is uncomfortable in one position, and she looks positively like an angel.And I know that inside her there is a battle against kidney failure, which is why her tummy is so huge and her organs are floating in that cavity we call the abdomen. And inside her too is heart failure, which likely has caused the kidney failure. And so she is fatigued, and she is heavy - she can't fit into her wheelchair anymore - and her heaviness is creating risk for pressure injuries on her bed. And I know that she has medications by the dozens, and that I recommended the daughter get a blister pack because at some point it is impossible to keep track of all these medications.I know that this is a disease, or more accurately a plethora of diseases, each feeding off of the other - when one head is chopped off, the hydra grows another.So I know why she is dying, I suppose. But she is 87. And is she really diseased? Isn't this just her aged body saying - enough. I have worked long enough, and now I wish to be comfortable as I leave this life. Despite the list of diagnoses that go on and on, and the list of surgeries that go on and on, and the list of medications that is even longer - isn't she dying of old age? It's just that simple. She isn't dying of disease. She is dying of the natural cycle of life - not just of human life, but of all life. She is dying of the cosmic principle that says - ye shalt not last! She is dying because nothing in this world is eternal, and even thousands of years old trees must one day die, and the lion eats the gazelle, and the cat chases the mouse, and age comes after us all.So while she lies there and the healthcare team gently urges the daughter to move her mother to a hospice, I can't help but feel that somewhere along the line, by pathologizing, the dignity of old age - a dignity that is from understanding, not from the wheezing and heaving and overall grotesqueness of the last few months of life - is lost.We all must die, and death will most likely be awful, and painful, and we will very likely be surrounded by strangers. And some deaths are a tragedy, while others are just this: that Life folds her hands and places them in her lap, and her sister Death opens hers and says to us, Embrace me now, for your earthly journey is complete, so come home. And the worms will eat your body but the face of God hangs eternal, looking over it all."
50,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100050401-kathleen-murray,5,"I've given this book to at least 10 friends, and none will read it. Is it something to do with the title. This was the first, and one of the best, in the burgeoning genre of death and dying. Other than being born, death is one of the most important things that happens to us, and we might as well know a little about it. I read this when it first came out, about a year before I had health care power of attorney for an 86-year-old woman with end-stage COPD. I like to think that the section on pneumonia helped inform my decision-making, and limit the suffering of her final days. "
51,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2715247-james-klagge,4,"Some pretty rough descriptions, which illustrate the author's general point that death is rarely the serene, dignified experience for which we hope. It was not the prospect of my own death that motivated me to read this, but I couldn't help thinking about that as well. Though much of the book is taken up with describing at various levels the processes of death, the author also wanted to emphasize the difficulty and the importance of patients and their families taking some control of the process away from the medical-technological process that will otherwise dominate. The author regrets the power of specialists whose primary or sole motivation is curing or prolonging life regardless of the human cost. He quotes (p. 275) the director of the UCLA Medical Center who said in 2009: ""If you come into this hospital, we're not going to let you die."" It sounds like a perverse kind of hell. Instead, the author wishes that there were ways to value and promote family practitioners who would care about pastoring the patient as much as winning the battle. I have such a family doctor, but since he is several years older than I am, I wonder if he'll still be practicing when I need him.The main issue is deciding when it is time to stop trying and accept death. The problem is that doctors still too often don't know, and aren't happy letting patients decide, when enough is enough. This is not a lesson I needed to learn about, but it is important to think about it in advance, for oneself and one's loved ones. The discussion also reminded me of analogous issues such as when it is time to stop trying to save a dying relationship, or when it is time to stop trying to pursue an ill-fated project or profession. Hope is an important virtue, but it also has its limits. As Aristotle could have said, there can be too little hope, but there can also be too much. The author thinks we need to reconceive what we mean by hope near the end of life. Death will always win in the end. But he thinks that we can still hope for and work toward being ourselves to our last breath. Even this can be taken away from us by the ravages of death, but it is something we can aim for--to be oneself as long as possible. I really should give 5 stars to a doctor who quotes Vaclav Havel (p. 281) on hope, in a book about medicine; but the unnecessary repetitions led me to reduce the rating by a star. In any case, well-worth reading--especially since each of us will eventually die, or at least we know someone who will. :)"
52,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6269159-robyn-mcintyre,3,"This National Book Award winner came out in 1993, but I recently read it after a recommendation by a friend. Dr. Sherwin B. Nuland, the author, who passed away from colon cancer in 2014, combined stories of the difficult illnesses and deaths of family members and patients with the facts of what physically occurs during a fatal illness such as heart disease, stroke, or cancer. His primary point to be made was that people now die more often in a hospital than they do at home and that wishing for a comfortable, spiritual passing at home is pointless because death was intractable and almost always messy and humiliating.At the time, his words made quite a stir, adding to the national dialog that was revving up about how current society views death and deals with it by trying to convince the terminally ill to submit to lengthy and often painful procedures in an effort to extend their lives by a small margin.Having been through the deaths of my parents, my husband, several friends, and younger relatives, I was most taken with the stories Dr. Nuland related out of his own experience. The descriptions of the processes by which people die were less interesting to me because I had already researched most of them. Of course, people did not have access to the bounty of information now available via the internet about those processes and now, thanks to blogging, there is also a multitude of first-person experiences to be had. But in the early 90s, no such comprehensive resources existed, and Dr. Nuland's book provided a frank and somewhat shocking review of what happens during a catastrophic illness. If I had been able to read this in the 1980s and known about it in the 1990s, I'm certain I would have found it both enlightening and a cause for some sorrow.At this time, many terminally ill people are choosing hospice to try to find that 'good death' that Dr. Nuland saw as unachievable in the 80s and 90s. There is no doubt that the debilitation attending a drawn-out death is often messy and frequently painful as well as humiliating, but hospice care does attempt to provide an experience as close to a 'good' death as it is possible to get. And with a growing movement of physician-assisted deaths for terminal patients, some people are finding it possible to pass over without having to go through the most difficult parts of the dying process. I found myself wishing that How We Die could have been updated to address Dr. Nuland's thoughts on these alternatives to a hospital-based prolongation of life."
53,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7405304-deb-stone,4,"""Every life is different from any that has gone before it and so is every death."" Despite the opening line, it seems (after reading the book) that although each death is individual to the person's body peculiarities and responsiveness to intervention, ways of dying are readily categorized (mostly) due to a handful of particular maladies. The author divides the chapters by illness: ""The Strangled Heart"" and ""Alzheimer's Disease"" and so on, except for the ending chapters he uses to discuss his point of view about end of life responsibilities of providers. As the book progresses, so does the author's discussion about doctors attempting to solve ""The Riddle"" of the patient's illness which the author states often overshadows the needs of a dying patient. I enjoyed this book most when Nuland was deconstructing the illnesses in detail, explaining processes as he went. This style was more prevalent in the earlier chapters. As the book went on, his personal ideas (based on years of personal and professional experience) about how much intervention dying patients ought seek and providers ought provide, bogged down the chapters. I would have preferred scant mention of this until a summarizing chapter at the end wherein he pulled all the threads of the bodily processes in various ailments together to philosophize about the wisdom (or not) of intrusive end of life interventions. I surmise the author intended ""how we die"" to be a dual discussion of how the body physically ends as well as how the societal and medical systems participate in that process but the discussion of the latter feels heavy-handed, especially in later chapters. Still, the book is engaging overall, the individual explanations of how a body shuts down during heart failure or AIDS was fascinating, and he raises compelling questions about the cultural and ethical considerations in end of life care.

That being said, since having a life now touched by death, I have looked to solace in the biological (as opposed to the spiritual) aspect of what it means to die and be dead, so this book was pretty good for explaining how death happens physically (if you didn't get that from the title). It even gave me some insight into the minds of my mom's doctors as her conditioned worsened and they sort of began to wash their hands of her and walk away. That too, was helpful and relieved me of some anger.Here's my favorite part from the last chapter....there are additional pieces of baggage we shall all take to the grave, but from which we may somewhat disencumber ourselves if we anticipate them. By these, I mean conflicts unresolved, breached relationships not healed, potentials unfulfilled, promises not kept, and years that will never be lived. For virtually every one of us, there will be unfinished business. Only the very old escape it, and even then not always. Perhaps the mere existence of things undone should be a sort of satisfaction in itself, though the idea would appear to be paradoxical. Only one who is long since dead while still seemingly alive does not have many ""promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep,"" and that state of inertness is not to be desired. To the wise advice that we live every day as though it will be our last, we do well to add the admonition to live every day as though we will be on this earth forever."

The author, a surgeon, doesn't hold back, even when it means facing his own failings as a doctor and brother (his brother died of colon cancer a few years before the book was written).The Dr. Nuland's discomfort with the vast amount of intervention at the end of life often mirrored my own thoughts and concerns as my convictions on childbirth have migrated to End of Life decisions. “Beyond the medical establishment – and beyond even the capability of one’s own physician, no matter his beneficence – is the power that rightfully belongs to the patient and those who love him.”Sadly, far too often, patients and families are given false hopes. Either they are not given all the information to make these painful decisions, or they take upon themselves the belief that, hope upon hope, the medical establishment can restore their terminal loved one. It is a delicate dance.Not to say I always agreed with the author. He believes that in rare situations terminal patients should be allowed to hasten their own death. No matter how much I sympathize with the suffering of those facing painful deaths, I cannot go that quite that far. I feel similarly about trying to prolong our lives. It was easy enough to skim through the chapters on the main medical illnesses that befall mankind. However, I found that last three chapter’s to be invaluable and would highly recommend everyone to read the book just for the lessons to be learned there. The book is nearly 20 years old, and while some of the medical information is now dated, I feel the basic message is still salient."

While not sensationalized, the imageries of how our organs can fail in different orders are not for the faint of heart. Our physician author shares his reflections on how modern biomedicine has changed the way in which death is perceived and faced, with its gory details sanitized and hidden from public view. Nowadays, the medical community often treats its enemy as diseases or even death itself, but the author reminds medical professionals that perhaps it would also be wise to humbly remember that no one has ever escaped death, and to consider caring for patients in such a way so as to prioritize the enhancing the quality of their remaining time rather than maximizing its length by offering treatments which bring short periods of suffering often not worth the additional suffering and anguish. As for the rest of us, we can become well-informed and make the most appropriate decisions regarding our options according to our own values and preferences.In this book you will find page after page of insight and wisdom amid heartbreaking tales. I am thankful for the revelations concerning my own mortality, and the mortality of those around me. I cannot recommend this book enough for everyone in the medical profession, especially doctors and nurses at the frontline fighting for the wellbeing of patients."

Not many people die at home anymore….approximately 80 percent of Americans who die in a hospital….An entire mythology has grown up around the process of dying. Like most mythologies, it is based on the inborn psychological need that all humankind shares. The mythologies of death are meant to combat fear on the one hand and its opposite—wishes—on the other. They are meant to serve us by disarming our terror about what the reality may be> While so many of us hope for a swift death or a death during sleep “so I won’t suffer,” we at the same time cling to an image of our final moments that combines grace with a sense of closure; we need to believe in a clear-minded process in which the summation of a life takes place—either that or a perfect lapse into agony-free unconsciousness. –p8It is this so-called terminal gasp phase that allows the aspiration of so much water that its absorption in a freshwater drowning may account for as much as 50 percent of the blood volume. – p161Drowning kills almost five thousand people in the United States each year, and alcohol is involved 40 percent of the time.

In this book, an experienced physician describes the mechanisms of some of the greatest killers in the first world: heart disease, senility, violence, AIDS, and cancer. At the end he touches on the relationship between physicians and their dying charges.The prose tends toward the purple, with many references to pedestrian classics, yet the physiological descriptions can be hard to follow. More charts would help, as would more direct writing, but ultimately the ""how"" is not as important as the ""why."" Nuland's theory of bodily failure (that it all comes down to hypoxia) is a simplification, but leaves a solid impression that these seemingly disparate causes of death really are linked. The AIDS passage is tragic and beautifully written, as are many of the anecdotes. However, like many old pop-science books, science marches on and it's impossible to read that passage without thinking of how far medicine has come: in the 2010s, advertisements for pre-exposure prophylaxis (branded Truvada) are common for this disease that was a terrifying scourge in the 1990s. Throughout the book, Nuland expresses some near-futurist hopes that disease after disease will be conquered while tempered by the reality that people will continue to die, and more agonizingly so if those hopes are misplaced."

While the book is concerned with the Horsemen of Death (cancer, heart disease, strokes, septicemia, Alzheimer's), it is also as much about Nuland's life and those he cared for deeply that passed on as he observed the process as only a genius with a Photographic Memory can. It also has a significant amount of Medical History, even the history of when the book was written in 1993. In some ways (AIDS treatment for example), Medical Science has triumphed since the book was written 23 years ago. In others (Alzheimer's) we are no further along than we were then.

It seems so different from the nothing that preceded life.""This quote was only 3% in and it was immensely comforting for me to think about. Almost like we'd already done this before. I had never thought of death in that way.And then came the rest of the book. Honestly, I thought I was picking up a book about hospice, instead of all the graphic, gruesome ways disease destroys the body and how we succumb to it. I hadn't realized that this had been published at the beginning of the hospice movement in America. (January 1994! I was a month shy of my first birthday.) Obviously, this book is not suited to someone with extreme anxieties about dying. I could feel anxiety attacks coming on at certain parts. Even with that said, it's incredibly well-written and I learned a lot. So much in fact, that I bought a big bag of quinoa and oats to cut down on cholesterol and other unwanted fats. Fortunately, hospice has come a long ways from when this book was initially written, and the promise I've seen in many hospice books is that you don't have to die in pain, and that will be managed. There are many indignities as the body begins to fail, but you don't have to fear suffering.I think the epilogue was probably my favorite bit. So I'll leave this review with this quote:""The honesty and grace of the years of life that are ending is the real measure of how we die.

However, If you have been involved in care of a chronically ill family member or loved one, or have a loved one who has been killed, you probably don’t want to read all of it. (Or maybe not at all.) Cherry-picking chapters may be wise, to avoid stirring up your grief.Nuland writes about death as someone intimately familiar. He is a poet, and he is gruesome and unsparing. He is persuasive in his love of the body and his wonder with how it works, and then immediately utterly surgical in describing the horror of how things tend to end, including violence at times. I learned more about the specifics of certain diseases and general aging than I ever have via any other thing, and I feel more in love with the human body and its frailties than ever. If you’re at all squeamish, though, or recently bereaved, beware.That said: it feels important. Nuland makes the point that none of us will be spared. We’ll all die, very likely of some root cause described in this book. It seems wise and, really, compassionate to ourselves to acknowledge and try to grok that. And to begin to wrangle with the fact that doctors (at least in the US) are often primarily focused on “The Riddle” of our disease/symptoms, vs wholistic care, especially at the end of life. (This is lately, he points out in the 2010 epilogue, a business issue with capitalist healthcare as well as an issue of training.) It won’t be easy to be advocates for ourselves and the kind of life we want to live, all the way until the end, without some deliberate thinking on the topic."
65,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12375112-arjun-ravichandran,3,"The moth and flames - human beings and death ; Death is the worm at the heart of human consciousness, the janus that propels attraction as well as repulsion. One cultural defence amongst many against this scourge, is the hope for a ""good death"", ars moriendi (the art of dying). But, midst the dispassionately clinical descriptions of oxygen starved muscles, atherosclerosis induced heart failure, trauma, and the other ""doorways into death"" through which nature finally achieves her grim objective, the author (drawing on his years of medical practice) shows how often death is something abrupt, painful, and very often humiliating and detrimental to the human spirit. Yet, death is not an enemy ; if our hope of salvaging dignity from death's final throes is more likely than not to be thwarted, the only measure of dignity that we can gain succour from is the decades of life that preceded it. The art of dying is really the art of living. Death is not an enemy, because the tragedy of an individual demise, when seen in the larger context, is the triumph of nature's self-replenishing. We must die to give way to our children, as those before died for us. Midst this contemplation of life's painful finitude, lies a moral critique of modern day medicine. The latter seeks to dispute that life has a natural and inherent limit, and that when it is time to go, it is time to go. Modern day medicine suffers from an intellectual pride that is somewhat deaf to more personal and banal concerns of the patient at death's door ; treating every terminal disease as simply a puzzle to be solved runs the risk of ruinous medical expenses, a further erosion of dignity, and finally, precisely that which is most yearned to be avoided - an isolated death in the polished squalor of the modern hospital, where the majority of human beings (at least in the developed world) now expire. A dispiriting text, yet profoundly affirmative - there are certain struggles that we cannot win, best we come to terms with it. Perhaps we can make use of Rilke's poignant prayer that the author concludes with : "" Oh Lord, give each of us his own death/ The dying, that issues forth out of the life / In which he had love, meaning and despair.""

Will definitely revisit this one in the future. Recommended to anyone curious about a universal human experience.

However, Nuland has taken this challenge head on, analysing the physiology of death. No stone is left unturned as he explores how each key system in the body fails, considering each point of failure using first principles and clearly explaining how the end result comes about. There is a fascinating blend of philosophy together with science in this book, particularly when Nuland considers what people mean when they say that they’ve seen a “white light” or felt total serenity when close to death. He reflects on how he has seen death, in patients, family members and friends, explaining how it influenced his own views on the subject. Definitely a brilliant read."

76,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69318650-nathan,3,"Sherwin Nuland uses his medical experience to explain the biochemical, physical, and emotional processes that occur in some of the most common ways we die: MI, CHF, murder, suicide, Alzheimer’s, cancer, and simply our motors being worn and torn with age beyond repair. In the majority of cases there is not a dignified death; it is ugly, painful, and hard to witness so the crux of the matter is that we need to recognize that this realistic form of death is natural and that prolonging one’s life only to endure more and increased suffering is not always the best decision but dying with the ones we love and more importantly living a life full of love is the way to achieve a dignified death and not go gently into that good night.“Every life is different from any that has gone before it, and so is every death. The uniqueness of each of us extends even to the way we die. Though most people know that various diseases carry us to our final hours by various paths, only very few comprehend the fullness of that endless multitude of ways by which the final forces of the human spirit can separate themselves from the body. Every one of death's diverse appearances is as distinctive as that singular face we each show the world during the days of life. Every man will yield up the ghost in a manner that the heavens have never known before: every woman will go her final way in her own way.”“Decline is most often gradual, with plenty of warnings and much successful treatment before the final summons.”“Because it takes a pressure of approximately 120 millimeters of mercury to generate such a forceful squeeze, the left ventricle muscle is more than half an inch wide, giving it the strongest and thickest wall of all four chambers. Pushing out about 70 milliliters of blood (2/4 ounces) with each contraction, this vigorous pump drives some 7 million milliliters (more than 14.000 pints) each day in 100,000 rhythmic and powerful beats. The mechanism of a living heart is a masterpiece of nature.”“Delay it though we may, then, the victims of coronary atherosclerosis will almost certainly die of their affliction-perhaps un expectedly during a time when they seem to be responding well to treatment, perhaps of the gradual effects of congestive heart failure.”“Every resuscitation is different. Though the general pattern is similar, every sequence, every response to massage and drugs, every heart's willingness to come back-all are different. The only certainty, whether spoken or not, is that the doctors, nurses, and technicians are fighting not only death but their own uncertainties as well. In most resuscitations, those uncertainties can be narrowed down to two main questions: Are we doing the right things? and, Should we be doing anything at all?”“Actuaries seem unable to accept a natural phenomenon unless it is so well defined as to fit neatly into a distinct and easily described classification. The annual report of the federal death accountants is very orderly-not very imaginative, and to my mind not completely reflective of real life (and real death), but nevertheless very orderly. I'm convinced that plenty of people do die of old age.”“For plants and animals, renewal requires that death precede it so that the weary may be replaced by the vigorous. This is what is meant by the cycles of nature. There is nothing pathological or sick about the sequence-in fact, it is the antithesis of sick.”“Of hundreds of known diseases and their predisposing characteristics, some 85 percent of our aging population will succumb to the complications of one of only seven major entities: atherosclerosis, hypertension, adult-onset diabetes, obesity, mental depressing states such as Alzheimer's and other dementias, cancer, and decreased resistance to infection.”“The lesson taught by the twenty-three case histories is simply confirmation of the lesson that daily experience teaches. Whether it is the anarchy of disordered biochemistry or the direct result of its opposite-a carefully orchestrated genetic ride to death-we die of old age because we have been worn and torn and programmed to cave in. The very old do not succumb to disease they implode their way into eternity.”“Never yet has anyone succeeded in borrowing any time… The lesson is never learned-there will always be those who persist in seeking the Fountain of Youth, or at least delaying what is irrevocably ordained.”“Virtually every disease can be described in terms of cause and effect. The symptoms a patient presents to his doctor, and the physical findings elicited on examination, are the direct results of very specific pathological changes within cells, tissues, and organs, or of disorders in biochemical processes. Once these underlying alterations have been identified, they can be shown to have led inevitably to the observed clinical manifestations. It is the purpose of the diagnostic workup to find the cause, using its effects as clues.”“There are no consolations in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The anguish may be mitigated by good nursing care, support groups, and the closeness of friends and family, but in the end it will be necessary for patient and loved ones together to walk through that very tortuous valley of the shadow, in the course of which everything changes forever. There is no dignity in this kind of death.”“The rapid loss of approximately one-half to two-thirds of the body's blood volume is usually sufficient to arrest the heart. Since total blood volume is equal to some 7-8 percent of body weight, a bleed of eight pints in a 170-pound man or six pints in a 130-pound woman can be enough to cause clinical death. With laceration of a vessel the size of the aorta, the process takes less than a minute; a tear in the spleen or liver might take hours, or even days, on those very rare occasions when constant ooze remains unchecked.”“Many do, in this way, avoid a tormented passage; but many others are in physical and mental distress till nearly the last moment, or even at the last moment. There is a nice Victorian reticence in denying the probability of a miserable prelude to mortality, and it is what everyone wants to hear. But if peace and dignity are what we delude ourselves to expect, most of us will die wondering what we, or our doctors, have done wrong.”“No matter the degree to which a man thinks he has convinced himself that the process of dying is not to be dreaded, he will yet approach his final illness with dread.”“Accurate knowledge of how a disease kills serves to free us from unnecessary terrors of what we might be fated to endure when we die. We may thus be better prepared to recognize the stations at which it is appropriate to ask for relief, or perhaps to begin contemplating whether to end the journey altogether.”“I prefer to believe that God has nothing to do with it. We are witnessing in our time one of those cataclysms of nature that have no meaning, no precedent, and, in spite of many claims to the contrary, no useful metaphor.”“And always, the most important charge is to care for those dread fully stricken brothers and sisters of all of us, the sickest of whom are wasted, feverish, swollen, and anemic, their eyes seeking some reassurance and the unspoken promise of relief from their torment, which too often will come only with death. No matter the perseverance and moral strength so many patients muster in the face of lethal certainty, the pitiless process by which they die is dispiriting anew with every reenactment.”“The likeness is to an insidious, groping parasite, attached by sharp-clawed tentacles to the decaying surface of its imperiled prey. The clawing extremities ceaselessly extend the periphery of their malign grip, while the loathsome core of the burrowing beast eats silently away at life, able to digest only what it has first de composed. The process is noiseless; it has no recognizable instant of beginning and it ends only when the despoiler has consumed the final remnants of its host's vital forces.”“The boundaries of medical futility, however, have never been clear, and it may be too much to expect that they ever will be. It is perhaps for this reason that there has arisen the conviction among doctors-more than a mere conviction, it is nowadays felt by many to be a responsibility-that should error occur in the treatment of a patient, it must always be on the side of doing more rather than less.”“When the chips are down, almost no one wants his life to end, and one good way for the conscious mind to avoid it is for the unconscious mind to deny that it is about to happen.”“Though everyone may yearn for a tranquil death, the basic instinct to stay alive is a far more powerful force.”“The greatest dignity to be found in death is the dignity of the life that preceded it. This is a form of hope we can all achieve, and it is the most abiding of all. Hope resides in the meaning of what our lives have been.”“The lesson in all of this is well known. Hope lies not only in an expectation of cure or even of the remission of present distress. For dying patients, the hope of cure will always be shown to be ultimately false, and even the hope of relief too often turns to ashes.”“When my time comes, I will seek hope in the knowledge that insofar as possible I will not be allowed to suffer or be subjected to needless attempts to maintain life; I will seek it in the certainty that I will not be abandoned to die alone; I am seeking it now, in the way I try to live my life, so that those who value what I am will have profited by my time on earth and be left with comforting recollections of what we have meant to one another.”"

Very few of us will get that.Yet for long stretches, the book seems undecided how to approach death. I want to know what it's like to die of cancer, but the book tells me how cancer works, from the outside. There's a long chapter how AIDS was discovered, but little on what it's like to die of AIDS. Much gravity in the language, stilted. Appropriate to the subject, but still. I wish the final chapter, the Coda, from 2010, hadn't been written."

What I wanted to know was why, when I review the medical history of some of my clients (patients) with Chronic Heart Failure, and a history of a Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA), and Hypertension, and a CABG (bypass) in 2013, and kidney failure, and... what have these diagnoses done? Are they really dying of all of these things?I don't know how to explain it. I have a client right now, a sweet old lady, cute as can be, who laughs at the end of every breathless sentence she speaks. As is my job in the healthcare team, I ordered her a hospital bed - her doting daughter wishes to keep her at home - and a commode and a wheelchair and a cushion. I assess the redness developing on her coccyx (her bum) and recommend that she be turned at such and such time to prevent bedsores. Here I see an 87 year old lady dying, of course she is dying, and what she wants is rest and relaxation. So we set up her bed by the window, and she keeps her white nightgown on as her legs have edema (swelling), and she lays there with the head of the bed up to help her breath better, and the sunlight steams in, and every once in a while she groans and tries to shift her weight because she is uncomfortable in one position, and she looks positively like an angel.And I know that inside her there is a battle against kidney failure, which is why her tummy is so huge and her organs are floating in that cavity we call the abdomen. And inside her too is heart failure, which likely has caused the kidney failure. And so she is fatigued, and she is heavy - she can't fit into her wheelchair anymore - and her heaviness is creating risk for pressure injuries on her bed. And I know that she has medications by the dozens, and that I recommended the daughter get a blister pack because at some point it is impossible to keep track of all these medications.I know that this is a disease, or more accurately a plethora of diseases, each feeding off of the other - when one head is chopped off, the hydra grows another.So I know why she is dying, I suppose. But she is 87. And is she really diseased? Isn't this just her aged body saying - enough. I have worked long enough, and now I wish to be comfortable as I leave this life. Despite the list of diagnoses that go on and on, and the list of surgeries that go on and on, and the list of medications that is even longer - isn't she dying of old age? It's just that simple. She isn't dying of disease. She is dying of the natural cycle of life - not just of human life, but of all life. She is dying of the cosmic principle that says - ye shalt not last! She is dying because nothing in this world is eternal, and even thousands of years old trees must one day die, and the lion eats the gazelle, and the cat chases the mouse, and age comes after us all.So while she lies there and the healthcare team gently urges the daughter to move her mother to a hospice, I can't help but feel that somewhere along the line, by pathologizing, the dignity of old age - a dignity that is from understanding, not from the wheezing and heaving and overall grotesqueness of the last few months of life - is lost.We all must die, and death will most likely be awful, and painful, and we will very likely be surrounded by strangers. And some deaths are a tragedy, while others are just this: that Life folds her hands and places them in her lap, and her sister Death opens hers and says to us, Embrace me now, for your earthly journey is complete, so come home. And the worms will eat your body but the face of God hangs eternal, looking over it all."

This was the first, and one of the best, in the burgeoning genre of death and dying. Other than being born, death is one of the most important things that happens to us, and we might as well know a little about it. I read this when it first came out, about a year before I had health care power of attorney for an 86-year-old woman with end-stage COPD. I like to think that the section on pneumonia helped inform my decision-making, and limit the suffering of her final days. "
81,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2715247-james-klagge,4,"Some pretty rough descriptions, which illustrate the author's general point that death is rarely the serene, dignified experience for which we hope. It was not the prospect of my own death that motivated me to read this, but I couldn't help thinking about that as well. Though much of the book is taken up with describing at various levels the processes of death, the author also wanted to emphasize the difficulty and the importance of patients and their families taking some control of the process away from the medical-technological process that will otherwise dominate. The author regrets the power of specialists whose primary or sole motivation is curing or prolonging life regardless of the human cost. He quotes (p. 275) the director of the UCLA Medical Center who said in 2009: ""If you come into this hospital, we're not going to let you die."" It sounds like a perverse kind of hell. Instead, the author wishes that there were ways to value and promote family practitioners who would care about pastoring the patient as much as winning the battle. I have such a family doctor, but since he is several years older than I am, I wonder if he'll still be practicing when I need him.The main issue is deciding when it is time to stop trying and accept death. The problem is that doctors still too often don't know, and aren't happy letting patients decide, when enough is enough. This is not a lesson I needed to learn about, but it is important to think about it in advance, for oneself and one's loved ones. The discussion also reminded me of analogous issues such as when it is time to stop trying to save a dying relationship, or when it is time to stop trying to pursue an ill-fated project or profession. Hope is an important virtue, but it also has its limits. As Aristotle could have said, there can be too little hope, but there can also be too much. The author thinks we need to reconceive what we mean by hope near the end of life. Death will always win in the end. But he thinks that we can still hope for and work toward being ourselves to our last breath. Even this can be taken away from us by the ravages of death, but it is something we can aim for--to be oneself as long as possible. I really should give 5 stars to a doctor who quotes Vaclav Havel (p. 281) on hope, in a book about medicine; but the unnecessary repetitions led me to reduce the rating by a star. In any case, well-worth reading--especially since each of us will eventually die, or at least we know someone who will. :)"
82,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6269159-robyn-mcintyre,3,"This National Book Award winner came out in 1993, but I recently read it after a recommendation by a friend. Dr. Sherwin B. Nuland, the author, who passed away from colon cancer in 2014, combined stories of the difficult illnesses and deaths of family members and patients with the facts of what physically occurs during a fatal illness such as heart disease, stroke, or cancer. His primary point to be made was that people now die more often in a hospital than they do at home and that wishing for a comfortable, spiritual passing at home is pointless because death was intractable and almost always messy and humiliating.At the time, his words made quite a stir, adding to the national dialog that was revving up about how current society views death and deals with it by trying to convince the terminally ill to submit to lengthy and often painful procedures in an effort to extend their lives by a small margin.Having been through the deaths of my parents, my husband, several friends, and younger relatives, I was most taken with the stories Dr. Nuland related out of his own experience. The descriptions of the processes by which people die were less interesting to me because I had already researched most of them. Of course, people did not have access to the bounty of information now available via the internet about those processes and now, thanks to blogging, there is also a multitude of first-person experiences to be had. But in the early 90s, no such comprehensive resources existed, and Dr. Nuland's book provided a frank and somewhat shocking review of what happens during a catastrophic illness. If I had been able to read this in the 1980s and known about it in the 1990s, I'm certain I would have found it both enlightening and a cause for some sorrow.At this time, many terminally ill people are choosing hospice to try to find that 'good death' that Dr. Nuland saw as unachievable in the 80s and 90s. There is no doubt that the debilitation attending a drawn-out death is often messy and frequently painful as well as humiliating, but hospice care does attempt to provide an experience as close to a 'good' death as it is possible to get. And with a growing movement of physician-assisted deaths for terminal patients, some people are finding it possible to pass over without having to go through the most difficult parts of the dying process. I found myself wishing that How We Die could have been updated to address Dr. Nuland's thoughts on these alternatives to a hospital-based prolongation of life."
83,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7405304-deb-stone,4,"""Every life is different from any that has gone before it and so is every death."" Despite the opening line, it seems (after reading the book) that although each death is individual to the person's body peculiarities and responsiveness to intervention, ways of dying are readily categorized (mostly) due to a handful of particular maladies. The author divides the chapters by illness: ""The Strangled Heart"" and ""Alzheimer's Disease"" and so on, except for the ending chapters he uses to discuss his point of view about end of life responsibilities of providers. As the book progresses, so does the author's discussion about doctors attempting to solve ""The Riddle"" of the patient's illness which the author states often overshadows the needs of a dying patient. I enjoyed this book most when Nuland was deconstructing the illnesses in detail, explaining processes as he went. This style was more prevalent in the earlier chapters. As the book went on, his personal ideas (based on years of personal and professional experience) about how much intervention dying patients ought seek and providers ought provide, bogged down the chapters. I would have preferred scant mention of this until a summarizing chapter at the end wherein he pulled all the threads of the bodily processes in various ailments together to philosophize about the wisdom (or not) of intrusive end of life interventions. I surmise the author intended ""how we die"" to be a dual discussion of how the body physically ends as well as how the societal and medical systems participate in that process but the discussion of the latter feels heavy-handed, especially in later chapters. Still, the book is engaging overall, the individual explanations of how a body shuts down during heart failure or AIDS was fascinating, and he raises compelling questions about the cultural and ethical considerations in end of life care. "
84,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1732804-wendy,4,"I am only giving this book 4 stars because I am not the most medically/scientifically minded, so sometimes it made me say ""huh?"" and I had to go back and reread certain things to really get a grasp. Lots of big words and new ideas here for me. That being said, since having a life now touched by death, I have looked to solace in the biological (as opposed to the spiritual) aspect of what it means to die and be dead, so this book was pretty good for explaining how death happens physically (if you didn't get that from the title). It even gave me some insight into the minds of my mom's doctors as her conditioned worsened and they sort of began to wash their hands of her and walk away. That too, was helpful and relieved me of some anger.Here's my favorite part from the last chapter....there are additional pieces of baggage we shall all take to the grave, but from which we may somewhat disencumber ourselves if we anticipate them. By these, I mean conflicts unresolved, breached relationships not healed, potentials unfulfilled, promises not kept, and years that will never be lived. For virtually every one of us, there will be unfinished business. Only the very old escape it, and even then not always. Perhaps the mere existence of things undone should be a sort of satisfaction in itself, though the idea would appear to be paradoxical. Only one who is long since dead while still seemingly alive does not have many ""promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep,"" and that state of inertness is not to be desired. To the wise advice that we live every day as though it will be our last, we do well to add the admonition to live every day as though we will be on this earth forever."
85,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/576123-debbi,4,"How We Die is a sometimes raw look at the different ways we will all face death and End of Life issues. The author, a surgeon, doesn't hold back, even when it means facing his own failings as a doctor and brother (his brother died of colon cancer a few years before the book was written).The Dr. Nuland's discomfort with the vast amount of intervention at the end of life often mirrored my own thoughts and concerns as my convictions on childbirth have migrated to End of Life decisions. “Beyond the medical establishment – and beyond even the capability of one’s own physician, no matter his beneficence – is the power that rightfully belongs to the patient and those who love him.”Sadly, far too often, patients and families are given false hopes. Either they are not given all the information to make these painful decisions, or they take upon themselves the belief that, hope upon hope, the medical establishment can restore their terminal loved one. It is a delicate dance.Not to say I always agreed with the author. He believes that in rare situations terminal patients should be allowed to hasten their own death. No matter how much I sympathize with the suffering of those facing painful deaths, I cannot go that quite that far. I feel similarly about trying to prolong our lives. It was easy enough to skim through the chapters on the main medical illnesses that befall mankind. However, I found that last three chapter’s to be invaluable and would highly recommend everyone to read the book just for the lessons to be learned there. The book is nearly 20 years old, and while some of the medical information is now dated, I feel the basic message is still salient."

While not sensationalized, the imageries of how our organs can fail in different orders are not for the faint of heart. Our physician author shares his reflections on how modern biomedicine has changed the way in which death is perceived and faced, with its gory details sanitized and hidden from public view. Nowadays, the medical community often treats its enemy as diseases or even death itself, but the author reminds medical professionals that perhaps it would also be wise to humbly remember that no one has ever escaped death, and to consider caring for patients in such a way so as to prioritize the enhancing the quality of their remaining time rather than maximizing its length by offering treatments which bring short periods of suffering often not worth the additional suffering and anguish. As for the rest of us, we can become well-informed and make the most appropriate decisions regarding our options according to our own values and preferences.In this book you will find page after page of insight and wisdom amid heartbreaking tales. I am thankful for the revelations concerning my own mortality, and the mortality of those around me. I cannot recommend this book enough for everyone in the medical profession, especially doctors and nurses at the frontline fighting for the wellbeing of patients."

In this book, an experienced physician describes the mechanisms of some of the greatest killers in the first world: heart disease, senility, violence, AIDS, and cancer. At the end he touches on the relationship between physicians and their dying charges.The prose tends toward the purple, with many references to pedestrian classics, yet the physiological descriptions can be hard to follow. More charts would help, as would more direct writing, but ultimately the ""how"" is not as important as the ""why."" Nuland's theory of bodily failure (that it all comes down to hypoxia) is a simplification, but leaves a solid impression that these seemingly disparate causes of death really are linked. The AIDS passage is tragic and beautifully written, as are many of the anecdotes. However, like many old pop-science books, science marches on and it's impossible to read that passage without thinking of how far medicine has come: in the 2010s, advertisements for pre-exposure prophylaxis (branded Truvada) are common for this disease that was a terrifying scourge in the 1990s. Throughout the book, Nuland expresses some near-futurist hopes that disease after disease will be conquered while tempered by the reality that people will continue to die, and more agonizingly so if those hopes are misplaced."

While the book is concerned with the Horsemen of Death (cancer, heart disease, strokes, septicemia, Alzheimer's), it is also as much about Nuland's life and those he cared for deeply that passed on as he observed the process as only a genius with a Photographic Memory can. It also has a significant amount of Medical History, even the history of when the book was written in 1993. In some ways (AIDS treatment for example), Medical Science has triumphed since the book was written 23 years ago. In others (Alzheimer's) we are no further along than we were then.

It seems so different from the nothing that preceded life.""This quote was only 3% in and it was immensely comforting for me to think about. Almost like we'd already done this before. I had never thought of death in that way.And then came the rest of the book. Honestly, I thought I was picking up a book about hospice, instead of all the graphic, gruesome ways disease destroys the body and how we succumb to it. I hadn't realized that this had been published at the beginning of the hospice movement in America. (January 1994! I was a month shy of my first birthday.) Obviously, this book is not suited to someone with extreme anxieties about dying. I could feel anxiety attacks coming on at certain parts. Even with that said, it's incredibly well-written and I learned a lot. So much in fact, that I bought a big bag of quinoa and oats to cut down on cholesterol and other unwanted fats. Fortunately, hospice has come a long ways from when this book was initially written, and the promise I've seen in many hospice books is that you don't have to die in pain, and that will be managed. There are many indignities as the body begins to fail, but you don't have to fear suffering.I think the epilogue was probably my favorite bit. So I'll leave this review with this quote:""The honesty and grace of the years of life that are ending is the real measure of how we die.

However, If you have been involved in care of a chronically ill family member or loved one, or have a loved one who has been killed, you probably don’t want to read all of it. (Or maybe not at all.) Cherry-picking chapters may be wise, to avoid stirring up your grief.Nuland writes about death as someone intimately familiar. He is a poet, and he is gruesome and unsparing. He is persuasive in his love of the body and his wonder with how it works, and then immediately utterly surgical in describing the horror of how things tend to end, including violence at times. I learned more about the specifics of certain diseases and general aging than I ever have via any other thing, and I feel more in love with the human body and its frailties than ever. If you’re at all squeamish, though, or recently bereaved, beware.That said: it feels important. Nuland makes the point that none of us will be spared. We’ll all die, very likely of some root cause described in this book. It seems wise and, really, compassionate to ourselves to acknowledge and try to grok that. And to begin to wrangle with the fact that doctors (at least in the US) are often primarily focused on “The Riddle” of our disease/symptoms, vs wholistic care, especially at the end of life. (This is lately, he points out in the 2010 epilogue, a business issue with capitalist healthcare as well as an issue of training.) It won’t be easy to be advocates for ourselves and the kind of life we want to live, all the way until the end, without some deliberate thinking on the topic."

One cultural defence amongst many against this scourge, is the hope for a ""good death"", ars moriendi (the art of dying). But, midst the dispassionately clinical descriptions of oxygen starved muscles, atherosclerosis induced heart failure, trauma, and the other ""doorways into death"" through which nature finally achieves her grim objective, the author (drawing on his years of medical practice) shows how often death is something abrupt, painful, and very often humiliating and detrimental to the human spirit. Yet, death is not an enemy ; if our hope of salvaging dignity from death's final throes is more likely than not to be thwarted, the only measure of dignity that we can gain succour from is the decades of life that preceded it. The art of dying is really the art of living. Death is not an enemy, because the tragedy of an individual demise, when seen in the larger context, is the triumph of nature's self-replenishing. We must die to give way to our children, as those before died for us. Midst this contemplation of life's painful finitude, lies a moral critique of modern day medicine. The latter seeks to dispute that life has a natural and inherent limit, and that when it is time to go, it is time to go. Modern day medicine suffers from an intellectual pride that is somewhat deaf to more personal and banal concerns of the patient at death's door ; treating every terminal disease as simply a puzzle to be solved runs the risk of ruinous medical expenses, a further erosion of dignity, and finally, precisely that which is most yearned to be avoided - an isolated death in the polished squalor of the modern hospital, where the majority of human beings (at least in the developed world) now expire. A dispiriting text, yet profoundly affirmative - there are certain struggles that we cannot win, best we come to terms with it. Perhaps we can make use of Rilke's poignant prayer that the author concludes with : "" Oh Lord, give each of us his own death/ The dying, that issues forth out of the life / In which he had love, meaning and despair.""

There is a fascinating blend of philosophy together with science in this book, particularly when Nuland considers what people mean when they say that they’ve seen a “white light” or felt total serenity when close to death. He reflects on how he has seen death, in patients, family members and friends, explaining how it influenced his own views on the subject. Definitely a brilliant read."

In the majority of cases there is not a dignified death; it is ugly, painful, and hard to witness so the crux of the matter is that we need to recognize that this realistic form of death is natural and that prolonging one’s life only to endure more and increased suffering is not always the best decision but dying with the ones we love and more importantly living a life full of love is the way to achieve a dignified death and not go gently into that good night.“Every life is different from any that has gone before it, and so is every death. The uniqueness of each of us extends even to the way we die. Though most people know that various diseases carry us to our final hours by various paths, only very few comprehend the fullness of that endless multitude of ways by which the final forces of the human spirit can separate themselves from the body. Every one of death's diverse appearances is as distinctive as that singular face we each show the world during the days of life. Every man will yield up the ghost in a manner that the heavens have never known before: every woman will go her final way in her own way.”“Decline is most often gradual, with plenty of warnings and much successful treatment before the final summons.”“Because it takes a pressure of approximately 120 millimeters of mercury to generate such a forceful squeeze, the left ventricle muscle is more than half an inch wide, giving it the strongest and thickest wall of all four chambers. Pushing out about 70 milliliters of blood (2/4 ounces) with each contraction, this vigorous pump drives some 7 million milliliters (more than 14.000 pints) each day in 100,000 rhythmic and powerful beats. The mechanism of a living heart is a masterpiece of nature.”“Delay it though we may, then, the victims of coronary atherosclerosis will almost certainly die of their affliction-perhaps un expectedly during a time when they seem to be responding well to treatment, perhaps of the gradual effects of congestive heart failure.”“Every resuscitation is different. Though the general pattern is similar, every sequence, every response to massage and drugs, every heart's willingness to come back-all are different. The only certainty, whether spoken or not, is that the doctors, nurses, and technicians are fighting not only death but their own uncertainties as well. In most resuscitations, those uncertainties can be narrowed down to two main questions: Are we doing the right things? and, Should we be doing anything at all?”“Actuaries seem unable to accept a natural phenomenon unless it is so well defined as to fit neatly into a distinct and easily described classification. The annual report of the federal death accountants is very orderly-not very imaginative, and to my mind not completely reflective of real life (and real death), but nevertheless very orderly. I'm convinced that plenty of people do die of old age.”“For plants and animals, renewal requires that death precede it so that the weary may be replaced by the vigorous. This is what is meant by the cycles of nature. There is nothing pathological or sick about the sequence-in fact, it is the antithesis of sick.”“Of hundreds of known diseases and their predisposing characteristics, some 85 percent of our aging population will succumb to the complications of one of only seven major entities: atherosclerosis, hypertension, adult-onset diabetes, obesity, mental depressing states such as Alzheimer's and other dementias, cancer, and decreased resistance to infection.”“The lesson taught by the twenty-three case histories is simply confirmation of the lesson that daily experience teaches. Whether it is the anarchy of disordered biochemistry or the direct result of its opposite-a carefully orchestrated genetic ride to death-we die of old age because we have been worn and torn and programmed to cave in. The very old do not succumb to disease they implode their way into eternity.”“Never yet has anyone succeeded in borrowing any time… The lesson is never learned-there will always be those who persist in seeking the Fountain of Youth, or at least delaying what is irrevocably ordained.”“Virtually every disease can be described in terms of cause and effect. The symptoms a patient presents to his doctor, and the physical findings elicited on examination, are the direct results of very specific pathological changes within cells, tissues, and organs, or of disorders in biochemical processes. Once these underlying alterations have been identified, they can be shown to have led inevitably to the observed clinical manifestations. It is the purpose of the diagnostic workup to find the cause, using its effects as clues.”“There are no consolations in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The anguish may be mitigated by good nursing care, support groups, and the closeness of friends and family, but in the end it will be necessary for patient and loved ones together to walk through that very tortuous valley of the shadow, in the course of which everything changes forever. There is no dignity in this kind of death.”“The rapid loss of approximately one-half to two-thirds of the body's blood volume is usually sufficient to arrest the heart. Since total blood volume is equal to some 7-8 percent of body weight, a bleed of eight pints in a 170-pound man or six pints in a 130-pound woman can be enough to cause clinical death. With laceration of a vessel the size of the aorta, the process takes less than a minute; a tear in the spleen or liver might take hours, or even days, on those very rare occasions when constant ooze remains unchecked.”“Many do, in this way, avoid a tormented passage; but many others are in physical and mental distress till nearly the last moment, or even at the last moment. There is a nice Victorian reticence in denying the probability of a miserable prelude to mortality, and it is what everyone wants to hear. But if peace and dignity are what we delude ourselves to expect, most of us will die wondering what we, or our doctors, have done wrong.”“No matter the degree to which a man thinks he has convinced himself that the process of dying is not to be dreaded, he will yet approach his final illness with dread.”“Accurate knowledge of how a disease kills serves to free us from unnecessary terrors of what we might be fated to endure when we die. We may thus be better prepared to recognize the stations at which it is appropriate to ask for relief, or perhaps to begin contemplating whether to end the journey altogether.”“I prefer to believe that God has nothing to do with it. We are witnessing in our time one of those cataclysms of nature that have no meaning, no precedent, and, in spite of many claims to the contrary, no useful metaphor.”“And always, the most important charge is to care for those dread fully stricken brothers and sisters of all of us, the sickest of whom are wasted, feverish, swollen, and anemic, their eyes seeking some reassurance and the unspoken promise of relief from their torment, which too often will come only with death. No matter the perseverance and moral strength so many patients muster in the face of lethal certainty, the pitiless process by which they die is dispiriting anew with every reenactment.”“The likeness is to an insidious, groping parasite, attached by sharp-clawed tentacles to the decaying surface of its imperiled prey. The clawing extremities ceaselessly extend the periphery of their malign grip, while the loathsome core of the burrowing beast eats silently away at life, able to digest only what it has first de composed. The process is noiseless; it has no recognizable instant of beginning and it ends only when the despoiler has consumed the final remnants of its host's vital forces.”“The boundaries of medical futility, however, have never been clear, and it may be too much to expect that they ever will be. It is perhaps for this reason that there has arisen the conviction among doctors-more than a mere conviction, it is nowadays felt by many to be a responsibility-that should error occur in the treatment of a patient, it must always be on the side of doing more rather than less.”“When the chips are down, almost no one wants his life to end, and one good way for the conscious mind to avoid it is for the unconscious mind to deny that it is about to happen.”“Though everyone may yearn for a tranquil death, the basic instinct to stay alive is a far more powerful force.”“The greatest dignity to be found in death is the dignity of the life that preceded it. This is a form of hope we can all achieve, and it is the most abiding of all. Hope resides in the meaning of what our lives have been.”“The lesson in all of this is well known. Hope lies not only in an expectation of cure or even of the remission of present distress. For dying patients, the hope of cure will always be shown to be ultimately false, and even the hope of relief too often turns to ashes.”“When my time comes, I will seek hope in the knowledge that insofar as possible I will not be allowed to suffer or be subjected to needless attempts to maintain life; I will seek it in the certainty that I will not be abandoned to die alone; I am seeking it now, in the way I try to live my life, so that those who value what I am will have profited by my time on earth and be left with comforting recollections of what we have meant to one another.”"

108,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5859626-andr-spiegel,4,"It's a taboo and this is a book about it, so it gets a high rating. I have learned something new about every subject it covers. I have a deeper understanding of death, dignity, hope, care. If we have to die, we want it quick, but not too quick. We want it dignified and meaningful. Very few of us will get that.Yet for long stretches, the book seems undecided how to approach death. I want to know what it's like to die of cancer, but the book tells me how cancer works, from the outside. There's a long chapter how AIDS was discovered, but little on what it's like to die of AIDS. Much gravity in the language, stilted. Appropriate to the subject, but still. I wish the final chapter, the Coda, from 2010, hadn't been written."
109,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3754944-mm,0,"I read this book because I have started to work as a healthcare professional, and in particular with countless clients who are ""palliative."" What I wanted to know was why, when I review the medical history of some of my clients (patients) with Chronic Heart Failure, and a history of a Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA), and Hypertension, and a CABG (bypass) in 2013, and kidney failure, and... what have these diagnoses done? Are they really dying of all of these things?I don't know how to explain it. I have a client right now, a sweet old lady, cute as can be, who laughs at the end of every breathless sentence she speaks. As is my job in the healthcare team, I ordered her a hospital bed - her doting daughter wishes to keep her at home - and a commode and a wheelchair and a cushion. I assess the redness developing on her coccyx (her bum) and recommend that she be turned at such and such time to prevent bedsores. Here I see an 87 year old lady dying, of course she is dying, and what she wants is rest and relaxation. So we set up her bed by the window, and she keeps her white nightgown on as her legs have edema (swelling), and she lays there with the head of the bed up to help her breath better, and the sunlight steams in, and every once in a while she groans and tries to shift her weight because she is uncomfortable in one position, and she looks positively like an angel.And I know that inside her there is a battle against kidney failure, which is why her tummy is so huge and her organs are floating in that cavity we call the abdomen. And inside her too is heart failure, which likely has caused the kidney failure. And so she is fatigued, and she is heavy - she can't fit into her wheelchair anymore - and her heaviness is creating risk for pressure injuries on her bed. And I know that she has medications by the dozens, and that I recommended the daughter get a blister pack because at some point it is impossible to keep track of all these medications.I know that this is a disease, or more accurately a plethora of diseases, each feeding off of the other - when one head is chopped off, the hydra grows another.So I know why she is dying, I suppose. But she is 87. And is she really diseased? Isn't this just her aged body saying - enough. I have worked long enough, and now I wish to be comfortable as I leave this life. Despite the list of diagnoses that go on and on, and the list of surgeries that go on and on, and the list of medications that is even longer - isn't she dying of old age? It's just that simple. She isn't dying of disease. She is dying of the natural cycle of life - not just of human life, but of all life. She is dying of the cosmic principle that says - ye shalt not last! She is dying because nothing in this world is eternal, and even thousands of years old trees must one day die, and the lion eats the gazelle, and the cat chases the mouse, and age comes after us all.So while she lies there and the healthcare team gently urges the daughter to move her mother to a hospice, I can't help but feel that somewhere along the line, by pathologizing, the dignity of old age - a dignity that is from understanding, not from the wheezing and heaving and overall grotesqueness of the last few months of life - is lost.We all must die, and death will most likely be awful, and painful, and we will very likely be surrounded by strangers. And some deaths are a tragedy, while others are just this: that Life folds her hands and places them in her lap, and her sister Death opens hers and says to us, Embrace me now, for your earthly journey is complete, so come home. And the worms will eat your body but the face of God hangs eternal, looking over it all."
110,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100050401-kathleen-murray,5,"I've given this book to at least 10 friends, and none will read it. Is it something to do with the title. This was the first, and one of the best, in the burgeoning genre of death and dying. Other than being born, death is one of the most important things that happens to us, and we might as well know a little about it. I read this when it first came out, about a year before I had health care power of attorney for an 86-year-old woman with end-stage COPD. I like to think that the section on pneumonia helped inform my decision-making, and limit the suffering of her final days. "
111,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2715247-james-klagge,4,"Some pretty rough descriptions, which illustrate the author's general point that death is rarely the serene, dignified experience for which we hope. It was not the prospect of my own death that motivated me to read this, but I couldn't help thinking about that as well. Though much of the book is taken up with describing at various levels the processes of death, the author also wanted to emphasize the difficulty and the importance of patients and their families taking some control of the process away from the medical-technological process that will otherwise dominate. The author regrets the power of specialists whose primary or sole motivation is curing or prolonging life regardless of the human cost. He quotes (p. 275) the director of the UCLA Medical Center who said in 2009: ""If you come into this hospital, we're not going to let you die."" It sounds like a perverse kind of hell. Instead, the author wishes that there were ways to value and promote family practitioners who would care about pastoring the patient as much as winning the battle. I have such a family doctor, but since he is several years older than I am, I wonder if he'll still be practicing when I need him.The main issue is deciding when it is time to stop trying and accept death. The problem is that doctors still too often don't know, and aren't happy letting patients decide, when enough is enough. This is not a lesson I needed to learn about, but it is important to think about it in advance, for oneself and one's loved ones. The discussion also reminded me of analogous issues such as when it is time to stop trying to save a dying relationship, or when it is time to stop trying to pursue an ill-fated project or profession. Hope is an important virtue, but it also has its limits. As Aristotle could have said, there can be too little hope, but there can also be too much. The author thinks we need to reconceive what we mean by hope near the end of life. Death will always win in the end. But he thinks that we can still hope for and work toward being ourselves to our last breath. Even this can be taken away from us by the ravages of death, but it is something we can aim for--to be oneself as long as possible. I really should give 5 stars to a doctor who quotes Vaclav Havel (p. 281) on hope, in a book about medicine; but the unnecessary repetitions led me to reduce the rating by a star. In any case, well-worth reading--especially since each of us will eventually die, or at least we know someone who will. :)"
112,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6269159-robyn-mcintyre,3,"This National Book Award winner came out in 1993, but I recently read it after a recommendation by a friend. Dr. Sherwin B. Nuland, the author, who passed away from colon cancer in 2014, combined stories of the difficult illnesses and deaths of family members and patients with the facts of what physically occurs during a fatal illness such as heart disease, stroke, or cancer. His primary point to be made was that people now die more often in a hospital than they do at home and that wishing for a comfortable, spiritual passing at home is pointless because death was intractable and almost always messy and humiliating.At the time, his words made quite a stir, adding to the national dialog that was revving up about how current society views death and deals with it by trying to convince the terminally ill to submit to lengthy and often painful procedures in an effort to extend their lives by a small margin.Having been through the deaths of my parents, my husband, several friends, and younger relatives, I was most taken with the stories Dr. Nuland related out of his own experience. The descriptions of the processes by which people die were less interesting to me because I had already researched most of them. Of course, people did not have access to the bounty of information now available via the internet about those processes and now, thanks to blogging, there is also a multitude of first-person experiences to be had. But in the early 90s, no such comprehensive resources existed, and Dr. Nuland's book provided a frank and somewhat shocking review of what happens during a catastrophic illness. If I had been able to read this in the 1980s and known about it in the 1990s, I'm certain I would have found it both enlightening and a cause for some sorrow.At this time, many terminally ill people are choosing hospice to try to find that 'good death' that Dr. Nuland saw as unachievable in the 80s and 90s. There is no doubt that the debilitation attending a drawn-out death is often messy and frequently painful as well as humiliating, but hospice care does attempt to provide an experience as close to a 'good' death as it is possible to get. And with a growing movement of physician-assisted deaths for terminal patients, some people are finding it possible to pass over without having to go through the most difficult parts of the dying process. I found myself wishing that How We Die could have been updated to address Dr. Nuland's thoughts on these alternatives to a hospital-based prolongation of life."
113,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7405304-deb-stone,4,"""Every life is different from any that has gone before it and so is every death."" Despite the opening line, it seems (after reading the book) that although each death is individual to the person's body peculiarities and responsiveness to intervention, ways of dying are readily categorized (mostly) due to a handful of particular maladies. The author divides the chapters by illness: ""The Strangled Heart"" and ""Alzheimer's Disease"" and so on, except for the ending chapters he uses to discuss his point of view about end of life responsibilities of providers. As the book progresses, so does the author's discussion about doctors attempting to solve ""The Riddle"" of the patient's illness which the author states often overshadows the needs of a dying patient. I enjoyed this book most when Nuland was deconstructing the illnesses in detail, explaining processes as he went. This style was more prevalent in the earlier chapters. As the book went on, his personal ideas (based on years of personal and professional experience) about how much intervention dying patients ought seek and providers ought provide, bogged down the chapters. I would have preferred scant mention of this until a summarizing chapter at the end wherein he pulled all the threads of the bodily processes in various ailments together to philosophize about the wisdom (or not) of intrusive end of life interventions. I surmise the author intended ""how we die"" to be a dual discussion of how the body physically ends as well as how the societal and medical systems participate in that process but the discussion of the latter feels heavy-handed, especially in later chapters. Still, the book is engaging overall, the individual explanations of how a body shuts down during heart failure or AIDS was fascinating, and he raises compelling questions about the cultural and ethical considerations in end of life care. "
114,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1732804-wendy,4,"I am only giving this book 4 stars because I am not the most medically/scientifically minded, so sometimes it made me say ""huh?"" and I had to go back and reread certain things to really get a grasp. Lots of big words and new ideas here for me. That being said, since having a life now touched by death, I have looked to solace in the biological (as opposed to the spiritual) aspect of what it means to die and be dead, so this book was pretty good for explaining how death happens physically (if you didn't get that from the title). It even gave me some insight into the minds of my mom's doctors as her conditioned worsened and they sort of began to wash their hands of her and walk away. That too, was helpful and relieved me of some anger.Here's my favorite part from the last chapter....there are additional pieces of baggage we shall all take to the grave, but from which we may somewhat disencumber ourselves if we anticipate them. By these, I mean conflicts unresolved, breached relationships not healed, potentials unfulfilled, promises not kept, and years that will never be lived. For virtually every one of us, there will be unfinished business. Only the very old escape it, and even then not always. Perhaps the mere existence of things undone should be a sort of satisfaction in itself, though the idea would appear to be paradoxical. Only one who is long since dead while still seemingly alive does not have many ""promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep,"" and that state of inertness is not to be desired. To the wise advice that we live every day as though it will be our last, we do well to add the admonition to live every day as though we will be on this earth forever."
115,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/576123-debbi,4,"How We Die is a sometimes raw look at the different ways we will all face death and End of Life issues. The author, a surgeon, doesn't hold back, even when it means facing his own failings as a doctor and brother (his brother died of colon cancer a few years before the book was written).The Dr. Nuland's discomfort with the vast amount of intervention at the end of life often mirrored my own thoughts and concerns as my convictions on childbirth have migrated to End of Life decisions. “Beyond the medical establishment – and beyond even the capability of one’s own physician, no matter his beneficence – is the power that rightfully belongs to the patient and those who love him.”Sadly, far too often, patients and families are given false hopes. Either they are not given all the information to make these painful decisions, or they take upon themselves the belief that, hope upon hope, the medical establishment can restore their terminal loved one. It is a delicate dance.Not to say I always agreed with the author. He believes that in rare situations terminal patients should be allowed to hasten their own death. No matter how much I sympathize with the suffering of those facing painful deaths, I cannot go that quite that far. I feel similarly about trying to prolong our lives. It was easy enough to skim through the chapters on the main medical illnesses that befall mankind. However, I found that last three chapter’s to be invaluable and would highly recommend everyone to read the book just for the lessons to be learned there. The book is nearly 20 years old, and while some of the medical information is now dated, I feel the basic message is still salient."

While not sensationalized, the imageries of how our organs can fail in different orders are not for the faint of heart. Our physician author shares his reflections on how modern biomedicine has changed the way in which death is perceived and faced, with its gory details sanitized and hidden from public view. Nowadays, the medical community often treats its enemy as diseases or even death itself, but the author reminds medical professionals that perhaps it would also be wise to humbly remember that no one has ever escaped death, and to consider caring for patients in such a way so as to prioritize the enhancing the quality of their remaining time rather than maximizing its length by offering treatments which bring short periods of suffering often not worth the additional suffering and anguish. As for the rest of us, we can become well-informed and make the most appropriate decisions regarding our options according to our own values and preferences.In this book you will find page after page of insight and wisdom amid heartbreaking tales. I am thankful for the revelations concerning my own mortality, and the mortality of those around me.

In this book, an experienced physician describes the mechanisms of some of the greatest killers in the first world: heart disease, senility, violence, AIDS, and cancer. At the end he touches on the relationship between physicians and their dying charges.The prose tends toward the purple, with many references to pedestrian classics, yet the physiological descriptions can be hard to follow. More charts would help, as would more direct writing, but ultimately the ""how"" is not as important as the ""why."" Nuland's theory of bodily failure (that it all comes down to hypoxia) is a simplification, but leaves a solid impression that these seemingly disparate causes of death really are linked. The AIDS passage is tragic and beautifully written, as are many of the anecdotes. However, like many old pop-science books, science marches on and it's impossible to read that passage without thinking of how far medicine has come: in the 2010s, advertisements for pre-exposure prophylaxis (branded Truvada) are common for this disease that was a terrifying scourge in the 1990s. Throughout the book, Nuland expresses some near-futurist hopes that disease after disease will be conquered while tempered by the reality that people will continue to die, and more agonizingly so if those hopes are misplaced."

While the book is concerned with the Horsemen of Death (cancer, heart disease, strokes, septicemia, Alzheimer's), it is also as much about Nuland's life and those he cared for deeply that passed on as he observed the process as only a genius with a Photographic Memory can. It also has a significant amount of Medical History, even the history of when the book was written in 1993. In some ways (AIDS treatment for example), Medical Science has triumphed since the book was written 23 years ago. In others (Alzheimer's) we are no further along than we were then.

I had never thought of death in that way.And then came the rest of the book. Honestly, I thought I was picking up a book about hospice, instead of all the graphic, gruesome ways disease destroys the body and how we succumb to it. I hadn't realized that this had been published at the beginning of the hospice movement in America. (January 1994! I was a month shy of my first birthday.) Obviously, this book is not suited to someone with extreme anxieties about dying. I could feel anxiety attacks coming on at certain parts. Even with that said, it's incredibly well-written and I learned a lot. So much in fact, that I bought a big bag of quinoa and oats to cut down on cholesterol and other unwanted fats. Fortunately, hospice has come a long ways from when this book was initially written, and the promise I've seen in many hospice books is that you don't have to die in pain, and that will be managed. There are many indignities as the body begins to fail, but you don't have to fear suffering.I think the epilogue was probably my favorite bit. So I'll leave this review with this quote:""The honesty and grace of the years of life that are ending is the real measure of how we die.

However, If you have been involved in care of a chronically ill family member or loved one, or have a loved one who has been killed, you probably don’t want to read all of it. (Or maybe not at all.) Cherry-picking chapters may be wise, to avoid stirring up your grief.Nuland writes about death as someone intimately familiar. He is a poet, and he is gruesome and unsparing. He is persuasive in his love of the body and his wonder with how it works, and then immediately utterly surgical in describing the horror of how things tend to end, including violence at times. I learned more about the specifics of certain diseases and general aging than I ever have via any other thing, and I feel more in love with the human body and its frailties than ever. If you’re at all squeamish, though, or recently bereaved, beware.That said: it feels important. Nuland makes the point that none of us will be spared. We’ll all die, very likely of some root cause described in this book. It seems wise and, really, compassionate to ourselves to acknowledge and try to grok that. And to begin to wrangle with the fact that doctors (at least in the US) are often primarily focused on “The Riddle” of our disease/symptoms, vs wholistic care, especially at the end of life. (This is lately, he points out in the 2010 epilogue, a business issue with capitalist healthcare as well as an issue of training.)

But, midst the dispassionately clinical descriptions of oxygen starved muscles, atherosclerosis induced heart failure, trauma, and the other ""doorways into death"" through which nature finally achieves her grim objective, the author (drawing on his years of medical practice) shows how often death is something abrupt, painful, and very often humiliating and detrimental to the human spirit. Yet, death is not an enemy ; if our hope of salvaging dignity from death's final throes is more likely than not to be thwarted, the only measure of dignity that we can gain succour from is the decades of life that preceded it. The art of dying is really the art of living. Death is not an enemy, because the tragedy of an individual demise, when seen in the larger context, is the triumph of nature's self-replenishing. We must die to give way to our children, as those before died for us. Midst this contemplation of life's painful finitude, lies a moral critique of modern day medicine. The latter seeks to dispute that life has a natural and inherent limit, and that when it is time to go, it is time to go. Modern day medicine suffers from an intellectual pride that is somewhat deaf to more personal and banal concerns of the patient at death's door ; treating every terminal disease as simply a puzzle to be solved runs the risk of ruinous medical expenses, a further erosion of dignity, and finally, precisely that which is most yearned to be avoided - an isolated death in the polished squalor of the modern hospital, where the majority of human beings (at least in the developed world) now expire. A dispiriting text, yet profoundly affirmative - there are certain struggles that we cannot win, best we come to terms with it. Perhaps we can make use of Rilke's poignant prayer that the author concludes with : "" Oh Lord, give each of us his own death/ The dying, that issues forth out of the life / In which he had love, meaning and despair.""

Also a little out-of-date in some areas (the book was published in 1994), but more relevant than ever and fascinating all the same.The book really shines when addressing our misconceptions surrounding the dying process, helping us to demystify and come to terms with it in a rational, informed manner. Will definitely revisit this one in the future. Recommended to anyone curious about a universal human experience. ""When it is accepted that there are clearly defined limits to life, then life will be seen to have a symmetry as well. There is a framework of living into which all pleasures and accomplishments fit—and pain, too. Those who would live beyond their nature-given span lose their framework...""""The fact that there is a limited right time to do the rewarding things in our lives is what creates the urgency to do them."""

Ranging from precise mechanical descriptions of the physiological common pathways at the end of life, to broad philosophical discussions about the point of the medical profession and life. As well as being really interesting, parts of this were so beautifully written they were basically poetry -In this chapter about cancer, it’s described as: “An insidious groping parasite, attached by sharp clawed tentacles to the decaying surface of its imperilled prey” What??? Such a contrast to the dry medical texts (/Wikipedia) where I usually read about this stuff. Also really harrowing to read about medicine in the 80s where tons of young people were dying of AIDS with no cures - at the same time uplifting to realise HIV is now for many a well controlled chronic disease. #progressRequired reading for all doctors?

However, Nuland has taken this challenge head on, analysing the physiology of death. No stone is left unturned as he explores how each key system in the body fails, considering each point of failure using first principles and clearly explaining how the end result comes about. There is a fascinating blend of philosophy together with science in this book, particularly when Nuland considers what people mean when they say that they’ve seen a “white light” or felt total serenity when close to death. He reflects on how he has seen death, in patients, family members and friends, explaining how it influenced his own views on the subject. Definitely a brilliant read."

136,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69318650-nathan,3,"Sherwin Nuland uses his medical experience to explain the biochemical, physical, and emotional processes that occur in some of the most common ways we die: MI, CHF, murder, suicide, Alzheimer’s, cancer, and simply our motors being worn and torn with age beyond repair. In the majority of cases there is not a dignified death; it is ugly, painful, and hard to witness so the crux of the matter is that we need to recognize that this realistic form of death is natural and that prolonging one’s life only to endure more and increased suffering is not always the best decision but dying with the ones we love and more importantly living a life full of love is the way to achieve a dignified death and not go gently into that good night.“Every life is different from any that has gone before it, and so is every death. The uniqueness of each of us extends even to the way we die. Though most people know that various diseases carry us to our final hours by various paths, only very few comprehend the fullness of that endless multitude of ways by which the final forces of the human spirit can separate themselves from the body. Every one of death's diverse appearances is as distinctive as that singular face we each show the world during the days of life. Every man will yield up the ghost in a manner that the heavens have never known before: every woman will go her final way in her own way.”“Decline is most often gradual, with plenty of warnings and much successful treatment before the final summons.”“Because it takes a pressure of approximately 120 millimeters of mercury to generate such a forceful squeeze, the left ventricle muscle is more than half an inch wide, giving it the strongest and thickest wall of all four chambers. Pushing out about 70 milliliters of blood (2/4 ounces) with each contraction, this vigorous pump drives some 7 million milliliters (more than 14.000 pints) each day in 100,000 rhythmic and powerful beats. The mechanism of a living heart is a masterpiece of nature.”“Delay it though we may, then, the victims of coronary atherosclerosis will almost certainly die of their affliction-perhaps un expectedly during a time when they seem to be responding well to treatment, perhaps of the gradual effects of congestive heart failure.”“Every resuscitation is different. Though the general pattern is similar, every sequence, every response to massage and drugs, every heart's willingness to come back-all are different. The only certainty, whether spoken or not, is that the doctors, nurses, and technicians are fighting not only death but their own uncertainties as well. In most resuscitations, those uncertainties can be narrowed down to two main questions: Are we doing the right things? and, Should we be doing anything at all?”“Actuaries seem unable to accept a natural phenomenon unless it is so well defined as to fit neatly into a distinct and easily described classification. The annual report of the federal death accountants is very orderly-not very imaginative, and to my mind not completely reflective of real life (and real death), but nevertheless very orderly. I'm convinced that plenty of people do die of old age.”“For plants and animals, renewal requires that death precede it so that the weary may be replaced by the vigorous. This is what is meant by the cycles of nature. There is nothing pathological or sick about the sequence-in fact, it is the antithesis of sick.”“Of hundreds of known diseases and their predisposing characteristics, some 85 percent of our aging population will succumb to the complications of one of only seven major entities: atherosclerosis, hypertension, adult-onset diabetes, obesity, mental depressing states such as Alzheimer's and other dementias, cancer, and decreased resistance to infection.”“The lesson taught by the twenty-three case histories is simply confirmation of the lesson that daily experience teaches. Whether it is the anarchy of disordered biochemistry or the direct result of its opposite-a carefully orchestrated genetic ride to death-we die of old age because we have been worn and torn and programmed to cave in. The very old do not succumb to disease they implode their way into eternity.”“Never yet has anyone succeeded in borrowing any time… The lesson is never learned-there will always be those who persist in seeking the Fountain of Youth, or at least delaying what is irrevocably ordained.”“Virtually every disease can be described in terms of cause and effect. The symptoms a patient presents to his doctor, and the physical findings elicited on examination, are the direct results of very specific pathological changes within cells, tissues, and organs, or of disorders in biochemical processes. Once these underlying alterations have been identified, they can be shown to have led inevitably to the observed clinical manifestations. It is the purpose of the diagnostic workup to find the cause, using its effects as clues.”“There are no consolations in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The anguish may be mitigated by good nursing care, support groups, and the closeness of friends and family, but in the end it will be necessary for patient and loved ones together to walk through that very tortuous valley of the shadow, in the course of which everything changes forever. There is no dignity in this kind of death.”“The rapid loss of approximately one-half to two-thirds of the body's blood volume is usually sufficient to arrest the heart. Since total blood volume is equal to some 7-8 percent of body weight, a bleed of eight pints in a 170-pound man or six pints in a 130-pound woman can be enough to cause clinical death. With laceration of a vessel the size of the aorta, the process takes less than a minute; a tear in the spleen or liver might take hours, or even days, on those very rare occasions when constant ooze remains unchecked.”“Many do, in this way, avoid a tormented passage; but many others are in physical and mental distress till nearly the last moment, or even at the last moment. There is a nice Victorian reticence in denying the probability of a miserable prelude to mortality, and it is what everyone wants to hear. But if peace and dignity are what we delude ourselves to expect, most of us will die wondering what we, or our doctors, have done wrong.”“No matter the degree to which a man thinks he has convinced himself that the process of dying is not to be dreaded, he will yet approach his final illness with dread.”“Accurate knowledge of how a disease kills serves to free us from unnecessary terrors of what we might be fated to endure when we die. We may thus be better prepared to recognize the stations at which it is appropriate to ask for relief, or perhaps to begin contemplating whether to end the journey altogether.”“I prefer to believe that God has nothing to do with it. We are witnessing in our time one of those cataclysms of nature that have no meaning, no precedent, and, in spite of many claims to the contrary, no useful metaphor.”“And always, the most important charge is to care for those dread fully stricken brothers and sisters of all of us, the sickest of whom are wasted, feverish, swollen, and anemic, their eyes seeking some reassurance and the unspoken promise of relief from their torment, which too often will come only with death. No matter the perseverance and moral strength so many patients muster in the face of lethal certainty, the pitiless process by which they die is dispiriting anew with every reenactment.”“The likeness is to an insidious, groping parasite, attached by sharp-clawed tentacles to the decaying surface of its imperiled prey. The clawing extremities ceaselessly extend the periphery of their malign grip, while the loathsome core of the burrowing beast eats silently away at life, able to digest only what it has first de composed. The process is noiseless; it has no recognizable instant of beginning and it ends only when the despoiler has consumed the final remnants of its host's vital forces.”“The boundaries of medical futility, however, have never been clear, and it may be too much to expect that they ever will be. It is perhaps for this reason that there has arisen the conviction among doctors-more than a mere conviction, it is nowadays felt by many to be a responsibility-that should error occur in the treatment of a patient, it must always be on the side of doing more rather than less.”“When the chips are down, almost no one wants his life to end, and one good way for the conscious mind to avoid it is for the unconscious mind to deny that it is about to happen.”“Though everyone may yearn for a tranquil death, the basic instinct to stay alive is a far more powerful force.”“The greatest dignity to be found in death is the dignity of the life that preceded it. This is a form of hope we can all achieve, and it is the most abiding of all. Hope resides in the meaning of what our lives have been.”“The lesson in all of this is well known. Hope lies not only in an expectation of cure or even of the remission of present distress. For dying patients, the hope of cure will always be shown to be ultimately false, and even the hope of relief too often turns to ashes.”“When my time comes, I will seek hope in the knowledge that insofar as possible I will not be allowed to suffer or be subjected to needless attempts to maintain life; I will seek it in the certainty that I will not be abandoned to die alone; I am seeking it now, in the way I try to live my life, so that those who value what I am will have profited by my time on earth and be left with comforting recollections of what we have meant to one another.”"

138,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5859626-andr-spiegel,4,"It's a taboo and this is a book about it, so it gets a high rating. I have learned something new about every subject it covers. I have a deeper understanding of death, dignity, hope, care. If we have to die, we want it quick, but not too quick. We want it dignified and meaningful. Very few of us will get that.Yet for long stretches, the book seems undecided how to approach death. I want to know what it's like to die of cancer, but the book tells me how cancer works, from the outside. There's a long chapter how AIDS was discovered, but little on what it's like to die of AIDS. Much gravity in the language, stilted. Appropriate to the subject, but still. I wish the final chapter, the Coda, from 2010, hadn't been written."
139,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3754944-mm,0,"I read this book because I have started to work as a healthcare professional, and in particular with countless clients who are ""palliative."" What I wanted to know was why, when I review the medical history of some of my clients (patients) with Chronic Heart Failure, and a history of a Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA), and Hypertension, and a CABG (bypass) in 2013, and kidney failure, and... what have these diagnoses done? Are they really dying of all of these things?I don't know how to explain it. I have a client right now, a sweet old lady, cute as can be, who laughs at the end of every breathless sentence she speaks. As is my job in the healthcare team, I ordered her a hospital bed - her doting daughter wishes to keep her at home - and a commode and a wheelchair and a cushion. I assess the redness developing on her coccyx (her bum) and recommend that she be turned at such and such time to prevent bedsores. Here I see an 87 year old lady dying, of course she is dying, and what she wants is rest and relaxation. So we set up her bed by the window, and she keeps her white nightgown on as her legs have edema (swelling), and she lays there with the head of the bed up to help her breath better, and the sunlight steams in, and every once in a while she groans and tries to shift her weight because she is uncomfortable in one position, and she looks positively like an angel.And I know that inside her there is a battle against kidney failure, which is why her tummy is so huge and her organs are floating in that cavity we call the abdomen. And inside her too is heart failure, which likely has caused the kidney failure. And so she is fatigued, and she is heavy - she can't fit into her wheelchair anymore - and her heaviness is creating risk for pressure injuries on her bed. And I know that she has medications by the dozens, and that I recommended the daughter get a blister pack because at some point it is impossible to keep track of all these medications.I know that this is a disease, or more accurately a plethora of diseases, each feeding off of the other - when one head is chopped off, the hydra grows another.So I know why she is dying, I suppose. But she is 87. And is she really diseased? Isn't this just her aged body saying - enough. I have worked long enough, and now I wish to be comfortable as I leave this life. Despite the list of diagnoses that go on and on, and the list of surgeries that go on and on, and the list of medications that is even longer - isn't she dying of old age? It's just that simple. She isn't dying of disease. She is dying of the natural cycle of life - not just of human life, but of all life. She is dying of the cosmic principle that says - ye shalt not last! She is dying because nothing in this world is eternal, and even thousands of years old trees must one day die, and the lion eats the gazelle, and the cat chases the mouse, and age comes after us all.So while she lies there and the healthcare team gently urges the daughter to move her mother to a hospice, I can't help but feel that somewhere along the line, by pathologizing, the dignity of old age - a dignity that is from understanding, not from the wheezing and heaving and overall grotesqueness of the last few months of life - is lost.We all must die, and death will most likely be awful, and painful, and we will very likely be surrounded by strangers. And some deaths are a tragedy, while others are just this: that Life folds her hands and places them in her lap, and her sister Death opens hers and says to us, Embrace me now, for your earthly journey is complete, so come home. And the worms will eat your body but the face of God hangs eternal, looking over it all."
140,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100050401-kathleen-murray,5,"I've given this book to at least 10 friends, and none will read it. Is it something to do with the title. This was the first, and one of the best, in the burgeoning genre of death and dying. Other than being born, death is one of the most important things that happens to us, and we might as well know a little about it. I read this when it first came out, about a year before I had health care power of attorney for an 86-year-old woman with end-stage COPD. I like to think that the section on pneumonia helped inform my decision-making, and limit the suffering of her final days. "
141,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2715247-james-klagge,4,"Some pretty rough descriptions, which illustrate the author's general point that death is rarely the serene, dignified experience for which we hope. It was not the prospect of my own death that motivated me to read this, but I couldn't help thinking about that as well. Though much of the book is taken up with describing at various levels the processes of death, the author also wanted to emphasize the difficulty and the importance of patients and their families taking some control of the process away from the medical-technological process that will otherwise dominate. The author regrets the power of specialists whose primary or sole motivation is curing or prolonging life regardless of the human cost. He quotes (p. 275) the director of the UCLA Medical Center who said in 2009: ""If you come into this hospital, we're not going to let you die."" It sounds like a perverse kind of hell. Instead, the author wishes that there were ways to value and promote family practitioners who would care about pastoring the patient as much as winning the battle. I have such a family doctor, but since he is several years older than I am, I wonder if he'll still be practicing when I need him.The main issue is deciding when it is time to stop trying and accept death. The problem is that doctors still too often don't know, and aren't happy letting patients decide, when enough is enough. This is not a lesson I needed to learn about, but it is important to think about it in advance, for oneself and one's loved ones. The discussion also reminded me of analogous issues such as when it is time to stop trying to save a dying relationship, or when it is time to stop trying to pursue an ill-fated project or profession. Hope is an important virtue, but it also has its limits. As Aristotle could have said, there can be too little hope, but there can also be too much. The author thinks we need to reconceive what we mean by hope near the end of life. Death will always win in the end. But he thinks that we can still hope for and work toward being ourselves to our last breath. Even this can be taken away from us by the ravages of death, but it is something we can aim for--to be oneself as long as possible. I really should give 5 stars to a doctor who quotes Vaclav Havel (p. 281) on hope, in a book about medicine; but the unnecessary repetitions led me to reduce the rating by a star. In any case, well-worth reading--especially since each of us will eventually die, or at least we know someone who will. :)"
142,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6269159-robyn-mcintyre,3,"This National Book Award winner came out in 1993, but I recently read it after a recommendation by a friend. Dr. Sherwin B. Nuland, the author, who passed away from colon cancer in 2014, combined stories of the difficult illnesses and deaths of family members and patients with the facts of what physically occurs during a fatal illness such as heart disease, stroke, or cancer. His primary point to be made was that people now die more often in a hospital than they do at home and that wishing for a comfortable, spiritual passing at home is pointless because death was intractable and almost always messy and humiliating.At the time, his words made quite a stir, adding to the national dialog that was revving up about how current society views death and deals with it by trying to convince the terminally ill to submit to lengthy and often painful procedures in an effort to extend their lives by a small margin.Having been through the deaths of my parents, my husband, several friends, and younger relatives, I was most taken with the stories Dr. Nuland related out of his own experience. The descriptions of the processes by which people die were less interesting to me because I had already researched most of them. Of course, people did not have access to the bounty of information now available via the internet about those processes and now, thanks to blogging, there is also a multitude of first-person experiences to be had. But in the early 90s, no such comprehensive resources existed, and Dr. Nuland's book provided a frank and somewhat shocking review of what happens during a catastrophic illness. If I had been able to read this in the 1980s and known about it in the 1990s, I'm certain I would have found it both enlightening and a cause for some sorrow.At this time, many terminally ill people are choosing hospice to try to find that 'good death' that Dr. Nuland saw as unachievable in the 80s and 90s. There is no doubt that the debilitation attending a drawn-out death is often messy and frequently painful as well as humiliating, but hospice care does attempt to provide an experience as close to a 'good' death as it is possible to get. And with a growing movement of physician-assisted deaths for terminal patients, some people are finding it possible to pass over without having to go through the most difficult parts of the dying process. I found myself wishing that How We Die could have been updated to address Dr. Nuland's thoughts on these alternatives to a hospital-based prolongation of life."
143,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7405304-deb-stone,4,"""Every life is different from any that has gone before it and so is every death."" Despite the opening line, it seems (after reading the book) that although each death is individual to the person's body peculiarities and responsiveness to intervention, ways of dying are readily categorized (mostly) due to a handful of particular maladies. The author divides the chapters by illness: ""The Strangled Heart"" and ""Alzheimer's Disease"" and so on, except for the ending chapters he uses to discuss his point of view about end of life responsibilities of providers. As the book progresses, so does the author's discussion about doctors attempting to solve ""The Riddle"" of the patient's illness which the author states often overshadows the needs of a dying patient. I enjoyed this book most when Nuland was deconstructing the illnesses in detail, explaining processes as he went. This style was more prevalent in the earlier chapters. As the book went on, his personal ideas (based on years of personal and professional experience) about how much intervention dying patients ought seek and providers ought provide, bogged down the chapters. I would have preferred scant mention of this until a summarizing chapter at the end wherein he pulled all the threads of the bodily processes in various ailments together to philosophize about the wisdom (or not) of intrusive end of life interventions. I surmise the author intended ""how we die"" to be a dual discussion of how the body physically ends as well as how the societal and medical systems participate in that process but the discussion of the latter feels heavy-handed, especially in later chapters. Still, the book is engaging overall, the individual explanations of how a body shuts down during heart failure or AIDS was fascinating, and he raises compelling questions about the cultural and ethical considerations in end of life care. "
144,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1732804-wendy,4,"I am only giving this book 4 stars because I am not the most medically/scientifically minded, so sometimes it made me say ""huh?"" and I had to go back and reread certain things to really get a grasp. Lots of big words and new ideas here for me. That being said, since having a life now touched by death, I have looked to solace in the biological (as opposed to the spiritual) aspect of what it means to die and be dead, so this book was pretty good for explaining how death happens physically (if you didn't get that from the title). It even gave me some insight into the minds of my mom's doctors as her conditioned worsened and they sort of began to wash their hands of her and walk away. That too, was helpful and relieved me of some anger.Here's my favorite part from the last chapter....there are additional pieces of baggage we shall all take to the grave, but from which we may somewhat disencumber ourselves if we anticipate them. By these, I mean conflicts unresolved, breached relationships not healed, potentials unfulfilled, promises not kept, and years that will never be lived. For virtually every one of us, there will be unfinished business. Only the very old escape it, and even then not always. Perhaps the mere existence of things undone should be a sort of satisfaction in itself, though the idea would appear to be paradoxical. Only one who is long since dead while still seemingly alive does not have many ""promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep,"" and that state of inertness is not to be desired. To the wise advice that we live every day as though it will be our last, we do well to add the admonition to live every day as though we will be on this earth forever."
145,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/576123-debbi,4,"How We Die is a sometimes raw look at the different ways we will all face death and End of Life issues. The author, a surgeon, doesn't hold back, even when it means facing his own failings as a doctor and brother (his brother died of colon cancer a few years before the book was written).The Dr. Nuland's discomfort with the vast amount of intervention at the end of life often mirrored my own thoughts and concerns as my convictions on childbirth have migrated to End of Life decisions. “Beyond the medical establishment – and beyond even the capability of one’s own physician, no matter his beneficence – is the power that rightfully belongs to the patient and those who love him.”Sadly, far too often, patients and families are given false hopes. Either they are not given all the information to make these painful decisions, or they take upon themselves the belief that, hope upon hope, the medical establishment can restore their terminal loved one. It is a delicate dance.Not to say I always agreed with the author. He believes that in rare situations terminal patients should be allowed to hasten their own death. No matter how much I sympathize with the suffering of those facing painful deaths, I cannot go that quite that far. I feel similarly about trying to prolong our lives. It was easy enough to skim through the chapters on the main medical illnesses that befall mankind. However, I found that last three chapter’s to be invaluable and would highly recommend everyone to read the book just for the lessons to be learned there. The book is nearly 20 years old, and while some of the medical information is now dated, I feel the basic message is still salient."

While not sensationalized, the imageries of how our organs can fail in different orders are not for the faint of heart. Our physician author shares his reflections on how modern biomedicine has changed the way in which death is perceived and faced, with its gory details sanitized and hidden from public view. Nowadays, the medical community often treats its enemy as diseases or even death itself, but the author reminds medical professionals that perhaps it would also be wise to humbly remember that no one has ever escaped death, and to consider caring for patients in such a way so as to prioritize the enhancing the quality of their remaining time rather than maximizing its length by offering treatments which bring short periods of suffering often not worth the additional suffering and anguish. As for the rest of us, we can become well-informed and make the most appropriate decisions regarding our options according to our own values and preferences.In this book you will find page after page of insight and wisdom amid heartbreaking tales.

Not many people die at home anymore….approximately 80 percent of Americans who die in a hospital….An entire mythology has grown up around the process of dying. Like most mythologies, it is based on the inborn psychological need that all humankind shares. The mythologies of death are meant to combat fear on the one hand and its opposite—wishes—on the other. They are meant to serve us by disarming our terror about what the reality may be> While so many of us hope for a swift death or a death during sleep “so I won’t suffer,” we at the same time cling to an image of our final moments that combines grace with a sense of closure; we need to believe in a clear-minded process in which the summation of a life takes place—either that or a perfect lapse into agony-free unconsciousness. –p8It is this so-called terminal gasp phase that allows the aspiration of so much water that its absorption in a freshwater drowning may account for as much as 50 percent of the blood volume. – p161Drowning kills almost five thousand people in the United States each year, and alcohol is involved 40 percent of the time.

In this book, an experienced physician describes the mechanisms of some of the greatest killers in the first world: heart disease, senility, violence, AIDS, and cancer. At the end he touches on the relationship between physicians and their dying charges.The prose tends toward the purple, with many references to pedestrian classics, yet the physiological descriptions can be hard to follow. More charts would help, as would more direct writing, but ultimately the ""how"" is not as important as the ""why."" Nuland's theory of bodily failure (that it all comes down to hypoxia) is a simplification, but leaves a solid impression that these seemingly disparate causes of death really are linked. The AIDS passage is tragic and beautifully written, as are many of the anecdotes. However, like many old pop-science books, science marches on and it's impossible to read that passage without thinking of how far medicine has come: in the 2010s, advertisements for pre-exposure prophylaxis (branded Truvada) are common for this disease that was a terrifying scourge in the 1990s. Throughout the book, Nuland expresses some near-futurist hopes that disease after disease will be conquered while tempered by the reality that people will continue to die, and more agonizingly so if those hopes are misplaced."

While the book is concerned with the Horsemen of Death (cancer, heart disease, strokes, septicemia, Alzheimer's), it is also as much about Nuland's life and those he cared for deeply that passed on as he observed the process as only a genius with a Photographic Memory can. It also has a significant amount of Medical History, even the history of when the book was written in 1993. In some ways (AIDS treatment for example), Medical Science has triumphed since the book was written 23 years ago. In others (Alzheimer's) we are no further along than we were then.

It seems so different from the nothing that preceded life.""This quote was only 3% in and it was immensely comforting for me to think about. Almost like we'd already done this before. I had never thought of death in that way.And then came the rest of the book. Honestly, I thought I was picking up a book about hospice, instead of all the graphic, gruesome ways disease destroys the body and how we succumb to it. I hadn't realized that this had been published at the beginning of the hospice movement in America. (January 1994! I was a month shy of my first birthday.) Obviously, this book is not suited to someone with extreme anxieties about dying. I could feel anxiety attacks coming on at certain parts. Even with that said, it's incredibly well-written and I learned a lot. So much in fact, that I bought a big bag of quinoa and oats to cut down on cholesterol and other unwanted fats. Fortunately, hospice has come a long ways from when this book was initially written, and the promise I've seen in many hospice books is that you don't have to die in pain, and that will be managed. There are many indignities as the body begins to fail, but you don't have to fear suffering.I think the epilogue was probably my favorite bit. So I'll leave this review with this quote:""The honesty and grace of the years of life that are ending is the real measure of how we die. It is not in the last weeks or days that we compose the message that will be remembered, but in all the decades that preceded them."""

However, If you have been involved in care of a chronically ill family member or loved one, or have a loved one who has been killed, you probably don’t want to read all of it. (Or maybe not at all.) Cherry-picking chapters may be wise, to avoid stirring up your grief.Nuland writes about death as someone intimately familiar. He is a poet, and he is gruesome and unsparing. He is persuasive in his love of the body and his wonder with how it works, and then immediately utterly surgical in describing the horror of how things tend to end, including violence at times. I learned more about the specifics of certain diseases and general aging than I ever have via any other thing, and I feel more in love with the human body and its frailties than ever. If you’re at all squeamish, though, or recently bereaved, beware.That said: it feels important. Nuland makes the point that none of us will be spared. We’ll all die, very likely of some root cause described in this book. It seems wise and, really, compassionate to ourselves to acknowledge and try to grok that. And to begin to wrangle with the fact that doctors (at least in the US) are often primarily focused on “The Riddle” of our disease/symptoms, vs wholistic care, especially at the end of life. (This is lately, he points out in the 2010 epilogue, a business issue with capitalist healthcare as well as an issue of training.) It won’t be easy to be advocates for ourselves and the kind of life we want to live, all the way until the end, without some deliberate thinking on the topic."

One cultural defence amongst many against this scourge, is the hope for a ""good death"", ars moriendi (the art of dying). But, midst the dispassionately clinical descriptions of oxygen starved muscles, atherosclerosis induced heart failure, trauma, and the other ""doorways into death"" through which nature finally achieves her grim objective, the author (drawing on his years of medical practice) shows how often death is something abrupt, painful, and very often humiliating and detrimental to the human spirit. Yet, death is not an enemy ; if our hope of salvaging dignity from death's final throes is more likely than not to be thwarted, the only measure of dignity that we can gain succour from is the decades of life that preceded it. The art of dying is really the art of living. Death is not an enemy, because the tragedy of an individual demise, when seen in the larger context, is the triumph of nature's self-replenishing. We must die to give way to our children, as those before died for us. Midst this contemplation of life's painful finitude, lies a moral critique of modern day medicine. The latter seeks to dispute that life has a natural and inherent limit, and that when it is time to go, it is time to go. Modern day medicine suffers from an intellectual pride that is somewhat deaf to more personal and banal concerns of the patient at death's door ; treating every terminal disease as simply a puzzle to be solved runs the risk of ruinous medical expenses, a further erosion of dignity, and finally, precisely that which is most yearned to be avoided - an isolated death in the polished squalor of the modern hospital, where the majority of human beings (at least in the developed world) now expire. A dispiriting text, yet profoundly affirmative - there are certain struggles that we cannot win, best we come to terms with it. Perhaps we can make use of Rilke's poignant prayer that the author concludes with : "" Oh Lord, give each of us his own death/ The dying, that issues forth out of the life / In which he had love, meaning and despair.""

Will definitely revisit this one in the future. Recommended to anyone curious about a universal human experience.

However, Nuland has taken this challenge head on, analysing the physiology of death. No stone is left unturned as he explores how each key system in the body fails, considering each point of failure using first principles and clearly explaining how the end result comes about. There is a fascinating blend of philosophy together with science in this book, particularly when Nuland considers what people mean when they say that they’ve seen a “white light” or felt total serenity when close to death. He reflects on how he has seen death, in patients, family members and friends, explaining how it influenced his own views on the subject. Definitely a brilliant read."

166,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69318650-nathan,3,"Sherwin Nuland uses his medical experience to explain the biochemical, physical, and emotional processes that occur in some of the most common ways we die: MI, CHF, murder, suicide, Alzheimer’s, cancer, and simply our motors being worn and torn with age beyond repair. In the majority of cases there is not a dignified death; it is ugly, painful, and hard to witness so the crux of the matter is that we need to recognize that this realistic form of death is natural and that prolonging one’s life only to endure more and increased suffering is not always the best decision but dying with the ones we love and more importantly living a life full of love is the way to achieve a dignified death and not go gently into that good night.“Every life is different from any that has gone before it, and so is every death. The uniqueness of each of us extends even to the way we die. Though most people know that various diseases carry us to our final hours by various paths, only very few comprehend the fullness of that endless multitude of ways by which the final forces of the human spirit can separate themselves from the body. Every one of death's diverse appearances is as distinctive as that singular face we each show the world during the days of life. Every man will yield up the ghost in a manner that the heavens have never known before: every woman will go her final way in her own way.”“Decline is most often gradual, with plenty of warnings and much successful treatment before the final summons.”“Because it takes a pressure of approximately 120 millimeters of mercury to generate such a forceful squeeze, the left ventricle muscle is more than half an inch wide, giving it the strongest and thickest wall of all four chambers. Pushing out about 70 milliliters of blood (2/4 ounces) with each contraction, this vigorous pump drives some 7 million milliliters (more than 14.000 pints) each day in 100,000 rhythmic and powerful beats. The mechanism of a living heart is a masterpiece of nature.”“Delay it though we may, then, the victims of coronary atherosclerosis will almost certainly die of their affliction-perhaps un expectedly during a time when they seem to be responding well to treatment, perhaps of the gradual effects of congestive heart failure.”“Every resuscitation is different. Though the general pattern is similar, every sequence, every response to massage and drugs, every heart's willingness to come back-all are different. The only certainty, whether spoken or not, is that the doctors, nurses, and technicians are fighting not only death but their own uncertainties as well. In most resuscitations, those uncertainties can be narrowed down to two main questions: Are we doing the right things? and, Should we be doing anything at all?”“Actuaries seem unable to accept a natural phenomenon unless it is so well defined as to fit neatly into a distinct and easily described classification. The annual report of the federal death accountants is very orderly-not very imaginative, and to my mind not completely reflective of real life (and real death), but nevertheless very orderly. I'm convinced that plenty of people do die of old age.”“For plants and animals, renewal requires that death precede it so that the weary may be replaced by the vigorous. This is what is meant by the cycles of nature. There is nothing pathological or sick about the sequence-in fact, it is the antithesis of sick.”“Of hundreds of known diseases and their predisposing characteristics, some 85 percent of our aging population will succumb to the complications of one of only seven major entities: atherosclerosis, hypertension, adult-onset diabetes, obesity, mental depressing states such as Alzheimer's and other dementias, cancer, and decreased resistance to infection.”“The lesson taught by the twenty-three case histories is simply confirmation of the lesson that daily experience teaches. Whether it is the anarchy of disordered biochemistry or the direct result of its opposite-a carefully orchestrated genetic ride to death-we die of old age because we have been worn and torn and programmed to cave in. The very old do not succumb to disease they implode their way into eternity.”“Never yet has anyone succeeded in borrowing any time… The lesson is never learned-there will always be those who persist in seeking the Fountain of Youth, or at least delaying what is irrevocably ordained.”“Virtually every disease can be described in terms of cause and effect. The symptoms a patient presents to his doctor, and the physical findings elicited on examination, are the direct results of very specific pathological changes within cells, tissues, and organs, or of disorders in biochemical processes. Once these underlying alterations have been identified, they can be shown to have led inevitably to the observed clinical manifestations. It is the purpose of the diagnostic workup to find the cause, using its effects as clues.”“There are no consolations in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The anguish may be mitigated by good nursing care, support groups, and the closeness of friends and family, but in the end it will be necessary for patient and loved ones together to walk through that very tortuous valley of the shadow, in the course of which everything changes forever. There is no dignity in this kind of death.”“The rapid loss of approximately one-half to two-thirds of the body's blood volume is usually sufficient to arrest the heart. Since total blood volume is equal to some 7-8 percent of body weight, a bleed of eight pints in a 170-pound man or six pints in a 130-pound woman can be enough to cause clinical death. With laceration of a vessel the size of the aorta, the process takes less than a minute; a tear in the spleen or liver might take hours, or even days, on those very rare occasions when constant ooze remains unchecked.”“Many do, in this way, avoid a tormented passage; but many others are in physical and mental distress till nearly the last moment, or even at the last moment. There is a nice Victorian reticence in denying the probability of a miserable prelude to mortality, and it is what everyone wants to hear. But if peace and dignity are what we delude ourselves to expect, most of us will die wondering what we, or our doctors, have done wrong.”“No matter the degree to which a man thinks he has convinced himself that the process of dying is not to be dreaded, he will yet approach his final illness with dread.”“Accurate knowledge of how a disease kills serves to free us from unnecessary terrors of what we might be fated to endure when we die. We may thus be better prepared to recognize the stations at which it is appropriate to ask for relief, or perhaps to begin contemplating whether to end the journey altogether.”“I prefer to believe that God has nothing to do with it. We are witnessing in our time one of those cataclysms of nature that have no meaning, no precedent, and, in spite of many claims to the contrary, no useful metaphor.”“And always, the most important charge is to care for those dread fully stricken brothers and sisters of all of us, the sickest of whom are wasted, feverish, swollen, and anemic, their eyes seeking some reassurance and the unspoken promise of relief from their torment, which too often will come only with death. No matter the perseverance and moral strength so many patients muster in the face of lethal certainty, the pitiless process by which they die is dispiriting anew with every reenactment.”“The likeness is to an insidious, groping parasite, attached by sharp-clawed tentacles to the decaying surface of its imperiled prey. The clawing extremities ceaselessly extend the periphery of their malign grip, while the loathsome core of the burrowing beast eats silently away at life, able to digest only what it has first de composed. The process is noiseless; it has no recognizable instant of beginning and it ends only when the despoiler has consumed the final remnants of its host's vital forces.”“The boundaries of medical futility, however, have never been clear, and it may be too much to expect that they ever will be. It is perhaps for this reason that there has arisen the conviction among doctors-more than a mere conviction, it is nowadays felt by many to be a responsibility-that should error occur in the treatment of a patient, it must always be on the side of doing more rather than less.”“When the chips are down, almost no one wants his life to end, and one good way for the conscious mind to avoid it is for the unconscious mind to deny that it is about to happen.”“Though everyone may yearn for a tranquil death, the basic instinct to stay alive is a far more powerful force.”“The greatest dignity to be found in death is the dignity of the life that preceded it. This is a form of hope we can all achieve, and it is the most abiding of all. Hope resides in the meaning of what our lives have been.”“The lesson in all of this is well known. Hope lies not only in an expectation of cure or even of the remission of present distress. For dying patients, the hope of cure will always be shown to be ultimately false, and even the hope of relief too often turns to ashes.”“When my time comes, I will seek hope in the knowledge that insofar as possible I will not be allowed to suffer or be subjected to needless attempts to maintain life; I will seek it in the certainty that I will not be abandoned to die alone; I am seeking it now, in the way I try to live my life, so that those who value what I am will have profited by my time on earth and be left with comforting recollections of what we have meant to one another.”"

I have a deeper understanding of death, dignity, hope, care. If we have to die, we want it quick, but not too quick. We want it dignified and meaningful. Very few of us will get that.Yet for long stretches, the book seems undecided how to approach death. I want to know what it's like to die of cancer, but the book tells me how cancer works, from the outside. There's a long chapter how AIDS was discovered, but little on what it's like to die of AIDS. Much gravity in the language, stilted. Appropriate to the subject, but still. I wish the final chapter, the Coda, from 2010, hadn't been written."
169,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3754944-mm,0,"I read this book because I have started to work as a healthcare professional, and in particular with countless clients who are ""palliative."" What I wanted to know was why, when I review the medical history of some of my clients (patients) with Chronic Heart Failure, and a history of a Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA), and Hypertension, and a CABG (bypass) in 2013, and kidney failure, and... what have these diagnoses done? Are they really dying of all of these things?I don't know how to explain it. I have a client right now, a sweet old lady, cute as can be, who laughs at the end of every breathless sentence she speaks. As is my job in the healthcare team, I ordered her a hospital bed - her doting daughter wishes to keep her at home - and a commode and a wheelchair and a cushion. I assess the redness developing on her coccyx (her bum) and recommend that she be turned at such and such time to prevent bedsores. Here I see an 87 year old lady dying, of course she is dying, and what she wants is rest and relaxation. So we set up her bed by the window, and she keeps her white nightgown on as her legs have edema (swelling), and she lays there with the head of the bed up to help her breath better, and the sunlight steams in, and every once in a while she groans and tries to shift her weight because she is uncomfortable in one position, and she looks positively like an angel.And I know that inside her there is a battle against kidney failure, which is why her tummy is so huge and her organs are floating in that cavity we call the abdomen. And inside her too is heart failure, which likely has caused the kidney failure. And so she is fatigued, and she is heavy - she can't fit into her wheelchair anymore - and her heaviness is creating risk for pressure injuries on her bed. And I know that she has medications by the dozens, and that I recommended the daughter get a blister pack because at some point it is impossible to keep track of all these medications.I know that this is a disease, or more accurately a plethora of diseases, each feeding off of the other - when one head is chopped off, the hydra grows another.So I know why she is dying, I suppose. But she is 87. And is she really diseased? Isn't this just her aged body saying - enough. I have worked long enough, and now I wish to be comfortable as I leave this life. Despite the list of diagnoses that go on and on, and the list of surgeries that go on and on, and the list of medications that is even longer - isn't she dying of old age? It's just that simple. She isn't dying of disease. She is dying of the natural cycle of life - not just of human life, but of all life. She is dying of the cosmic principle that says - ye shalt not last! She is dying because nothing in this world is eternal, and even thousands of years old trees must one day die, and the lion eats the gazelle, and the cat chases the mouse, and age comes after us all.So while she lies there and the healthcare team gently urges the daughter to move her mother to a hospice, I can't help but feel that somewhere along the line, by pathologizing, the dignity of old age - a dignity that is from understanding, not from the wheezing and heaving and overall grotesqueness of the last few months of life - is lost.We all must die, and death will most likely be awful, and painful, and we will very likely be surrounded by strangers. And some deaths are a tragedy, while others are just this: that Life folds her hands and places them in her lap, and her sister Death opens hers and says to us, Embrace me now, for your earthly journey is complete, so come home. And the worms will eat your body but the face of God hangs eternal, looking over it all."
170,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100050401-kathleen-murray,5,"I've given this book to at least 10 friends, and none will read it. Is it something to do with the title. This was the first, and one of the best, in the burgeoning genre of death and dying. Other than being born, death is one of the most important things that happens to us, and we might as well know a little about it. I read this when it first came out, about a year before I had health care power of attorney for an 86-year-old woman with end-stage COPD. I like to think that the section on pneumonia helped inform my decision-making, and limit the suffering of her final days. "
171,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2715247-james-klagge,4,"Some pretty rough descriptions, which illustrate the author's general point that death is rarely the serene, dignified experience for which we hope. It was not the prospect of my own death that motivated me to read this, but I couldn't help thinking about that as well. Though much of the book is taken up with describing at various levels the processes of death, the author also wanted to emphasize the difficulty and the importance of patients and their families taking some control of the process away from the medical-technological process that will otherwise dominate. The author regrets the power of specialists whose primary or sole motivation is curing or prolonging life regardless of the human cost. He quotes (p. 275) the director of the UCLA Medical Center who said in 2009: ""If you come into this hospital, we're not going to let you die."" It sounds like a perverse kind of hell. Instead, the author wishes that there were ways to value and promote family practitioners who would care about pastoring the patient as much as winning the battle. I have such a family doctor, but since he is several years older than I am, I wonder if he'll still be practicing when I need him.The main issue is deciding when it is time to stop trying and accept death. The problem is that doctors still too often don't know, and aren't happy letting patients decide, when enough is enough. This is not a lesson I needed to learn about, but it is important to think about it in advance, for oneself and one's loved ones. The discussion also reminded me of analogous issues such as when it is time to stop trying to save a dying relationship, or when it is time to stop trying to pursue an ill-fated project or profession. Hope is an important virtue, but it also has its limits. As Aristotle could have said, there can be too little hope, but there can also be too much. The author thinks we need to reconceive what we mean by hope near the end of life. Death will always win in the end. But he thinks that we can still hope for and work toward being ourselves to our last breath. Even this can be taken away from us by the ravages of death, but it is something we can aim for--to be oneself as long as possible. I really should give 5 stars to a doctor who quotes Vaclav Havel (p. 281) on hope, in a book about medicine; but the unnecessary repetitions led me to reduce the rating by a star. In any case, well-worth reading--especially since each of us will eventually die, or at least we know someone who will. :)"
172,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6269159-robyn-mcintyre,3,"This National Book Award winner came out in 1993, but I recently read it after a recommendation by a friend. Dr. Sherwin B. Nuland, the author, who passed away from colon cancer in 2014, combined stories of the difficult illnesses and deaths of family members and patients with the facts of what physically occurs during a fatal illness such as heart disease, stroke, or cancer. His primary point to be made was that people now die more often in a hospital than they do at home and that wishing for a comfortable, spiritual passing at home is pointless because death was intractable and almost always messy and humiliating.At the time, his words made quite a stir, adding to the national dialog that was revving up about how current society views death and deals with it by trying to convince the terminally ill to submit to lengthy and often painful procedures in an effort to extend their lives by a small margin.Having been through the deaths of my parents, my husband, several friends, and younger relatives, I was most taken with the stories Dr. Nuland related out of his own experience. The descriptions of the processes by which people die were less interesting to me because I had already researched most of them. Of course, people did not have access to the bounty of information now available via the internet about those processes and now, thanks to blogging, there is also a multitude of first-person experiences to be had. But in the early 90s, no such comprehensive resources existed, and Dr. Nuland's book provided a frank and somewhat shocking review of what happens during a catastrophic illness. If I had been able to read this in the 1980s and known about it in the 1990s, I'm certain I would have found it both enlightening and a cause for some sorrow.At this time, many terminally ill people are choosing hospice to try to find that 'good death' that Dr. Nuland saw as unachievable in the 80s and 90s. There is no doubt that the debilitation attending a drawn-out death is often messy and frequently painful as well as humiliating, but hospice care does attempt to provide an experience as close to a 'good' death as it is possible to get. And with a growing movement of physician-assisted deaths for terminal patients, some people are finding it possible to pass over without having to go through the most difficult parts of the dying process. I found myself wishing that How We Die could have been updated to address Dr. Nuland's thoughts on these alternatives to a hospital-based prolongation of life."
173,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7405304-deb-stone,4,"""Every life is different from any that has gone before it and so is every death."" Despite the opening line, it seems (after reading the book) that although each death is individual to the person's body peculiarities and responsiveness to intervention, ways of dying are readily categorized (mostly) due to a handful of particular maladies. The author divides the chapters by illness: ""The Strangled Heart"" and ""Alzheimer's Disease"" and so on, except for the ending chapters he uses to discuss his point of view about end of life responsibilities of providers. As the book progresses, so does the author's discussion about doctors attempting to solve ""The Riddle"" of the patient's illness which the author states often overshadows the needs of a dying patient. I enjoyed this book most when Nuland was deconstructing the illnesses in detail, explaining processes as he went. This style was more prevalent in the earlier chapters. As the book went on, his personal ideas (based on years of personal and professional experience) about how much intervention dying patients ought seek and providers ought provide, bogged down the chapters. I would have preferred scant mention of this until a summarizing chapter at the end wherein he pulled all the threads of the bodily processes in various ailments together to philosophize about the wisdom (or not) of intrusive end of life interventions. I surmise the author intended ""how we die"" to be a dual discussion of how the body physically ends as well as how the societal and medical systems participate in that process but the discussion of the latter feels heavy-handed, especially in later chapters. Still, the book is engaging overall, the individual explanations of how a body shuts down during heart failure or AIDS was fascinating, and he raises compelling questions about the cultural and ethical considerations in end of life care. "
174,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1732804-wendy,4,"I am only giving this book 4 stars because I am not the most medically/scientifically minded, so sometimes it made me say ""huh?"" and I had to go back and reread certain things to really get a grasp. Lots of big words and new ideas here for me. That being said, since having a life now touched by death, I have looked to solace in the biological (as opposed to the spiritual) aspect of what it means to die and be dead, so this book was pretty good for explaining how death happens physically (if you didn't get that from the title). It even gave me some insight into the minds of my mom's doctors as her conditioned worsened and they sort of began to wash their hands of her and walk away. That too, was helpful and relieved me of some anger.Here's my favorite part from the last chapter....there are additional pieces of baggage we shall all take to the grave, but from which we may somewhat disencumber ourselves if we anticipate them. By these, I mean conflicts unresolved, breached relationships not healed, potentials unfulfilled, promises not kept, and years that will never be lived. For virtually every one of us, there will be unfinished business. Only the very old escape it, and even then not always. Perhaps the mere existence of things undone should be a sort of satisfaction in itself, though the idea would appear to be paradoxical. Only one who is long since dead while still seemingly alive does not have many ""promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep,"" and that state of inertness is not to be desired. To the wise advice that we live every day as though it will be our last, we do well to add the admonition to live every day as though we will be on this earth forever."
175,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/576123-debbi,4,"How We Die is a sometimes raw look at the different ways we will all face death and End of Life issues. The author, a surgeon, doesn't hold back, even when it means facing his own failings as a doctor and brother (his brother died of colon cancer a few years before the book was written).The Dr. Nuland's discomfort with the vast amount of intervention at the end of life often mirrored my own thoughts and concerns as my convictions on childbirth have migrated to End of Life decisions. “Beyond the medical establishment – and beyond even the capability of one’s own physician, no matter his beneficence – is the power that rightfully belongs to the patient and those who love him.”Sadly, far too often, patients and families are given false hopes. Either they are not given all the information to make these painful decisions, or they take upon themselves the belief that, hope upon hope, the medical establishment can restore their terminal loved one. It is a delicate dance.Not to say I always agreed with the author. He believes that in rare situations terminal patients should be allowed to hasten their own death. No matter how much I sympathize with the suffering of those facing painful deaths, I cannot go that quite that far. I feel similarly about trying to prolong our lives. It was easy enough to skim through the chapters on the main medical illnesses that befall mankind. However, I found that last three chapter’s to be invaluable and would highly recommend everyone to read the book just for the lessons to be learned there. The book is nearly 20 years old, and while some of the medical information is now dated, I feel the basic message is still salient."

While not sensationalized, the imageries of how our organs can fail in different orders are not for the faint of heart. Our physician author shares his reflections on how modern biomedicine has changed the way in which death is perceived and faced, with its gory details sanitized and hidden from public view. Nowadays, the medical community often treats its enemy as diseases or even death itself, but the author reminds medical professionals that perhaps it would also be wise to humbly remember that no one has ever escaped death, and to consider caring for patients in such a way so as to prioritize the enhancing the quality of their remaining time rather than maximizing its length by offering treatments which bring short periods of suffering often not worth the additional suffering and anguish. As for the rest of us, we can become well-informed and make the most appropriate decisions regarding our options according to our own values and preferences.In this book you will find page after page of insight and wisdom amid heartbreaking tales. I am thankful for the revelations concerning my own mortality, and the mortality of those around me. I cannot recommend this book enough for everyone in the medical profession, especially doctors and nurses at the frontline fighting for the wellbeing of patients."

They are meant to serve us by disarming our terror about what the reality may be> While so many of us hope for a swift death or a death during sleep “so I won’t suffer,” we at the same time cling to an image of our final moments that combines grace with a sense of closure; we need to believe in a clear-minded process in which the summation of a life takes place—either that or a perfect lapse into agony-free unconsciousness. –p8It is this so-called terminal gasp phase that allows the aspiration of so much water that its absorption in a freshwater drowning may account for as much as 50 percent of the blood volume. – p161Drowning kills almost five thousand people in the United States each year, and alcohol is involved 40 percent of the time.

In this book, an experienced physician describes the mechanisms of some of the greatest killers in the first world: heart disease, senility, violence, AIDS, and cancer. At the end he touches on the relationship between physicians and their dying charges.The prose tends toward the purple, with many references to pedestrian classics, yet the physiological descriptions can be hard to follow. More charts would help, as would more direct writing, but ultimately the ""how"" is not as important as the ""why."" Nuland's theory of bodily failure (that it all comes down to hypoxia) is a simplification, but leaves a solid impression that these seemingly disparate causes of death really are linked. The AIDS passage is tragic and beautifully written, as are many of the anecdotes. However, like many old pop-science books, science marches on and it's impossible to read that passage without thinking of how far medicine has come: in the 2010s, advertisements for pre-exposure prophylaxis (branded Truvada) are common for this disease that was a terrifying scourge in the 1990s. Throughout the book, Nuland expresses some near-futurist hopes that disease after disease will be conquered while tempered by the reality that people will continue to die, and more agonizingly so if those hopes are misplaced."

While the book is concerned with the Horsemen of Death (cancer, heart disease, strokes, septicemia, Alzheimer's), it is also as much about Nuland's life and those he cared for deeply that passed on as he observed the process as only a genius with a Photographic Memory can. It also has a significant amount of Medical History, even the history of when the book was written in 1993. In some ways (AIDS treatment for example), Medical Science has triumphed since the book was written 23 years ago. In others (Alzheimer's) we are no further along than we were then.

It seems so different from the nothing that preceded life.""This quote was only 3% in and it was immensely comforting for me to think about. Almost like we'd already done this before. I had never thought of death in that way.And then came the rest of the book. Honestly, I thought I was picking up a book about hospice, instead of all the graphic, gruesome ways disease destroys the body and how we succumb to it. I hadn't realized that this had been published at the beginning of the hospice movement in America. (January 1994! I was a month shy of my first birthday.) Obviously, this book is not suited to someone with extreme anxieties about dying. I could feel anxiety attacks coming on at certain parts. Even with that said, it's incredibly well-written and I learned a lot. So much in fact, that I bought a big bag of quinoa and oats to cut down on cholesterol and other unwanted fats. Fortunately, hospice has come a long ways from when this book was initially written, and the promise I've seen in many hospice books is that you don't have to die in pain, and that will be managed. There are many indignities as the body begins to fail, but you don't have to fear suffering.I think the epilogue was probably my favorite bit. So I'll leave this review with this quote:""The honesty and grace of the years of life that are ending is the real measure of how we die.

However, If you have been involved in care of a chronically ill family member or loved one, or have a loved one who has been killed, you probably don’t want to read all of it. (Or maybe not at all.) Cherry-picking chapters may be wise, to avoid stirring up your grief.Nuland writes about death as someone intimately familiar. He is a poet, and he is gruesome and unsparing. He is persuasive in his love of the body and his wonder with how it works, and then immediately utterly surgical in describing the horror of how things tend to end, including violence at times. I learned more about the specifics of certain diseases and general aging than I ever have via any other thing, and I feel more in love with the human body and its frailties than ever. If you’re at all squeamish, though, or recently bereaved, beware.That said: it feels important. Nuland makes the point that none of us will be spared. We’ll all die, very likely of some root cause described in this book. It seems wise and, really, compassionate to ourselves to acknowledge and try to grok that. And to begin to wrangle with the fact that doctors (at least in the US) are often primarily focused on “The Riddle” of our disease/symptoms, vs wholistic care, especially at the end of life. (This is lately, he points out in the 2010 epilogue, a business issue with capitalist healthcare as well as an issue of training.) It won’t be easy to be advocates for ourselves and the kind of life we want to live, all the way until the end, without some deliberate thinking on the topic."

One cultural defence amongst many against this scourge, is the hope for a ""good death"", ars moriendi (the art of dying). But, midst the dispassionately clinical descriptions of oxygen starved muscles, atherosclerosis induced heart failure, trauma, and the other ""doorways into death"" through which nature finally achieves her grim objective, the author (drawing on his years of medical practice) shows how often death is something abrupt, painful, and very often humiliating and detrimental to the human spirit. Yet, death is not an enemy ; if our hope of salvaging dignity from death's final throes is more likely than not to be thwarted, the only measure of dignity that we can gain succour from is the decades of life that preceded it. The art of dying is really the art of living. Death is not an enemy, because the tragedy of an individual demise, when seen in the larger context, is the triumph of nature's self-replenishing. We must die to give way to our children, as those before died for us. Midst this contemplation of life's painful finitude, lies a moral critique of modern day medicine. The latter seeks to dispute that life has a natural and inherent limit, and that when it is time to go, it is time to go. Modern day medicine suffers from an intellectual pride that is somewhat deaf to more personal and banal concerns of the patient at death's door ; treating every terminal disease as simply a puzzle to be solved runs the risk of ruinous medical expenses, a further erosion of dignity, and finally, precisely that which is most yearned to be avoided - an isolated death in the polished squalor of the modern hospital, where the majority of human beings (at least in the developed world) now expire. A dispiriting text, yet profoundly affirmative - there are certain struggles that we cannot win, best we come to terms with it. Perhaps we can make use of Rilke's poignant prayer that the author concludes with : "" Oh Lord, give each of us his own death/ The dying, that issues forth out of the life / In which he had love, meaning and despair.""

No stone is left unturned as he explores how each key system in the body fails, considering each point of failure using first principles and clearly explaining how the end result comes about. There is a fascinating blend of philosophy together with science in this book, particularly when Nuland considers what people mean when they say that they’ve seen a “white light” or felt total serenity when close to death. He reflects on how he has seen death, in patients, family members and friends, explaining how it influenced his own views on the subject. Definitely a brilliant read."

In the majority of cases there is not a dignified death; it is ugly, painful, and hard to witness so the crux of the matter is that we need to recognize that this realistic form of death is natural and that prolonging one’s life only to endure more and increased suffering is not always the best decision but dying with the ones we love and more importantly living a life full of love is the way to achieve a dignified death and not go gently into that good night.“Every life is different from any that has gone before it, and so is every death. The uniqueness of each of us extends even to the way we die. Though most people know that various diseases carry us to our final hours by various paths, only very few comprehend the fullness of that endless multitude of ways by which the final forces of the human spirit can separate themselves from the body. Every one of death's diverse appearances is as distinctive as that singular face we each show the world during the days of life. Every man will yield up the ghost in a manner that the heavens have never known before: every woman will go her final way in her own way.”“Decline is most often gradual, with plenty of warnings and much successful treatment before the final summons.”“Because it takes a pressure of approximately 120 millimeters of mercury to generate such a forceful squeeze, the left ventricle muscle is more than half an inch wide, giving it the strongest and thickest wall of all four chambers. Pushing out about 70 milliliters of blood (2/4 ounces) with each contraction, this vigorous pump drives some 7 million milliliters (more than 14.000 pints) each day in 100,000 rhythmic and powerful beats. The mechanism of a living heart is a masterpiece of nature.”“Delay it though we may, then, the victims of coronary atherosclerosis will almost certainly die of their affliction-perhaps un expectedly during a time when they seem to be responding well to treatment, perhaps of the gradual effects of congestive heart failure.”“Every resuscitation is different. Though the general pattern is similar, every sequence, every response to massage and drugs, every heart's willingness to come back-all are different. The only certainty, whether spoken or not, is that the doctors, nurses, and technicians are fighting not only death but their own uncertainties as well. In most resuscitations, those uncertainties can be narrowed down to two main questions: Are we doing the right things? and, Should we be doing anything at all?”“Actuaries seem unable to accept a natural phenomenon unless it is so well defined as to fit neatly into a distinct and easily described classification. The annual report of the federal death accountants is very orderly-not very imaginative, and to my mind not completely reflective of real life (and real death), but nevertheless very orderly. I'm convinced that plenty of people do die of old age.”“For plants and animals, renewal requires that death precede it so that the weary may be replaced by the vigorous. This is what is meant by the cycles of nature. There is nothing pathological or sick about the sequence-in fact, it is the antithesis of sick.”“Of hundreds of known diseases and their predisposing characteristics, some 85 percent of our aging population will succumb to the complications of one of only seven major entities: atherosclerosis, hypertension, adult-onset diabetes, obesity, mental depressing states such as Alzheimer's and other dementias, cancer, and decreased resistance to infection.”“The lesson taught by the twenty-three case histories is simply confirmation of the lesson that daily experience teaches. Whether it is the anarchy of disordered biochemistry or the direct result of its opposite-a carefully orchestrated genetic ride to death-we die of old age because we have been worn and torn and programmed to cave in. The very old do not succumb to disease they implode their way into eternity.”“Never yet has anyone succeeded in borrowing any time… The lesson is never learned-there will always be those who persist in seeking the Fountain of Youth, or at least delaying what is irrevocably ordained.”“Virtually every disease can be described in terms of cause and effect. The symptoms a patient presents to his doctor, and the physical findings elicited on examination, are the direct results of very specific pathological changes within cells, tissues, and organs, or of disorders in biochemical processes. Once these underlying alterations have been identified, they can be shown to have led inevitably to the observed clinical manifestations. It is the purpose of the diagnostic workup to find the cause, using its effects as clues.”“There are no consolations in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The anguish may be mitigated by good nursing care, support groups, and the closeness of friends and family, but in the end it will be necessary for patient and loved ones together to walk through that very tortuous valley of the shadow, in the course of which everything changes forever. There is no dignity in this kind of death.”“The rapid loss of approximately one-half to two-thirds of the body's blood volume is usually sufficient to arrest the heart. Since total blood volume is equal to some 7-8 percent of body weight, a bleed of eight pints in a 170-pound man or six pints in a 130-pound woman can be enough to cause clinical death. With laceration of a vessel the size of the aorta, the process takes less than a minute; a tear in the spleen or liver might take hours, or even days, on those very rare occasions when constant ooze remains unchecked.”“Many do, in this way, avoid a tormented passage; but many others are in physical and mental distress till nearly the last moment, or even at the last moment. There is a nice Victorian reticence in denying the probability of a miserable prelude to mortality, and it is what everyone wants to hear. But if peace and dignity are what we delude ourselves to expect, most of us will die wondering what we, or our doctors, have done wrong.”“No matter the degree to which a man thinks he has convinced himself that the process of dying is not to be dreaded, he will yet approach his final illness with dread.”“Accurate knowledge of how a disease kills serves to free us from unnecessary terrors of what we might be fated to endure when we die. We may thus be better prepared to recognize the stations at which it is appropriate to ask for relief, or perhaps to begin contemplating whether to end the journey altogether.”“I prefer to believe that God has nothing to do with it. We are witnessing in our time one of those cataclysms of nature that have no meaning, no precedent, and, in spite of many claims to the contrary, no useful metaphor.”“And always, the most important charge is to care for those dread fully stricken brothers and sisters of all of us, the sickest of whom are wasted, feverish, swollen, and anemic, their eyes seeking some reassurance and the unspoken promise of relief from their torment, which too often will come only with death. No matter the perseverance and moral strength so many patients muster in the face of lethal certainty, the pitiless process by which they die is dispiriting anew with every reenactment.”“The likeness is to an insidious, groping parasite, attached by sharp-clawed tentacles to the decaying surface of its imperiled prey. The clawing extremities ceaselessly extend the periphery of their malign grip, while the loathsome core of the burrowing beast eats silently away at life, able to digest only what it has first de composed. The process is noiseless; it has no recognizable instant of beginning and it ends only when the despoiler has consumed the final remnants of its host's vital forces.”“The boundaries of medical futility, however, have never been clear, and it may be too much to expect that they ever will be. It is perhaps for this reason that there has arisen the conviction among doctors-more than a mere conviction, it is nowadays felt by many to be a responsibility-that should error occur in the treatment of a patient, it must always be on the side of doing more rather than less.”“When the chips are down, almost no one wants his life to end, and one good way for the conscious mind to avoid it is for the unconscious mind to deny that it is about to happen.”“Though everyone may yearn for a tranquil death, the basic instinct to stay alive is a far more powerful force.”“The greatest dignity to be found in death is the dignity of the life that preceded it. This is a form of hope we can all achieve, and it is the most abiding of all. Hope resides in the meaning of what our lives have been.”“The lesson in all of this is well known. Hope lies not only in an expectation of cure or even of the remission of present distress. For dying patients, the hope of cure will always be shown to be ultimately false, and even the hope of relief too often turns to ashes.”“When my time comes, I will seek hope in the knowledge that insofar as possible I will not be allowed to suffer or be subjected to needless attempts to maintain life; I will seek it in the certainty that I will not be abandoned to die alone; I am seeking it now, in the way I try to live my life, so that those who value what I am will have profited by my time on earth and be left with comforting recollections of what we have meant to one another.”"

198,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5859626-andr-spiegel,4,"It's a taboo and this is a book about it, so it gets a high rating. I have learned something new about every subject it covers. I have a deeper understanding of death, dignity, hope, care. If we have to die, we want it quick, but not too quick. We want it dignified and meaningful. Very few of us will get that.Yet for long stretches, the book seems undecided how to approach death. I want to know what it's like to die of cancer, but the book tells me how cancer works, from the outside. There's a long chapter how AIDS was discovered, but little on what it's like to die of AIDS. Much gravity in the language, stilted. Appropriate to the subject, but still. I wish the final chapter, the Coda, from 2010, hadn't been written."
199,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3754944-mm,0,"I read this book because I have started to work as a healthcare professional, and in particular with countless clients who are ""palliative."" What I wanted to know was why, when I review the medical history of some of my clients (patients) with Chronic Heart Failure, and a history of a Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA), and Hypertension, and a CABG (bypass) in 2013, and kidney failure, and... what have these diagnoses done? Are they really dying of all of these things?I don't know how to explain it. I have a client right now, a sweet old lady, cute as can be, who laughs at the end of every breathless sentence she speaks. As is my job in the healthcare team, I ordered her a hospital bed - her doting daughter wishes to keep her at home - and a commode and a wheelchair and a cushion. I assess the redness developing on her coccyx (her bum) and recommend that she be turned at such and such time to prevent bedsores. Here I see an 87 year old lady dying, of course she is dying, and what she wants is rest and relaxation. So we set up her bed by the window, and she keeps her white nightgown on as her legs have edema (swelling), and she lays there with the head of the bed up to help her breath better, and the sunlight steams in, and every once in a while she groans and tries to shift her weight because she is uncomfortable in one position, and she looks positively like an angel.And I know that inside her there is a battle against kidney failure, which is why her tummy is so huge and her organs are floating in that cavity we call the abdomen. And inside her too is heart failure, which likely has caused the kidney failure. And so she is fatigued, and she is heavy - she can't fit into her wheelchair anymore - and her heaviness is creating risk for pressure injuries on her bed. And I know that she has medications by the dozens, and that I recommended the daughter get a blister pack because at some point it is impossible to keep track of all these medications.I know that this is a disease, or more accurately a plethora of diseases, each feeding off of the other - when one head is chopped off, the hydra grows another.So I know why she is dying, I suppose. But she is 87. And is she really diseased? Isn't this just her aged body saying - enough. I have worked long enough, and now I wish to be comfortable as I leave this life. Despite the list of diagnoses that go on and on, and the list of surgeries that go on and on, and the list of medications that is even longer - isn't she dying of old age? It's just that simple. She isn't dying of disease. She is dying of the natural cycle of life - not just of human life, but of all life. She is dying of the cosmic principle that says - ye shalt not last! She is dying because nothing in this world is eternal, and even thousands of years old trees must one day die, and the lion eats the gazelle, and the cat chases the mouse, and age comes after us all.So while she lies there and the healthcare team gently urges the daughter to move her mother to a hospice, I can't help but feel that somewhere along the line, by pathologizing, the dignity of old age - a dignity that is from understanding, not from the wheezing and heaving and overall grotesqueness of the last few months of life - is lost.We all must die, and death will most likely be awful, and painful, and we will very likely be surrounded by strangers. And some deaths are a tragedy, while others are just this: that Life folds her hands and places them in her lap, and her sister Death opens hers and says to us, Embrace me now, for your earthly journey is complete, so come home. And the worms will eat your body but the face of God hangs eternal, looking over it all."
200,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100050401-kathleen-murray,5,"I've given this book to at least 10 friends, and none will read it. Is it something to do with the title. This was the first, and one of the best, in the burgeoning genre of death and dying. Other than being born, death is one of the most important things that happens to us, and we might as well know a little about it. I read this when it first came out, about a year before I had health care power of attorney for an 86-year-old woman with end-stage COPD. I like to think that the section on pneumonia helped inform my decision-making, and limit the suffering of her final days. "
201,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2715247-james-klagge,4,"Some pretty rough descriptions, which illustrate the author's general point that death is rarely the serene, dignified experience for which we hope. It was not the prospect of my own death that motivated me to read this, but I couldn't help thinking about that as well. Though much of the book is taken up with describing at various levels the processes of death, the author also wanted to emphasize the difficulty and the importance of patients and their families taking some control of the process away from the medical-technological process that will otherwise dominate. The author regrets the power of specialists whose primary or sole motivation is curing or prolonging life regardless of the human cost. He quotes (p. 275) the director of the UCLA Medical Center who said in 2009: ""If you come into this hospital, we're not going to let you die."" It sounds like a perverse kind of hell. Instead, the author wishes that there were ways to value and promote family practitioners who would care about pastoring the patient as much as winning the battle. I have such a family doctor, but since he is several years older than I am, I wonder if he'll still be practicing when I need him.The main issue is deciding when it is time to stop trying and accept death. The problem is that doctors still too often don't know, and aren't happy letting patients decide, when enough is enough. This is not a lesson I needed to learn about, but it is important to think about it in advance, for oneself and one's loved ones. The discussion also reminded me of analogous issues such as when it is time to stop trying to save a dying relationship, or when it is time to stop trying to pursue an ill-fated project or profession. Hope is an important virtue, but it also has its limits. As Aristotle could have said, there can be too little hope, but there can also be too much. The author thinks we need to reconceive what we mean by hope near the end of life. Death will always win in the end. But he thinks that we can still hope for and work toward being ourselves to our last breath. Even this can be taken away from us by the ravages of death, but it is something we can aim for--to be oneself as long as possible. I really should give 5 stars to a doctor who quotes Vaclav Havel (p. 281) on hope, in a book about medicine; but the unnecessary repetitions led me to reduce the rating by a star. In any case, well-worth reading--especially since each of us will eventually die, or at least we know someone who will. :)"
202,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6269159-robyn-mcintyre,3,"This National Book Award winner came out in 1993, but I recently read it after a recommendation by a friend. Dr. Sherwin B. Nuland, the author, who passed away from colon cancer in 2014, combined stories of the difficult illnesses and deaths of family members and patients with the facts of what physically occurs during a fatal illness such as heart disease, stroke, or cancer. His primary point to be made was that people now die more often in a hospital than they do at home and that wishing for a comfortable, spiritual passing at home is pointless because death was intractable and almost always messy and humiliating.At the time, his words made quite a stir, adding to the national dialog that was revving up about how current society views death and deals with it by trying to convince the terminally ill to submit to lengthy and often painful procedures in an effort to extend their lives by a small margin.Having been through the deaths of my parents, my husband, several friends, and younger relatives, I was most taken with the stories Dr. Nuland related out of his own experience. The descriptions of the processes by which people die were less interesting to me because I had already researched most of them. Of course, people did not have access to the bounty of information now available via the internet about those processes and now, thanks to blogging, there is also a multitude of first-person experiences to be had. But in the early 90s, no such comprehensive resources existed, and Dr. Nuland's book provided a frank and somewhat shocking review of what happens during a catastrophic illness. If I had been able to read this in the 1980s and known about it in the 1990s, I'm certain I would have found it both enlightening and a cause for some sorrow.At this time, many terminally ill people are choosing hospice to try to find that 'good death' that Dr. Nuland saw as unachievable in the 80s and 90s. There is no doubt that the debilitation attending a drawn-out death is often messy and frequently painful as well as humiliating, but hospice care does attempt to provide an experience as close to a 'good' death as it is possible to get. And with a growing movement of physician-assisted deaths for terminal patients, some people are finding it possible to pass over without having to go through the most difficult parts of the dying process. I found myself wishing that How We Die could have been updated to address Dr. Nuland's thoughts on these alternatives to a hospital-based prolongation of life."
203,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7405304-deb-stone,4,"""Every life is different from any that has gone before it and so is every death."" Despite the opening line, it seems (after reading the book) that although each death is individual to the person's body peculiarities and responsiveness to intervention, ways of dying are readily categorized (mostly) due to a handful of particular maladies. The author divides the chapters by illness: ""The Strangled Heart"" and ""Alzheimer's Disease"" and so on, except for the ending chapters he uses to discuss his point of view about end of life responsibilities of providers. As the book progresses, so does the author's discussion about doctors attempting to solve ""The Riddle"" of the patient's illness which the author states often overshadows the needs of a dying patient. I enjoyed this book most when Nuland was deconstructing the illnesses in detail, explaining processes as he went. This style was more prevalent in the earlier chapters. As the book went on, his personal ideas (based on years of personal and professional experience) about how much intervention dying patients ought seek and providers ought provide, bogged down the chapters. I would have preferred scant mention of this until a summarizing chapter at the end wherein he pulled all the threads of the bodily processes in various ailments together to philosophize about the wisdom (or not) of intrusive end of life interventions. I surmise the author intended ""how we die"" to be a dual discussion of how the body physically ends as well as how the societal and medical systems participate in that process but the discussion of the latter feels heavy-handed, especially in later chapters. Still, the book is engaging overall, the individual explanations of how a body shuts down during heart failure or AIDS was fascinating, and he raises compelling questions about the cultural and ethical considerations in end of life care. "
204,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1732804-wendy,4,"I am only giving this book 4 stars because I am not the most medically/scientifically minded, so sometimes it made me say ""huh?"" and I had to go back and reread certain things to really get a grasp. Lots of big words and new ideas here for me. That being said, since having a life now touched by death, I have looked to solace in the biological (as opposed to the spiritual) aspect of what it means to die and be dead, so this book was pretty good for explaining how death happens physically (if you didn't get that from the title). It even gave me some insight into the minds of my mom's doctors as her conditioned worsened and they sort of began to wash their hands of her and walk away. That too, was helpful and relieved me of some anger.Here's my favorite part from the last chapter....there are additional pieces of baggage we shall all take to the grave, but from which we may somewhat disencumber ourselves if we anticipate them. By these, I mean conflicts unresolved, breached relationships not healed, potentials unfulfilled, promises not kept, and years that will never be lived. For virtually every one of us, there will be unfinished business. Only the very old escape it, and even then not always. Perhaps the mere existence of things undone should be a sort of satisfaction in itself, though the idea would appear to be paradoxical. Only one who is long since dead while still seemingly alive does not have many ""promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep,"" and that state of inertness is not to be desired. To the wise advice that we live every day as though it will be our last, we do well to add the admonition to live every day as though we will be on this earth forever."
205,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/576123-debbi,4,"How We Die is a sometimes raw look at the different ways we will all face death and End of Life issues. The author, a surgeon, doesn't hold back, even when it means facing his own failings as a doctor and brother (his brother died of colon cancer a few years before the book was written).The Dr. Nuland's discomfort with the vast amount of intervention at the end of life often mirrored my own thoughts and concerns as my convictions on childbirth have migrated to End of Life decisions. “Beyond the medical establishment – and beyond even the capability of one’s own physician, no matter his beneficence – is the power that rightfully belongs to the patient and those who love him.”Sadly, far too often, patients and families are given false hopes. Either they are not given all the information to make these painful decisions, or they take upon themselves the belief that, hope upon hope, the medical establishment can restore their terminal loved one. It is a delicate dance.Not to say I always agreed with the author. He believes that in rare situations terminal patients should be allowed to hasten their own death. No matter how much I sympathize with the suffering of those facing painful deaths, I cannot go that quite that far. I feel similarly about trying to prolong our lives. It was easy enough to skim through the chapters on the main medical illnesses that befall mankind. However, I found that last three chapter’s to be invaluable and would highly recommend everyone to read the book just for the lessons to be learned there. The book is nearly 20 years old, and while some of the medical information is now dated, I feel the basic message is still salient."

While not sensationalized, the imageries of how our organs can fail in different orders are not for the faint of heart. Our physician author shares his reflections on how modern biomedicine has changed the way in which death is perceived and faced, with its gory details sanitized and hidden from public view. Nowadays, the medical community often treats its enemy as diseases or even death itself, but the author reminds medical professionals that perhaps it would also be wise to humbly remember that no one has ever escaped death, and to consider caring for patients in such a way so as to prioritize the enhancing the quality of their remaining time rather than maximizing its length by offering treatments which bring short periods of suffering often not worth the additional suffering and anguish. As for the rest of us, we can become well-informed and make the most appropriate decisions regarding our options according to our own values and preferences.In this book you will find page after page of insight and wisdom amid heartbreaking tales. I am thankful for the revelations concerning my own mortality, and the mortality of those around me.

In this book, an experienced physician describes the mechanisms of some of the greatest killers in the first world: heart disease, senility, violence, AIDS, and cancer. At the end he touches on the relationship between physicians and their dying charges.The prose tends toward the purple, with many references to pedestrian classics, yet the physiological descriptions can be hard to follow. More charts would help, as would more direct writing, but ultimately the ""how"" is not as important as the ""why."" Nuland's theory of bodily failure (that it all comes down to hypoxia) is a simplification, but leaves a solid impression that these seemingly disparate causes of death really are linked. The AIDS passage is tragic and beautifully written, as are many of the anecdotes. However, like many old pop-science books, science marches on and it's impossible to read that passage without thinking of how far medicine has come: in the 2010s, advertisements for pre-exposure prophylaxis (branded Truvada) are common for this disease that was a terrifying scourge in the 1990s. Throughout the book, Nuland expresses some near-futurist hopes that disease after disease will be conquered while tempered by the reality that people will continue to die, and more agonizingly so if those hopes are misplaced."

While the book is concerned with the Horsemen of Death (cancer, heart disease, strokes, septicemia, Alzheimer's), it is also as much about Nuland's life and those he cared for deeply that passed on as he observed the process as only a genius with a Photographic Memory can. It also has a significant amount of Medical History, even the history of when the book was written in 1993. In some ways (AIDS treatment for example), Medical Science has triumphed since the book was written 23 years ago. In others (Alzheimer's) we are no further along than we were then.

I had never thought of death in that way.And then came the rest of the book. Honestly, I thought I was picking up a book about hospice, instead of all the graphic, gruesome ways disease destroys the body and how we succumb to it. I hadn't realized that this had been published at the beginning of the hospice movement in America. (January 1994! I was a month shy of my first birthday.) Obviously, this book is not suited to someone with extreme anxieties about dying. I could feel anxiety attacks coming on at certain parts. Even with that said, it's incredibly well-written and I learned a lot. So much in fact, that I bought a big bag of quinoa and oats to cut down on cholesterol and other unwanted fats. Fortunately, hospice has come a long ways from when this book was initially written, and the promise I've seen in many hospice books is that you don't have to die in pain, and that will be managed. There are many indignities as the body begins to fail, but you don't have to fear suffering.I think the epilogue was probably my favorite bit.

However, If you have been involved in care of a chronically ill family member or loved one, or have a loved one who has been killed, you probably don’t want to read all of it. (Or maybe not at all.) Cherry-picking chapters may be wise, to avoid stirring up your grief.Nuland writes about death as someone intimately familiar. He is a poet, and he is gruesome and unsparing. He is persuasive in his love of the body and his wonder with how it works, and then immediately utterly surgical in describing the horror of how things tend to end, including violence at times. I learned more about the specifics of certain diseases and general aging than I ever have via any other thing, and I feel more in love with the human body and its frailties than ever. If you’re at all squeamish, though, or recently bereaved, beware.That said: it feels important. Nuland makes the point that none of us will be spared. We’ll all die, very likely of some root cause described in this book. It seems wise and, really, compassionate to ourselves to acknowledge and try to grok that. And to begin to wrangle with the fact that doctors (at least in the US) are often primarily focused on “The Riddle” of our disease/symptoms, vs wholistic care, especially at the end of life. (This is lately, he points out in the 2010 epilogue, a business issue with capitalist healthcare as well as an issue of training.) It won’t be easy to be advocates for ourselves and the kind of life we want to live, all the way until the end, without some deliberate thinking on the topic."

One cultural defence amongst many against this scourge, is the hope for a ""good death"", ars moriendi (the art of dying). But, midst the dispassionately clinical descriptions of oxygen starved muscles, atherosclerosis induced heart failure, trauma, and the other ""doorways into death"" through which nature finally achieves her grim objective, the author (drawing on his years of medical practice) shows how often death is something abrupt, painful, and very often humiliating and detrimental to the human spirit. Yet, death is not an enemy ; if our hope of salvaging dignity from death's final throes is more likely than not to be thwarted, the only measure of dignity that we can gain succour from is the decades of life that preceded it. The art of dying is really the art of living. Death is not an enemy, because the tragedy of an individual demise, when seen in the larger context, is the triumph of nature's self-replenishing. We must die to give way to our children, as those before died for us. Midst this contemplation of life's painful finitude, lies a moral critique of modern day medicine. The latter seeks to dispute that life has a natural and inherent limit, and that when it is time to go, it is time to go. Modern day medicine suffers from an intellectual pride that is somewhat deaf to more personal and banal concerns of the patient at death's door ; treating every terminal disease as simply a puzzle to be solved runs the risk of ruinous medical expenses, a further erosion of dignity, and finally, precisely that which is most yearned to be avoided - an isolated death in the polished squalor of the modern hospital, where the majority of human beings (at least in the developed world) now expire. A dispiriting text, yet profoundly affirmative - there are certain struggles that we cannot win, best we come to terms with it. Perhaps we can make use of Rilke's poignant prayer that the author concludes with : "" Oh Lord, give each of us his own death/ The dying, that issues forth out of the life / In which he had love, meaning and despair.""

However, Nuland has taken this challenge head on, analysing the physiology of death. No stone is left unturned as he explores how each key system in the body fails, considering each point of failure using first principles and clearly explaining how the end result comes about. There is a fascinating blend of philosophy together with science in this book, particularly when Nuland considers what people mean when they say that they’ve seen a “white light” or felt total serenity when close to death. He reflects on how he has seen death, in patients, family members and friends, explaining how it influenced his own views on the subject. Definitely a brilliant read."

He makes many points in his work that bear thought and for my life. "

226,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69318650-nathan,3,"Sherwin Nuland uses his medical experience to explain the biochemical, physical, and emotional processes that occur in some of the most common ways we die: MI, CHF, murder, suicide, Alzheimer’s, cancer, and simply our motors being worn and torn with age beyond repair. In the majority of cases there is not a dignified death; it is ugly, painful, and hard to witness so the crux of the matter is that we need to recognize that this realistic form of death is natural and that prolonging one’s life only to endure more and increased suffering is not always the best decision but dying with the ones we love and more importantly living a life full of love is the way to achieve a dignified death and not go gently into that good night.“Every life is different from any that has gone before it, and so is every death. The uniqueness of each of us extends even to the way we die. Though most people know that various diseases carry us to our final hours by various paths, only very few comprehend the fullness of that endless multitude of ways by which the final forces of the human spirit can separate themselves from the body. Every one of death's diverse appearances is as distinctive as that singular face we each show the world during the days of life. Every man will yield up the ghost in a manner that the heavens have never known before: every woman will go her final way in her own way.”“Decline is most often gradual, with plenty of warnings and much successful treatment before the final summons.”“Because it takes a pressure of approximately 120 millimeters of mercury to generate such a forceful squeeze, the left ventricle muscle is more than half an inch wide, giving it the strongest and thickest wall of all four chambers. Pushing out about 70 milliliters of blood (2/4 ounces) with each contraction, this vigorous pump drives some 7 million milliliters (more than 14.000 pints) each day in 100,000 rhythmic and powerful beats. The mechanism of a living heart is a masterpiece of nature.”“Delay it though we may, then, the victims of coronary atherosclerosis will almost certainly die of their affliction-perhaps un expectedly during a time when they seem to be responding well to treatment, perhaps of the gradual effects of congestive heart failure.”“Every resuscitation is different. Though the general pattern is similar, every sequence, every response to massage and drugs, every heart's willingness to come back-all are different. The only certainty, whether spoken or not, is that the doctors, nurses, and technicians are fighting not only death but their own uncertainties as well. In most resuscitations, those uncertainties can be narrowed down to two main questions: Are we doing the right things? and, Should we be doing anything at all?”“Actuaries seem unable to accept a natural phenomenon unless it is so well defined as to fit neatly into a distinct and easily described classification. The annual report of the federal death accountants is very orderly-not very imaginative, and to my mind not completely reflective of real life (and real death), but nevertheless very orderly. I'm convinced that plenty of people do die of old age.”“For plants and animals, renewal requires that death precede it so that the weary may be replaced by the vigorous. This is what is meant by the cycles of nature. There is nothing pathological or sick about the sequence-in fact, it is the antithesis of sick.”“Of hundreds of known diseases and their predisposing characteristics, some 85 percent of our aging population will succumb to the complications of one of only seven major entities: atherosclerosis, hypertension, adult-onset diabetes, obesity, mental depressing states such as Alzheimer's and other dementias, cancer, and decreased resistance to infection.”“The lesson taught by the twenty-three case histories is simply confirmation of the lesson that daily experience teaches. Whether it is the anarchy of disordered biochemistry or the direct result of its opposite-a carefully orchestrated genetic ride to death-we die of old age because we have been worn and torn and programmed to cave in. The very old do not succumb to disease they implode their way into eternity.”“Never yet has anyone succeeded in borrowing any time… The lesson is never learned-there will always be those who persist in seeking the Fountain of Youth, or at least delaying what is irrevocably ordained.”“Virtually every disease can be described in terms of cause and effect. The symptoms a patient presents to his doctor, and the physical findings elicited on examination, are the direct results of very specific pathological changes within cells, tissues, and organs, or of disorders in biochemical processes. Once these underlying alterations have been identified, they can be shown to have led inevitably to the observed clinical manifestations. It is the purpose of the diagnostic workup to find the cause, using its effects as clues.”“There are no consolations in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The anguish may be mitigated by good nursing care, support groups, and the closeness of friends and family, but in the end it will be necessary for patient and loved ones together to walk through that very tortuous valley of the shadow, in the course of which everything changes forever. There is no dignity in this kind of death.”“The rapid loss of approximately one-half to two-thirds of the body's blood volume is usually sufficient to arrest the heart. Since total blood volume is equal to some 7-8 percent of body weight, a bleed of eight pints in a 170-pound man or six pints in a 130-pound woman can be enough to cause clinical death. With laceration of a vessel the size of the aorta, the process takes less than a minute; a tear in the spleen or liver might take hours, or even days, on those very rare occasions when constant ooze remains unchecked.”“Many do, in this way, avoid a tormented passage; but many others are in physical and mental distress till nearly the last moment, or even at the last moment. There is a nice Victorian reticence in denying the probability of a miserable prelude to mortality, and it is what everyone wants to hear. But if peace and dignity are what we delude ourselves to expect, most of us will die wondering what we, or our doctors, have done wrong.”“No matter the degree to which a man thinks he has convinced himself that the process of dying is not to be dreaded, he will yet approach his final illness with dread.”“Accurate knowledge of how a disease kills serves to free us from unnecessary terrors of what we might be fated to endure when we die. We may thus be better prepared to recognize the stations at which it is appropriate to ask for relief, or perhaps to begin contemplating whether to end the journey altogether.”“I prefer to believe that God has nothing to do with it. We are witnessing in our time one of those cataclysms of nature that have no meaning, no precedent, and, in spite of many claims to the contrary, no useful metaphor.”“And always, the most important charge is to care for those dread fully stricken brothers and sisters of all of us, the sickest of whom are wasted, feverish, swollen, and anemic, their eyes seeking some reassurance and the unspoken promise of relief from their torment, which too often will come only with death. No matter the perseverance and moral strength so many patients muster in the face of lethal certainty, the pitiless process by which they die is dispiriting anew with every reenactment.”“The likeness is to an insidious, groping parasite, attached by sharp-clawed tentacles to the decaying surface of its imperiled prey. The clawing extremities ceaselessly extend the periphery of their malign grip, while the loathsome core of the burrowing beast eats silently away at life, able to digest only what it has first de composed. The process is noiseless; it has no recognizable instant of beginning and it ends only when the despoiler has consumed the final remnants of its host's vital forces.”“The boundaries of medical futility, however, have never been clear, and it may be too much to expect that they ever will be. It is perhaps for this reason that there has arisen the conviction among doctors-more than a mere conviction, it is nowadays felt by many to be a responsibility-that should error occur in the treatment of a patient, it must always be on the side of doing more rather than less.”“When the chips are down, almost no one wants his life to end, and one good way for the conscious mind to avoid it is for the unconscious mind to deny that it is about to happen.”“Though everyone may yearn for a tranquil death, the basic instinct to stay alive is a far more powerful force.”“The greatest dignity to be found in death is the dignity of the life that preceded it. This is a form of hope we can all achieve, and it is the most abiding of all. Hope resides in the meaning of what our lives have been.”“The lesson in all of this is well known. Hope lies not only in an expectation of cure or even of the remission of present distress. For dying patients, the hope of cure will always be shown to be ultimately false, and even the hope of relief too often turns to ashes.”“When my time comes, I will seek hope in the knowledge that insofar as possible I will not be allowed to suffer or be subjected to needless attempts to maintain life; I will seek it in the certainty that I will not be abandoned to die alone; I am seeking it now, in the way I try to live my life, so that those who value what I am will have profited by my time on earth and be left with comforting recollections of what we have meant to one another.”"

228,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5859626-andr-spiegel,4,"It's a taboo and this is a book about it, so it gets a high rating. I have learned something new about every subject it covers. I have a deeper understanding of death, dignity, hope, care. If we have to die, we want it quick, but not too quick. We want it dignified and meaningful. Very few of us will get that.Yet for long stretches, the book seems undecided how to approach death. I want to know what it's like to die of cancer, but the book tells me how cancer works, from the outside. There's a long chapter how AIDS was discovered, but little on what it's like to die of AIDS. Much gravity in the language, stilted. Appropriate to the subject, but still. I wish the final chapter, the Coda, from 2010, hadn't been written."
229,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3754944-mm,0,"I read this book because I have started to work as a healthcare professional, and in particular with countless clients who are ""palliative."" What I wanted to know was why, when I review the medical history of some of my clients (patients) with Chronic Heart Failure, and a history of a Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA), and Hypertension, and a CABG (bypass) in 2013, and kidney failure, and... what have these diagnoses done? Are they really dying of all of these things?I don't know how to explain it. I have a client right now, a sweet old lady, cute as can be, who laughs at the end of every breathless sentence she speaks. As is my job in the healthcare team, I ordered her a hospital bed - her doting daughter wishes to keep her at home - and a commode and a wheelchair and a cushion. I assess the redness developing on her coccyx (her bum) and recommend that she be turned at such and such time to prevent bedsores. Here I see an 87 year old lady dying, of course she is dying, and what she wants is rest and relaxation. So we set up her bed by the window, and she keeps her white nightgown on as her legs have edema (swelling), and she lays there with the head of the bed up to help her breath better, and the sunlight steams in, and every once in a while she groans and tries to shift her weight because she is uncomfortable in one position, and she looks positively like an angel.And I know that inside her there is a battle against kidney failure, which is why her tummy is so huge and her organs are floating in that cavity we call the abdomen. And inside her too is heart failure, which likely has caused the kidney failure. And so she is fatigued, and she is heavy - she can't fit into her wheelchair anymore - and her heaviness is creating risk for pressure injuries on her bed. And I know that she has medications by the dozens, and that I recommended the daughter get a blister pack because at some point it is impossible to keep track of all these medications.I know that this is a disease, or more accurately a plethora of diseases, each feeding off of the other - when one head is chopped off, the hydra grows another.So I know why she is dying, I suppose. But she is 87. And is she really diseased? Isn't this just her aged body saying - enough. I have worked long enough, and now I wish to be comfortable as I leave this life. Despite the list of diagnoses that go on and on, and the list of surgeries that go on and on, and the list of medications that is even longer - isn't she dying of old age? It's just that simple. She isn't dying of disease. She is dying of the natural cycle of life - not just of human life, but of all life. She is dying of the cosmic principle that says - ye shalt not last! She is dying because nothing in this world is eternal, and even thousands of years old trees must one day die, and the lion eats the gazelle, and the cat chases the mouse, and age comes after us all.So while she lies there and the healthcare team gently urges the daughter to move her mother to a hospice, I can't help but feel that somewhere along the line, by pathologizing, the dignity of old age - a dignity that is from understanding, not from the wheezing and heaving and overall grotesqueness of the last few months of life - is lost.We all must die, and death will most likely be awful, and painful, and we will very likely be surrounded by strangers. And some deaths are a tragedy, while others are just this: that Life folds her hands and places them in her lap, and her sister Death opens hers and says to us, Embrace me now, for your earthly journey is complete, so come home. And the worms will eat your body but the face of God hangs eternal, looking over it all."
230,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100050401-kathleen-murray,5,"I've given this book to at least 10 friends, and none will read it. Is it something to do with the title. This was the first, and one of the best, in the burgeoning genre of death and dying. Other than being born, death is one of the most important things that happens to us, and we might as well know a little about it. I read this when it first came out, about a year before I had health care power of attorney for an 86-year-old woman with end-stage COPD. I like to think that the section on pneumonia helped inform my decision-making, and limit the suffering of her final days. "
231,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2715247-james-klagge,4,"Some pretty rough descriptions, which illustrate the author's general point that death is rarely the serene, dignified experience for which we hope. It was not the prospect of my own death that motivated me to read this, but I couldn't help thinking about that as well. Though much of the book is taken up with describing at various levels the processes of death, the author also wanted to emphasize the difficulty and the importance of patients and their families taking some control of the process away from the medical-technological process that will otherwise dominate. The author regrets the power of specialists whose primary or sole motivation is curing or prolonging life regardless of the human cost. He quotes (p. 275) the director of the UCLA Medical Center who said in 2009: ""If you come into this hospital, we're not going to let you die."" It sounds like a perverse kind of hell. Instead, the author wishes that there were ways to value and promote family practitioners who would care about pastoring the patient as much as winning the battle. I have such a family doctor, but since he is several years older than I am, I wonder if he'll still be practicing when I need him.The main issue is deciding when it is time to stop trying and accept death. The problem is that doctors still too often don't know, and aren't happy letting patients decide, when enough is enough. This is not a lesson I needed to learn about, but it is important to think about it in advance, for oneself and one's loved ones. The discussion also reminded me of analogous issues such as when it is time to stop trying to save a dying relationship, or when it is time to stop trying to pursue an ill-fated project or profession. Hope is an important virtue, but it also has its limits. As Aristotle could have said, there can be too little hope, but there can also be too much. The author thinks we need to reconceive what we mean by hope near the end of life. Death will always win in the end. But he thinks that we can still hope for and work toward being ourselves to our last breath. Even this can be taken away from us by the ravages of death, but it is something we can aim for--to be oneself as long as possible. I really should give 5 stars to a doctor who quotes Vaclav Havel (p. 281) on hope, in a book about medicine; but the unnecessary repetitions led me to reduce the rating by a star. In any case, well-worth reading--especially since each of us will eventually die, or at least we know someone who will. :)"
232,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6269159-robyn-mcintyre,3,"This National Book Award winner came out in 1993, but I recently read it after a recommendation by a friend. Dr. Sherwin B. Nuland, the author, who passed away from colon cancer in 2014, combined stories of the difficult illnesses and deaths of family members and patients with the facts of what physically occurs during a fatal illness such as heart disease, stroke, or cancer. His primary point to be made was that people now die more often in a hospital than they do at home and that wishing for a comfortable, spiritual passing at home is pointless because death was intractable and almost always messy and humiliating.At the time, his words made quite a stir, adding to the national dialog that was revving up about how current society views death and deals with it by trying to convince the terminally ill to submit to lengthy and often painful procedures in an effort to extend their lives by a small margin.Having been through the deaths of my parents, my husband, several friends, and younger relatives, I was most taken with the stories Dr. Nuland related out of his own experience. The descriptions of the processes by which people die were less interesting to me because I had already researched most of them. Of course, people did not have access to the bounty of information now available via the internet about those processes and now, thanks to blogging, there is also a multitude of first-person experiences to be had. But in the early 90s, no such comprehensive resources existed, and Dr. Nuland's book provided a frank and somewhat shocking review of what happens during a catastrophic illness. If I had been able to read this in the 1980s and known about it in the 1990s, I'm certain I would have found it both enlightening and a cause for some sorrow.At this time, many terminally ill people are choosing hospice to try to find that 'good death' that Dr. Nuland saw as unachievable in the 80s and 90s. There is no doubt that the debilitation attending a drawn-out death is often messy and frequently painful as well as humiliating, but hospice care does attempt to provide an experience as close to a 'good' death as it is possible to get. And with a growing movement of physician-assisted deaths for terminal patients, some people are finding it possible to pass over without having to go through the most difficult parts of the dying process. I found myself wishing that How We Die could have been updated to address Dr. Nuland's thoughts on these alternatives to a hospital-based prolongation of life."
233,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7405304-deb-stone,4,"""Every life is different from any that has gone before it and so is every death."" Despite the opening line, it seems (after reading the book) that although each death is individual to the person's body peculiarities and responsiveness to intervention, ways of dying are readily categorized (mostly) due to a handful of particular maladies. The author divides the chapters by illness: ""The Strangled Heart"" and ""Alzheimer's Disease"" and so on, except for the ending chapters he uses to discuss his point of view about end of life responsibilities of providers. As the book progresses, so does the author's discussion about doctors attempting to solve ""The Riddle"" of the patient's illness which the author states often overshadows the needs of a dying patient. I enjoyed this book most when Nuland was deconstructing the illnesses in detail, explaining processes as he went. This style was more prevalent in the earlier chapters. As the book went on, his personal ideas (based on years of personal and professional experience) about how much intervention dying patients ought seek and providers ought provide, bogged down the chapters. I would have preferred scant mention of this until a summarizing chapter at the end wherein he pulled all the threads of the bodily processes in various ailments together to philosophize about the wisdom (or not) of intrusive end of life interventions. I surmise the author intended ""how we die"" to be a dual discussion of how the body physically ends as well as how the societal and medical systems participate in that process but the discussion of the latter feels heavy-handed, especially in later chapters. Still, the book is engaging overall, the individual explanations of how a body shuts down during heart failure or AIDS was fascinating, and he raises compelling questions about the cultural and ethical considerations in end of life care. "
234,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1732804-wendy,4,"I am only giving this book 4 stars because I am not the most medically/scientifically minded, so sometimes it made me say ""huh?"" and I had to go back and reread certain things to really get a grasp. Lots of big words and new ideas here for me. That being said, since having a life now touched by death, I have looked to solace in the biological (as opposed to the spiritual) aspect of what it means to die and be dead, so this book was pretty good for explaining how death happens physically (if you didn't get that from the title). It even gave me some insight into the minds of my mom's doctors as her conditioned worsened and they sort of began to wash their hands of her and walk away. That too, was helpful and relieved me of some anger.Here's my favorite part from the last chapter....there are additional pieces of baggage we shall all take to the grave, but from which we may somewhat disencumber ourselves if we anticipate them. By these, I mean conflicts unresolved, breached relationships not healed, potentials unfulfilled, promises not kept, and years that will never be lived. For virtually every one of us, there will be unfinished business. Only the very old escape it, and even then not always. Perhaps the mere existence of things undone should be a sort of satisfaction in itself, though the idea would appear to be paradoxical. Only one who is long since dead while still seemingly alive does not have many ""promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep,"" and that state of inertness is not to be desired. To the wise advice that we live every day as though it will be our last, we do well to add the admonition to live every day as though we will be on this earth forever."
235,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/576123-debbi,4,"How We Die is a sometimes raw look at the different ways we will all face death and End of Life issues. The author, a surgeon, doesn't hold back, even when it means facing his own failings as a doctor and brother (his brother died of colon cancer a few years before the book was written).The Dr. Nuland's discomfort with the vast amount of intervention at the end of life often mirrored my own thoughts and concerns as my convictions on childbirth have migrated to End of Life decisions. “Beyond the medical establishment – and beyond even the capability of one’s own physician, no matter his beneficence – is the power that rightfully belongs to the patient and those who love him.”Sadly, far too often, patients and families are given false hopes. Either they are not given all the information to make these painful decisions, or they take upon themselves the belief that, hope upon hope, the medical establishment can restore their terminal loved one. It is a delicate dance.Not to say I always agreed with the author. He believes that in rare situations terminal patients should be allowed to hasten their own death. No matter how much I sympathize with the suffering of those facing painful deaths, I cannot go that quite that far. I feel similarly about trying to prolong our lives. It was easy enough to skim through the chapters on the main medical illnesses that befall mankind. However, I found that last three chapter’s to be invaluable and would highly recommend everyone to read the book just for the lessons to be learned there. The book is nearly 20 years old, and while some of the medical information is now dated, I feel the basic message is still salient."

While not sensationalized, the imageries of how our organs can fail in different orders are not for the faint of heart. Our physician author shares his reflections on how modern biomedicine has changed the way in which death is perceived and faced, with its gory details sanitized and hidden from public view. Nowadays, the medical community often treats its enemy as diseases or even death itself, but the author reminds medical professionals that perhaps it would also be wise to humbly remember that no one has ever escaped death, and to consider caring for patients in such a way so as to prioritize the enhancing the quality of their remaining time rather than maximizing its length by offering treatments which bring short periods of suffering often not worth the additional suffering and anguish. As for the rest of us, we can become well-informed and make the most appropriate decisions regarding our options according to our own values and preferences.In this book you will find page after page of insight and wisdom amid heartbreaking tales. I am thankful for the revelations concerning my own mortality, and the mortality of those around me.

In this book, an experienced physician describes the mechanisms of some of the greatest killers in the first world: heart disease, senility, violence, AIDS, and cancer. At the end he touches on the relationship between physicians and their dying charges.The prose tends toward the purple, with many references to pedestrian classics, yet the physiological descriptions can be hard to follow. More charts would help, as would more direct writing, but ultimately the ""how"" is not as important as the ""why."" Nuland's theory of bodily failure (that it all comes down to hypoxia) is a simplification, but leaves a solid impression that these seemingly disparate causes of death really are linked. The AIDS passage is tragic and beautifully written, as are many of the anecdotes. However, like many old pop-science books, science marches on and it's impossible to read that passage without thinking of how far medicine has come: in the 2010s, advertisements for pre-exposure prophylaxis (branded Truvada) are common for this disease that was a terrifying scourge in the 1990s. Throughout the book, Nuland expresses some near-futurist hopes that disease after disease will be conquered while tempered by the reality that people will continue to die, and more agonizingly so if those hopes are misplaced."

While the book is concerned with the Horsemen of Death (cancer, heart disease, strokes, septicemia, Alzheimer's), it is also as much about Nuland's life and those he cared for deeply that passed on as he observed the process as only a genius with a Photographic Memory can. It also has a significant amount of Medical History, even the history of when the book was written in 1993. In some ways (AIDS treatment for example), Medical Science has triumphed since the book was written 23 years ago. In others (Alzheimer's) we are no further along than we were then. What I didn't like: the author's Atheism in Agnostic Clothing. Belongs on the shelf with ""Being Mortal""by Atul Gawande, both equally great and disturbing."

I think it's important to have accurate information about the process of dying instead of holding on to myths about what it's like to end this life. Dying is indeed messy, painful and undignified business. I'm grateful that this detailed account of how different diseases kill us is out there. Just wasn't ready to read it all right now."

It seems so different from the nothing that preceded life.""This quote was only 3% in and it was immensely comforting for me to think about. Almost like we'd already done this before. I had never thought of death in that way.And then came the rest of the book. Honestly, I thought I was picking up a book about hospice, instead of all the graphic, gruesome ways disease destroys the body and how we succumb to it. I hadn't realized that this had been published at the beginning of the hospice movement in America. (January 1994! I was a month shy of my first birthday.) Obviously, this book is not suited to someone with extreme anxieties about dying. I could feel anxiety attacks coming on at certain parts. Even with that said, it's incredibly well-written and I learned a lot. So much in fact, that I bought a big bag of quinoa and oats to cut down on cholesterol and other unwanted fats. Fortunately, hospice has come a long ways from when this book was initially written, and the promise I've seen in many hospice books is that you don't have to die in pain, and that will be managed. There are many indignities as the body begins to fail, but you don't have to fear suffering.I think the epilogue was probably my favorite bit. So I'll leave this review with this quote:""The honesty and grace of the years of life that are ending is the real measure of how we die. It is not in the last weeks or days that we compose the message that will be remembered, but in all the decades that preceded them."""
244,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17181-jill,4,"I needed this book. However, If you have been involved in care of a chronically ill family member or loved one, or have a loved one who has been killed, you probably don’t want to read all of it. (Or maybe not at all.) Cherry-picking chapters may be wise, to avoid stirring up your grief.Nuland writes about death as someone intimately familiar. He is a poet, and he is gruesome and unsparing. He is persuasive in his love of the body and his wonder with how it works, and then immediately utterly surgical in describing the horror of how things tend to end, including violence at times. I learned more about the specifics of certain diseases and general aging than I ever have via any other thing, and I feel more in love with the human body and its frailties than ever. If you’re at all squeamish, though, or recently bereaved, beware.That said: it feels important. Nuland makes the point that none of us will be spared. We’ll all die, very likely of some root cause described in this book. It seems wise and, really, compassionate to ourselves to acknowledge and try to grok that. And to begin to wrangle with the fact that doctors (at least in the US) are often primarily focused on “The Riddle” of our disease/symptoms, vs wholistic care, especially at the end of life. (This is lately, he points out in the 2010 epilogue, a business issue with capitalist healthcare as well as an issue of training.) It won’t be easy to be advocates for ourselves and the kind of life we want to live, all the way until the end, without some deliberate thinking on the topic."
245,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12375112-arjun-ravichandran,3,"The moth and flames - human beings and death ; Death is the worm at the heart of human consciousness, the janus that propels attraction as well as repulsion. One cultural defence amongst many against this scourge, is the hope for a ""good death"", ars moriendi (the art of dying). But, midst the dispassionately clinical descriptions of oxygen starved muscles, atherosclerosis induced heart failure, trauma, and the other ""doorways into death"" through which nature finally achieves her grim objective, the author (drawing on his years of medical practice) shows how often death is something abrupt, painful, and very often humiliating and detrimental to the human spirit. Yet, death is not an enemy ; if our hope of salvaging dignity from death's final throes is more likely than not to be thwarted, the only measure of dignity that we can gain succour from is the decades of life that preceded it. The art of dying is really the art of living. Death is not an enemy, because the tragedy of an individual demise, when seen in the larger context, is the triumph of nature's self-replenishing. We must die to give way to our children, as those before died for us. Midst this contemplation of life's painful finitude, lies a moral critique of modern day medicine. The latter seeks to dispute that life has a natural and inherent limit, and that when it is time to go, it is time to go. Modern day medicine suffers from an intellectual pride that is somewhat deaf to more personal and banal concerns of the patient at death's door ; treating every terminal disease as simply a puzzle to be solved runs the risk of ruinous medical expenses, a further erosion of dignity, and finally, precisely that which is most yearned to be avoided - an isolated death in the polished squalor of the modern hospital, where the majority of human beings (at least in the developed world) now expire. A dispiriting text, yet profoundly affirmative - there are certain struggles that we cannot win, best we come to terms with it. Perhaps we can make use of Rilke's poignant prayer that the author concludes with : "" Oh Lord, give each of us his own death/ The dying, that issues forth out of the life / In which he had love, meaning and despair.""

Also a little out-of-date in some areas (the book was published in 1994), but more relevant than ever and fascinating all the same.The book really shines when addressing our misconceptions surrounding the dying process, helping us to demystify and come to terms with it in a rational, informed manner. Will definitely revisit this one in the future. Recommended to anyone curious about a universal human experience. ""When it is accepted that there are clearly defined limits to life, then life will be seen to have a symmetry as well. There is a framework of living into which all pleasures and accomplishments fit—and pain, too.

Ranging from precise mechanical descriptions of the physiological common pathways at the end of life, to broad philosophical discussions about the point of the medical profession and life. As well as being really interesting, parts of this were so beautifully written they were basically poetry -In this chapter about cancer, it’s described as: “An insidious groping parasite, attached by sharp clawed tentacles to the decaying surface of its imperilled prey” What??? Such a contrast to the dry medical texts (/Wikipedia) where I usually read about this stuff.

However, Nuland has taken this challenge head on, analysing the physiology of death. No stone is left unturned as he explores how each key system in the body fails, considering each point of failure using first principles and clearly explaining how the end result comes about. There is a fascinating blend of philosophy together with science in this book, particularly when Nuland considers what people mean when they say that they’ve seen a “white light” or felt total serenity when close to death. He reflects on how he has seen death, in patients, family members and friends, explaining how it influenced his own views on the subject. Definitely a brilliant read."

256,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69318650-nathan,3,"Sherwin Nuland uses his medical experience to explain the biochemical, physical, and emotional processes that occur in some of the most common ways we die: MI, CHF, murder, suicide, Alzheimer’s, cancer, and simply our motors being worn and torn with age beyond repair. In the majority of cases there is not a dignified death; it is ugly, painful, and hard to witness so the crux of the matter is that we need to recognize that this realistic form of death is natural and that prolonging one’s life only to endure more and increased suffering is not always the best decision but dying with the ones we love and more importantly living a life full of love is the way to achieve a dignified death and not go gently into that good night.“Every life is different from any that has gone before it, and so is every death. The uniqueness of each of us extends even to the way we die. Though most people know that various diseases carry us to our final hours by various paths, only very few comprehend the fullness of that endless multitude of ways by which the final forces of the human spirit can separate themselves from the body. Every one of death's diverse appearances is as distinctive as that singular face we each show the world during the days of life. Every man will yield up the ghost in a manner that the heavens have never known before: every woman will go her final way in her own way.”“Decline is most often gradual, with plenty of warnings and much successful treatment before the final summons.”“Because it takes a pressure of approximately 120 millimeters of mercury to generate such a forceful squeeze, the left ventricle muscle is more than half an inch wide, giving it the strongest and thickest wall of all four chambers. Pushing out about 70 milliliters of blood (2/4 ounces) with each contraction, this vigorous pump drives some 7 million milliliters (more than 14.000 pints) each day in 100,000 rhythmic and powerful beats. The mechanism of a living heart is a masterpiece of nature.”“Delay it though we may, then, the victims of coronary atherosclerosis will almost certainly die of their affliction-perhaps un expectedly during a time when they seem to be responding well to treatment, perhaps of the gradual effects of congestive heart failure.”“Every resuscitation is different. Though the general pattern is similar, every sequence, every response to massage and drugs, every heart's willingness to come back-all are different. The only certainty, whether spoken or not, is that the doctors, nurses, and technicians are fighting not only death but their own uncertainties as well. In most resuscitations, those uncertainties can be narrowed down to two main questions: Are we doing the right things? and, Should we be doing anything at all?”“Actuaries seem unable to accept a natural phenomenon unless it is so well defined as to fit neatly into a distinct and easily described classification. The annual report of the federal death accountants is very orderly-not very imaginative, and to my mind not completely reflective of real life (and real death), but nevertheless very orderly. I'm convinced that plenty of people do die of old age.”“For plants and animals, renewal requires that death precede it so that the weary may be replaced by the vigorous. This is what is meant by the cycles of nature. There is nothing pathological or sick about the sequence-in fact, it is the antithesis of sick.”“Of hundreds of known diseases and their predisposing characteristics, some 85 percent of our aging population will succumb to the complications of one of only seven major entities: atherosclerosis, hypertension, adult-onset diabetes, obesity, mental depressing states such as Alzheimer's and other dementias, cancer, and decreased resistance to infection.”“The lesson taught by the twenty-three case histories is simply confirmation of the lesson that daily experience teaches. Whether it is the anarchy of disordered biochemistry or the direct result of its opposite-a carefully orchestrated genetic ride to death-we die of old age because we have been worn and torn and programmed to cave in. The very old do not succumb to disease they implode their way into eternity.”“Never yet has anyone succeeded in borrowing any time… The lesson is never learned-there will always be those who persist in seeking the Fountain of Youth, or at least delaying what is irrevocably ordained.”“Virtually every disease can be described in terms of cause and effect. The symptoms a patient presents to his doctor, and the physical findings elicited on examination, are the direct results of very specific pathological changes within cells, tissues, and organs, or of disorders in biochemical processes. Once these underlying alterations have been identified, they can be shown to have led inevitably to the observed clinical manifestations. It is the purpose of the diagnostic workup to find the cause, using its effects as clues.”“There are no consolations in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The anguish may be mitigated by good nursing care, support groups, and the closeness of friends and family, but in the end it will be necessary for patient and loved ones together to walk through that very tortuous valley of the shadow, in the course of which everything changes forever. There is no dignity in this kind of death.”“The rapid loss of approximately one-half to two-thirds of the body's blood volume is usually sufficient to arrest the heart. Since total blood volume is equal to some 7-8 percent of body weight, a bleed of eight pints in a 170-pound man or six pints in a 130-pound woman can be enough to cause clinical death. With laceration of a vessel the size of the aorta, the process takes less than a minute; a tear in the spleen or liver might take hours, or even days, on those very rare occasions when constant ooze remains unchecked.”“Many do, in this way, avoid a tormented passage; but many others are in physical and mental distress till nearly the last moment, or even at the last moment. There is a nice Victorian reticence in denying the probability of a miserable prelude to mortality, and it is what everyone wants to hear. But if peace and dignity are what we delude ourselves to expect, most of us will die wondering what we, or our doctors, have done wrong.”“No matter the degree to which a man thinks he has convinced himself that the process of dying is not to be dreaded, he will yet approach his final illness with dread.”“Accurate knowledge of how a disease kills serves to free us from unnecessary terrors of what we might be fated to endure when we die. We may thus be better prepared to recognize the stations at which it is appropriate to ask for relief, or perhaps to begin contemplating whether to end the journey altogether.”“I prefer to believe that God has nothing to do with it. We are witnessing in our time one of those cataclysms of nature that have no meaning, no precedent, and, in spite of many claims to the contrary, no useful metaphor.”“And always, the most important charge is to care for those dread fully stricken brothers and sisters of all of us, the sickest of whom are wasted, feverish, swollen, and anemic, their eyes seeking some reassurance and the unspoken promise of relief from their torment, which too often will come only with death. No matter the perseverance and moral strength so many patients muster in the face of lethal certainty, the pitiless process by which they die is dispiriting anew with every reenactment.”“The likeness is to an insidious, groping parasite, attached by sharp-clawed tentacles to the decaying surface of its imperiled prey. The clawing extremities ceaselessly extend the periphery of their malign grip, while the loathsome core of the burrowing beast eats silently away at life, able to digest only what it has first de composed. The process is noiseless; it has no recognizable instant of beginning and it ends only when the despoiler has consumed the final remnants of its host's vital forces.”“The boundaries of medical futility, however, have never been clear, and it may be too much to expect that they ever will be. It is perhaps for this reason that there has arisen the conviction among doctors-more than a mere conviction, it is nowadays felt by many to be a responsibility-that should error occur in the treatment of a patient, it must always be on the side of doing more rather than less.”“When the chips are down, almost no one wants his life to end, and one good way for the conscious mind to avoid it is for the unconscious mind to deny that it is about to happen.”“Though everyone may yearn for a tranquil death, the basic instinct to stay alive is a far more powerful force.”“The greatest dignity to be found in death is the dignity of the life that preceded it. This is a form of hope we can all achieve, and it is the most abiding of all. Hope resides in the meaning of what our lives have been.”“The lesson in all of this is well known. Hope lies not only in an expectation of cure or even of the remission of present distress. For dying patients, the hope of cure will always be shown to be ultimately false, and even the hope of relief too often turns to ashes.”“When my time comes, I will seek hope in the knowledge that insofar as possible I will not be allowed to suffer or be subjected to needless attempts to maintain life; I will seek it in the certainty that I will not be abandoned to die alone; I am seeking it now, in the way I try to live my life, so that those who value what I am will have profited by my time on earth and be left with comforting recollections of what we have meant to one another.”"

I have a deeper understanding of death, dignity, hope, care. If we have to die, we want it quick, but not too quick. We want it dignified and meaningful. Very few of us will get that.Yet for long stretches, the book seems undecided how to approach death. I want to know what it's like to die of cancer, but the book tells me how cancer works, from the outside. There's a long chapter how AIDS was discovered, but little on what it's like to die of AIDS. Much gravity in the language, stilted. Appropriate to the subject, but still. I wish the final chapter, the Coda, from 2010, hadn't been written."
259,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3754944-mm,0,"I read this book because I have started to work as a healthcare professional, and in particular with countless clients who are ""palliative."" What I wanted to know was why, when I review the medical history of some of my clients (patients) with Chronic Heart Failure, and a history of a Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA), and Hypertension, and a CABG (bypass) in 2013, and kidney failure, and... what have these diagnoses done? Are they really dying of all of these things?I don't know how to explain it. I have a client right now, a sweet old lady, cute as can be, who laughs at the end of every breathless sentence she speaks. As is my job in the healthcare team, I ordered her a hospital bed - her doting daughter wishes to keep her at home - and a commode and a wheelchair and a cushion. I assess the redness developing on her coccyx (her bum) and recommend that she be turned at such and such time to prevent bedsores. Here I see an 87 year old lady dying, of course she is dying, and what she wants is rest and relaxation. So we set up her bed by the window, and she keeps her white nightgown on as her legs have edema (swelling), and she lays there with the head of the bed up to help her breath better, and the sunlight steams in, and every once in a while she groans and tries to shift her weight because she is uncomfortable in one position, and she looks positively like an angel.And I know that inside her there is a battle against kidney failure, which is why her tummy is so huge and her organs are floating in that cavity we call the abdomen. And inside her too is heart failure, which likely has caused the kidney failure. And so she is fatigued, and she is heavy - she can't fit into her wheelchair anymore - and her heaviness is creating risk for pressure injuries on her bed. And I know that she has medications by the dozens, and that I recommended the daughter get a blister pack because at some point it is impossible to keep track of all these medications.I know that this is a disease, or more accurately a plethora of diseases, each feeding off of the other - when one head is chopped off, the hydra grows another.So I know why she is dying, I suppose. But she is 87. And is she really diseased? Isn't this just her aged body saying - enough. I have worked long enough, and now I wish to be comfortable as I leave this life. Despite the list of diagnoses that go on and on, and the list of surgeries that go on and on, and the list of medications that is even longer - isn't she dying of old age? It's just that simple. She isn't dying of disease. She is dying of the natural cycle of life - not just of human life, but of all life. She is dying of the cosmic principle that says - ye shalt not last! She is dying because nothing in this world is eternal, and even thousands of years old trees must one day die, and the lion eats the gazelle, and the cat chases the mouse, and age comes after us all.So while she lies there and the healthcare team gently urges the daughter to move her mother to a hospice, I can't help but feel that somewhere along the line, by pathologizing, the dignity of old age - a dignity that is from understanding, not from the wheezing and heaving and overall grotesqueness of the last few months of life - is lost.We all must die, and death will most likely be awful, and painful, and we will very likely be surrounded by strangers. And some deaths are a tragedy, while others are just this: that Life folds her hands and places them in her lap, and her sister Death opens hers and says to us, Embrace me now, for your earthly journey is complete, so come home. And the worms will eat your body but the face of God hangs eternal, looking over it all."
260,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100050401-kathleen-murray,5,"I've given this book to at least 10 friends, and none will read it. Is it something to do with the title. This was the first, and one of the best, in the burgeoning genre of death and dying. Other than being born, death is one of the most important things that happens to us, and we might as well know a little about it. I read this when it first came out, about a year before I had health care power of attorney for an 86-year-old woman with end-stage COPD. I like to think that the section on pneumonia helped inform my decision-making, and limit the suffering of her final days. "
261,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2715247-james-klagge,4,"Some pretty rough descriptions, which illustrate the author's general point that death is rarely the serene, dignified experience for which we hope. It was not the prospect of my own death that motivated me to read this, but I couldn't help thinking about that as well. Though much of the book is taken up with describing at various levels the processes of death, the author also wanted to emphasize the difficulty and the importance of patients and their families taking some control of the process away from the medical-technological process that will otherwise dominate. The author regrets the power of specialists whose primary or sole motivation is curing or prolonging life regardless of the human cost. He quotes (p. 275) the director of the UCLA Medical Center who said in 2009: ""If you come into this hospital, we're not going to let you die."" It sounds like a perverse kind of hell. Instead, the author wishes that there were ways to value and promote family practitioners who would care about pastoring the patient as much as winning the battle. I have such a family doctor, but since he is several years older than I am, I wonder if he'll still be practicing when I need him.The main issue is deciding when it is time to stop trying and accept death. The problem is that doctors still too often don't know, and aren't happy letting patients decide, when enough is enough. This is not a lesson I needed to learn about, but it is important to think about it in advance, for oneself and one's loved ones. The discussion also reminded me of analogous issues such as when it is time to stop trying to save a dying relationship, or when it is time to stop trying to pursue an ill-fated project or profession. Hope is an important virtue, but it also has its limits. As Aristotle could have said, there can be too little hope, but there can also be too much. The author thinks we need to reconceive what we mean by hope near the end of life. Death will always win in the end. But he thinks that we can still hope for and work toward being ourselves to our last breath. Even this can be taken away from us by the ravages of death, but it is something we can aim for--to be oneself as long as possible. I really should give 5 stars to a doctor who quotes Vaclav Havel (p. 281) on hope, in a book about medicine; but the unnecessary repetitions led me to reduce the rating by a star. In any case, well-worth reading--especially since each of us will eventually die, or at least we know someone who will. :)"
262,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6269159-robyn-mcintyre,3,"This National Book Award winner came out in 1993, but I recently read it after a recommendation by a friend. Dr. Sherwin B. Nuland, the author, who passed away from colon cancer in 2014, combined stories of the difficult illnesses and deaths of family members and patients with the facts of what physically occurs during a fatal illness such as heart disease, stroke, or cancer. His primary point to be made was that people now die more often in a hospital than they do at home and that wishing for a comfortable, spiritual passing at home is pointless because death was intractable and almost always messy and humiliating.At the time, his words made quite a stir, adding to the national dialog that was revving up about how current society views death and deals with it by trying to convince the terminally ill to submit to lengthy and often painful procedures in an effort to extend their lives by a small margin.Having been through the deaths of my parents, my husband, several friends, and younger relatives, I was most taken with the stories Dr. Nuland related out of his own experience. The descriptions of the processes by which people die were less interesting to me because I had already researched most of them. Of course, people did not have access to the bounty of information now available via the internet about those processes and now, thanks to blogging, there is also a multitude of first-person experiences to be had. But in the early 90s, no such comprehensive resources existed, and Dr. Nuland's book provided a frank and somewhat shocking review of what happens during a catastrophic illness. If I had been able to read this in the 1980s and known about it in the 1990s, I'm certain I would have found it both enlightening and a cause for some sorrow.At this time, many terminally ill people are choosing hospice to try to find that 'good death' that Dr. Nuland saw as unachievable in the 80s and 90s. There is no doubt that the debilitation attending a drawn-out death is often messy and frequently painful as well as humiliating, but hospice care does attempt to provide an experience as close to a 'good' death as it is possible to get. And with a growing movement of physician-assisted deaths for terminal patients, some people are finding it possible to pass over without having to go through the most difficult parts of the dying process. I found myself wishing that How We Die could have been updated to address Dr. Nuland's thoughts on these alternatives to a hospital-based prolongation of life."

Despite the opening line, it seems (after reading the book) that although each death is individual to the person's body peculiarities and responsiveness to intervention, ways of dying are readily categorized (mostly) due to a handful of particular maladies. The author divides the chapters by illness: ""The Strangled Heart"" and ""Alzheimer's Disease"" and so on, except for the ending chapters he uses to discuss his point of view about end of life responsibilities of providers. As the book progresses, so does the author's discussion about doctors attempting to solve ""The Riddle"" of the patient's illness which the author states often overshadows the needs of a dying patient. I enjoyed this book most when Nuland was deconstructing the illnesses in detail, explaining processes as he went. This style was more prevalent in the earlier chapters. As the book went on, his personal ideas (based on years of personal and professional experience) about how much intervention dying patients ought seek and providers ought provide, bogged down the chapters. I would have preferred scant mention of this until a summarizing chapter at the end wherein he pulled all the threads of the bodily processes in various ailments together to philosophize about the wisdom (or not) of intrusive end of life interventions. I surmise the author intended ""how we die"" to be a dual discussion of how the body physically ends as well as how the societal and medical systems participate in that process but the discussion of the latter feels heavy-handed, especially in later chapters. Still, the book is engaging overall, the individual explanations of how a body shuts down during heart failure or AIDS was fascinating, and he raises compelling questions about the cultural and ethical considerations in end of life care.

264,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1732804-wendy,4,"I am only giving this book 4 stars because I am not the most medically/scientifically minded, so sometimes it made me say ""huh?"" and I had to go back and reread certain things to really get a grasp. Lots of big words and new ideas here for me. That being said, since having a life now touched by death, I have looked to solace in the biological (as opposed to the spiritual) aspect of what it means to die and be dead, so this book was pretty good for explaining how death happens physically (if you didn't get that from the title). It even gave me some insight into the minds of my mom's doctors as her conditioned worsened and they sort of began to wash their hands of her and walk away. That too, was helpful and relieved me of some anger.Here's my favorite part from the last chapter....there are additional pieces of baggage we shall all take to the grave, but from which we may somewhat disencumber ourselves if we anticipate them. By these, I mean conflicts unresolved, breached relationships not healed, potentials unfulfilled, promises not kept, and years that will never be lived. For virtually every one of us, there will be unfinished business. Only the very old escape it, and even then not always. Perhaps the mere existence of things undone should be a sort of satisfaction in itself, though the idea would appear to be paradoxical. Only one who is long since dead while still seemingly alive does not have many ""promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep,"" and that state of inertness is not to be desired. To the wise advice that we live every day as though it will be our last, we do well to add the admonition to live every day as though we will be on this earth forever."

The author, a surgeon, doesn't hold back, even when it means facing his own failings as a doctor and brother (his brother died of colon cancer a few years before the book was written).The Dr. Nuland's discomfort with the vast amount of intervention at the end of life often mirrored my own thoughts and concerns as my convictions on childbirth have migrated to End of Life decisions. “Beyond the medical establishment – and beyond even the capability of one’s own physician, no matter his beneficence – is the power that rightfully belongs to the patient and those who love him.”Sadly, far too often, patients and families are given false hopes. Either they are not given all the information to make these painful decisions, or they take upon themselves the belief that, hope upon hope, the medical establishment can restore their terminal loved one. It is a delicate dance.Not to say I always agreed with the author. He believes that in rare situations terminal patients should be allowed to hasten their own death. No matter how much I sympathize with the suffering of those facing painful deaths, I cannot go that quite that far. I feel similarly about trying to prolong our lives. It was easy enough to skim through the chapters on the main medical illnesses that befall mankind. However, I found that last three chapter’s to be invaluable and would highly recommend everyone to read the book just for the lessons to be learned there. The book is nearly 20 years old, and while some of the medical information is now dated, I feel the basic message is still salient."

While not sensationalized, the imageries of how our organs can fail in different orders are not for the faint of heart. Our physician author shares his reflections on how modern biomedicine has changed the way in which death is perceived and faced, with its gory details sanitized and hidden from public view. Nowadays, the medical community often treats its enemy as diseases or even death itself, but the author reminds medical professionals that perhaps it would also be wise to humbly remember that no one has ever escaped death, and to consider caring for patients in such a way so as to prioritize the enhancing the quality of their remaining time rather than maximizing its length by offering treatments which bring short periods of suffering often not worth the additional suffering and anguish. As for the rest of us, we can become well-informed and make the most appropriate decisions regarding our options according to our own values and preferences.In this book you will find page after page of insight and wisdom amid heartbreaking tales. I am thankful for the revelations concerning my own mortality, and the mortality of those around me. I cannot recommend this book enough for everyone in the medical profession, especially doctors and nurses at the frontline fighting for the wellbeing of patients."

They are meant to serve us by disarming our terror about what the reality may be> While so many of us hope for a swift death or a death during sleep “so I won’t suffer,” we at the same time cling to an image of our final moments that combines grace with a sense of closure; we need to believe in a clear-minded process in which the summation of a life takes place—either that or a perfect lapse into agony-free unconsciousness. –p8It is this so-called terminal gasp phase that allows the aspiration of so much water that its absorption in a freshwater drowning may account for as much as 50 percent of the blood volume. – p161Drowning kills almost five thousand people in the United States each year, and alcohol is involved 40 percent of the time.

In this book, an experienced physician describes the mechanisms of some of the greatest killers in the first world: heart disease, senility, violence, AIDS, and cancer. At the end he touches on the relationship between physicians and their dying charges.The prose tends toward the purple, with many references to pedestrian classics, yet the physiological descriptions can be hard to follow. More charts would help, as would more direct writing, but ultimately the ""how"" is not as important as the ""why."" Nuland's theory of bodily failure (that it all comes down to hypoxia) is a simplification, but leaves a solid impression that these seemingly disparate causes of death really are linked. The AIDS passage is tragic and beautifully written, as are many of the anecdotes. However, like many old pop-science books, science marches on and it's impossible to read that passage without thinking of how far medicine has come: in the 2010s, advertisements for pre-exposure prophylaxis (branded Truvada) are common for this disease that was a terrifying scourge in the 1990s. Throughout the book, Nuland expresses some near-futurist hopes that disease after disease will be conquered while tempered by the reality that people will continue to die, and more agonizingly so if those hopes are misplaced."

While the book is concerned with the Horsemen of Death (cancer, heart disease, strokes, septicemia, Alzheimer's), it is also as much about Nuland's life and those he cared for deeply that passed on as he observed the process as only a genius with a Photographic Memory can. It also has a significant amount of Medical History, even the history of when the book was written in 1993. In some ways (AIDS treatment for example), Medical Science has triumphed since the book was written 23 years ago. In others (Alzheimer's) we are no further along than we were then.

It seems so different from the nothing that preceded life.""This quote was only 3% in and it was immensely comforting for me to think about. Almost like we'd already done this before. I had never thought of death in that way.And then came the rest of the book. Honestly, I thought I was picking up a book about hospice, instead of all the graphic, gruesome ways disease destroys the body and how we succumb to it. I hadn't realized that this had been published at the beginning of the hospice movement in America. (January 1994! I was a month shy of my first birthday.) Obviously, this book is not suited to someone with extreme anxieties about dying. I could feel anxiety attacks coming on at certain parts. Even with that said, it's incredibly well-written and I learned a lot. So much in fact, that I bought a big bag of quinoa and oats to cut down on cholesterol and other unwanted fats. Fortunately, hospice has come a long ways from when this book was initially written, and the promise I've seen in many hospice books is that you don't have to die in pain, and that will be managed. There are many indignities as the body begins to fail, but you don't have to fear suffering.I think the epilogue was probably my favorite bit. So I'll leave this review with this quote:""The honesty and grace of the years of life that are ending is the real measure of how we die.

However, If you have been involved in care of a chronically ill family member or loved one, or have a loved one who has been killed, you probably don’t want to read all of it. (Or maybe not at all.) Cherry-picking chapters may be wise, to avoid stirring up your grief.Nuland writes about death as someone intimately familiar. He is a poet, and he is gruesome and unsparing. He is persuasive in his love of the body and his wonder with how it works, and then immediately utterly surgical in describing the horror of how things tend to end, including violence at times. I learned more about the specifics of certain diseases and general aging than I ever have via any other thing, and I feel more in love with the human body and its frailties than ever. If you’re at all squeamish, though, or recently bereaved, beware.That said: it feels important. Nuland makes the point that none of us will be spared. We’ll all die, very likely of some root cause described in this book. It seems wise and, really, compassionate to ourselves to acknowledge and try to grok that. And to begin to wrangle with the fact that doctors (at least in the US) are often primarily focused on “The Riddle” of our disease/symptoms, vs wholistic care, especially at the end of life. (This is lately, he points out in the 2010 epilogue, a business issue with capitalist healthcare as well as an issue of training.) It won’t be easy to be advocates for ourselves and the kind of life we want to live, all the way until the end, without some deliberate thinking on the topic."

One cultural defence amongst many against this scourge, is the hope for a ""good death"", ars moriendi (the art of dying). But, midst the dispassionately clinical descriptions of oxygen starved muscles, atherosclerosis induced heart failure, trauma, and the other ""doorways into death"" through which nature finally achieves her grim objective, the author (drawing on his years of medical practice) shows how often death is something abrupt, painful, and very often humiliating and detrimental to the human spirit. Yet, death is not an enemy ; if our hope of salvaging dignity from death's final throes is more likely than not to be thwarted, the only measure of dignity that we can gain succour from is the decades of life that preceded it. The art of dying is really the art of living. Death is not an enemy, because the tragedy of an individual demise, when seen in the larger context, is the triumph of nature's self-replenishing. We must die to give way to our children, as those before died for us. Midst this contemplation of life's painful finitude, lies a moral critique of modern day medicine. The latter seeks to dispute that life has a natural and inherent limit, and that when it is time to go, it is time to go. Modern day medicine suffers from an intellectual pride that is somewhat deaf to more personal and banal concerns of the patient at death's door ; treating every terminal disease as simply a puzzle to be solved runs the risk of ruinous medical expenses, a further erosion of dignity, and finally, precisely that which is most yearned to be avoided - an isolated death in the polished squalor of the modern hospital, where the majority of human beings (at least in the developed world) now expire. A dispiriting text, yet profoundly affirmative - there are certain struggles that we cannot win, best we come to terms with it. Perhaps we can make use of Rilke's poignant prayer that the author concludes with : "" Oh Lord, give each of us his own death/ The dying, that issues forth out of the life / In which he had love, meaning and despair.""

No stone is left unturned as he explores how each key system in the body fails, considering each point of failure using first principles and clearly explaining how the end result comes about. There is a fascinating blend of philosophy together with science in this book, particularly when Nuland considers what people mean when they say that they’ve seen a “white light” or felt total serenity when close to death. He reflects on how he has seen death, in patients, family members and friends, explaining how it influenced his own views on the subject. Definitely a brilliant read."

286,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69318650-nathan,3,"Sherwin Nuland uses his medical experience to explain the biochemical, physical, and emotional processes that occur in some of the most common ways we die: MI, CHF, murder, suicide, Alzheimer’s, cancer, and simply our motors being worn and torn with age beyond repair. In the majority of cases there is not a dignified death; it is ugly, painful, and hard to witness so the crux of the matter is that we need to recognize that this realistic form of death is natural and that prolonging one’s life only to endure more and increased suffering is not always the best decision but dying with the ones we love and more importantly living a life full of love is the way to achieve a dignified death and not go gently into that good night.“Every life is different from any that has gone before it, and so is every death. The uniqueness of each of us extends even to the way we die. Though most people know that various diseases carry us to our final hours by various paths, only very few comprehend the fullness of that endless multitude of ways by which the final forces of the human spirit can separate themselves from the body. Every one of death's diverse appearances is as distinctive as that singular face we each show the world during the days of life. Every man will yield up the ghost in a manner that the heavens have never known before: every woman will go her final way in her own way.”“Decline is most often gradual, with plenty of warnings and much successful treatment before the final summons.”“Because it takes a pressure of approximately 120 millimeters of mercury to generate such a forceful squeeze, the left ventricle muscle is more than half an inch wide, giving it the strongest and thickest wall of all four chambers. Pushing out about 70 milliliters of blood (2/4 ounces) with each contraction, this vigorous pump drives some 7 million milliliters (more than 14.000 pints) each day in 100,000 rhythmic and powerful beats. The mechanism of a living heart is a masterpiece of nature.”“Delay it though we may, then, the victims of coronary atherosclerosis will almost certainly die of their affliction-perhaps un expectedly during a time when they seem to be responding well to treatment, perhaps of the gradual effects of congestive heart failure.”“Every resuscitation is different. Though the general pattern is similar, every sequence, every response to massage and drugs, every heart's willingness to come back-all are different. The only certainty, whether spoken or not, is that the doctors, nurses, and technicians are fighting not only death but their own uncertainties as well. In most resuscitations, those uncertainties can be narrowed down to two main questions: Are we doing the right things? and, Should we be doing anything at all?”“Actuaries seem unable to accept a natural phenomenon unless it is so well defined as to fit neatly into a distinct and easily described classification. The annual report of the federal death accountants is very orderly-not very imaginative, and to my mind not completely reflective of real life (and real death), but nevertheless very orderly. I'm convinced that plenty of people do die of old age.”“For plants and animals, renewal requires that death precede it so that the weary may be replaced by the vigorous. This is what is meant by the cycles of nature. There is nothing pathological or sick about the sequence-in fact, it is the antithesis of sick.”“Of hundreds of known diseases and their predisposing characteristics, some 85 percent of our aging population will succumb to the complications of one of only seven major entities: atherosclerosis, hypertension, adult-onset diabetes, obesity, mental depressing states such as Alzheimer's and other dementias, cancer, and decreased resistance to infection.”“The lesson taught by the twenty-three case histories is simply confirmation of the lesson that daily experience teaches. Whether it is the anarchy of disordered biochemistry or the direct result of its opposite-a carefully orchestrated genetic ride to death-we die of old age because we have been worn and torn and programmed to cave in. The very old do not succumb to disease they implode their way into eternity.”“Never yet has anyone succeeded in borrowing any time… The lesson is never learned-there will always be those who persist in seeking the Fountain of Youth, or at least delaying what is irrevocably ordained.”“Virtually every disease can be described in terms of cause and effect. The symptoms a patient presents to his doctor, and the physical findings elicited on examination, are the direct results of very specific pathological changes within cells, tissues, and organs, or of disorders in biochemical processes. Once these underlying alterations have been identified, they can be shown to have led inevitably to the observed clinical manifestations. It is the purpose of the diagnostic workup to find the cause, using its effects as clues.”“There are no consolations in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The anguish may be mitigated by good nursing care, support groups, and the closeness of friends and family, but in the end it will be necessary for patient and loved ones together to walk through that very tortuous valley of the shadow, in the course of which everything changes forever. There is no dignity in this kind of death.”“The rapid loss of approximately one-half to two-thirds of the body's blood volume is usually sufficient to arrest the heart. Since total blood volume is equal to some 7-8 percent of body weight, a bleed of eight pints in a 170-pound man or six pints in a 130-pound woman can be enough to cause clinical death. With laceration of a vessel the size of the aorta, the process takes less than a minute; a tear in the spleen or liver might take hours, or even days, on those very rare occasions when constant ooze remains unchecked.”“Many do, in this way, avoid a tormented passage; but many others are in physical and mental distress till nearly the last moment, or even at the last moment. There is a nice Victorian reticence in denying the probability of a miserable prelude to mortality, and it is what everyone wants to hear. But if peace and dignity are what we delude ourselves to expect, most of us will die wondering what we, or our doctors, have done wrong.”“No matter the degree to which a man thinks he has convinced himself that the process of dying is not to be dreaded, he will yet approach his final illness with dread.”“Accurate knowledge of how a disease kills serves to free us from unnecessary terrors of what we might be fated to endure when we die. We may thus be better prepared to recognize the stations at which it is appropriate to ask for relief, or perhaps to begin contemplating whether to end the journey altogether.”“I prefer to believe that God has nothing to do with it. We are witnessing in our time one of those cataclysms of nature that have no meaning, no precedent, and, in spite of many claims to the contrary, no useful metaphor.”“And always, the most important charge is to care for those dread fully stricken brothers and sisters of all of us, the sickest of whom are wasted, feverish, swollen, and anemic, their eyes seeking some reassurance and the unspoken promise of relief from their torment, which too often will come only with death. No matter the perseverance and moral strength so many patients muster in the face of lethal certainty, the pitiless process by which they die is dispiriting anew with every reenactment.”“The likeness is to an insidious, groping parasite, attached by sharp-clawed tentacles to the decaying surface of its imperiled prey. The clawing extremities ceaselessly extend the periphery of their malign grip, while the loathsome core of the burrowing beast eats silently away at life, able to digest only what it has first de composed. The process is noiseless; it has no recognizable instant of beginning and it ends only when the despoiler has consumed the final remnants of its host's vital forces.”“The boundaries of medical futility, however, have never been clear, and it may be too much to expect that they ever will be. It is perhaps for this reason that there has arisen the conviction among doctors-more than a mere conviction, it is nowadays felt by many to be a responsibility-that should error occur in the treatment of a patient, it must always be on the side of doing more rather than less.”“When the chips are down, almost no one wants his life to end, and one good way for the conscious mind to avoid it is for the unconscious mind to deny that it is about to happen.”“Though everyone may yearn for a tranquil death, the basic instinct to stay alive is a far more powerful force.”“The greatest dignity to be found in death is the dignity of the life that preceded it. This is a form of hope we can all achieve, and it is the most abiding of all. Hope resides in the meaning of what our lives have been.”“The lesson in all of this is well known. Hope lies not only in an expectation of cure or even of the remission of present distress. For dying patients, the hope of cure will always be shown to be ultimately false, and even the hope of relief too often turns to ashes.”“When my time comes, I will seek hope in the knowledge that insofar as possible I will not be allowed to suffer or be subjected to needless attempts to maintain life; I will seek it in the certainty that I will not be abandoned to die alone; I am seeking it now, in the way I try to live my life, so that those who value what I am will have profited by my time on earth and be left with comforting recollections of what we have meant to one another.”"

Are they really dying of all of these things?I don't know how to explain it. I have a client right now, a sweet old lady, cute as can be, who laughs at the end of every breathless sentence she speaks. As is my job in the healthcare team, I ordered her a hospital bed - her doting daughter wishes to keep her at home - and a commode and a wheelchair and a cushion. I assess the redness developing on her coccyx (her bum) and recommend that she be turned at such and such time to prevent bedsores. Here I see an 87 year old lady dying, of course she is dying, and what she wants is rest and relaxation. So we set up her bed by the window, and she keeps her white nightgown on as her legs have edema (swelling), and she lays there with the head of the bed up to help her breath better, and the sunlight steams in, and every once in a while she groans and tries to shift her weight because she is uncomfortable in one position, and she looks positively like an angel.And I know that inside her there is a battle against kidney failure, which is why her tummy is so huge and her organs are floating in that cavity we call the abdomen. And inside her too is heart failure, which likely has caused the kidney failure. And so she is fatigued, and she is heavy - she can't fit into her wheelchair anymore - and her heaviness is creating risk for pressure injuries on her bed. And I know that she has medications by the dozens, and that I recommended the daughter get a blister pack because at some point it is impossible to keep track of all these medications.I know that this is a disease, or more accurately a plethora of diseases, each feeding off of the other - when one head is chopped off, the hydra grows another.So I know why she is dying, I suppose. But she is 87. And is she really diseased? Isn't this just her aged body saying - enough. I have worked long enough, and now I wish to be comfortable as I leave this life. Despite the list of diagnoses that go on and on, and the list of surgeries that go on and on, and the list of medications that is even longer - isn't she dying of old age? It's just that simple. She isn't dying of disease. She is dying of the natural cycle of life - not just of human life, but of all life. She is dying of the cosmic principle that says - ye shalt not last! She is dying because nothing in this world is eternal, and even thousands of years old trees must one day die, and the lion eats the gazelle, and the cat chases the mouse, and age comes after us all.So while she lies there and the healthcare team gently urges the daughter to move her mother to a hospice, I can't help but feel that somewhere along the line, by pathologizing, the dignity of old age - a dignity that is from understanding, not from the wheezing and heaving and overall grotesqueness of the last few months of life - is lost.We all must die, and death will most likely be awful, and painful, and we will very likely be surrounded by strangers. And some deaths are a tragedy, while others are just this: that Life folds her hands and places them in her lap, and her sister Death opens hers and says to us, Embrace me now, for your earthly journey is complete, so come home. And the worms will eat your body but the face of God hangs eternal, looking over it all."

This was the first, and one of the best, in the burgeoning genre of death and dying. Other than being born, death is one of the most important things that happens to us, and we might as well know a little about it. I read this when it first came out, about a year before I had health care power of attorney for an 86-year-old woman with end-stage COPD. I like to think that the section on pneumonia helped inform my decision-making, and limit the suffering of her final days. "
291,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2715247-james-klagge,4,"Some pretty rough descriptions, which illustrate the author's general point that death is rarely the serene, dignified experience for which we hope. It was not the prospect of my own death that motivated me to read this, but I couldn't help thinking about that as well. Though much of the book is taken up with describing at various levels the processes of death, the author also wanted to emphasize the difficulty and the importance of patients and their families taking some control of the process away from the medical-technological process that will otherwise dominate. The author regrets the power of specialists whose primary or sole motivation is curing or prolonging life regardless of the human cost. He quotes (p. 275) the director of the UCLA Medical Center who said in 2009: ""If you come into this hospital, we're not going to let you die."" It sounds like a perverse kind of hell. Instead, the author wishes that there were ways to value and promote family practitioners who would care about pastoring the patient as much as winning the battle. I have such a family doctor, but since he is several years older than I am, I wonder if he'll still be practicing when I need him.The main issue is deciding when it is time to stop trying and accept death. The problem is that doctors still too often don't know, and aren't happy letting patients decide, when enough is enough. This is not a lesson I needed to learn about, but it is important to think about it in advance, for oneself and one's loved ones. The discussion also reminded me of analogous issues such as when it is time to stop trying to save a dying relationship, or when it is time to stop trying to pursue an ill-fated project or profession. Hope is an important virtue, but it also has its limits. As Aristotle could have said, there can be too little hope, but there can also be too much. The author thinks we need to reconceive what we mean by hope near the end of life. Death will always win in the end. But he thinks that we can still hope for and work toward being ourselves to our last breath. Even this can be taken away from us by the ravages of death, but it is something we can aim for--to be oneself as long as possible. I really should give 5 stars to a doctor who quotes Vaclav Havel (p. 281) on hope, in a book about medicine; but the unnecessary repetitions led me to reduce the rating by a star. In any case, well-worth reading--especially since each of us will eventually die, or at least we know someone who will. :)"
292,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6269159-robyn-mcintyre,3,"This National Book Award winner came out in 1993, but I recently read it after a recommendation by a friend. Dr. Sherwin B. Nuland, the author, who passed away from colon cancer in 2014, combined stories of the difficult illnesses and deaths of family members and patients with the facts of what physically occurs during a fatal illness such as heart disease, stroke, or cancer. His primary point to be made was that people now die more often in a hospital than they do at home and that wishing for a comfortable, spiritual passing at home is pointless because death was intractable and almost always messy and humiliating.At the time, his words made quite a stir, adding to the national dialog that was revving up about how current society views death and deals with it by trying to convince the terminally ill to submit to lengthy and often painful procedures in an effort to extend their lives by a small margin.Having been through the deaths of my parents, my husband, several friends, and younger relatives, I was most taken with the stories Dr. Nuland related out of his own experience. The descriptions of the processes by which people die were less interesting to me because I had already researched most of them. Of course, people did not have access to the bounty of information now available via the internet about those processes and now, thanks to blogging, there is also a multitude of first-person experiences to be had. But in the early 90s, no such comprehensive resources existed, and Dr. Nuland's book provided a frank and somewhat shocking review of what happens during a catastrophic illness. If I had been able to read this in the 1980s and known about it in the 1990s, I'm certain I would have found it both enlightening and a cause for some sorrow.At this time, many terminally ill people are choosing hospice to try to find that 'good death' that Dr. Nuland saw as unachievable in the 80s and 90s. There is no doubt that the debilitation attending a drawn-out death is often messy and frequently painful as well as humiliating, but hospice care does attempt to provide an experience as close to a 'good' death as it is possible to get. And with a growing movement of physician-assisted deaths for terminal patients, some people are finding it possible to pass over without having to go through the most difficult parts of the dying process. I found myself wishing that How We Die could have been updated to address Dr. Nuland's thoughts on these alternatives to a hospital-based prolongation of life."
293,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7405304-deb-stone,4,"""Every life is different from any that has gone before it and so is every death."" Despite the opening line, it seems (after reading the book) that although each death is individual to the person's body peculiarities and responsiveness to intervention, ways of dying are readily categorized (mostly) due to a handful of particular maladies. The author divides the chapters by illness: ""The Strangled Heart"" and ""Alzheimer's Disease"" and so on, except for the ending chapters he uses to discuss his point of view about end of life responsibilities of providers. As the book progresses, so does the author's discussion about doctors attempting to solve ""The Riddle"" of the patient's illness which the author states often overshadows the needs of a dying patient. I enjoyed this book most when Nuland was deconstructing the illnesses in detail, explaining processes as he went. This style was more prevalent in the earlier chapters. As the book went on, his personal ideas (based on years of personal and professional experience) about how much intervention dying patients ought seek and providers ought provide, bogged down the chapters. I would have preferred scant mention of this until a summarizing chapter at the end wherein he pulled all the threads of the bodily processes in various ailments together to philosophize about the wisdom (or not) of intrusive end of life interventions. I surmise the author intended ""how we die"" to be a dual discussion of how the body physically ends as well as how the societal and medical systems participate in that process but the discussion of the latter feels heavy-handed, especially in later chapters. Still, the book is engaging overall, the individual explanations of how a body shuts down during heart failure or AIDS was fascinating, and he raises compelling questions about the cultural and ethical considerations in end of life care. "
294,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1732804-wendy,4,"I am only giving this book 4 stars because I am not the most medically/scientifically minded, so sometimes it made me say ""huh?"" and I had to go back and reread certain things to really get a grasp. Lots of big words and new ideas here for me. That being said, since having a life now touched by death, I have looked to solace in the biological (as opposed to the spiritual) aspect of what it means to die and be dead, so this book was pretty good for explaining how death happens physically (if you didn't get that from the title). It even gave me some insight into the minds of my mom's doctors as her conditioned worsened and they sort of began to wash their hands of her and walk away. That too, was helpful and relieved me of some anger.Here's my favorite part from the last chapter....there are additional pieces of baggage we shall all take to the grave, but from which we may somewhat disencumber ourselves if we anticipate them. By these, I mean conflicts unresolved, breached relationships not healed, potentials unfulfilled, promises not kept, and years that will never be lived. For virtually every one of us, there will be unfinished business. Only the very old escape it, and even then not always. Perhaps the mere existence of things undone should be a sort of satisfaction in itself, though the idea would appear to be paradoxical. Only one who is long since dead while still seemingly alive does not have many ""promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep,"" and that state of inertness is not to be desired. To the wise advice that we live every day as though it will be our last, we do well to add the admonition to live every day as though we will be on this earth forever."
295,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/576123-debbi,4,"How We Die is a sometimes raw look at the different ways we will all face death and End of Life issues. The author, a surgeon, doesn't hold back, even when it means facing his own failings as a doctor and brother (his brother died of colon cancer a few years before the book was written).The Dr. Nuland's discomfort with the vast amount of intervention at the end of life often mirrored my own thoughts and concerns as my convictions on childbirth have migrated to End of Life decisions. “Beyond the medical establishment – and beyond even the capability of one’s own physician, no matter his beneficence – is the power that rightfully belongs to the patient and those who love him.”Sadly, far too often, patients and families are given false hopes. Either they are not given all the information to make these painful decisions, or they take upon themselves the belief that, hope upon hope, the medical establishment can restore their terminal loved one. It is a delicate dance.Not to say I always agreed with the author. He believes that in rare situations terminal patients should be allowed to hasten their own death. No matter how much I sympathize with the suffering of those facing painful deaths, I cannot go that quite that far. I feel similarly about trying to prolong our lives. It was easy enough to skim through the chapters on the main medical illnesses that befall mankind. However, I found that last three chapter’s to be invaluable and would highly recommend everyone to read the book just for the lessons to be learned there. The book is nearly 20 years old, and while some of the medical information is now dated, I feel the basic message is still salient."
296,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7696415-karen-lee,5,"I have never been fascinated with death in any shape or form, but at the ripe old age of 3x, I decided to reflect more on the unavoidable end that awaits each of us.How We Die --- Reflections on Life's Final Chapter discusses the common ways in which most of us will die, in precise medical terms and clinical details. While not sensationalized, the imageries of how our organs can fail in different orders are not for the faint of heart. Our physician author shares his reflections on how modern biomedicine has changed the way in which death is perceived and faced, with its gory details sanitized and hidden from public view. Nowadays, the medical community often treats its enemy as diseases or even death itself, but the author reminds medical professionals that perhaps it would also be wise to humbly remember that no one has ever escaped death, and to consider caring for patients in such a way so as to prioritize the enhancing the quality of their remaining time rather than maximizing its length by offering treatments which bring short periods of suffering often not worth the additional suffering and anguish. As for the rest of us, we can become well-informed and make the most appropriate decisions regarding our options according to our own values and preferences.In this book you will find page after page of insight and wisdom amid heartbreaking tales. I am thankful for the revelations concerning my own mortality, and the mortality of those around me. I cannot recommend this book enough for everyone in the medical profession, especially doctors and nurses at the frontline fighting for the wellbeing of patients."

Some quotes:The chief ingredient of the [“good death”] myth is the longed-for ideal of “death with dignity.”I had read that the sensation imparted by a fibrillating heart is like holding is one’s palm a wet, jellylike bagful of hyperactive worms, and that is exactly the way it was. – p7Nowadays, very few of use actually witness the deaths of those we love. Not many people die at home anymore….approximately 80 percent of Americans who die in a hospital….An entire mythology has grown up around the process of dying. Like most mythologies, it is based on the inborn psychological need that all humankind shares. The mythologies of death are meant to combat fear on the one hand and its opposite—wishes—on the other. They are meant to serve us by disarming our terror about what the reality may be> While so many of us hope for a swift death or a death during sleep “so I won’t suffer,” we at the same time cling to an image of our final moments that combines grace with a sense of closure; we need to believe in a clear-minded process in which the summation of a life takes place—either that or a perfect lapse into agony-free unconsciousness. –p8It is this so-called terminal gasp phase that allows the aspiration of so much water that its absorption in a freshwater drowning may account for as much as 50 percent of the blood volume. – p161Drowning kills almost five thousand people in the United States each year, and alcohol is involved 40 percent of the time.

298,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33765699-lavinia,5,"Death in old age or as a result of the biological state can be as traumatic as murder or cholera. In this book, an experienced physician describes the mechanisms of some of the greatest killers in the first world: heart disease, senility, violence, AIDS, and cancer. At the end he touches on the relationship between physicians and their dying charges.The prose tends toward the purple, with many references to pedestrian classics, yet the physiological descriptions can be hard to follow. More charts would help, as would more direct writing, but ultimately the ""how"" is not as important as the ""why."" Nuland's theory of bodily failure (that it all comes down to hypoxia) is a simplification, but leaves a solid impression that these seemingly disparate causes of death really are linked. The AIDS passage is tragic and beautifully written, as are many of the anecdotes. However, like many old pop-science books, science marches on and it's impossible to read that passage without thinking of how far medicine has come: in the 2010s, advertisements for pre-exposure prophylaxis (branded Truvada) are common for this disease that was a terrifying scourge in the 1990s. Throughout the book, Nuland expresses some near-futurist hopes that disease after disease will be conquered while tempered by the reality that people will continue to die, and more agonizingly so if those hopes are misplaced."
299,0679742441,http://goodreads.com/user/show/320372-lenny-husen,5,"This is a depressing subject, and this book has its share of dismal images and yet has a profound beauty. A must read for any Medical Student, of special interest for Pathologists and Palliative Care Specialists, and anyone seeking an understanding of the physical events of Death for any reason.I learned a lot; this was a ""could not put down"" volume, and yet I was anxious to finish it and move on to something less somber (thinking of reading The Gulag Archipelago for some lighter fare). While the book is concerned with the Horsemen of Death (cancer, heart disease, strokes, septicemia, Alzheimer's), it is also as much about Nuland's life and those he cared for deeply that passed on as he observed the process as only a genius with a Photographic Memory can. It also has a significant amount of Medical History, even the history of when the book was written in 1993. In some ways (AIDS treatment for example), Medical Science has triumphed since the book was written 23 years ago. In others (Alzheimer's) we are no further along than we were then. What I didn't like: the author's Atheism in Agnostic Clothing. Belongs on the shelf with ""Being Mortal""by Atul Gawande, both equally great and disturbing."
