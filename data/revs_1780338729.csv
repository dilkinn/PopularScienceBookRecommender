0,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25642731-paul-r-fleischman,2,"	This book confuses an abstract existential truth with psychological reality. It has no originality, and is potentially destructive to suffering people or as literature for their psychotherapeutic guides. 	The main argument of this book is that the sense of self is an illusion. The entire volume is a polemic organized around this single point. Of course it is true that nothing in the universe is enduring and permanent, since even the universe is not. But Bruce Hood confuses the kind of thinking that led the Buddha to claim that human beings have no eternal enduring self (in contrast to religious claims of an enduring soul) with the importance and validity of the psychological self, which is just as real and important as our bodies. 	The idea that the self is predominantly a social construction, mirrored back to us as we develop through childhood, from parents, peers, and surrounding culture, is a long established truism in Western psychology. This idea was not entirely new in the 19th century when George Herbert Mead promoted it in many books and essays. Freudian thinking was also based upon the idea of a socially developed self that gained definition through reflection from others. Heinz Kohut made the importance of mirroring, and interpersonal development of the self, a hallmark of modern psychoanalytic thinking. “The Self Illusion” ignores these widely known and widely read precedents in order to claim an apparent break-through in psychology. 	Most of this book consists of anecdotes, social psychological experiments, and neuro-psychology to refute the straw-man hypothesis that the human self consists of an isolated, uniform entity. No one believes in such an entity. 	The importance of the psychological self to modern psychotherapists, and to each one of us as individuals, is that our existence requires a synthesizing, organizing, integrating, dynamic, responsive regulator of the multiple inputs that we receive. Instead of consisting of random responses, or externally controlled dependencies, every healthy human being contains a networked, interactionally complexified executive, that provides some coherence to personality, while permitting variability and situational responsiveness. Ironically, Bruce Hood provides some very fine writing on this very point. He talks about the sense of self as a “web,” a “culmination of the interaction of a multitude of hidden factors ranging from genetic inheritance, life experiences, current circumstances…patterns of neuronal activity in the brain…a matrix of distributed networks…” and he adds, “…The resulting sums of these complex interactions are the decisions and choices that I make.” He reminds us that the human being, “has complexity impossible to predict” and “almost infinite brain states.” As he accurately tells us, there is “no core self at the helm.” But there is in fact the integrating system he has so cogently defined. 	Much of this book consists of compounding evidence that this self is inconsistent, forgetful, subject to external influence, and otherwise non-uniform. None of these are logical arguments against the existence of the self. The evidence Bruce Hood brings to bear actually shows us what a richly endowed, porous, absorptive, responsive, and a subtle brew the self is. The fact that the United States is influenced by the economies of Mexico and the Euro zone is not evidence that the United States does not exist. The fact that the United States has politics that are conflictual and contradictory, does not mean that the United States does not exist.	The sense of self is as important to psychological health as the sense of embodied self is to maintaining physical health. The sense of self is built over layered platforms of biology, culture and situation, and is not fully controlled by, nor co-terminus with, any of its antecedents, because it is a complex emergent state of almost infinite interactions, with multiple origins, and graded peripheries. It is not eternal and enduring, but it is no more fictional than our temporary bodies, trees, books, or planet Earth, which is also impermanent. Our sense of self is not “Atta,” the eternal soul, so the Buddha taught we are “Anatta,” without an eternal soul, but our psychological self is a key attribute of our mental and physical health, personal well being, and social contribution, and can neither be discovered, nor dismissed by the black and white thinking, existence versus non-existence, to which Bruce Hood has subjected it. 	As a psychotherapist who spent a lifetime helping people realize an adaptive, flexible, rich, complex, nuanced, multi-layered, sense of self, I cannot recommend this simple and linear psychology book with its pretension to originality and its inability to discern motile realities.Reviewed by: Paul R.

1,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,3,"This book questions our notion of self and identity, arguing they are shaped far more by other people and environments than we care to admit. Not only that, it takes this notion further….. saying that myriad impulses in the brain are what really control us – impulses which operate in our unconscious or subconscious – rather than any “self” which seems to be in the driving seat. That ‘self’ is just the mouthpiece. A convenient construct that our brains have engineered to pull all the variables together into a cohesive whole.I am surprisingly unperturbed by all of this. I’ve had several experiences of the subconscious which make me amenable to the idea of a cacophony of inner voices – with only one voice reaching consciousness at any one time. The book suggests that we are under the impression that we think consciously, but our thinking is really done for us, before it reaches consciousness. It questions the notion of free will.The author also argues that we are hugely influenced by other people, and by the situations in which we find ourselves. Memories, ostensibly so important to us, can also be very misleading.The sum of these proposals? Our ideas of selfhood are misguided. The notion of “self” is an illusion.But, but, but, but…. I see such strong and individual personalities in the the people around me; even between siblings there are enormous differences. And in myself – mainly via my appalling weaknesses (all those broken new year’s resolutions!), I see a tenacity of ways of being that I am happy enough to call “self”. Self may not be perfect, but it’s good enough for me.This book was enjoyable though. I particularly liked the way it made me question environmental influences and social pressures (people pleasing). I think I had underestimated the influence of these things.The author quotes a lot of other people’s research projects, some of which are well known, but some of which were new to me, and I found interesting. Here are some of my favourite snips (not necessarily relevant to the discussion about self).(view spoiler)[
   For learning some things there are ‘critical periods’; windows of opportunity where we have to learn something, or we never learn it. Often this happens when we are young. That is why good nurturing in early childhood is so important.Brains account for 2% of body weight, but they use up to 20% of metabolic energy. It has been estimated that a chess grand-master can burn up to 6,000 to 7,000 calories during a game.We need our big brains in order to be sociable, in order to negotiate society, rather than just for intellectual reasons.Only about one in ten people can be hypnotized easily.Glucose is a vital fluid for the brain. Using will-power depletes glucose. A sugary drink will help restore it.Roy Baumeister found that by getting students to monitor and control their posture over two weeks, they were much better on experiments that measured self-control compared to those who lounged around.A concept of free will, whilst the author feels this is misguided, is nevertheless good for us. Those who believe in free will are usually able to give a much better performance than those who believe in fatalism and determinism. The latter undermine motivation.Humans have not evolved to consider facts based on large amounts of data. Rather we operate with heuristics – fast and dirty rules of thumb that generally serve us well.In the US social anxiety is the number one anxiety problem and the third most common mental disorder. It is an extreme version of what some actors experience before they go on stage. Caring about what other people think may be one of our strongest preoccupations as human animals.Attempts to integrate with other people, if they fail, can turn to anger and aggression. An analysis of those school boys who have gone on shooting sprees found that in thirteen out of fifteen cases, the perpetrators had been targets of ostracism.

These will generate a downward spiral into degradation. (He did the infamous Stanford Prison Experiment in 1971.)

We tend to remember highly emotional memories better – they are almost like a form of post traumatic stress disorder.

2,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13620950-mike,2,"Hood's thesis is that the self is an illusion, but what this means is not clear. He uses the analogy of a Kanizsa triangle to illustrate the idea that the ""self"" is carved out of the negative space created by social and cultural interactions. It's an interesting analogy but as far as I can tell it doesn't lead anywhere. If there's a better account of this concept somewhere please point me toward it - I'd love to have the dots connected if the connections are there to be made.The self is an illusion? As far as I can tell, this means one of several things:1) We don't have a subjective experience of the world or are not aware of our own existence. As best I can define a ""self"", it becomes a meaningful word when applied to an entity with self-awareness. Thus the self would be an illusion if we do not have subjective experience. This is my best attempt to translate into plain English. But it's nonsense, so, moving on.2) We don't have free will. I'm not sure how it relates to the notion of the self -- even if I don't have free will, I feel as if I do -- but to the extent that we define ourselves as creatures of will, the argument that free will does not exist may translate to the book's thesis. This would make a more interesting book, but doesn't seem to be what Hood means. The book spends a little time on free will, but fails to clearly draw the distinction between this and option 3.3) We have less than perfect control over our thoughts and actions. This is what the meat of the book actually supports. If this is what you mean by ""the self is an illusion"" then I guess I agree with your premise but disagree with your choice of words.But Hood doesn't really tell us what he means. The ""Kanizsa triangle"" analogy is whipped out at the last minute and presented as though it's the culmination of the entire book. There are interesting arguments to be had about the self as an illusion (let's start by defining our terms), but Hood doesn't go there.After discarding the philosophical angle, what's left is a shallow skim of virtually every psychological study that has ever suggested that we may not be 100% in control of our thoughts and actions at all times. And yeah, it's interesting stuff if you don't happen to be already familiar with it."

This book provides both scientific and experimental explanation of the ""self"" being an illusion and a mere reflection of it's context. It is empowering to have this insight, we can go through life with less attachment to the perceived core self and the need to prove it. Consequently living with more self discipline,mind clarity,success and happiness."
4,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19707263-sinduja-ragunathan,3,"Bruce Hood gives us a crash course of sorts on all major aspects of the psychology of the mind. His writing is easy to read and keeps one engrossed. However, he has simply woven together different studies and research findings with few inputs of his own. This book is a more interesting version of a psychology textbook. Any reader who is already familiar with the major theories of psychology will be familiar with most of the content in this book. The answer to the main question of why the self is an illusion has been narrated with examples of research. Rather, he could have provided more inputs of his own for this issue. Also, too many aspects of the science of the mind have been covered such that the reader feels like he is only taking quick stops at different points without getting a chance to analyze a few things in-depth.To conclude, if you are fascinated by the mind and psychology and are new to concepts involving both, this book will help you get a glimpse of the main areas. But if you want a detailed and profound discussion on anything, this book only provides with little hints to piece together the discussion yourself."
5,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/906247-jean,2,"I was hoping for something new, but didn't find it. The same old studies and the same old stories - the marshmallow study of emotional intelligence, the stories of brain injuries and illnesses and how they affect people - I've read them all. The very first part about how our brains work was mildly interesting, but soon the author got into the same old rut. Male vs. female, Konrad Lorenz and ""imprinting"" on baby ducklings, primacy and recency, false memories, cognitive dissonance - nothing new here. Don't waste your time."
6,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9599138-mark,1,"This book ought to be titled 'The self illusion illusion' as it's an illusion that Hood has addressed the issue of the self illusion.This is such a disappointing book, considering the potential of the subject matter. I hoped for a detailed exposition on 'why there is no you inside your head' (the book subtitle). Maybe some neuroscientific perspective necessarily spliced with the appropriate philosophy, whether its Parfit's, Hume's or even Buddha's view on the absence of a self. What I got was a load of very basic science stories and some unlettered philosophy. The book basically consists of anecdotes, generally about babies (and most of these anecdotes you would have seen better expounded by other popular science authors), disjointedly hoping to show that there is no single, enduring self. This is a LONG WAY from establishing that the self does not exist and that there is no 'you' inside your head. Examination of the self has traditionally been a philosophical issue but there's little philosophy here and where it exists it's incredibly elementary. Hood has missed the chance to engage with the existing philosophy and reconcile it with the current neuroscience and cognitive science. It's true that the anecdotes occasionally mention some philosophical names (much to my ephemeral delight), but they are ultimately nothing more than a name drop before he proceeds to the next disjointed anecdote.Don't waste your time or money unless you want some very fluffy scientific stories about babies."
7,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5136053-marc-nash,3,"The last chapter summarises the whole book in such a clear and concise way, you almost don't have to read all the preceding chapters and you'll still be able to see the argument. The preceding chapters have lots of scientific and anecdotal vignettes, but I feel they are never tied in to the overall argument.As to the argument itself, I started from a basic shared position with the author that the notion of self or ego is nothing but an illusion, but I found his arguments for that unconvincing. He posits that because we gain experience and knowledge through the social transmission as children, plus as adults we show different sides of ourselves in different social situations, therefore our sense of self is entirely constructed through social means and reflecting others around us. I don't buy that at all, yes others can partly shape our sense of self, but they do not determine it entirely. And the contribution of language as both a unique form of self-expression and yet also an illusory way of encountering and explaining the world and our position in it, only merited a brief treatment within the first chapter. Real/unreal or illusion are first and foremost verbal constructs that need defining."
8,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38586129-sarah-black,4,"Self Illusion?This book was confusing, yet very educating. I've learnt a lot from this book. I learnt that we have more than one blind spot in our eyes, they're actually the size of lemons. What people say to you, even if it is only online affects you and makes you feel vulnerable. We have many parts to ourselves, scientists believe we are not our only selves, we are made up of ""l"", ""me"", ""my"", ""mine"", ""your"", ""our"" and ""us"".I actually ended up liking this more than I thought I would. "
9,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73029907-cav,4,"This was a decent book. My second from author Bruce Hood, after his 2009 book SuperSense: Why We Believe in the Unbelievable.I must admit that I liked that one much more than this one, unfortunately...The writing and contents of this book never met the high water mark he established in ""Supersense"", to my disappointment.""The Self Illusion"" is a cursory trek through psychology and social psychology. Hood covers most of the bases here; the neuroanatomy of the brain, facial recognition, social and anti-social behavior, Milgram's experiments, Witman's tumor, free will, left-brain/right-brain splits, the Big Five personality traits, and many more.The writing here was decent. Although this book is right up my alley, I sadly didn't find anything new in here that I had not previously read about in multiple other books. This is my biggest criticism of this book.So, my recommendation would depend on your level of literacy on these topics. If you've heard everything I listed above before, then you probably won't find too much new or interesting in these pages. For those not too familiar with psychology or social psychology, this book would make a great primer.3.5 stars."
10,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1571969-billie-pritchett,4,"I read popular science constantly, so I was largely familiar with the psychological and neurophysiological examples that Bruce Hood gave in his book The Self Illusion, yet I had never thought about these examples in the way that Hood has. Hood has provided a beautiful synthesis of (some) familiar examples in the psychological literature to argue that the idea that human beings have a sense of self is an illusion. He writes that this of course does not mean that it ""does not exist."" By way of analogy, one common illusion that human beings have is that we see everything there is to be seen in our visual field. Strictly speaking, this isn't true. We have a blind spot, which was an area in our eye which literally allows us to see nothing. But what vision does for us is it interprets whatever would have been in the blind spot as similar enough to whatever is next to it, similar enough in shape and color. And so we never realize that there is nothing there that we're not seeing because our mind and visual system has filled in the gap. So, that we see everything in our visual field is a pervasive illusion, but of course that does not mean that it isn't real or mere fantasy.Hood argues that like this blind spot, this illusion of self is an illusion we live by. For instance, I bet now, right now while you're reading this, you are probably experience a sense of self. If I were to ask you to point to where you feel like ""You"" are in your body, I could take a good guess about where you'd point: probably to your forehead, somewhere there, in between your eyes. But of course there is no ""You"" there. This is an illusion, generated by your brain, that tells you that a Little Man or Little Woman sits up there and controls your body's actions. It is kind of mind-blowing when you realize that this sense of self isn't true. And far from being disheartening, it seems to me actually enlivening. It's a reminder that this sense of ego that we have is just a way that human bodies have adapted to process information and interact with other people and the environment. When people realize that this is a kind of fabrication, a necessary illusion we must live with, perhaps we could do a better job getting over ourselves and thinking the Little Man or Little Woman in our noggin is so important."
11,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1015304-frank-jude,3,"I really wish I could have given this book at least four stars... and in fact, if you are someone who hasn't been keeping up with more recent cognitive and neuro-science, I can give a four-star recommendation for this book. But for myself, I found both what I consider an excessive number of typos and a writing style that at times felt a bit formulaic, and so can honestly say I only ""liked this book.""What I like most is that the book offers an investigation and deconstruction of the ""self illusion"" from the socially constructed side. There are many books that detail how the sense of self is created from the neuronal level up (for instance, the work of Antonio D'Amasio is excellent for this) but this book takes the approach from the macro-side: how even the barest sense of individual subjectivity must and does arise from the mirroring we receive from others. As the influential zen poem, ""Trust in Mind"" puts it: ""subject is subject because of object; object is object because of subject.""In our culture, which hypervalorizes individuality, we are taught to be blinded by just how our sense of self is constructed by our social relations. In fact, when politicians like Pres. Obama point out that successful bushiness people have built their success upon myriad causes and conditions such as other workers, infrastructure provided by the state etc. they are criticized as being ""anti-business!"" So, an important addition to the library of anyone interested in the science of consciousness as well as yoigis -- buddhist students in particular may find an entry into the buddha's teaching of anatta or ""not-self"" here."

13,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19428451-thomas,2,Very basic introduction to the material.I would have loved to see this book reduced by about two hundred pages and just get to the point.
14,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12174361-krishna,4,"Imagine a conference room. As we enter we see a motley crowd of individuals sitting around the table either alone or in small groups of twos and threes talking quietly to each other. A few messengers walk in and out carrying snippets of information from the outside world -- things heard and seen, gossip from the streets. All is quiet at the moment, but pandemonium can break out at any time. A messenger rushes in with some news, and suddenly the groups are galvanized into action. People shout across the table, push and pull at each other, scream in anger or fear. Some rush around the table tearing at their hair and clothes, and screaming at the top of their voice. Others form coalitions and struggle to control the more violent ones. And then a moment later, all is quiet again. As you spend more time in the room, you begin to notice particular individuals. There is the bleary-eyed, disheveled junkie at the bottom of the table, his arms wrapped around himself and rocking back and forth and mumbling quietly. There is the wild-eyed Cassandra, just a step short of panic, ready to fight or fly from danger. There is the green-eye-shaded accountant, disengaged from everyone else, coolly tabulating a list of numbers. The office flirt is walking around hitting on anyone who will give her a chance. There is the linguist at the window, chanting blank verse. There is no one in charge though, and whoever at any moment can shout the loudest, or put together the strongest coalition wins the day. But groups form and dissolve momentarily, and no one has the upper hand for very long. This is the picture of the brain that Bruce Hood paints in the Self Illusion. According to him, the brain is composed of fluidly interacting modules and sub-routines, more or less specializing in particular tasks, that are activated in response to external stimuli. It is a densely interconnected system of parts, with highly complex and indeterminate combinations. There is no essential ""self"" controlling this activity. Rather, what we perceive as the ""self"" is merely a post facto rationalization of the choices made by the interacting modules in the brain. The parts of the brain that regulate the specific functions include the supplementary motor area that controls movements, the Pre Frontal Cortex (PFC) that regulates decision-making, the anterior insula that helps discriminate between self and others, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) responsible for anxiety and the brain's ""alarm system,"" the amygdala that processes emotions, the caudate nucleus (CN) that initiates intentional actions, etc. Malfunctions of modules or connections between modules result in abnormal behaviors, such as Tourette's syndrome (uncontrollable tics and swearing), Cotard's syndrome (belief that the self is dead); autism (mind blindness); total absence of short term memory; obsessions and compulsions, and so on. Sometimes it is imbalance in activity between regions that causes specific behaviors: one current theory says that imbalance between the PFC, the ACC and the CN causes conditions such as Obsessive and Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The structure itself is formed as a result of environmental interactions. The strength of modules is not based on how big they are or how many neurons they have, but on how densely they are interconnected with other parts of the brain. The number of connections a part has is the outcome of early childhood experiences. In the developing infant brain, each neuron forms a huge number of axial connections with other neurons, but simultaneously cuts back these connections in a process called pruning. If two neurons do not fire together, their connection may be pruned back. This indicates how important sensory stimulation is in early childhood. Sense-deprived infants may not develop specific brain capabilities, because axial connections are not formed or are pruned back due to disuse. Feral children who miss the language window may not acquire linguistic abilities later in life, however well they are trained. Hood also extensively discusses social determinants of our brain processes. As evidenced by phenomena such as hypnosis, crowd psychology, social norms and deference to authority, we as members of a social species are uniquely suggestible and subject to peer pressure. Thus, what we think of as ""free will"" is really the outcome of brain processes we do not consciously comprehend, as conditioned by our social networks and culture. Hood's thesis of a fragmentary brain helps explain why some persons display inexplicable behaviors: why rich and famous movie stars should shoplift or solicit prostitutes, why an otherwise thoughtful and wise legislator should send pictures of his penis to women, why a billionaire daredevil should also be a germophobe, or why a monstrous dictator who sent millions to the gas chambers should also be a vegetarian and pet lover. It also explains our own behaviors, why we who manage entire work teams with confidence and wisdom should be driven up the wall by a spouse's casual criticism. In each interaction and social situation, different modules are activated and their complex and unpredictable interactions give rise to our emotional and behavioral responses. Advocates of a coherent, rational and semi-permanent self will be hard pressed to explain these multiple personalities. This book is written in a style accessible to the layperson, but it is backed by extensive research with over 50 pages of notes and close to 500 citations to peer reviewed literature. Some of this research is conducted by the author himself - Hood is an experimental psychologist whose specialty is developmental neuroscience (early childhood)."

Some times the author missed the main story by talking about less relevant topics. Although it's evitable to describe self as a concept by considering surrounding aspects. It seems author does not expert in technology and social network but he had to describe the new virtual self in virtual life.
16,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33677264-nick-traynor,4,"I think there were two separate theses in this book that the author tried to roll into one: the illusion of our subjective conscious experience and the impact of context and other people on sense of identity. I would have liked a deeper exploration of the first issue, with its attendant philosophical implications, but I did enjoy a review of the social psychological research into the latter. It was good to be updated on this field since when I studied psychology and the research, stories and anecdotes were enlightening and entertaining. It reaffirmed my view that psychology has taken up where philosophy left off, and that it provides a more insightful and pleasingly empirical analysis of the human experience."
17,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4643358-dimitris-hall,3,"Found out about this book from the 
You Are Not So Smart
 podcast and read it on my Kindle.It reeked of a mechanistic, sterile, matter-of-fact ""you are your brain"" worldview which I must admit I'm tired of and find boring, but I should have expected as much since You Are Not So Smart comes from pretty much the same mental place.I don't find fault with the idea that we don't have an integral self; obviously, just like Bruce Hood thoroughly and with rich supporting bibliography demonstrates in this book, we're largely shaped and influenced by our surroundings, our society and our biological limitations, first and foremost those of our brain. But that doesn't mean that the notion of self is an illusion; rather, it means that the self is not a constant and that it is mutable. In fact, in which case would the self not be an illusion? When would we be in a position to say that the self is a real, concrete, quantifiable thing?It seems to me that Mr. Hood's proposition could have just as easily been called ""The Soul Illusion"", for his assumption of what a self looks like--or should feel like--closely corresponds to our, for better or worse, highly intuitive notion of what a soul is: an immaterial cohesive agent between all of our experiences, thoughts and actions that creates a feeling of identity. In other words, the definition of the ""me"" in ""I am me"". But is that what the self is, what it should be or all it can be? Is it possible to define what our selves are differently? In ""I am me"", who would be the ""I""? Who is the consciousness, like Eckhart Tolle would comment with his ultra-calm voice? Who is it--what is it--that reads this book and goes ""huh, so I'm an illusion""? You might argue that the sense of self and consciousness are two separate things in order to question my qualms with the central point of the book; ""precisely!"", I'd exclaim then, happy that you could intuitively grasp my point.All that said, I'm giving The Self Illusion three stars instead of two because I must admit that it is well-researched, well-written and has plenty of interesting case studies of various psychological and psychiatrical disorders, ""nature vs nurture"", sociological phenomena etc that do a good job of proving that the concept of self, or at least what Mr. Hood understands it to be, is an illusion insofar as it's highly unpredictable and dependent on environmental and social factors. I particularly enjoyed reading about babies and how their brains develop and about conditions such as Tourette's and how miming, laughing and facial expressions work in socialising and the development thereof. All this is interesting and rich from a clinical perspective, so it's worth reading if you're out to come closer to understanding how the human brain works--a task I personally believe to be impossible anyway. But if you're not convinced that the brain is responsible for every little thing a person does, thinks, or thinks of doing, in view of the evidence that, contrary to what Mr. Hood quite often and emphatically repeats in the book, does exist, this book will provide little insight."
18,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7198893-jonathan-karmel,4,"The book Consciousness Explained, by Dan Dennett, set out the theory that there is no “self” directing what a person does. Your brain is the product of genetics and your environment, and it produces sensations, thoughts, and feelings, but the belief that there is a separate “you” that controls what your brain does is an illusion. Like every other aspect of human development, the emergence of the self is epigenetic – an interaction of the genes in the environment. The self emerges out of that journey through the epigenetic landscape, combining the legacy of your genetic inheritance with the influence of the early environment.This book is very similar to Waking Up, by Sam Harris and Why Buddhism is True, by Robert Wright. Sam Harris connects Dennett’s work to the Tibetan Buddhist teachings of Dzogchen, and Robert Wright connects Dennett’s work to the Buddhist concept of anatta (non-existence of one’s self). This book is relating Dennett’s work to findings of social psychologists and behavioral economists such as Daniel Kahneman and Dan Ariely.It is not the case that your self is an essential entity at the core of your existence that holds steady throughout your life. There is no “you” behind your eyeballs (or anywhere else) orchestrating your identity. If you think there’s a “you” inside your head, who is directing the you? If your answer is “nothing,” you are of the mistaken belief that there is a “ghost in the machine.” The concept that you are exercising “free will” is undermined by the fact that the “readiness potential” in your brain can be measured before you take action; in other words, your brain is telling you what to do, not the other way around.Over the course of your life, you have many different “selves.” You change over time, you act differently in different situations and with different people. Your nature is different when you are asleep, “under the influence,” or hypnotized. What makes you laugh? Are the thoughts inside your head “you” or the thoughts you express; what if you have Tourette’s? Your willpower often fails, and you often act impulsively – so who are you, the one attempting to exercise will, or the one acting impulsively? Is the addicted you the self, or is it the one trying to fight the addiction? The insanity defense is based on the concept that the crime wasn’t committed by the person’s “self,” but why not? Why do we act superstitious, even though we tell ourselves that we don’t believe the superstitions? Why are we unable to control obsessive-compulsions that we would prefer not to have? Usually, your left brain and right brain work together, but people who do not have a working corpus collosum have two separate selves, a left brain that controls their right side and a right brain that controls their left side. Do you want your fantasies to be true or not; do you know what your “self” wants? People live entirely different lives on the internet from “real life,” but which is the person’s actual “self”? If you “pretend” to be a certain way to get “likes” and “followers,” why is the “pretend” you not the real you?Your concept of yourself is greatly shaped by your beliefs about how others perceive you. Charles Horton Cooley explained that your identity is the result of seeing yourself the way that others see you (the looking-glass self). Humans generally act based on their beliefs about what others are thinking, and adolescents are especially influenced by what they believe others are thinking about them. Our beliefs about our “self” are often based on our status or based on the possessions that we own rather than anything inside ourselves. We often act as conformists who have a herd mentality or a hive mind and do not want to feel excluded, and the way we would act if we didn’t care what others thought would be completely different. People are influenced by their culture to the extent that “normal” people can easily be convinced to act in an “evil” way; this is the “banality of evil.”You are a product of your genes, your physical form, and your experiences. People with very deprived childhoods (e.g. the orphans of communist Rumania or people raised without vision or without human contact) are permanently and irrevocably affected. You have bundles of sensations, perceptions, thoughts, and then you construct a narrative to make sense of it. Mirror neurons make you feel other people’s pain, and yawning or vomiting can be contagious. Like Neo in the movie The Matrix, you have no direct connection to reality; you just know what your brain tells you. In a sense, we are our memories, but you experience so many sensations that it would be hard to remember anything if you didn’t have a “self” concept to help you figure out what information was relevant to you. Babies, who have not yet developed a “self” concept, do not form long-term memories, because they cannot integrate memories into meaningful stories. To have meaning, memories must be embedded within a “self.” Your memories are also inaccurate and subject to manipulation by others. Your conscious mind is a spin-doctor, not a commander in chief; it weaves a coherent narrative from your thoughts even when your thoughts create cognitive dissonance between your beliefs and new information. We rationalize when information does not fit existing beliefs or we repress or “forget” inconvenient truths.Authors such as Daniel Kahneman and Dan Ariely have explained the many cognitive biases that humans have, and that humans are predictably irrational. Our idea of our self is also based on these same biases and irrational beliefs.Interestingly, the author of this book believes that we should continue to believe the self illusion, not that we should accept reality. The self illusion serves a useful purpose. If you think about the “I” and the “me” that we usually refer to as the self, it provides a focal point to hang experiences together both in the immediate here and now, as well as to join those events over a lifetime. Experiences are fragmented episodes unless they are woven together in a meaningful narrative. The self illusion depends on a lifetime of memories that are constructed as we interpret the world. That interpretation is guided by mechanisms that seek out certain information in the world but also by those around us who help us to make sense of it all. In this way, we are continually shaped by those around us. We also treat others as individual selves. It is faster, more economical, and more efficient to treat others as a self rather than as a collection of brain activities. Just because something doesn’t really exist doesn’t mean that believing that it does is pointless. Fantasy doesn’t really exist but the world would be a much more impoverished place without storytelling. Those who reject the notion of a self in control of destiny, lead sadder, less satisfying lives. Those who embrace the self illusion feel fulfilled and purposeful.I thought this was an interesting book that will change my concept of my “self.”"

As long as the author writes about simple studies he tends to keep it scientific. A lot of well-known studies, most of us already have heard about, are introduced here. I always support people who present real science to the masses.Con:Unfortunately there is some lousy social science in this book too. We can't seem to avoid it. As I keep saying, 9/10 of social science books have these crappy outdated assumptions. The blank slate assumption rears its ugly head again and again even though no good social scientist really ought to believe in such silliness. And of course he uses correlations to prove causations several times over, but only when he tries to prove some blank slate hypothesis. That's horrible social science I really do not expect in a book about such a serious topic. But mostly it's explaining without assuming.Another bad thing here is that he doesn't seem to clearly explain why he is talking about this or that study at any one point. The studies are interesting, but his points are not made clear in large parts of the book. For example, he seems to at times say that the no-self theory depends on there being some blank slate. This makes no logical sense to me at all. He never really explains his thinking on this issue and I'm not sure if he believes in some black slate and therefore assumes it must mean something or if he just got lost in some other line of thinking.Conclusion:I don't believe that the self exists. I do think people should know that the self doesn't seem to exist and seems to be an illusion. No one has ever proven it exists or presented a valid self-theory. But this is not a book I could recommend to readers even though 90% of it is fine enough. If you read it it's not a bad thing. But unless you can think very critically about social science you will be tricked by some correlation proves causation thinking.Edit:The year is 2020. I still to this day recommend this book to readers who don't understand how the mind works. Just saying. I highly recommend this book. I will be rereading it because I feel like my review overlooked some good things in the book."

That was revolutionary. One of those rare best of the best ""aha! here's how that works!"" moments.This book explains it a bit more, for example, that ""self"" (as ""daemon"" or ""server"", just though off this definition) is ""switching"" to ""another"" (relatively, as probably there are no such clear boundaries) daemon depending on social environment, e.g. ""me"" basically is what others think about ""me"".I'm regretting I didn't choose to be a scientist as from my own intuition (and some psychedelics understanding) I was saying years ago that ""we"" don't exist, it is just reactions to to environment. Likewise if we had removed the body, there would be no emotions, no sensory input and as a consequence - no ""self"". (Like probably I had already mentioned with many misses in Sci-Fi where authors think that AI would have ""emotions"" like humans do).From that understanding came several practical things, which those books didn't mention, but I had realized. For example, IF ""self"" demon depends on sensory input, AND main purpose of a replicator is to survive, THEN any statism is ""death"" for ""self"" and dynamism is ""life"". Life is basically a motion. Move and you'll never experience unprofitable emotions for the ""self"". It works in an instant. Conversely, people who form static habits (the ""walking dead"") can't experience life in full and come into various mental problems.Maybe it's all about the most powerful daemon, but I'm not sure, probably not (not what you can read in books about ""will power"", something different and that interests me), as several times I was thinking ""something changed, I can't get what, I just woke up, probably I had traveled to parallel universe, as I remember Obama wasn't elected, where are my kids and lover gone, where I am..."", haha."
21,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5204364-ralph-jacob,3,"Hood does his best to demonstrate the book's central thesis without (over-)overwhelming those uninitiated into the convoluted realm that is neuro-psychology. The self is evidenced to not actually be the autonomously singular entity we all like to believe it is. Rather it is an emergent sum of various brain processes we do not control nor consciously know of. These processes, in turn, are heavily influenced by both nature and nurture--again, factors we have very little control over.Where this whole anecdote-laden cerebral adventure fails me is in cohesion in explaining how this leaves our existence with any real sense and purpose. Hood comes up with centuries' worth of irrefutable proof to show that we have very little to no free-will, that most of our decisions happen in a place we do not control, but that we need to believe in an illusion anyway because it's this illusion of the in-control self which has kept our species surviving through millenia. And while I get the message, it all begs asking the question: Are we then left to just submit to the idea that we are forever at the mercy of this tug-of- war between neuro-network activations? The book does askthis question a number of times but never really answers it.The problem with cohesion may actually say more about the book's publisher than the author himself, but my problem with the book's central proposal (or lack thereof) is likely telling of its intention to be a strictly psychological commentary and never a philosophical one.This still shouldn't undermine the enlightenment (even the awakening) the book offers on the nature of our 'neurally imagined' selves, but what then to do with this new knowledge is an entirely different matter better explored in movies like The Matrix."
22,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34564183-culadasa-yates,4,"Most of us believe that we have an independent, coherent self – an individual inside our head who thinks, watches, wonders, dreams, and makes plans for the future. This sense of our self may seem incredibly real, but a wealth of scientific evidence reveals that it is not what it seems – it is all an illusion.Hood tracks how the self emerges during childhood, during which time we not only learn from others, but learn to become like others. We learn to create a self, and, more importantly, to become different selves in different situations. The self is not one, but many. And no one of these selves is static or stable, but is in a fluid process of constant revision. Each self is constructed anew every time it gets resurrected, never quite the same from one time to the next. Not only is the self constructed rather than being something intrinsic or inherent, but the form it takes in the moment is largely determined by the behavior and attitudes of those around us. We don’t even choose the self we become, it is constructed in reaction to others. Hood does not deny our uniqueness or individuality, but points out that we exaggerate it in our own minds – we are far more alike than we prefer to believe.This is a useful primer for understanding intellectually how the doctrine of no-self can be true, although it does not address the deeper questions of, “if not this, then what?” and “how will knowing this make me happier?” But delusion must first be dispelled before it can be replaced by the wisdom that answers these questions."
23,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10487877-jeremy-hankins,2,"This book is much less about the self and how it's generated than it is about the tricks our minds play on us. As an argument for why we should not trust our intuitions about the nature of the self the book is solid, but there's little here to justify the author's conclusion: that since our intuitions aren't right about the self it's actually an illusion. Nor does he do much to justify his claim that the self is socially generated (a claim I'm generally inclined to agree with) other than give a laundry list of ways in which social interaction is important for development.Hood mentions the complex philosophical debates on the nature of the self but he doesn't do justice to even the well-known arguments on the subject. This is understandable, since he's neurologist not a philosopher, but it is a serious weakness in the stated goal of the book.It would have improved the book to leave out chapter 8, on the impact of the internet on the development of the self. It was mostly hand-waving and angst, worrying that the internet could have negative consequences for society without any concrete dangers or suggestions.Despite these shortcomings, the experimental evidence he covers that cast our reflective notions of self-hood into doubt are important and make salutary reading. This is an age that could use some serious examination of the nature of the self, and while this book doesn't live up to its title, it is a good start."
24,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/985119-dana-larose,3,"Really interesting book on the self and mind. The hypothesis is that what we feel as ""self"" (Ie., the thing you are referring to when you talk about ""I"" or ""me"") is an illusion arising from your brain arranging all the data it receives into a coherent narrative. Much like the way we feel like we are seeing a continuous, coherent picture of the world with via our eyes but our vision is really a kludgy, imperfect (but sufficiently accurate) model of what's out there. (You can see that when you look at any number of optical illusions)The author takes a very materialistic stance. He doesn't shies away from saying souls don't exist but dismisses the notion that there is some inner me living inside our meatsacks (so to speak). So he doesn't really deny the existence of a self, just that the self is coherent thing that exists separate from the body. There are lots of neat anecdotes from neuroscience and psychology experiments but over all it didn't feel like he was really making his cases. Or maybe I'm just a lazy reader. But it felt like, ""Here are a lot of neat factoids, you figure out how this fits in my thesis"". Lots of pop culture references too. I think I would have liked a more technical book and definitely this needs a ""further reading"" section.But quite recommended if you are interested in the mind. "
25,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22127141-rhys,3,"I enjoyed this almost as much as Kahneman's Thinking. Fast and Slow, or Miller's The Mating Mind or Louise Barret's Beyond the Brain. Hood explores what it is that we think to be the Self.A telling comment of the book was: ""Note how this leaves us with a glaring paradox – without a sense of self, memories have no meaning, and yet the self is a product of our memories"" (p.83). The Self is comprised of self-organizing neurons creating pattern-seeking structures called the brain. This organ ""protects us from the true nature of the situation. Maybe this is why we do not see the cognitive illusions that create the self. Cognitive dissonance protects us from ruminating over failed goals, positive biases keep us motivated, free will gives us grounds for praise and blame, decision-making gives us the illusion of control"" (p.295).What I would like to read, I think, is some sort of explanation of why it seems that the result of our creation of a Self automatically creates the feeling of separation from our environment (and from each other) - why we feel inside our Self even when our Self is the creation of what is outside of us, of what we mirror. Very curious.And I wonder what an 'environmentalist' is as it relates to the Self? Nonetheless, this book was well written, relating much of what recent research is telling us about us."
26,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1092991-danielle,3,"This book provides a rather exhaustive look at who we are, how we form our identities and our actions, and how our brain works. He delves into lots of psychological research, most of which any psychology student is intimately familiar with already. Though it provides a lot of information, there are a number of other better books out there on similar subjects. It seemed more like a textbook throwing out information on study after study as opposed to connecting it well in a larger narrative. I also took issue with the end of the book where he discusses the influence of more recent things like social networking and their influences on people, but without any actual research to back up anything he is saying. The entire rest of the book he provides study after study to back up his assertions and then all of a sudden he throws this out there with no real research behind it. Instead it's just the speculation you see in all kinds of newspaper and magazine articles with no real hard science to back it. If you can't get enough of reading stuff like this then it's not a horrible book, but there are better books out there if you know nothing on the subject and if you do know something about the subject you're not going to find anything new here."
27,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8990718-the-book,4,"Very interesting book - there are so many examples of theories and studies in here, from looking at how the young brain is hardwired to develop in specific ways at certain ages, to how we construct our selves, to examples of brain-damaged people who can't recognise themselves in the mirror, or form new memories, or use both right and left hemispheres of the brain because they've had surgery to sever the connecting pathways. I love finding out how people/minds work, and this book was full of thought-provoking theories. I'm not sure I buy into all of them just yet, because I do personally believe in a soul that exists independently of the physical brain (and I'm not ready to relinquish my concept of self!) but I thoroughly enjoyed reading.

28,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5367041-will,4,"Although Bruce Hood only mentions the Buddha in passing, his book provides a good explanation of anatta, or no self, the doctrine that underpins Buddhist teaching. Hood is a developmental cognitive neuroscientist and he explains how the brain can create the illusion of a self in control through experiences the body has with its environment. He stresses that this is a necessary illusion which has evolved to permit the organization of data from experience without overloading the brain's response mechanisms. We are fortunate to have a self for it allows us to remember, form goals and relate to others, so long as we realize that it is a creation of the brain and not evidence for an eternal soul. Highly recommended."

The publisher should've assigned a better proof reader. Also, though well written (grammar and typos aside), I found the central thesis of the self as an illusion got lost between chapters. In other words, a summation of what evidence has been gathered from chapter to chapter would've helped tie it all together better. Perhaps this too is an issue with the publisher. Having said all that, I still enjoyed the book and I understand better how the self is is formed and how the illusion comes to be. I will definitely look for more books written about this topic."

The reader isn't lead along to the authors way of thinking. The chapters are more or less just a collection of behavioral studies and the results of those studies. Some of the studies mentioned contains some fascinating stuff, but the author doesn't really make much of his case. Also, the last two chapters of the book spend way to much time explaining, the Internet, the World Wide Web, Facebook, and Twitter. They felt like an add-on after the fact in order to fatten up the page numbers. I did enjoy reading it, but I don't think that this book will really convince anyone who isn't already entertaining the idea of the illusion of a self. "

Hood warns us against seeing through the illusion, which is the direct opposite of the advice from Eastern gurus. Can we operate without a self? To the proofreaders: OMG. Some of the typos and omissions are so bad that they completely negate the intended point, e.g. leaving out or adding ""not."" Exponential notation is a foreign concept. Very distracting."

38,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15394714-luiz,4,"I first heard of Bruce Hood from Maria Poppova, on a brainpickings post, almost a year ago. This was right before going on my second trip to India. In this article, Poppova presented many interesting ideas from this author and recommended The Self Illusion for those interested in understanding the self as an entity derived from a biological phenomenon that is the mind. An electrical fish creates electrical waves to avert predators, we primates use the electrical discharges of our neurological system to create our spirit and thus our self. This idea, despite simple, was very striking on me. I immediately ordered the book, but since it would be shipped from overseas it didn’t make till left to India. Given the impossibility of bringing the book on my trip, I decided to buy other publication available in the local market. Then I stumbled upon to his other book SuperSense which argues how we tend to trick ourselves turning the unbelievable into believable. This reading couldn’t be more appropriate while having a “spiritual” trip through the Indian subcontinent. Religion is undeniable powerful and it take advantages on people’s incapability to accept that their ego is as perishable as their body. People need to believe that through religious transcendence, magic is plausible and death is not a definite event. It is an important social manifestation since it can calm the spirit from its anxieties regarding its origins and its ends. Religion works to split the material phenomena which is the body from its electrical phenomena from where comes the mind, therefore it can trick the ego when it faces despair and death. Hood maintain that everyone is born with a tendency to have this ""Super Sense"" and social institutions, such as religion, profits on that. I still think that any religion mythology is a rich source of insights for human psyche and for how it dealt since our even our ignorant and “enlightened” society still lacks for peace of the soul like the first Neandhertal did. Consequently, it helped me to better understand the spiritual experiences I had not only in this trip but also with my later Ayhuasca experience. Where my divine experience was realizing that there is a much bigger force than me and that I am just a machine as full of grace, blood, meat and bones that will stay alive during an amount of time impossible to totally grasp the origins its origins even with all the clear evidences of the absence of magic and super creator. Besides, the topics discussed are all a vanguard on neuroscience the text is very well written and fluid, making the reading experience more interesting. With this in mind, I started reading the Self Illusion three weeks ago. The book was very helpful to better understand the dynamics that ego creates to justify itSELF and how we are tricked to believe that we transcend our body. Like his previous books, Hood present empirical evidence based on common sense life events of and the last brain science discoveries supported by philosophers (such as Daniel Dennet) and cognitive psychologists (Pinker and Kahnemann).He asserts that THE SELF is not programmed to identify itself. That's why many animals from Birds to Dogs or even we, when little, take some time to understand what is our reflection on mirrors. He also argues about the window of opportunity of brain development, such as a chick is programed to identify its mom to follow to and from to the nest. Identically in the Super Sense, Bruce Hood argues again how babes when born don't have a clear sight, they just want to absorbe as much information as possible, they don't know exactly the shapes of heads of their moms just like chicks don't know who to follow, despite knowing they have to follow. Therefore, the evidence would suggest that like for Noam Chosmky we have built-in traits genetically evolved and inherited to identify the sources of security to better deal with natural selection imposed by the environment. An illusion is not what it seems and for most of us, we consider our self as some essential core of who we are. For example, most us think that we see the world continuously throughout the waking day when in fact we only see a fraction of the world in front of us, and because the brain blanks out our visual experience every time we move our eyes in a process called saccadic suppression, we are effectively blind for at least 2 hrs of the day. Although the brain is just a loom of electric neurons and contradictory impulses, the self makes us whole how the singularity of the self emerges from the cacophony of mind and the mess of social life	he self – this entity at the center of our personal universe – is actually just a story, a “constructed narrative”.Our brains think in stories. The same is true for the self and I use a distinction that William James drew between the self as “I” and “me.” Our consciousness of the self in the here and now is the “I” and most of the time, we experience this as being an integrated and coherent individual – a bit like the character in the story. The self which we tell others about, is autobiographical or the “me”. The neuroscience supports the claim that self is constructed readily confabulate an explanation to reconcile information unconsciously processed with information that was conscious Ramachandran describes patients who are paralyzed but deny they have a problem. These are all extreme clinical cases but the same is true of normal people. Nietzsche said it first: “My hypothesis is the subject as multiplicity,” we really just a collection of “splinters and mosaics”. We have no direct contact with reality because everything we experience is an abstracted version of reality that has been through the processing machinery of our brains to produce experience. If the human condition it is not materialist, then an alternative good explanation must be non-materialist. Show me good evidence for souls and spirits and then I will be forced to change my view about how plausible is the hypothesis on how supernatural entities can inhabit our bodies. In contrast, we know that if you alter the physical state of the brain through a head injury, dementia or drugs, each of these changes our self and, thus, easily to promote the necessary delusions to make god possible.Nietzsche said it first: “My hypothesis is the subject as multiplicity,” we are just a collection of “splinters and mosaics”. As the philosopher Gilbert Ryle pointed out, when it comes to the mind you cannot be both the hunter and the hunted. I think that he is saying that the brain creates both the mind and the experience of mind. An illusion is not what it seems and for most of us, we consider our self as some essential core of who we are. Deconstruction of the Self Illusion is hard to pin down since we consider our self as some essential core of who we are."
39,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10228055-derek,3,"This was an interesting read, but didn't exactly convince me that my self doesn't exist. The author claims that the self is an illusion that is difficult to shake...probably because, as he also acknowledges, the self is conjured by our interactions with our environment. The mind is wired to make sense of our experience and use memories to predict future states of whatever system we want to focus on. To give a concrete example - a mind wired mostly in comfort and a mind wired mostly in abuse will predict different outcomes upon meeting a stranger and definitely not respond in the same way. The self is created by the brain's machinations which are shaped by the body's experience of reality.Further, reasoning that ""having the quality of existing in a person's mind"" is equal to ""being illusory"" ends in solipsism, and you should never trust solipsists.Even further, picking my nose in private just means that I know there are social repercussions for picking my nose in public, not that I'm a different person and that my sense of self is schizophrenically splinteredStill though, I enjoyed reading this book and thinking through the ideas it presented. That's the reason for the third star."
40,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1961193-tim-atkinson,4,"This relatively small book (the footnotes and there further reading at the end pack a mean page punch!) took surprisingly long to read not because it wasn't fascinating, frightening and frankly astonishing in equal measure but because... it was so damn, small. I mean, the font. It can't have been more than about ten point and that, I'm afraid, to 'my' eyes (the eyes of the controlling self that doesn't exist, the eyes of the 'me' that is no more than a mere neurological and evolutionary illusion) just can't cope with anything that small anymore. Well, they could if it was slightly less technically demanding than this - which isn't to say Hood's writing is obscure: far from it.

Building off a wealth of knowledge and exploration into modern philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology, Hood plumbs the depths of our understanding of who we are and how much control we actually have over our ""selves"". Incredible eye opening, but not for those who stand on shaky ground with the full implications of such existential explorations. The greatest value of this book is that it does all this without falling into the lazy trap of nihilism. A life without purpose or meaning still has value, even if that self and that value are fictional constructs. As Hood puts it. Just because you understand that a brick is made of tiny particles spread out far enough to make the object mostly empty space, that isn't going to keep you from ducking if someone throws it at your head.Hands down one of the best modern pop science books I have read on the intersection of neural science and philosophy."
42,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22994712-katrina-sark,2,"p.5 – There are three major types of neurons. Sensory neurons respond to information picked from the environment through our senses. Motor neurons relay information that controls out movement outputs. But it is the third class of neuron that makes up the majority – the interneurons, which connect the input and the output of the brain into an internal network where all the really clever stuff happens. It is this internal network that stores information and performs all the operations that we recognize as higher thought processes.p.52 – Our infant attachment patterns appear to influence our emotional attachment to partners later in life. Those infants who develop a normal pattern of wanting their mother and then settling easily back in when they are reunited are more likely to go on to form relatively stable relationships as adults. They find it relatively easy to get close to others and are comfortable being dependent on others and having others depend on them. They do not worry about being abandoned and are comfortable in intimate relationships. In contrast, those who had formed an insecure attachment to their mothers are either too needy and clingy for fear of being abandoned or, if they were avoidant as infants, they typically do not want to get too close to others or allow others to get close to them. p.63 – The mirror neuron system was originally discovered by accident in the laboratories of the Italian neuropsychologist, Giancomo Rizzolatti, in the 1990s. p.65 – Mirror neurons are part of the reason that we enjoy watching movies and plays. When we watch others, we can experience their emotions directly. When we empathize with the emotions of others, we feel their pain and joy. p.83 – Our identity is a sum of our memories, but it turns out that memories are fluid, modified by context and sometimes simply confabulated. This means we cannot trust them. And our sense of self is compromised. Note how this leaves us with a glaring paradox – without a sense of self, memories have no meaning, and yet the self is a product of our memories. p.98 – by 2 years of age, most children easily identify with their own gender and the roles and appearances that they believe are appropriate. Up until 4 years of age, children think that long hair and dresses determine whether you are a boy or girl. By 6 years, children’s gender understanding is more sophisticated and goes over and beyond outward appearances. They know that changing clothes and hair does not change boys into girls and vice versa. They are already demonstrating an understanding of what it means to be essentially a boy or a girl. p.99 – Teachers perpetuate gender stereotypes. In mixed classes, boys are more likely to volunteer answers, receive more attention from teachers, and girls report lower self-esteem than boys, but it’s not because they are less able. According to the 2007 U.K. National Office of Statistics, girls outperform boys at all levels of education from preschool right through to university. p.140 – post hoc, ergo propter hoc, which translates from Latin as “after this, therefore because of this. It is particularly obvious in superstitious behaviors. Superstitions are typically found in situations in which an element of risk exists. Rituals provide the individual with an illusion of control that they are doing something to influence outcomes when in fact they have no control whatsoever. If you remove an individual’s perception of control, then he experiences uncertain situations as stressful, thereby generating anxiety that impairs both the immune system and the capacity to think clearly. Enacting superstitious rituals inoculates us from the negative excesses of stress. This is why you often find superstitious behavior in dangerous occupations. p.152 – Children who thought their performance was all down to hard work not only stuck longer on the third task, but also enjoyed it more. So it’s better to tell your kids that they are hard workers rather than simply smart. The same can be said for free will. When we believe that we are the masters of our own destiny, we behave differently than those who deny the existence of free will and believe everything is determined. p.153 – Workers who believe in free will outperform their colleagues, and this is recognized and rewarded by their supervisors. So, when we believe in free will, we enjoy life more. We like people who are decisive because we believe they are positive and driven, and that makes most of us feel more comfortable than does someone who can’t seem to reach a decision. p.158 – Cognitive dissonance, a term coined by Leon Festinger in 1957, is the process of self-justification whereby we defend our actions and thoughts when they turn out to be wrong or, as in the case of sour grapes, ineffectual. p.160 – Cognitive dissonance protects the self from conflicting stories and is at the heart of why the self illusion is so important, but it also reveals the dangers that a strong sense of self can create. We use it to justify faulty reasoning. Although we do not appreciate it, our decision-making is actually the constellation of many processes vying for attention and in constant conflict. We fail to consider just how much of our decision-making is actually out of our control. p.167 – Not all depression us the same in its origins, but it is statistically more common among the poor and deprived in our society. One theory is that it is not so much that poverty is the root cause but rather the circumstances that having no wealth entails – the inability of individuals to do anything about their lives. The obvious solution is to empower people with choices. Some would argue that this is what wealth really brings – the opportunity to make choices and not be shackled to a life you can’t escape. If nothing changes no matter what you do, you have the basics of despair. The need for control appears to be fairly important for both physical and mental health. "
43,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2612588-candace,3,"This was an interesting survey of the evidence from psychology and neuropsychology for the idea that our much-coveted sense of self is an illusion that our brain creates. Specifically, the author feels that it is our social interactions that most determine our selves (as we can have different selves in different social or work-related settings). Some of the evidence for this kind of went over my autistic spectrum head. I did come to understand a bit better why I was getting beaten up in school every day back in junior high, given how oblivious I was to the strong social and hormonal currents then swirling around me, but if I am honest, as someone who could be viewed as socially retarded, arguments about self as a sheerly social construct are hard for me to wrap my head around. Still it was an interesting book, filled with interesting examples and vignettes. It seemed to meander a bit near the end, but overall, it was a worthwhile read."

What I considered to be the main downside of this book was corrected very shortly afterwards, and the story continued on a very high note.Considerable parts of this were more biochemical than I would normally appreciate, but it did seem as if the author put considerable effort into making things understandable. Similarly, his examples -- though not very different if one has read a number of other self/mind/psychology works -- were as illustrative as one could hope. Overall, I feel that the main value of this work is in the way Mr Hood highlights which functions are instinctive/inherited/uncontrollable even though we are primed to think that we have some control.

He pulls together a vast range of psychological research, much of which I had heard of, but was happy to read an understandable explanation of. A little out of date now, so the latest findings may be missing. Written in a way suitable for a layman, but without seeming too dumbed down (to this layman).I wasn't entirely convinced that my sense of having a self is an illusion created by my brain. I think that is going too far, but what he did convince me of is that many of the ways in which I experience my self are not necessarily 'real'.The narration by the author was good.

Hood didn't organize his thoughts into a cohesive picture of his thesis. It reads like something closer to a polished outline, all the research is there and it's orderly, but each section feels like its own little island. The research is interesting, and with a little effort you'll understand what he's trying to say, but it's just not up to the level it could have been."

The reader isn't lead along to the authors way of thinking. The chapters are more or less just a collection of behavioral studies and the results of those studies. Some of the studies mentioned contains some fascinating stuff, but the author doesn't really make much of his case. Also, the last two chapters of the book spend way to much time explaining, the Internet, the World Wide Web, Facebook, and Twitter.

68,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15394714-luiz,4,"I first heard of Bruce Hood from Maria Poppova, on a brainpickings post, almost a year ago. This was right before going on my second trip to India. In this article, Poppova presented many interesting ideas from this author and recommended The Self Illusion for those interested in understanding the self as an entity derived from a biological phenomenon that is the mind. An electrical fish creates electrical waves to avert predators, we primates use the electrical discharges of our neurological system to create our spirit and thus our self. This idea, despite simple, was very striking on me. I immediately ordered the book, but since it would be shipped from overseas it didn’t make till left to India. Given the impossibility of bringing the book on my trip, I decided to buy other publication available in the local market. Then I stumbled upon to his other book SuperSense which argues how we tend to trick ourselves turning the unbelievable into believable. This reading couldn’t be more appropriate while having a “spiritual” trip through the Indian subcontinent. Religion is undeniable powerful and it take advantages on people’s incapability to accept that their ego is as perishable as their body. People need to believe that through religious transcendence, magic is plausible and death is not a definite event. It is an important social manifestation since it can calm the spirit from its anxieties regarding its origins and its ends. Religion works to split the material phenomena which is the body from its electrical phenomena from where comes the mind, therefore it can trick the ego when it faces despair and death. Hood maintain that everyone is born with a tendency to have this ""Super Sense"" and social institutions, such as religion, profits on that. I still think that any religion mythology is a rich source of insights for human psyche and for how it dealt since our even our ignorant and “enlightened” society still lacks for peace of the soul like the first Neandhertal did. Consequently, it helped me to better understand the spiritual experiences I had not only in this trip but also with my later Ayhuasca experience. Where my divine experience was realizing that there is a much bigger force than me and that I am just a machine as full of grace, blood, meat and bones that will stay alive during an amount of time impossible to totally grasp the origins its origins even with all the clear evidences of the absence of magic and super creator. Besides, the topics discussed are all a vanguard on neuroscience the text is very well written and fluid, making the reading experience more interesting. With this in mind, I started reading the Self Illusion three weeks ago. The book was very helpful to better understand the dynamics that ego creates to justify itSELF and how we are tricked to believe that we transcend our body. Like his previous books, Hood present empirical evidence based on common sense life events of and the last brain science discoveries supported by philosophers (such as Daniel Dennet) and cognitive psychologists (Pinker and Kahnemann).He asserts that THE SELF is not programmed to identify itself. That's why many animals from Birds to Dogs or even we, when little, take some time to understand what is our reflection on mirrors. He also argues about the window of opportunity of brain development, such as a chick is programed to identify its mom to follow to and from to the nest. Identically in the Super Sense, Bruce Hood argues again how babes when born don't have a clear sight, they just want to absorbe as much information as possible, they don't know exactly the shapes of heads of their moms just like chicks don't know who to follow, despite knowing they have to follow. Therefore, the evidence would suggest that like for Noam Chosmky we have built-in traits genetically evolved and inherited to identify the sources of security to better deal with natural selection imposed by the environment. An illusion is not what it seems and for most of us, we consider our self as some essential core of who we are. For example, most us think that we see the world continuously throughout the waking day when in fact we only see a fraction of the world in front of us, and because the brain blanks out our visual experience every time we move our eyes in a process called saccadic suppression, we are effectively blind for at least 2 hrs of the day. Although the brain is just a loom of electric neurons and contradictory impulses, the self makes us whole how the singularity of the self emerges from the cacophony of mind and the mess of social life	he self – this entity at the center of our personal universe – is actually just a story, a “constructed narrative”.Our brains think in stories. The same is true for the self and I use a distinction that William James drew between the self as “I” and “me.” Our consciousness of the self in the here and now is the “I” and most of the time, we experience this as being an integrated and coherent individual – a bit like the character in the story. The self which we tell others about, is autobiographical or the “me”. The neuroscience supports the claim that self is constructed readily confabulate an explanation to reconcile information unconsciously processed with information that was conscious Ramachandran describes patients who are paralyzed but deny they have a problem. These are all extreme clinical cases but the same is true of normal people. Nietzsche said it first: “My hypothesis is the subject as multiplicity,” we really just a collection of “splinters and mosaics”. We have no direct contact with reality because everything we experience is an abstracted version of reality that has been through the processing machinery of our brains to produce experience. If the human condition it is not materialist, then an alternative good explanation must be non-materialist. Show me good evidence for souls and spirits and then I will be forced to change my view about how plausible is the hypothesis on how supernatural entities can inhabit our bodies. In contrast, we know that if you alter the physical state of the brain through a head injury, dementia or drugs, each of these changes our self and, thus, easily to promote the necessary delusions to make god possible.Nietzsche said it first: “My hypothesis is the subject as multiplicity,” we are just a collection of “splinters and mosaics”. As the philosopher Gilbert Ryle pointed out, when it comes to the mind you cannot be both the hunter and the hunted. I think that he is saying that the brain creates both the mind and the experience of mind. An illusion is not what it seems and for most of us, we consider our self as some essential core of who we are. Deconstruction of the Self Illusion is hard to pin down since we consider our self as some essential core of who we are."
69,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10228055-derek,3,"This was an interesting read, but didn't exactly convince me that my self doesn't exist. The author claims that the self is an illusion that is difficult to shake...probably because, as he also acknowledges, the self is conjured by our interactions with our environment. The mind is wired to make sense of our experience and use memories to predict future states of whatever system we want to focus on. To give a concrete example - a mind wired mostly in comfort and a mind wired mostly in abuse will predict different outcomes upon meeting a stranger and definitely not respond in the same way. The self is created by the brain's machinations which are shaped by the body's experience of reality.Further, reasoning that ""having the quality of existing in a person's mind"" is equal to ""being illusory"" ends in solipsism, and you should never trust solipsists.Even further, picking my nose in private just means that I know there are social repercussions for picking my nose in public, not that I'm a different person and that my sense of self is schizophrenically splinteredStill though, I enjoyed reading this book and thinking through the ideas it presented.

When we believe that we are the masters of our own destiny, we behave differently than those who deny the existence of free will and believe everything is determined. p.153 – Workers who believe in free will outperform their colleagues, and this is recognized and rewarded by their supervisors. So, when we believe in free will, we enjoy life more. We like people who are decisive because we believe they are positive and driven, and that makes most of us feel more comfortable than does someone who can’t seem to reach a decision. p.158 – Cognitive dissonance, a term coined by Leon Festinger in 1957, is the process of self-justification whereby we defend our actions and thoughts when they turn out to be wrong or, as in the case of sour grapes, ineffectual. p.160 – Cognitive dissonance protects the self from conflicting stories and is at the heart of why the self illusion is so important, but it also reveals the dangers that a strong sense of self can create. We use it to justify faulty reasoning. Although we do not appreciate it, our decision-making is actually the constellation of many processes vying for attention and in constant conflict. We fail to consider just how much of our decision-making is actually out of our control. p.167 – Not all depression us the same in its origins, but it is statistically more common among the poor and deprived in our society. One theory is that it is not so much that poverty is the root cause but rather the circumstances that having no wealth entails – the inability of individuals to do anything about their lives. The obvious solution is to empower people with choices. Some would argue that this is what wealth really brings – the opportunity to make choices and not be shackled to a life you can’t escape. If nothing changes no matter what you do, you have the basics of despair. The need for control appears to be fairly important for both physical and mental health. "

Specifically, the author feels that it is our social interactions that most determine our selves (as we can have different selves in different social or work-related settings). Some of the evidence for this kind of went over my autistic spectrum head. I did come to understand a bit better why I was getting beaten up in school every day back in junior high, given how oblivious I was to the strong social and hormonal currents then swirling around me, but if I am honest, as someone who could be viewed as socially retarded, arguments about self as a sheerly social construct are hard for me to wrap my head around.

What I considered to be the main downside of this book was corrected very shortly afterwards, and the story continued on a very high note.Considerable parts of this were more biochemical than I would normally appreciate, but it did seem as if the author put considerable effort into making things understandable. Similarly, his examples -- though not very different if one has read a number of other self/mind/psychology works -- were as illustrative as one could hope. Overall, I feel that the main value of this work is in the way Mr Hood highlights which functions are instinctive/inherited/uncontrollable even though we are primed to think that we have some control.

Hood didn't organize his thoughts into a cohesive picture of his thesis. It reads like something closer to a polished outline, all the research is there and it's orderly, but each section feels like its own little island.

The reader isn't lead along to the authors way of thinking. The chapters are more or less just a collection of behavioral studies and the results of those studies. Some of the studies mentioned contains some fascinating stuff, but the author doesn't really make much of his case. Also, the last two chapters of the book spend way to much time explaining, the Internet, the World Wide Web, Facebook, and Twitter.

98,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15394714-luiz,4,"I first heard of Bruce Hood from Maria Poppova, on a brainpickings post, almost a year ago. This was right before going on my second trip to India. In this article, Poppova presented many interesting ideas from this author and recommended The Self Illusion for those interested in understanding the self as an entity derived from a biological phenomenon that is the mind. An electrical fish creates electrical waves to avert predators, we primates use the electrical discharges of our neurological system to create our spirit and thus our self. This idea, despite simple, was very striking on me. I immediately ordered the book, but since it would be shipped from overseas it didn’t make till left to India. Given the impossibility of bringing the book on my trip, I decided to buy other publication available in the local market. Then I stumbled upon to his other book SuperSense which argues how we tend to trick ourselves turning the unbelievable into believable. This reading couldn’t be more appropriate while having a “spiritual” trip through the Indian subcontinent. Religion is undeniable powerful and it take advantages on people’s incapability to accept that their ego is as perishable as their body. People need to believe that through religious transcendence, magic is plausible and death is not a definite event. It is an important social manifestation since it can calm the spirit from its anxieties regarding its origins and its ends. Religion works to split the material phenomena which is the body from its electrical phenomena from where comes the mind, therefore it can trick the ego when it faces despair and death. Hood maintain that everyone is born with a tendency to have this ""Super Sense"" and social institutions, such as religion, profits on that. I still think that any religion mythology is a rich source of insights for human psyche and for how it dealt since our even our ignorant and “enlightened” society still lacks for peace of the soul like the first Neandhertal did. Consequently, it helped me to better understand the spiritual experiences I had not only in this trip but also with my later Ayhuasca experience. Where my divine experience was realizing that there is a much bigger force than me and that I am just a machine as full of grace, blood, meat and bones that will stay alive during an amount of time impossible to totally grasp the origins its origins even with all the clear evidences of the absence of magic and super creator. Besides, the topics discussed are all a vanguard on neuroscience the text is very well written and fluid, making the reading experience more interesting. With this in mind, I started reading the Self Illusion three weeks ago. The book was very helpful to better understand the dynamics that ego creates to justify itSELF and how we are tricked to believe that we transcend our body. Like his previous books, Hood present empirical evidence based on common sense life events of and the last brain science discoveries supported by philosophers (such as Daniel Dennet) and cognitive psychologists (Pinker and Kahnemann).He asserts that THE SELF is not programmed to identify itself. That's why many animals from Birds to Dogs or even we, when little, take some time to understand what is our reflection on mirrors. He also argues about the window of opportunity of brain development, such as a chick is programed to identify its mom to follow to and from to the nest. Identically in the Super Sense, Bruce Hood argues again how babes when born don't have a clear sight, they just want to absorbe as much information as possible, they don't know exactly the shapes of heads of their moms just like chicks don't know who to follow, despite knowing they have to follow. Therefore, the evidence would suggest that like for Noam Chosmky we have built-in traits genetically evolved and inherited to identify the sources of security to better deal with natural selection imposed by the environment. An illusion is not what it seems and for most of us, we consider our self as some essential core of who we are. For example, most us think that we see the world continuously throughout the waking day when in fact we only see a fraction of the world in front of us, and because the brain blanks out our visual experience every time we move our eyes in a process called saccadic suppression, we are effectively blind for at least 2 hrs of the day. Although the brain is just a loom of electric neurons and contradictory impulses, the self makes us whole how the singularity of the self emerges from the cacophony of mind and the mess of social life	he self – this entity at the center of our personal universe – is actually just a story, a “constructed narrative”.Our brains think in stories. The same is true for the self and I use a distinction that William James drew between the self as “I” and “me.” Our consciousness of the self in the here and now is the “I” and most of the time, we experience this as being an integrated and coherent individual – a bit like the character in the story. The self which we tell others about, is autobiographical or the “me”. The neuroscience supports the claim that self is constructed readily confabulate an explanation to reconcile information unconsciously processed with information that was conscious Ramachandran describes patients who are paralyzed but deny they have a problem. These are all extreme clinical cases but the same is true of normal people. Nietzsche said it first: “My hypothesis is the subject as multiplicity,” we really just a collection of “splinters and mosaics”. We have no direct contact with reality because everything we experience is an abstracted version of reality that has been through the processing machinery of our brains to produce experience. If the human condition it is not materialist, then an alternative good explanation must be non-materialist. Show me good evidence for souls and spirits and then I will be forced to change my view about how plausible is the hypothesis on how supernatural entities can inhabit our bodies. In contrast, we know that if you alter the physical state of the brain through a head injury, dementia or drugs, each of these changes our self and, thus, easily to promote the necessary delusions to make god possible.Nietzsche said it first: “My hypothesis is the subject as multiplicity,” we are just a collection of “splinters and mosaics”. As the philosopher Gilbert Ryle pointed out, when it comes to the mind you cannot be both the hunter and the hunted. I think that he is saying that the brain creates both the mind and the experience of mind. An illusion is not what it seems and for most of us, we consider our self as some essential core of who we are. Deconstruction of the Self Illusion is hard to pin down since we consider our self as some essential core of who we are."
99,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10228055-derek,3,"This was an interesting read, but didn't exactly convince me that my self doesn't exist. The author claims that the self is an illusion that is difficult to shake...probably because, as he also acknowledges, the self is conjured by our interactions with our environment. The mind is wired to make sense of our experience and use memories to predict future states of whatever system we want to focus on. To give a concrete example - a mind wired mostly in comfort and a mind wired mostly in abuse will predict different outcomes upon meeting a stranger and definitely not respond in the same way. The self is created by the brain's machinations which are shaped by the body's experience of reality.Further, reasoning that ""having the quality of existing in a person's mind"" is equal to ""being illusory"" ends in solipsism, and you should never trust solipsists.Even further, picking my nose in private just means that I know there are social repercussions for picking my nose in public, not that I'm a different person and that my sense of self is schizophrenically splinteredStill though, I enjoyed reading this book and thinking through the ideas it presented. That's the reason for the third star."
100,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1961193-tim-atkinson,4,"This relatively small book (the footnotes and there further reading at the end pack a mean page punch!) took surprisingly long to read not because it wasn't fascinating, frightening and frankly astonishing in equal measure but because... it was so damn, small. I mean, the font. It can't have been more than about ten point and that, I'm afraid, to 'my' eyes (the eyes of the controlling self that doesn't exist, the eyes of the 'me' that is no more than a mere neurological and evolutionary illusion) just can't cope with anything that small anymore. Well, they could if it was slightly less technically demanding than this - which isn't to say Hood's writing is obscure: far from it. But the philosophical and psychological implications of his writing - combined with the empirical evidence for his conclusions - make it a prime candidate for reading on the Kindle, in my opinion. If only I had. Still, worth getting the end if only to discover that I'd probably actually got there before I realised I had, just like I chose the book before 'choosing' it (so-to-speak) and that my understanding of it precedes (by nano-seconds) my knowing or realising that I've understood it. Yes, it really is that kind of book. "
101,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28415586-jeff-powers,4,"A fantastic exploration into how our minds construct not only the world around us but our place in it. Building off a wealth of knowledge and exploration into modern philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology, Hood plumbs the depths of our understanding of who we are and how much control we actually have over our ""selves"". Incredible eye opening, but not for those who stand on shaky ground with the full implications of such existential explorations. The greatest value of this book is that it does all this without falling into the lazy trap of nihilism. A life without purpose or meaning still has value, even if that self and that value are fictional constructs. As Hood puts it. Just because you understand that a brick is made of tiny particles spread out far enough to make the object mostly empty space, that isn't going to keep you from ducking if someone throws it at your head.Hands down one of the best modern pop science books I have read on the intersection of neural science and philosophy."
102,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22994712-katrina-sark,2,"p.5 – There are three major types of neurons. Sensory neurons respond to information picked from the environment through our senses. Motor neurons relay information that controls out movement outputs. But it is the third class of neuron that makes up the majority – the interneurons, which connect the input and the output of the brain into an internal network where all the really clever stuff happens. It is this internal network that stores information and performs all the operations that we recognize as higher thought processes.p.52 – Our infant attachment patterns appear to influence our emotional attachment to partners later in life. Those infants who develop a normal pattern of wanting their mother and then settling easily back in when they are reunited are more likely to go on to form relatively stable relationships as adults. They find it relatively easy to get close to others and are comfortable being dependent on others and having others depend on them. They do not worry about being abandoned and are comfortable in intimate relationships. In contrast, those who had formed an insecure attachment to their mothers are either too needy and clingy for fear of being abandoned or, if they were avoidant as infants, they typically do not want to get too close to others or allow others to get close to them. p.63 – The mirror neuron system was originally discovered by accident in the laboratories of the Italian neuropsychologist, Giancomo Rizzolatti, in the 1990s. p.65 – Mirror neurons are part of the reason that we enjoy watching movies and plays. When we watch others, we can experience their emotions directly. When we empathize with the emotions of others, we feel their pain and joy. p.83 – Our identity is a sum of our memories, but it turns out that memories are fluid, modified by context and sometimes simply confabulated. This means we cannot trust them. And our sense of self is compromised. Note how this leaves us with a glaring paradox – without a sense of self, memories have no meaning, and yet the self is a product of our memories. p.98 – by 2 years of age, most children easily identify with their own gender and the roles and appearances that they believe are appropriate. Up until 4 years of age, children think that long hair and dresses determine whether you are a boy or girl. By 6 years, children’s gender understanding is more sophisticated and goes over and beyond outward appearances. They know that changing clothes and hair does not change boys into girls and vice versa. They are already demonstrating an understanding of what it means to be essentially a boy or a girl. p.99 – Teachers perpetuate gender stereotypes. In mixed classes, boys are more likely to volunteer answers, receive more attention from teachers, and girls report lower self-esteem than boys, but it’s not because they are less able. According to the 2007 U.K. National Office of Statistics, girls outperform boys at all levels of education from preschool right through to university. p.140 – post hoc, ergo propter hoc, which translates from Latin as “after this, therefore because of this. It is particularly obvious in superstitious behaviors. Superstitions are typically found in situations in which an element of risk exists. Rituals provide the individual with an illusion of control that they are doing something to influence outcomes when in fact they have no control whatsoever. If you remove an individual’s perception of control, then he experiences uncertain situations as stressful, thereby generating anxiety that impairs both the immune system and the capacity to think clearly. Enacting superstitious rituals inoculates us from the negative excesses of stress. This is why you often find superstitious behavior in dangerous occupations. p.152 – Children who thought their performance was all down to hard work not only stuck longer on the third task, but also enjoyed it more. So it’s better to tell your kids that they are hard workers rather than simply smart. The same can be said for free will. When we believe that we are the masters of our own destiny, we behave differently than those who deny the existence of free will and believe everything is determined. p.153 – Workers who believe in free will outperform their colleagues, and this is recognized and rewarded by their supervisors. So, when we believe in free will, we enjoy life more. We like people who are decisive because we believe they are positive and driven, and that makes most of us feel more comfortable than does someone who can’t seem to reach a decision. p.158 – Cognitive dissonance, a term coined by Leon Festinger in 1957, is the process of self-justification whereby we defend our actions and thoughts when they turn out to be wrong or, as in the case of sour grapes, ineffectual. p.160 – Cognitive dissonance protects the self from conflicting stories and is at the heart of why the self illusion is so important, but it also reveals the dangers that a strong sense of self can create. We use it to justify faulty reasoning. Although we do not appreciate it, our decision-making is actually the constellation of many processes vying for attention and in constant conflict. We fail to consider just how much of our decision-making is actually out of our control. p.167 – Not all depression us the same in its origins, but it is statistically more common among the poor and deprived in our society. One theory is that it is not so much that poverty is the root cause but rather the circumstances that having no wealth entails – the inability of individuals to do anything about their lives. The obvious solution is to empower people with choices. Some would argue that this is what wealth really brings – the opportunity to make choices and not be shackled to a life you can’t escape. If nothing changes no matter what you do, you have the basics of despair. The need for control appears to be fairly important for both physical and mental health. "

Some of the studies mentioned contains some fascinating stuff, but the author doesn't really make much of his case. Also, the last two chapters of the book spend way to much time explaining, the Internet, the World Wide Web, Facebook, and Twitter.

128,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15394714-luiz,4,"I first heard of Bruce Hood from Maria Poppova, on a brainpickings post, almost a year ago. This was right before going on my second trip to India. In this article, Poppova presented many interesting ideas from this author and recommended The Self Illusion for those interested in understanding the self as an entity derived from a biological phenomenon that is the mind. An electrical fish creates electrical waves to avert predators, we primates use the electrical discharges of our neurological system to create our spirit and thus our self. This idea, despite simple, was very striking on me. I immediately ordered the book, but since it would be shipped from overseas it didn’t make till left to India. Given the impossibility of bringing the book on my trip, I decided to buy other publication available in the local market. Then I stumbled upon to his other book SuperSense which argues how we tend to trick ourselves turning the unbelievable into believable. This reading couldn’t be more appropriate while having a “spiritual” trip through the Indian subcontinent. Religion is undeniable powerful and it take advantages on people’s incapability to accept that their ego is as perishable as their body. People need to believe that through religious transcendence, magic is plausible and death is not a definite event. It is an important social manifestation since it can calm the spirit from its anxieties regarding its origins and its ends. Religion works to split the material phenomena which is the body from its electrical phenomena from where comes the mind, therefore it can trick the ego when it faces despair and death. Hood maintain that everyone is born with a tendency to have this ""Super Sense"" and social institutions, such as religion, profits on that. I still think that any religion mythology is a rich source of insights for human psyche and for how it dealt since our even our ignorant and “enlightened” society still lacks for peace of the soul like the first Neandhertal did. Consequently, it helped me to better understand the spiritual experiences I had not only in this trip but also with my later Ayhuasca experience. Where my divine experience was realizing that there is a much bigger force than me and that I am just a machine as full of grace, blood, meat and bones that will stay alive during an amount of time impossible to totally grasp the origins its origins even with all the clear evidences of the absence of magic and super creator. Besides, the topics discussed are all a vanguard on neuroscience the text is very well written and fluid, making the reading experience more interesting. With this in mind, I started reading the Self Illusion three weeks ago. The book was very helpful to better understand the dynamics that ego creates to justify itSELF and how we are tricked to believe that we transcend our body. Like his previous books, Hood present empirical evidence based on common sense life events of and the last brain science discoveries supported by philosophers (such as Daniel Dennet) and cognitive psychologists (Pinker and Kahnemann).He asserts that THE SELF is not programmed to identify itself. That's why many animals from Birds to Dogs or even we, when little, take some time to understand what is our reflection on mirrors. He also argues about the window of opportunity of brain development, such as a chick is programed to identify its mom to follow to and from to the nest. Identically in the Super Sense, Bruce Hood argues again how babes when born don't have a clear sight, they just want to absorbe as much information as possible, they don't know exactly the shapes of heads of their moms just like chicks don't know who to follow, despite knowing they have to follow. Therefore, the evidence would suggest that like for Noam Chosmky we have built-in traits genetically evolved and inherited to identify the sources of security to better deal with natural selection imposed by the environment. An illusion is not what it seems and for most of us, we consider our self as some essential core of who we are. For example, most us think that we see the world continuously throughout the waking day when in fact we only see a fraction of the world in front of us, and because the brain blanks out our visual experience every time we move our eyes in a process called saccadic suppression, we are effectively blind for at least 2 hrs of the day. Although the brain is just a loom of electric neurons and contradictory impulses, the self makes us whole how the singularity of the self emerges from the cacophony of mind and the mess of social life	he self – this entity at the center of our personal universe – is actually just a story, a “constructed narrative”.Our brains think in stories. The same is true for the self and I use a distinction that William James drew between the self as “I” and “me.” Our consciousness of the self in the here and now is the “I” and most of the time, we experience this as being an integrated and coherent individual – a bit like the character in the story. The self which we tell others about, is autobiographical or the “me”. The neuroscience supports the claim that self is constructed readily confabulate an explanation to reconcile information unconsciously processed with information that was conscious Ramachandran describes patients who are paralyzed but deny they have a problem. These are all extreme clinical cases but the same is true of normal people. Nietzsche said it first: “My hypothesis is the subject as multiplicity,” we really just a collection of “splinters and mosaics”. We have no direct contact with reality because everything we experience is an abstracted version of reality that has been through the processing machinery of our brains to produce experience. If the human condition it is not materialist, then an alternative good explanation must be non-materialist. Show me good evidence for souls and spirits and then I will be forced to change my view about how plausible is the hypothesis on how supernatural entities can inhabit our bodies. In contrast, we know that if you alter the physical state of the brain through a head injury, dementia or drugs, each of these changes our self and, thus, easily to promote the necessary delusions to make god possible.Nietzsche said it first: “My hypothesis is the subject as multiplicity,” we are just a collection of “splinters and mosaics”. As the philosopher Gilbert Ryle pointed out, when it comes to the mind you cannot be both the hunter and the hunted. I think that he is saying that the brain creates both the mind and the experience of mind. An illusion is not what it seems and for most of us, we consider our self as some essential core of who we are. Deconstruction of the Self Illusion is hard to pin down since we consider our self as some essential core of who we are."
129,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10228055-derek,3,"This was an interesting read, but didn't exactly convince me that my self doesn't exist. The author claims that the self is an illusion that is difficult to shake...probably because, as he also acknowledges, the self is conjured by our interactions with our environment. The mind is wired to make sense of our experience and use memories to predict future states of whatever system we want to focus on. To give a concrete example - a mind wired mostly in comfort and a mind wired mostly in abuse will predict different outcomes upon meeting a stranger and definitely not respond in the same way. The self is created by the brain's machinations which are shaped by the body's experience of reality.Further, reasoning that ""having the quality of existing in a person's mind"" is equal to ""being illusory"" ends in solipsism, and you should never trust solipsists.Even further, picking my nose in private just means that I know there are social repercussions for picking my nose in public, not that I'm a different person and that my sense of self is schizophrenically splinteredStill though, I enjoyed reading this book and thinking through the ideas it presented. That's the reason for the third star."
130,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1961193-tim-atkinson,4,"This relatively small book (the footnotes and there further reading at the end pack a mean page punch!) took surprisingly long to read not because it wasn't fascinating, frightening and frankly astonishing in equal measure but because... it was so damn, small. I mean, the font. It can't have been more than about ten point and that, I'm afraid, to 'my' eyes (the eyes of the controlling self that doesn't exist, the eyes of the 'me' that is no more than a mere neurological and evolutionary illusion) just can't cope with anything that small anymore. Well, they could if it was slightly less technically demanding than this - which isn't to say Hood's writing is obscure: far from it. But the philosophical and psychological implications of his writing - combined with the empirical evidence for his conclusions - make it a prime candidate for reading on the Kindle, in my opinion. If only I had. Still, worth getting the end if only to discover that I'd probably actually got there before I realised I had, just like I chose the book before 'choosing' it (so-to-speak) and that my understanding of it precedes (by nano-seconds) my knowing or realising that I've understood it. Yes, it really is that kind of book. "
131,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28415586-jeff-powers,4,"A fantastic exploration into how our minds construct not only the world around us but our place in it. Building off a wealth of knowledge and exploration into modern philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology, Hood plumbs the depths of our understanding of who we are and how much control we actually have over our ""selves"". Incredible eye opening, but not for those who stand on shaky ground with the full implications of such existential explorations. The greatest value of this book is that it does all this without falling into the lazy trap of nihilism. A life without purpose or meaning still has value, even if that self and that value are fictional constructs. As Hood puts it. Just because you understand that a brick is made of tiny particles spread out far enough to make the object mostly empty space, that isn't going to keep you from ducking if someone throws it at your head.Hands down one of the best modern pop science books I have read on the intersection of neural science and philosophy."
132,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22994712-katrina-sark,2,"p.5 – There are three major types of neurons. Sensory neurons respond to information picked from the environment through our senses. Motor neurons relay information that controls out movement outputs. But it is the third class of neuron that makes up the majority – the interneurons, which connect the input and the output of the brain into an internal network where all the really clever stuff happens. It is this internal network that stores information and performs all the operations that we recognize as higher thought processes.p.52 – Our infant attachment patterns appear to influence our emotional attachment to partners later in life. Those infants who develop a normal pattern of wanting their mother and then settling easily back in when they are reunited are more likely to go on to form relatively stable relationships as adults. They find it relatively easy to get close to others and are comfortable being dependent on others and having others depend on them. They do not worry about being abandoned and are comfortable in intimate relationships. In contrast, those who had formed an insecure attachment to their mothers are either too needy and clingy for fear of being abandoned or, if they were avoidant as infants, they typically do not want to get too close to others or allow others to get close to them. p.63 – The mirror neuron system was originally discovered by accident in the laboratories of the Italian neuropsychologist, Giancomo Rizzolatti, in the 1990s. p.65 – Mirror neurons are part of the reason that we enjoy watching movies and plays. When we watch others, we can experience their emotions directly. When we empathize with the emotions of others, we feel their pain and joy. p.83 – Our identity is a sum of our memories, but it turns out that memories are fluid, modified by context and sometimes simply confabulated. This means we cannot trust them. And our sense of self is compromised. Note how this leaves us with a glaring paradox – without a sense of self, memories have no meaning, and yet the self is a product of our memories. p.98 – by 2 years of age, most children easily identify with their own gender and the roles and appearances that they believe are appropriate. Up until 4 years of age, children think that long hair and dresses determine whether you are a boy or girl. By 6 years, children’s gender understanding is more sophisticated and goes over and beyond outward appearances. They know that changing clothes and hair does not change boys into girls and vice versa. They are already demonstrating an understanding of what it means to be essentially a boy or a girl. p.99 – Teachers perpetuate gender stereotypes. In mixed classes, boys are more likely to volunteer answers, receive more attention from teachers, and girls report lower self-esteem than boys, but it’s not because they are less able. According to the 2007 U.K. National Office of Statistics, girls outperform boys at all levels of education from preschool right through to university. p.140 – post hoc, ergo propter hoc, which translates from Latin as “after this, therefore because of this. It is particularly obvious in superstitious behaviors. Superstitions are typically found in situations in which an element of risk exists. Rituals provide the individual with an illusion of control that they are doing something to influence outcomes when in fact they have no control whatsoever. If you remove an individual’s perception of control, then he experiences uncertain situations as stressful, thereby generating anxiety that impairs both the immune system and the capacity to think clearly. Enacting superstitious rituals inoculates us from the negative excesses of stress. This is why you often find superstitious behavior in dangerous occupations. p.152 – Children who thought their performance was all down to hard work not only stuck longer on the third task, but also enjoyed it more. So it’s better to tell your kids that they are hard workers rather than simply smart. The same can be said for free will. When we believe that we are the masters of our own destiny, we behave differently than those who deny the existence of free will and believe everything is determined. p.153 – Workers who believe in free will outperform their colleagues, and this is recognized and rewarded by their supervisors. So, when we believe in free will, we enjoy life more. We like people who are decisive because we believe they are positive and driven, and that makes most of us feel more comfortable than does someone who can’t seem to reach a decision. p.158 – Cognitive dissonance, a term coined by Leon Festinger in 1957, is the process of self-justification whereby we defend our actions and thoughts when they turn out to be wrong or, as in the case of sour grapes, ineffectual. p.160 – Cognitive dissonance protects the self from conflicting stories and is at the heart of why the self illusion is so important, but it also reveals the dangers that a strong sense of self can create. We use it to justify faulty reasoning. Although we do not appreciate it, our decision-making is actually the constellation of many processes vying for attention and in constant conflict. We fail to consider just how much of our decision-making is actually out of our control. p.167 – Not all depression us the same in its origins, but it is statistically more common among the poor and deprived in our society. One theory is that it is not so much that poverty is the root cause but rather the circumstances that having no wealth entails – the inability of individuals to do anything about their lives. The obvious solution is to empower people with choices. Some would argue that this is what wealth really brings – the opportunity to make choices and not be shackled to a life you can’t escape. If nothing changes no matter what you do, you have the basics of despair. The need for control appears to be fairly important for both physical and mental health. "
133,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2612588-candace,3,"This was an interesting survey of the evidence from psychology and neuropsychology for the idea that our much-coveted sense of self is an illusion that our brain creates. Specifically, the author feels that it is our social interactions that most determine our selves (as we can have different selves in different social or work-related settings). Some of the evidence for this kind of went over my autistic spectrum head. I did come to understand a bit better why I was getting beaten up in school every day back in junior high, given how oblivious I was to the strong social and hormonal currents then swirling around me, but if I am honest, as someone who could be viewed as socially retarded, arguments about self as a sheerly social construct are hard for me to wrap my head around.

What I considered to be the main downside of this book was corrected very shortly afterwards, and the story continued on a very high note.Considerable parts of this were more biochemical than I would normally appreciate, but it did seem as if the author put considerable effort into making things understandable. Similarly, his examples -- though not very different if one has read a number of other self/mind/psychology works -- were as illustrative as one could hope. Overall, I feel that the main value of this work is in the way Mr Hood highlights which functions are instinctive/inherited/uncontrollable even though we are primed to think that we have some control.

158,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15394714-luiz,4,"I first heard of Bruce Hood from Maria Poppova, on a brainpickings post, almost a year ago. This was right before going on my second trip to India. In this article, Poppova presented many interesting ideas from this author and recommended The Self Illusion for those interested in understanding the self as an entity derived from a biological phenomenon that is the mind. An electrical fish creates electrical waves to avert predators, we primates use the electrical discharges of our neurological system to create our spirit and thus our self. This idea, despite simple, was very striking on me. I immediately ordered the book, but since it would be shipped from overseas it didn’t make till left to India. Given the impossibility of bringing the book on my trip, I decided to buy other publication available in the local market. Then I stumbled upon to his other book SuperSense which argues how we tend to trick ourselves turning the unbelievable into believable. This reading couldn’t be more appropriate while having a “spiritual” trip through the Indian subcontinent. Religion is undeniable powerful and it take advantages on people’s incapability to accept that their ego is as perishable as their body. People need to believe that through religious transcendence, magic is plausible and death is not a definite event. It is an important social manifestation since it can calm the spirit from its anxieties regarding its origins and its ends. Religion works to split the material phenomena which is the body from its electrical phenomena from where comes the mind, therefore it can trick the ego when it faces despair and death. Hood maintain that everyone is born with a tendency to have this ""Super Sense"" and social institutions, such as religion, profits on that. I still think that any religion mythology is a rich source of insights for human psyche and for how it dealt since our even our ignorant and “enlightened” society still lacks for peace of the soul like the first Neandhertal did. Consequently, it helped me to better understand the spiritual experiences I had not only in this trip but also with my later Ayhuasca experience. Where my divine experience was realizing that there is a much bigger force than me and that I am just a machine as full of grace, blood, meat and bones that will stay alive during an amount of time impossible to totally grasp the origins its origins even with all the clear evidences of the absence of magic and super creator. Besides, the topics discussed are all a vanguard on neuroscience the text is very well written and fluid, making the reading experience more interesting. With this in mind, I started reading the Self Illusion three weeks ago. The book was very helpful to better understand the dynamics that ego creates to justify itSELF and how we are tricked to believe that we transcend our body. Like his previous books, Hood present empirical evidence based on common sense life events of and the last brain science discoveries supported by philosophers (such as Daniel Dennet) and cognitive psychologists (Pinker and Kahnemann).He asserts that THE SELF is not programmed to identify itself. That's why many animals from Birds to Dogs or even we, when little, take some time to understand what is our reflection on mirrors. He also argues about the window of opportunity of brain development, such as a chick is programed to identify its mom to follow to and from to the nest. Identically in the Super Sense, Bruce Hood argues again how babes when born don't have a clear sight, they just want to absorbe as much information as possible, they don't know exactly the shapes of heads of their moms just like chicks don't know who to follow, despite knowing they have to follow. Therefore, the evidence would suggest that like for Noam Chosmky we have built-in traits genetically evolved and inherited to identify the sources of security to better deal with natural selection imposed by the environment. An illusion is not what it seems and for most of us, we consider our self as some essential core of who we are. For example, most us think that we see the world continuously throughout the waking day when in fact we only see a fraction of the world in front of us, and because the brain blanks out our visual experience every time we move our eyes in a process called saccadic suppression, we are effectively blind for at least 2 hrs of the day. Although the brain is just a loom of electric neurons and contradictory impulses, the self makes us whole how the singularity of the self emerges from the cacophony of mind and the mess of social life	he self – this entity at the center of our personal universe – is actually just a story, a “constructed narrative”.Our brains think in stories. The same is true for the self and I use a distinction that William James drew between the self as “I” and “me.” Our consciousness of the self in the here and now is the “I” and most of the time, we experience this as being an integrated and coherent individual – a bit like the character in the story. The self which we tell others about, is autobiographical or the “me”. The neuroscience supports the claim that self is constructed readily confabulate an explanation to reconcile information unconsciously processed with information that was conscious Ramachandran describes patients who are paralyzed but deny they have a problem. These are all extreme clinical cases but the same is true of normal people. Nietzsche said it first: “My hypothesis is the subject as multiplicity,” we really just a collection of “splinters and mosaics”. We have no direct contact with reality because everything we experience is an abstracted version of reality that has been through the processing machinery of our brains to produce experience. If the human condition it is not materialist, then an alternative good explanation must be non-materialist. Show me good evidence for souls and spirits and then I will be forced to change my view about how plausible is the hypothesis on how supernatural entities can inhabit our bodies. In contrast, we know that if you alter the physical state of the brain through a head injury, dementia or drugs, each of these changes our self and, thus, easily to promote the necessary delusions to make god possible.Nietzsche said it first: “My hypothesis is the subject as multiplicity,” we are just a collection of “splinters and mosaics”. As the philosopher Gilbert Ryle pointed out, when it comes to the mind you cannot be both the hunter and the hunted. I think that he is saying that the brain creates both the mind and the experience of mind. An illusion is not what it seems and for most of us, we consider our self as some essential core of who we are. Deconstruction of the Self Illusion is hard to pin down since we consider our self as some essential core of who we are."
159,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10228055-derek,3,"This was an interesting read, but didn't exactly convince me that my self doesn't exist. The author claims that the self is an illusion that is difficult to shake...probably because, as he also acknowledges, the self is conjured by our interactions with our environment. The mind is wired to make sense of our experience and use memories to predict future states of whatever system we want to focus on. To give a concrete example - a mind wired mostly in comfort and a mind wired mostly in abuse will predict different outcomes upon meeting a stranger and definitely not respond in the same way. The self is created by the brain's machinations which are shaped by the body's experience of reality.Further, reasoning that ""having the quality of existing in a person's mind"" is equal to ""being illusory"" ends in solipsism, and you should never trust solipsists.Even further, picking my nose in private just means that I know there are social repercussions for picking my nose in public, not that I'm a different person and that my sense of self is schizophrenically splinteredStill though, I enjoyed reading this book and thinking through the ideas it presented. That's the reason for the third star."
160,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1961193-tim-atkinson,4,"This relatively small book (the footnotes and there further reading at the end pack a mean page punch!) took surprisingly long to read not because it wasn't fascinating, frightening and frankly astonishing in equal measure but because... it was so damn, small. I mean, the font. It can't have been more than about ten point and that, I'm afraid, to 'my' eyes (the eyes of the controlling self that doesn't exist, the eyes of the 'me' that is no more than a mere neurological and evolutionary illusion) just can't cope with anything that small anymore. Well, they could if it was slightly less technically demanding than this - which isn't to say Hood's writing is obscure: far from it. But the philosophical and psychological implications of his writing - combined with the empirical evidence for his conclusions - make it a prime candidate for reading on the Kindle, in my opinion. If only I had. Still, worth getting the end if only to discover that I'd probably actually got there before I realised I had, just like I chose the book before 'choosing' it (so-to-speak) and that my understanding of it precedes (by nano-seconds) my knowing or realising that I've understood it. Yes, it really is that kind of book. "
161,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28415586-jeff-powers,4,"A fantastic exploration into how our minds construct not only the world around us but our place in it. Building off a wealth of knowledge and exploration into modern philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology, Hood plumbs the depths of our understanding of who we are and how much control we actually have over our ""selves"". Incredible eye opening, but not for those who stand on shaky ground with the full implications of such existential explorations. The greatest value of this book is that it does all this without falling into the lazy trap of nihilism. A life without purpose or meaning still has value, even if that self and that value are fictional constructs. As Hood puts it. Just because you understand that a brick is made of tiny particles spread out far enough to make the object mostly empty space, that isn't going to keep you from ducking if someone throws it at your head.Hands down one of the best modern pop science books I have read on the intersection of neural science and philosophy."
162,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22994712-katrina-sark,2,"p.5 – There are three major types of neurons. Sensory neurons respond to information picked from the environment through our senses. Motor neurons relay information that controls out movement outputs. But it is the third class of neuron that makes up the majority – the interneurons, which connect the input and the output of the brain into an internal network where all the really clever stuff happens. It is this internal network that stores information and performs all the operations that we recognize as higher thought processes.p.52 – Our infant attachment patterns appear to influence our emotional attachment to partners later in life. Those infants who develop a normal pattern of wanting their mother and then settling easily back in when they are reunited are more likely to go on to form relatively stable relationships as adults. They find it relatively easy to get close to others and are comfortable being dependent on others and having others depend on them. They do not worry about being abandoned and are comfortable in intimate relationships. In contrast, those who had formed an insecure attachment to their mothers are either too needy and clingy for fear of being abandoned or, if they were avoidant as infants, they typically do not want to get too close to others or allow others to get close to them. p.63 – The mirror neuron system was originally discovered by accident in the laboratories of the Italian neuropsychologist, Giancomo Rizzolatti, in the 1990s. p.65 – Mirror neurons are part of the reason that we enjoy watching movies and plays. When we watch others, we can experience their emotions directly. When we empathize with the emotions of others, we feel their pain and joy. p.83 – Our identity is a sum of our memories, but it turns out that memories are fluid, modified by context and sometimes simply confabulated. This means we cannot trust them. And our sense of self is compromised. Note how this leaves us with a glaring paradox – without a sense of self, memories have no meaning, and yet the self is a product of our memories. p.98 – by 2 years of age, most children easily identify with their own gender and the roles and appearances that they believe are appropriate. Up until 4 years of age, children think that long hair and dresses determine whether you are a boy or girl. By 6 years, children’s gender understanding is more sophisticated and goes over and beyond outward appearances. They know that changing clothes and hair does not change boys into girls and vice versa. They are already demonstrating an understanding of what it means to be essentially a boy or a girl. p.99 – Teachers perpetuate gender stereotypes. In mixed classes, boys are more likely to volunteer answers, receive more attention from teachers, and girls report lower self-esteem than boys, but it’s not because they are less able. According to the 2007 U.K. National Office of Statistics, girls outperform boys at all levels of education from preschool right through to university. p.140 – post hoc, ergo propter hoc, which translates from Latin as “after this, therefore because of this. It is particularly obvious in superstitious behaviors. Superstitions are typically found in situations in which an element of risk exists. Rituals provide the individual with an illusion of control that they are doing something to influence outcomes when in fact they have no control whatsoever. If you remove an individual’s perception of control, then he experiences uncertain situations as stressful, thereby generating anxiety that impairs both the immune system and the capacity to think clearly. Enacting superstitious rituals inoculates us from the negative excesses of stress. This is why you often find superstitious behavior in dangerous occupations. p.152 – Children who thought their performance was all down to hard work not only stuck longer on the third task, but also enjoyed it more. So it’s better to tell your kids that they are hard workers rather than simply smart. The same can be said for free will. When we believe that we are the masters of our own destiny, we behave differently than those who deny the existence of free will and believe everything is determined. p.153 – Workers who believe in free will outperform their colleagues, and this is recognized and rewarded by their supervisors. So, when we believe in free will, we enjoy life more. We like people who are decisive because we believe they are positive and driven, and that makes most of us feel more comfortable than does someone who can’t seem to reach a decision. p.158 – Cognitive dissonance, a term coined by Leon Festinger in 1957, is the process of self-justification whereby we defend our actions and thoughts when they turn out to be wrong or, as in the case of sour grapes, ineffectual. p.160 – Cognitive dissonance protects the self from conflicting stories and is at the heart of why the self illusion is so important, but it also reveals the dangers that a strong sense of self can create. We use it to justify faulty reasoning. Although we do not appreciate it, our decision-making is actually the constellation of many processes vying for attention and in constant conflict. We fail to consider just how much of our decision-making is actually out of our control. p.167 – Not all depression us the same in its origins, but it is statistically more common among the poor and deprived in our society. One theory is that it is not so much that poverty is the root cause but rather the circumstances that having no wealth entails – the inability of individuals to do anything about their lives. The obvious solution is to empower people with choices. Some would argue that this is what wealth really brings – the opportunity to make choices and not be shackled to a life you can’t escape. If nothing changes no matter what you do, you have the basics of despair. The need for control appears to be fairly important for both physical and mental health. "
163,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2612588-candace,3,"This was an interesting survey of the evidence from psychology and neuropsychology for the idea that our much-coveted sense of self is an illusion that our brain creates. Specifically, the author feels that it is our social interactions that most determine our selves (as we can have different selves in different social or work-related settings). Some of the evidence for this kind of went over my autistic spectrum head. I did come to understand a bit better why I was getting beaten up in school every day back in junior high, given how oblivious I was to the strong social and hormonal currents then swirling around me, but if I am honest, as someone who could be viewed as socially retarded, arguments about self as a sheerly social construct are hard for me to wrap my head around. Still it was an interesting book, filled with interesting examples and vignettes. It seemed to meander a bit near the end, but overall, it was a worthwhile read."

What I considered to be the main downside of this book was corrected very shortly afterwards, and the story continued on a very high note.Considerable parts of this were more biochemical than I would normally appreciate, but it did seem as if the author put considerable effort into making things understandable. Similarly, his examples -- though not very different if one has read a number of other self/mind/psychology works -- were as illustrative as one could hope. Overall, I feel that the main value of this work is in the way Mr Hood highlights which functions are instinctive/inherited/uncontrollable even though we are primed to think that we have some control.

A little out of date now, so the latest findings may be missing. Written in a way suitable for a layman, but without seeming too dumbed down (to this layman).I wasn't entirely convinced that my sense of having a self is an illusion created by my brain. I think that is going too far, but what he did convince me of is that many of the ways in which I experience my self are not necessarily 'real'.The narration by the author was good.

This guy just doesn’t have the athletic mind and wit to take on the complex and nuanced subject matter of how we as humans are merely organic machines and not half as individual and self governing as we think we are."

Hood didn't organize his thoughts into a cohesive picture of his thesis. It reads like something closer to a polished outline, all the research is there and it's orderly, but each section feels like its own little island. The research is interesting, and with a little effort you'll understand what he's trying to say, but it's just not up to the level it could have been."

188,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15394714-luiz,4,"I first heard of Bruce Hood from Maria Poppova, on a brainpickings post, almost a year ago. This was right before going on my second trip to India. In this article, Poppova presented many interesting ideas from this author and recommended The Self Illusion for those interested in understanding the self as an entity derived from a biological phenomenon that is the mind. An electrical fish creates electrical waves to avert predators, we primates use the electrical discharges of our neurological system to create our spirit and thus our self. This idea, despite simple, was very striking on me. I immediately ordered the book, but since it would be shipped from overseas it didn’t make till left to India. Given the impossibility of bringing the book on my trip, I decided to buy other publication available in the local market. Then I stumbled upon to his other book SuperSense which argues how we tend to trick ourselves turning the unbelievable into believable. This reading couldn’t be more appropriate while having a “spiritual” trip through the Indian subcontinent. Religion is undeniable powerful and it take advantages on people’s incapability to accept that their ego is as perishable as their body. People need to believe that through religious transcendence, magic is plausible and death is not a definite event. It is an important social manifestation since it can calm the spirit from its anxieties regarding its origins and its ends. Religion works to split the material phenomena which is the body from its electrical phenomena from where comes the mind, therefore it can trick the ego when it faces despair and death. Hood maintain that everyone is born with a tendency to have this ""Super Sense"" and social institutions, such as religion, profits on that. I still think that any religion mythology is a rich source of insights for human psyche and for how it dealt since our even our ignorant and “enlightened” society still lacks for peace of the soul like the first Neandhertal did. Consequently, it helped me to better understand the spiritual experiences I had not only in this trip but also with my later Ayhuasca experience. Where my divine experience was realizing that there is a much bigger force than me and that I am just a machine as full of grace, blood, meat and bones that will stay alive during an amount of time impossible to totally grasp the origins its origins even with all the clear evidences of the absence of magic and super creator. Besides, the topics discussed are all a vanguard on neuroscience the text is very well written and fluid, making the reading experience more interesting. With this in mind, I started reading the Self Illusion three weeks ago. The book was very helpful to better understand the dynamics that ego creates to justify itSELF and how we are tricked to believe that we transcend our body. Like his previous books, Hood present empirical evidence based on common sense life events of and the last brain science discoveries supported by philosophers (such as Daniel Dennet) and cognitive psychologists (Pinker and Kahnemann).He asserts that THE SELF is not programmed to identify itself. That's why many animals from Birds to Dogs or even we, when little, take some time to understand what is our reflection on mirrors. He also argues about the window of opportunity of brain development, such as a chick is programed to identify its mom to follow to and from to the nest. Identically in the Super Sense, Bruce Hood argues again how babes when born don't have a clear sight, they just want to absorbe as much information as possible, they don't know exactly the shapes of heads of their moms just like chicks don't know who to follow, despite knowing they have to follow. Therefore, the evidence would suggest that like for Noam Chosmky we have built-in traits genetically evolved and inherited to identify the sources of security to better deal with natural selection imposed by the environment. An illusion is not what it seems and for most of us, we consider our self as some essential core of who we are. For example, most us think that we see the world continuously throughout the waking day when in fact we only see a fraction of the world in front of us, and because the brain blanks out our visual experience every time we move our eyes in a process called saccadic suppression, we are effectively blind for at least 2 hrs of the day. Although the brain is just a loom of electric neurons and contradictory impulses, the self makes us whole how the singularity of the self emerges from the cacophony of mind and the mess of social life	he self – this entity at the center of our personal universe – is actually just a story, a “constructed narrative”.Our brains think in stories. The same is true for the self and I use a distinction that William James drew between the self as “I” and “me.” Our consciousness of the self in the here and now is the “I” and most of the time, we experience this as being an integrated and coherent individual – a bit like the character in the story. The self which we tell others about, is autobiographical or the “me”. The neuroscience supports the claim that self is constructed readily confabulate an explanation to reconcile information unconsciously processed with information that was conscious Ramachandran describes patients who are paralyzed but deny they have a problem. These are all extreme clinical cases but the same is true of normal people. Nietzsche said it first: “My hypothesis is the subject as multiplicity,” we really just a collection of “splinters and mosaics”. We have no direct contact with reality because everything we experience is an abstracted version of reality that has been through the processing machinery of our brains to produce experience. If the human condition it is not materialist, then an alternative good explanation must be non-materialist. Show me good evidence for souls and spirits and then I will be forced to change my view about how plausible is the hypothesis on how supernatural entities can inhabit our bodies. In contrast, we know that if you alter the physical state of the brain through a head injury, dementia or drugs, each of these changes our self and, thus, easily to promote the necessary delusions to make god possible.Nietzsche said it first: “My hypothesis is the subject as multiplicity,” we are just a collection of “splinters and mosaics”. As the philosopher Gilbert Ryle pointed out, when it comes to the mind you cannot be both the hunter and the hunted. I think that he is saying that the brain creates both the mind and the experience of mind. An illusion is not what it seems and for most of us, we consider our self as some essential core of who we are. Deconstruction of the Self Illusion is hard to pin down since we consider our self as some essential core of who we are."
189,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10228055-derek,3,"This was an interesting read, but didn't exactly convince me that my self doesn't exist. The author claims that the self is an illusion that is difficult to shake...probably because, as he also acknowledges, the self is conjured by our interactions with our environment. The mind is wired to make sense of our experience and use memories to predict future states of whatever system we want to focus on. To give a concrete example - a mind wired mostly in comfort and a mind wired mostly in abuse will predict different outcomes upon meeting a stranger and definitely not respond in the same way. The self is created by the brain's machinations which are shaped by the body's experience of reality.Further, reasoning that ""having the quality of existing in a person's mind"" is equal to ""being illusory"" ends in solipsism, and you should never trust solipsists.Even further, picking my nose in private just means that I know there are social repercussions for picking my nose in public, not that I'm a different person and that my sense of self is schizophrenically splinteredStill though, I enjoyed reading this book and thinking through the ideas it presented. That's the reason for the third star."
190,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1961193-tim-atkinson,4,"This relatively small book (the footnotes and there further reading at the end pack a mean page punch!) took surprisingly long to read not because it wasn't fascinating, frightening and frankly astonishing in equal measure but because... it was so damn, small. I mean, the font. It can't have been more than about ten point and that, I'm afraid, to 'my' eyes (the eyes of the controlling self that doesn't exist, the eyes of the 'me' that is no more than a mere neurological and evolutionary illusion) just can't cope with anything that small anymore. Well, they could if it was slightly less technically demanding than this - which isn't to say Hood's writing is obscure: far from it. But the philosophical and psychological implications of his writing - combined with the empirical evidence for his conclusions - make it a prime candidate for reading on the Kindle, in my opinion. If only I had. Still, worth getting the end if only to discover that I'd probably actually got there before I realised I had, just like I chose the book before 'choosing' it (so-to-speak) and that my understanding of it precedes (by nano-seconds) my knowing or realising that I've understood it. Yes, it really is that kind of book. "
191,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28415586-jeff-powers,4,"A fantastic exploration into how our minds construct not only the world around us but our place in it. Building off a wealth of knowledge and exploration into modern philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology, Hood plumbs the depths of our understanding of who we are and how much control we actually have over our ""selves"". Incredible eye opening, but not for those who stand on shaky ground with the full implications of such existential explorations. The greatest value of this book is that it does all this without falling into the lazy trap of nihilism. A life without purpose or meaning still has value, even if that self and that value are fictional constructs. As Hood puts it. Just because you understand that a brick is made of tiny particles spread out far enough to make the object mostly empty space, that isn't going to keep you from ducking if someone throws it at your head.Hands down one of the best modern pop science books I have read on the intersection of neural science and philosophy."
192,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22994712-katrina-sark,2,"p.5 – There are three major types of neurons. Sensory neurons respond to information picked from the environment through our senses. Motor neurons relay information that controls out movement outputs. But it is the third class of neuron that makes up the majority – the interneurons, which connect the input and the output of the brain into an internal network where all the really clever stuff happens. It is this internal network that stores information and performs all the operations that we recognize as higher thought processes.p.52 – Our infant attachment patterns appear to influence our emotional attachment to partners later in life. Those infants who develop a normal pattern of wanting their mother and then settling easily back in when they are reunited are more likely to go on to form relatively stable relationships as adults. They find it relatively easy to get close to others and are comfortable being dependent on others and having others depend on them. They do not worry about being abandoned and are comfortable in intimate relationships. In contrast, those who had formed an insecure attachment to their mothers are either too needy and clingy for fear of being abandoned or, if they were avoidant as infants, they typically do not want to get too close to others or allow others to get close to them. p.63 – The mirror neuron system was originally discovered by accident in the laboratories of the Italian neuropsychologist, Giancomo Rizzolatti, in the 1990s. p.65 – Mirror neurons are part of the reason that we enjoy watching movies and plays. When we watch others, we can experience their emotions directly. When we empathize with the emotions of others, we feel their pain and joy. p.83 – Our identity is a sum of our memories, but it turns out that memories are fluid, modified by context and sometimes simply confabulated. This means we cannot trust them. And our sense of self is compromised. Note how this leaves us with a glaring paradox – without a sense of self, memories have no meaning, and yet the self is a product of our memories. p.98 – by 2 years of age, most children easily identify with their own gender and the roles and appearances that they believe are appropriate. Up until 4 years of age, children think that long hair and dresses determine whether you are a boy or girl. By 6 years, children’s gender understanding is more sophisticated and goes over and beyond outward appearances. They know that changing clothes and hair does not change boys into girls and vice versa. They are already demonstrating an understanding of what it means to be essentially a boy or a girl. p.99 – Teachers perpetuate gender stereotypes. In mixed classes, boys are more likely to volunteer answers, receive more attention from teachers, and girls report lower self-esteem than boys, but it’s not because they are less able. According to the 2007 U.K. National Office of Statistics, girls outperform boys at all levels of education from preschool right through to university. p.140 – post hoc, ergo propter hoc, which translates from Latin as “after this, therefore because of this. It is particularly obvious in superstitious behaviors. Superstitions are typically found in situations in which an element of risk exists. Rituals provide the individual with an illusion of control that they are doing something to influence outcomes when in fact they have no control whatsoever. If you remove an individual’s perception of control, then he experiences uncertain situations as stressful, thereby generating anxiety that impairs both the immune system and the capacity to think clearly. Enacting superstitious rituals inoculates us from the negative excesses of stress. This is why you often find superstitious behavior in dangerous occupations. p.152 – Children who thought their performance was all down to hard work not only stuck longer on the third task, but also enjoyed it more. So it’s better to tell your kids that they are hard workers rather than simply smart. The same can be said for free will. When we believe that we are the masters of our own destiny, we behave differently than those who deny the existence of free will and believe everything is determined. p.153 – Workers who believe in free will outperform their colleagues, and this is recognized and rewarded by their supervisors. So, when we believe in free will, we enjoy life more. We like people who are decisive because we believe they are positive and driven, and that makes most of us feel more comfortable than does someone who can’t seem to reach a decision. p.158 – Cognitive dissonance, a term coined by Leon Festinger in 1957, is the process of self-justification whereby we defend our actions and thoughts when they turn out to be wrong or, as in the case of sour grapes, ineffectual. p.160 – Cognitive dissonance protects the self from conflicting stories and is at the heart of why the self illusion is so important, but it also reveals the dangers that a strong sense of self can create. We use it to justify faulty reasoning. Although we do not appreciate it, our decision-making is actually the constellation of many processes vying for attention and in constant conflict. We fail to consider just how much of our decision-making is actually out of our control. p.167 – Not all depression us the same in its origins, but it is statistically more common among the poor and deprived in our society. One theory is that it is not so much that poverty is the root cause but rather the circumstances that having no wealth entails – the inability of individuals to do anything about their lives. The obvious solution is to empower people with choices. Some would argue that this is what wealth really brings – the opportunity to make choices and not be shackled to a life you can’t escape. If nothing changes no matter what you do, you have the basics of despair. The need for control appears to be fairly important for both physical and mental health. "
193,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2612588-candace,3,"This was an interesting survey of the evidence from psychology and neuropsychology for the idea that our much-coveted sense of self is an illusion that our brain creates. Specifically, the author feels that it is our social interactions that most determine our selves (as we can have different selves in different social or work-related settings). Some of the evidence for this kind of went over my autistic spectrum head. I did come to understand a bit better why I was getting beaten up in school every day back in junior high, given how oblivious I was to the strong social and hormonal currents then swirling around me, but if I am honest, as someone who could be viewed as socially retarded, arguments about self as a sheerly social construct are hard for me to wrap my head around. Still it was an interesting book, filled with interesting examples and vignettes. It seemed to meander a bit near the end, but overall, it was a worthwhile read."

What I considered to be the main downside of this book was corrected very shortly afterwards, and the story continued on a very high note.Considerable parts of this were more biochemical than I would normally appreciate, but it did seem as if the author put considerable effort into making things understandable. Similarly, his examples -- though not very different if one has read a number of other self/mind/psychology works -- were as illustrative as one could hope. Overall, I feel that the main value of this work is in the way Mr Hood highlights which functions are instinctive/inherited/uncontrollable even though we are primed to think that we have some control.

A little out of date now, so the latest findings may be missing. Written in a way suitable for a layman, but without seeming too dumbed down (to this layman).I wasn't entirely convinced that my sense of having a self is an illusion created by my brain. I think that is going too far, but what he did convince me of is that many of the ways in which I experience my self are not necessarily 'real'.The narration by the author was good.

This guy just doesn’t have the athletic mind and wit to take on the complex and nuanced subject matter of how we as humans are merely organic machines and not half as individual and self governing as we think we are."

Hood didn't organize his thoughts into a cohesive picture of his thesis. It reads like something closer to a polished outline, all the research is there and it's orderly, but each section feels like its own little island. The research is interesting, and with a little effort you'll understand what he's trying to say, but it's just not up to the level it could have been."

Some of the studies mentioned contains some fascinating stuff, but the author doesn't really make much of his case. Also, the last two chapters of the book spend way to much time explaining, the Internet, the World Wide Web, Facebook, and Twitter.

An illusion is not what it seems and for most of us, we consider our self as some essential core of who we are. For example, most us think that we see the world continuously throughout the waking day when in fact we only see a fraction of the world in front of us, and because the brain blanks out our visual experience every time we move our eyes in a process called saccadic suppression, we are effectively blind for at least 2 hrs of the day. Although the brain is just a loom of electric neurons and contradictory impulses, the self makes us whole how the singularity of the self emerges from the cacophony of mind and the mess of social life	he self – this entity at the center of our personal universe – is actually just a story, a “constructed narrative”.Our brains think in stories. The same is true for the self and I use a distinction that William James drew between the self as “I” and “me.” Our consciousness of the self in the here and now is the “I” and most of the time, we experience this as being an integrated and coherent individual – a bit like the character in the story. The self which we tell others about, is autobiographical or the “me”. The neuroscience supports the claim that self is constructed readily confabulate an explanation to reconcile information unconsciously processed with information that was conscious Ramachandran describes patients who are paralyzed but deny they have a problem. These are all extreme clinical cases but the same is true of normal people. Nietzsche said it first: “My hypothesis is the subject as multiplicity,” we really just a collection of “splinters and mosaics”. We have no direct contact with reality because everything we experience is an abstracted version of reality that has been through the processing machinery of our brains to produce experience. If the human condition it is not materialist, then an alternative good explanation must be non-materialist. Show me good evidence for souls and spirits and then I will be forced to change my view about how plausible is the hypothesis on how supernatural entities can inhabit our bodies. In contrast, we know that if you alter the physical state of the brain through a head injury, dementia or drugs, each of these changes our self and, thus, easily to promote the necessary delusions to make god possible.Nietzsche said it first: “My hypothesis is the subject as multiplicity,” we are just a collection of “splinters and mosaics”. As the philosopher Gilbert Ryle pointed out, when it comes to the mind you cannot be both the hunter and the hunted. I think that he is saying that the brain creates both the mind and the experience of mind. An illusion is not what it seems and for most of us, we consider our self as some essential core of who we are. Deconstruction of the Self Illusion is hard to pin down since we consider our self as some essential core of who we are."

The author claims that the self is an illusion that is difficult to shake...probably because, as he also acknowledges, the self is conjured by our interactions with our environment. The mind is wired to make sense of our experience and use memories to predict future states of whatever system we want to focus on. To give a concrete example - a mind wired mostly in comfort and a mind wired mostly in abuse will predict different outcomes upon meeting a stranger and definitely not respond in the same way. The self is created by the brain's machinations which are shaped by the body's experience of reality.Further, reasoning that ""having the quality of existing in a person's mind"" is equal to ""being illusory"" ends in solipsism, and you should never trust solipsists.Even further, picking my nose in private just means that I know there are social repercussions for picking my nose in public, not that I'm a different person and that my sense of self is schizophrenically splinteredStill though, I enjoyed reading this book and thinking through the ideas it presented.

I mean, the font. It can't have been more than about ten point and that, I'm afraid, to 'my' eyes (the eyes of the controlling self that doesn't exist, the eyes of the 'me' that is no more than a mere neurological and evolutionary illusion) just can't cope with anything that small anymore. Well, they could if it was slightly less technically demanding than this - which isn't to say Hood's writing is obscure: far from it. But the philosophical and psychological implications of his writing - combined with the empirical evidence for his conclusions - make it a prime candidate for reading on the Kindle, in my opinion. If only I had. Still, worth getting the end if only to discover that I'd probably actually got there before I realised I had, just like I chose the book before 'choosing' it (so-to-speak) and that my understanding of it precedes (by nano-seconds) my knowing or realising that I've understood it. Yes, it really is that kind of book. "

Building off a wealth of knowledge and exploration into modern philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology, Hood plumbs the depths of our understanding of who we are and how much control we actually have over our ""selves"". Incredible eye opening, but not for those who stand on shaky ground with the full implications of such existential explorations. The greatest value of this book is that it does all this without falling into the lazy trap of nihilism. A life without purpose or meaning still has value, even if that self and that value are fictional constructs. As Hood puts it. Just because you understand that a brick is made of tiny particles spread out far enough to make the object mostly empty space, that isn't going to keep you from ducking if someone throws it at your head.Hands down one of the best modern pop science books I have read on the intersection of neural science and philosophy."
222,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22994712-katrina-sark,2,"p.5 – There are three major types of neurons. Sensory neurons respond to information picked from the environment through our senses. Motor neurons relay information that controls out movement outputs. But it is the third class of neuron that makes up the majority – the interneurons, which connect the input and the output of the brain into an internal network where all the really clever stuff happens. It is this internal network that stores information and performs all the operations that we recognize as higher thought processes.p.52 – Our infant attachment patterns appear to influence our emotional attachment to partners later in life. Those infants who develop a normal pattern of wanting their mother and then settling easily back in when they are reunited are more likely to go on to form relatively stable relationships as adults. They find it relatively easy to get close to others and are comfortable being dependent on others and having others depend on them. They do not worry about being abandoned and are comfortable in intimate relationships. In contrast, those who had formed an insecure attachment to their mothers are either too needy and clingy for fear of being abandoned or, if they were avoidant as infants, they typically do not want to get too close to others or allow others to get close to them. p.63 – The mirror neuron system was originally discovered by accident in the laboratories of the Italian neuropsychologist, Giancomo Rizzolatti, in the 1990s. p.65 – Mirror neurons are part of the reason that we enjoy watching movies and plays. When we watch others, we can experience their emotions directly. When we empathize with the emotions of others, we feel their pain and joy. p.83 – Our identity is a sum of our memories, but it turns out that memories are fluid, modified by context and sometimes simply confabulated. This means we cannot trust them. And our sense of self is compromised. Note how this leaves us with a glaring paradox – without a sense of self, memories have no meaning, and yet the self is a product of our memories. p.98 – by 2 years of age, most children easily identify with their own gender and the roles and appearances that they believe are appropriate. Up until 4 years of age, children think that long hair and dresses determine whether you are a boy or girl. By 6 years, children’s gender understanding is more sophisticated and goes over and beyond outward appearances. They know that changing clothes and hair does not change boys into girls and vice versa. They are already demonstrating an understanding of what it means to be essentially a boy or a girl. p.99 – Teachers perpetuate gender stereotypes. In mixed classes, boys are more likely to volunteer answers, receive more attention from teachers, and girls report lower self-esteem than boys, but it’s not because they are less able. According to the 2007 U.K. National Office of Statistics, girls outperform boys at all levels of education from preschool right through to university. p.140 – post hoc, ergo propter hoc, which translates from Latin as “after this, therefore because of this. It is particularly obvious in superstitious behaviors. Superstitions are typically found in situations in which an element of risk exists. Rituals provide the individual with an illusion of control that they are doing something to influence outcomes when in fact they have no control whatsoever. If you remove an individual’s perception of control, then he experiences uncertain situations as stressful, thereby generating anxiety that impairs both the immune system and the capacity to think clearly. Enacting superstitious rituals inoculates us from the negative excesses of stress. This is why you often find superstitious behavior in dangerous occupations. p.152 – Children who thought their performance was all down to hard work not only stuck longer on the third task, but also enjoyed it more. So it’s better to tell your kids that they are hard workers rather than simply smart. The same can be said for free will. When we believe that we are the masters of our own destiny, we behave differently than those who deny the existence of free will and believe everything is determined. p.153 – Workers who believe in free will outperform their colleagues, and this is recognized and rewarded by their supervisors. So, when we believe in free will, we enjoy life more. We like people who are decisive because we believe they are positive and driven, and that makes most of us feel more comfortable than does someone who can’t seem to reach a decision. p.158 – Cognitive dissonance, a term coined by Leon Festinger in 1957, is the process of self-justification whereby we defend our actions and thoughts when they turn out to be wrong or, as in the case of sour grapes, ineffectual. p.160 – Cognitive dissonance protects the self from conflicting stories and is at the heart of why the self illusion is so important, but it also reveals the dangers that a strong sense of self can create. We use it to justify faulty reasoning. Although we do not appreciate it, our decision-making is actually the constellation of many processes vying for attention and in constant conflict. We fail to consider just how much of our decision-making is actually out of our control. p.167 – Not all depression us the same in its origins, but it is statistically more common among the poor and deprived in our society. One theory is that it is not so much that poverty is the root cause but rather the circumstances that having no wealth entails – the inability of individuals to do anything about their lives. The obvious solution is to empower people with choices. Some would argue that this is what wealth really brings – the opportunity to make choices and not be shackled to a life you can’t escape. If nothing changes no matter what you do, you have the basics of despair. The need for control appears to be fairly important for both physical and mental health. "
223,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2612588-candace,3,"This was an interesting survey of the evidence from psychology and neuropsychology for the idea that our much-coveted sense of self is an illusion that our brain creates. Specifically, the author feels that it is our social interactions that most determine our selves (as we can have different selves in different social or work-related settings). Some of the evidence for this kind of went over my autistic spectrum head. I did come to understand a bit better why I was getting beaten up in school every day back in junior high, given how oblivious I was to the strong social and hormonal currents then swirling around me, but if I am honest, as someone who could be viewed as socially retarded, arguments about self as a sheerly social construct are hard for me to wrap my head around. Still it was an interesting book, filled with interesting examples and vignettes. It seemed to meander a bit near the end, but overall, it was a worthwhile read."

What I considered to be the main downside of this book was corrected very shortly afterwards, and the story continued on a very high note.Considerable parts of this were more biochemical than I would normally appreciate, but it did seem as if the author put considerable effort into making things understandable. Similarly, his examples -- though not very different if one has read a number of other self/mind/psychology works -- were as illustrative as one could hope. Overall, I feel that the main value of this work is in the way Mr Hood highlights which functions are instinctive/inherited/uncontrollable even though we are primed to think that we have some control.

A little out of date now, so the latest findings may be missing. Written in a way suitable for a layman, but without seeming too dumbed down (to this layman).I wasn't entirely convinced that my sense of having a self is an illusion created by my brain.

Hood didn't organize his thoughts into a cohesive picture of his thesis. It reads like something closer to a polished outline, all the research is there and it's orderly, but each section feels like its own little island.

Some of the studies mentioned contains some fascinating stuff, but the author doesn't really make much of his case. Also, the last two chapters of the book spend way to much time explaining, the Internet, the World Wide Web, Facebook, and Twitter.

248,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15394714-luiz,4,"I first heard of Bruce Hood from Maria Poppova, on a brainpickings post, almost a year ago. This was right before going on my second trip to India. In this article, Poppova presented many interesting ideas from this author and recommended The Self Illusion for those interested in understanding the self as an entity derived from a biological phenomenon that is the mind. An electrical fish creates electrical waves to avert predators, we primates use the electrical discharges of our neurological system to create our spirit and thus our self. This idea, despite simple, was very striking on me. I immediately ordered the book, but since it would be shipped from overseas it didn’t make till left to India. Given the impossibility of bringing the book on my trip, I decided to buy other publication available in the local market. Then I stumbled upon to his other book SuperSense which argues how we tend to trick ourselves turning the unbelievable into believable. This reading couldn’t be more appropriate while having a “spiritual” trip through the Indian subcontinent. Religion is undeniable powerful and it take advantages on people’s incapability to accept that their ego is as perishable as their body. People need to believe that through religious transcendence, magic is plausible and death is not a definite event. It is an important social manifestation since it can calm the spirit from its anxieties regarding its origins and its ends. Religion works to split the material phenomena which is the body from its electrical phenomena from where comes the mind, therefore it can trick the ego when it faces despair and death. Hood maintain that everyone is born with a tendency to have this ""Super Sense"" and social institutions, such as religion, profits on that. I still think that any religion mythology is a rich source of insights for human psyche and for how it dealt since our even our ignorant and “enlightened” society still lacks for peace of the soul like the first Neandhertal did. Consequently, it helped me to better understand the spiritual experiences I had not only in this trip but also with my later Ayhuasca experience. Where my divine experience was realizing that there is a much bigger force than me and that I am just a machine as full of grace, blood, meat and bones that will stay alive during an amount of time impossible to totally grasp the origins its origins even with all the clear evidences of the absence of magic and super creator. Besides, the topics discussed are all a vanguard on neuroscience the text is very well written and fluid, making the reading experience more interesting. With this in mind, I started reading the Self Illusion three weeks ago. The book was very helpful to better understand the dynamics that ego creates to justify itSELF and how we are tricked to believe that we transcend our body. Like his previous books, Hood present empirical evidence based on common sense life events of and the last brain science discoveries supported by philosophers (such as Daniel Dennet) and cognitive psychologists (Pinker and Kahnemann).He asserts that THE SELF is not programmed to identify itself. That's why many animals from Birds to Dogs or even we, when little, take some time to understand what is our reflection on mirrors. He also argues about the window of opportunity of brain development, such as a chick is programed to identify its mom to follow to and from to the nest. Identically in the Super Sense, Bruce Hood argues again how babes when born don't have a clear sight, they just want to absorbe as much information as possible, they don't know exactly the shapes of heads of their moms just like chicks don't know who to follow, despite knowing they have to follow. Therefore, the evidence would suggest that like for Noam Chosmky we have built-in traits genetically evolved and inherited to identify the sources of security to better deal with natural selection imposed by the environment. An illusion is not what it seems and for most of us, we consider our self as some essential core of who we are. For example, most us think that we see the world continuously throughout the waking day when in fact we only see a fraction of the world in front of us, and because the brain blanks out our visual experience every time we move our eyes in a process called saccadic suppression, we are effectively blind for at least 2 hrs of the day.

But the philosophical and psychological implications of his writing - combined with the empirical evidence for his conclusions - make it a prime candidate for reading on the Kindle, in my opinion. If only I had. Still, worth getting the end if only to discover that I'd probably actually got there before I realised I had, just like I chose the book before 'choosing' it (so-to-speak) and that my understanding of it precedes (by nano-seconds) my knowing or realising that I've understood it. Yes, it really is that kind of book. "

Building off a wealth of knowledge and exploration into modern philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology, Hood plumbs the depths of our understanding of who we are and how much control we actually have over our ""selves"". Incredible eye opening, but not for those who stand on shaky ground with the full implications of such existential explorations. The greatest value of this book is that it does all this without falling into the lazy trap of nihilism. A life without purpose or meaning still has value, even if that self and that value are fictional constructs. As Hood puts it. Just because you understand that a brick is made of tiny particles spread out far enough to make the object mostly empty space, that isn't going to keep you from ducking if someone throws it at your head.Hands down one of the best modern pop science books I have read on the intersection of neural science and philosophy."
252,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22994712-katrina-sark,2,"p.5 – There are three major types of neurons. Sensory neurons respond to information picked from the environment through our senses. Motor neurons relay information that controls out movement outputs. But it is the third class of neuron that makes up the majority – the interneurons, which connect the input and the output of the brain into an internal network where all the really clever stuff happens. It is this internal network that stores information and performs all the operations that we recognize as higher thought processes.p.52 – Our infant attachment patterns appear to influence our emotional attachment to partners later in life. Those infants who develop a normal pattern of wanting their mother and then settling easily back in when they are reunited are more likely to go on to form relatively stable relationships as adults. They find it relatively easy to get close to others and are comfortable being dependent on others and having others depend on them. They do not worry about being abandoned and are comfortable in intimate relationships. In contrast, those who had formed an insecure attachment to their mothers are either too needy and clingy for fear of being abandoned or, if they were avoidant as infants, they typically do not want to get too close to others or allow others to get close to them. p.63 – The mirror neuron system was originally discovered by accident in the laboratories of the Italian neuropsychologist, Giancomo Rizzolatti, in the 1990s. p.65 – Mirror neurons are part of the reason that we enjoy watching movies and plays. When we watch others, we can experience their emotions directly. When we empathize with the emotions of others, we feel their pain and joy. p.83 – Our identity is a sum of our memories, but it turns out that memories are fluid, modified by context and sometimes simply confabulated. This means we cannot trust them. And our sense of self is compromised. Note how this leaves us with a glaring paradox – without a sense of self, memories have no meaning, and yet the self is a product of our memories. p.98 – by 2 years of age, most children easily identify with their own gender and the roles and appearances that they believe are appropriate. Up until 4 years of age, children think that long hair and dresses determine whether you are a boy or girl. By 6 years, children’s gender understanding is more sophisticated and goes over and beyond outward appearances. They know that changing clothes and hair does not change boys into girls and vice versa. They are already demonstrating an understanding of what it means to be essentially a boy or a girl. p.99 – Teachers perpetuate gender stereotypes. In mixed classes, boys are more likely to volunteer answers, receive more attention from teachers, and girls report lower self-esteem than boys, but it’s not because they are less able. According to the 2007 U.K. National Office of Statistics, girls outperform boys at all levels of education from preschool right through to university. p.140 – post hoc, ergo propter hoc, which translates from Latin as “after this, therefore because of this. It is particularly obvious in superstitious behaviors. Superstitions are typically found in situations in which an element of risk exists. Rituals provide the individual with an illusion of control that they are doing something to influence outcomes when in fact they have no control whatsoever. If you remove an individual’s perception of control, then he experiences uncertain situations as stressful, thereby generating anxiety that impairs both the immune system and the capacity to think clearly. Enacting superstitious rituals inoculates us from the negative excesses of stress. This is why you often find superstitious behavior in dangerous occupations. p.152 – Children who thought their performance was all down to hard work not only stuck longer on the third task, but also enjoyed it more. So it’s better to tell your kids that they are hard workers rather than simply smart. The same can be said for free will. When we believe that we are the masters of our own destiny, we behave differently than those who deny the existence of free will and believe everything is determined. p.153 – Workers who believe in free will outperform their colleagues, and this is recognized and rewarded by their supervisors. So, when we believe in free will, we enjoy life more. We like people who are decisive because we believe they are positive and driven, and that makes most of us feel more comfortable than does someone who can’t seem to reach a decision. p.158 – Cognitive dissonance, a term coined by Leon Festinger in 1957, is the process of self-justification whereby we defend our actions and thoughts when they turn out to be wrong or, as in the case of sour grapes, ineffectual. p.160 – Cognitive dissonance protects the self from conflicting stories and is at the heart of why the self illusion is so important, but it also reveals the dangers that a strong sense of self can create. We use it to justify faulty reasoning. Although we do not appreciate it, our decision-making is actually the constellation of many processes vying for attention and in constant conflict. We fail to consider just how much of our decision-making is actually out of our control. p.167 – Not all depression us the same in its origins, but it is statistically more common among the poor and deprived in our society. One theory is that it is not so much that poverty is the root cause but rather the circumstances that having no wealth entails – the inability of individuals to do anything about their lives. The obvious solution is to empower people with choices. Some would argue that this is what wealth really brings – the opportunity to make choices and not be shackled to a life you can’t escape. If nothing changes no matter what you do, you have the basics of despair. The need for control appears to be fairly important for both physical and mental health. "
253,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2612588-candace,3,"This was an interesting survey of the evidence from psychology and neuropsychology for the idea that our much-coveted sense of self is an illusion that our brain creates. Specifically, the author feels that it is our social interactions that most determine our selves (as we can have different selves in different social or work-related settings). Some of the evidence for this kind of went over my autistic spectrum head. I did come to understand a bit better why I was getting beaten up in school every day back in junior high, given how oblivious I was to the strong social and hormonal currents then swirling around me, but if I am honest, as someone who could be viewed as socially retarded, arguments about self as a sheerly social construct are hard for me to wrap my head around. Still it was an interesting book, filled with interesting examples and vignettes. It seemed to meander a bit near the end, but overall, it was a worthwhile read."

What I considered to be the main downside of this book was corrected very shortly afterwards, and the story continued on a very high note.Considerable parts of this were more biochemical than I would normally appreciate, but it did seem as if the author put considerable effort into making things understandable. Similarly, his examples -- though not very different if one has read a number of other self/mind/psychology works -- were as illustrative as one could hope. Overall, I feel that the main value of this work is in the way Mr Hood highlights which functions are instinctive/inherited/uncontrollable even though we are primed to think that we have some control.

A little out of date now, so the latest findings may be missing. Written in a way suitable for a layman, but without seeming too dumbed down (to this layman).I wasn't entirely convinced that my sense of having a self is an illusion created by my brain. I think that is going too far, but what he did convince me of is that many of the ways in which I experience my self are not necessarily 'real'.The narration by the author was good.

Hood didn't organize his thoughts into a cohesive picture of his thesis. It reads like something closer to a polished outline, all the research is there and it's orderly, but each section feels like its own little island.

The reader isn't lead along to the authors way of thinking. The chapters are more or less just a collection of behavioral studies and the results of those studies. Some of the studies mentioned contains some fascinating stuff, but the author doesn't really make much of his case. Also, the last two chapters of the book spend way to much time explaining, the Internet, the World Wide Web, Facebook, and Twitter.

278,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15394714-luiz,4,"I first heard of Bruce Hood from Maria Poppova, on a brainpickings post, almost a year ago. This was right before going on my second trip to India. In this article, Poppova presented many interesting ideas from this author and recommended The Self Illusion for those interested in understanding the self as an entity derived from a biological phenomenon that is the mind. An electrical fish creates electrical waves to avert predators, we primates use the electrical discharges of our neurological system to create our spirit and thus our self. This idea, despite simple, was very striking on me. I immediately ordered the book, but since it would be shipped from overseas it didn’t make till left to India. Given the impossibility of bringing the book on my trip, I decided to buy other publication available in the local market. Then I stumbled upon to his other book SuperSense which argues how we tend to trick ourselves turning the unbelievable into believable. This reading couldn’t be more appropriate while having a “spiritual” trip through the Indian subcontinent. Religion is undeniable powerful and it take advantages on people’s incapability to accept that their ego is as perishable as their body. People need to believe that through religious transcendence, magic is plausible and death is not a definite event. It is an important social manifestation since it can calm the spirit from its anxieties regarding its origins and its ends. Religion works to split the material phenomena which is the body from its electrical phenomena from where comes the mind, therefore it can trick the ego when it faces despair and death. Hood maintain that everyone is born with a tendency to have this ""Super Sense"" and social institutions, such as religion, profits on that. I still think that any religion mythology is a rich source of insights for human psyche and for how it dealt since our even our ignorant and “enlightened” society still lacks for peace of the soul like the first Neandhertal did. Consequently, it helped me to better understand the spiritual experiences I had not only in this trip but also with my later Ayhuasca experience. Where my divine experience was realizing that there is a much bigger force than me and that I am just a machine as full of grace, blood, meat and bones that will stay alive during an amount of time impossible to totally grasp the origins its origins even with all the clear evidences of the absence of magic and super creator. Besides, the topics discussed are all a vanguard on neuroscience the text is very well written and fluid, making the reading experience more interesting. With this in mind, I started reading the Self Illusion three weeks ago. The book was very helpful to better understand the dynamics that ego creates to justify itSELF and how we are tricked to believe that we transcend our body. Like his previous books, Hood present empirical evidence based on common sense life events of and the last brain science discoveries supported by philosophers (such as Daniel Dennet) and cognitive psychologists (Pinker and Kahnemann).He asserts that THE SELF is not programmed to identify itself. That's why many animals from Birds to Dogs or even we, when little, take some time to understand what is our reflection on mirrors. He also argues about the window of opportunity of brain development, such as a chick is programed to identify its mom to follow to and from to the nest. Identically in the Super Sense, Bruce Hood argues again how babes when born don't have a clear sight, they just want to absorbe as much information as possible, they don't know exactly the shapes of heads of their moms just like chicks don't know who to follow, despite knowing they have to follow. Therefore, the evidence would suggest that like for Noam Chosmky we have built-in traits genetically evolved and inherited to identify the sources of security to better deal with natural selection imposed by the environment. An illusion is not what it seems and for most of us, we consider our self as some essential core of who we are. For example, most us think that we see the world continuously throughout the waking day when in fact we only see a fraction of the world in front of us, and because the brain blanks out our visual experience every time we move our eyes in a process called saccadic suppression, we are effectively blind for at least 2 hrs of the day. Although the brain is just a loom of electric neurons and contradictory impulses, the self makes us whole how the singularity of the self emerges from the cacophony of mind and the mess of social life	he self – this entity at the center of our personal universe – is actually just a story, a “constructed narrative”.Our brains think in stories. The same is true for the self and I use a distinction that William James drew between the self as “I” and “me.” Our consciousness of the self in the here and now is the “I” and most of the time, we experience this as being an integrated and coherent individual – a bit like the character in the story. The self which we tell others about, is autobiographical or the “me”. The neuroscience supports the claim that self is constructed readily confabulate an explanation to reconcile information unconsciously processed with information that was conscious Ramachandran describes patients who are paralyzed but deny they have a problem. These are all extreme clinical cases but the same is true of normal people. Nietzsche said it first: “My hypothesis is the subject as multiplicity,” we really just a collection of “splinters and mosaics”. We have no direct contact with reality because everything we experience is an abstracted version of reality that has been through the processing machinery of our brains to produce experience. If the human condition it is not materialist, then an alternative good explanation must be non-materialist. Show me good evidence for souls and spirits and then I will be forced to change my view about how plausible is the hypothesis on how supernatural entities can inhabit our bodies. In contrast, we know that if you alter the physical state of the brain through a head injury, dementia or drugs, each of these changes our self and, thus, easily to promote the necessary delusions to make god possible.Nietzsche said it first: “My hypothesis is the subject as multiplicity,” we are just a collection of “splinters and mosaics”. As the philosopher Gilbert Ryle pointed out, when it comes to the mind you cannot be both the hunter and the hunted. I think that he is saying that the brain creates both the mind and the experience of mind. An illusion is not what it seems and for most of us, we consider our self as some essential core of who we are. Deconstruction of the Self Illusion is hard to pin down since we consider our self as some essential core of who we are."
279,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10228055-derek,3,"This was an interesting read, but didn't exactly convince me that my self doesn't exist. The author claims that the self is an illusion that is difficult to shake...probably because, as he also acknowledges, the self is conjured by our interactions with our environment. The mind is wired to make sense of our experience and use memories to predict future states of whatever system we want to focus on. To give a concrete example - a mind wired mostly in comfort and a mind wired mostly in abuse will predict different outcomes upon meeting a stranger and definitely not respond in the same way. The self is created by the brain's machinations which are shaped by the body's experience of reality.Further, reasoning that ""having the quality of existing in a person's mind"" is equal to ""being illusory"" ends in solipsism, and you should never trust solipsists.Even further, picking my nose in private just means that I know there are social repercussions for picking my nose in public, not that I'm a different person and that my sense of self is schizophrenically splinteredStill though, I enjoyed reading this book and thinking through the ideas it presented.

If you remove an individual’s perception of control, then he experiences uncertain situations as stressful, thereby generating anxiety that impairs both the immune system and the capacity to think clearly. Enacting superstitious rituals inoculates us from the negative excesses of stress. This is why you often find superstitious behavior in dangerous occupations. p.152 – Children who thought their performance was all down to hard work not only stuck longer on the third task, but also enjoyed it more. So it’s better to tell your kids that they are hard workers rather than simply smart. The same can be said for free will. When we believe that we are the masters of our own destiny, we behave differently than those who deny the existence of free will and believe everything is determined. p.153 – Workers who believe in free will outperform their colleagues, and this is recognized and rewarded by their supervisors. So, when we believe in free will, we enjoy life more. We like people who are decisive because we believe they are positive and driven, and that makes most of us feel more comfortable than does someone who can’t seem to reach a decision. p.158 – Cognitive dissonance, a term coined by Leon Festinger in 1957, is the process of self-justification whereby we defend our actions and thoughts when they turn out to be wrong or, as in the case of sour grapes, ineffectual. p.160 – Cognitive dissonance protects the self from conflicting stories and is at the heart of why the self illusion is so important, but it also reveals the dangers that a strong sense of self can create. We use it to justify faulty reasoning. Although we do not appreciate it, our decision-making is actually the constellation of many processes vying for attention and in constant conflict. We fail to consider just how much of our decision-making is actually out of our control. p.167 – Not all depression us the same in its origins, but it is statistically more common among the poor and deprived in our society. One theory is that it is not so much that poverty is the root cause but rather the circumstances that having no wealth entails – the inability of individuals to do anything about their lives. The obvious solution is to empower people with choices. Some would argue that this is what wealth really brings – the opportunity to make choices and not be shackled to a life you can’t escape. If nothing changes no matter what you do, you have the basics of despair. The need for control appears to be fairly important for both physical and mental health. "
283,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2612588-candace,3,"This was an interesting survey of the evidence from psychology and neuropsychology for the idea that our much-coveted sense of self is an illusion that our brain creates. Specifically, the author feels that it is our social interactions that most determine our selves (as we can have different selves in different social or work-related settings). Some of the evidence for this kind of went over my autistic spectrum head. I did come to understand a bit better why I was getting beaten up in school every day back in junior high, given how oblivious I was to the strong social and hormonal currents then swirling around me, but if I am honest, as someone who could be viewed as socially retarded, arguments about self as a sheerly social construct are hard for me to wrap my head around. Still it was an interesting book, filled with interesting examples and vignettes. It seemed to meander a bit near the end, but overall, it was a worthwhile read."
284,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5397189-koit,5,"This was a very slow start, with me, during the first chapter, very much looking for useful examples to add to the narrative. What I considered to be the main downside of this book was corrected very shortly afterwards, and the story continued on a very high note.Considerable parts of this were more biochemical than I would normally appreciate, but it did seem as if the author put considerable effort into making things understandable. Similarly, his examples -- though not very different if one has read a number of other self/mind/psychology works -- were as illustrative as one could hope. Overall, I feel that the main value of this work is in the way Mr Hood highlights which functions are instinctive/inherited/uncontrollable even though we are primed to think that we have some control. "
285,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85825923-ivanopinion,4,"Really interesting survey of brain science. He pulls together a vast range of psychological research, much of which I had heard of, but was happy to read an understandable explanation of. A little out of date now, so the latest findings may be missing. Written in a way suitable for a layman, but without seeming too dumbed down (to this layman).I wasn't entirely convinced that my sense of having a self is an illusion created by my brain. I think that is going too far, but what he did convince me of is that many of the ways in which I experience my self are not necessarily 'real'.The narration by the author was good. It felt like sitting in on one of his lectures."
286,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14392480-jaime-mozo-dutton,2,"Given the subject matter, and how much I personally buy into the idea of the illusion of self, this guy had to really drop a turd to turn me off this book... and that he did.... merely a collection of statistics, disjointed anecdotes about clinical or social studies and in some instance blatant regurgitation of better books... This guy just doesn’t have the athletic mind and wit to take on the complex and nuanced subject matter of how we as humans are merely organic machines and not half as individual and self governing as we think we are."
287,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81699805-jonathan-williams,4,"Great job by Bruce Hood as he tackles areas of biology, neuroscience, evolution, philosophy, psychology, and sociology in a fantastic book. Good provides a great introduction into the various areas that create the illusory self, mainly the sense of freedom in our actions. Finally, he touches on how technology and social media has created another illusory sense of identity.Written in a simple yet clear language, Hood tackles this problem splendidly. This book is a must for any entitled individual in the 21st century "
288,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27921245-sam,4,"This book poses a lot of questions about what it means to make your own choices, who you are, etc. It's eye-opening; I found myself unconsciously thinking about much of what I'd read going about my day to day life, and I think that's a good standard for any neuroscience book to live up to.I do have one major criticism however. Hood didn't organize his thoughts into a cohesive picture of his thesis. It reads like something closer to a polished outline, all the research is there and it's orderly, but each section feels like its own little island. The research is interesting, and with a little effort you'll understand what he's trying to say, but it's just not up to the level it could have been."
289,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24675464-roxanna,3,"Fascinating premise well supported with research but I struggled to finish this book - plenty of ""whats"" and ""hows"" but somehow lacks the ""so what"". So what if our self is really an illusion? How differently do I need to live my life? I wished that the author at least spent more time exploring this."
290,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11757496-mukesh-kumar,5,"Hardcore science writing! Not a breezy read, you will have to pause and think through because of the sheer volume of experimental/research data that the author throws around.Imagine an episode of VSauce...on steroids...and a 1000 times over, that is how the book is.Oh and by the way, Mr Bruce Hood consumes everything in pop culture! "
291,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11620807-heather,5,"An excellent book that I'd highly recommend. Bruce Hood convincingly argues that while we are hard-wired to sense a 'self' specific to us, a concrete thing that we know and understand, each of us is actually composed of an ever-changing bundle of memories, experiences, influences and ideas about our own identities."
292,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9432103-katie,5,I loved it! Don't read it unless you're prepared to challenge yourself. it's solidified a lot of other concepts I'm familiar with but didn't fully understand. we construct a story around our identity and we like to believe things about ourselves that aren't true.
293,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11804274-moses,4,"author cited many medical conditions, psychological and social experiments to argue that it's a illusion that we have a consistent inner self. who we think we are are made up, influenced and as a result of social interactions."

295,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14604576-alex-kenjeev,2,I mean there’s nothing wrong with this book. Its easy to read and engaging enough. It’s just that the same points are argued better and more precisely elsewhere. I guess that’s not the author’s fault but here we are
296,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52807056-cheyne,5,"Fantastic, I really enjoyed the academic study heavy type of book and basically being a meta-analysis. These are the types of books I crave where the reader can learn more and more about the mind in a detailed rich text. "
297,1780338729,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96593313-chau-nguyen,3,"From very good to averageI liked the first half , interesting facts about brain, behaviour, etc. 2nd half was focused more on social media and tools of interaction, however as it was written almost 10 years ago many things became obsolete.
