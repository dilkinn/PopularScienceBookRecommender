0,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25642731-paul-r-fleischman,2,"	This book confuses an abstract existential truth with psychological reality. It has no originality, and is potentially destructive to suffering people or as literature for their psychotherapeutic guides. 	The main argument of this book is that the sense of self is an illusion. The entire volume is a polemic organized around this single point. Of course it is true that nothing in the universe is enduring and permanent, since even the universe is not. But Bruce Hood confuses the kind of thinking that led the Buddha to claim that human beings have no eternal enduring self (in contrast to religious claims of an enduring soul) with the importance and validity of the psychological self, which is just as real and important as our bodies. 	The idea that the self is predominantly a social construction, mirrored back to us as we develop through childhood, from parents, peers, and surrounding culture, is a long established truism in Western psychology. This idea was not entirely new in the 19th century when George Herbert Mead promoted it in many books and essays. Freudian thinking was also based upon the idea of a socially developed self that gained definition through reflection from others. Heinz Kohut made the importance of mirroring, and interpersonal development of the self, a hallmark of modern psychoanalytic thinking. “The Self Illusion” ignores these widely known and widely read precedents in order to claim an apparent break-through in psychology. 	Most of this book consists of anecdotes, social psychological experiments, and neuro-psychology to refute the straw-man hypothesis that the human self consists of an isolated, uniform entity. No one believes in such an entity. 	The importance of the psychological self to modern psychotherapists, and to each one of us as individuals, is that our existence requires a synthesizing, organizing, integrating, dynamic, responsive regulator of the multiple inputs that we receive. Instead of consisting of random responses, or externally controlled dependencies, every healthy human being contains a networked, interactionally complexified executive, that provides some coherence to personality, while permitting variability and situational responsiveness. Ironically, Bruce Hood provides some very fine writing on this very point. He talks about the sense of self as a “web,” a “culmination of the interaction of a multitude of hidden factors ranging from genetic inheritance, life experiences, current circumstances…patterns of neuronal activity in the brain…a matrix of distributed networks…” and he adds, “…The resulting sums of these complex interactions are the decisions and choices that I make.” He reminds us that the human being, “has complexity impossible to predict” and “almost infinite brain states.” As he accurately tells us, there is “no core self at the helm.” But there is in fact the integrating system he has so cogently defined. 	Much of this book consists of compounding evidence that this self is inconsistent, forgetful, subject to external influence, and otherwise non-uniform. None of these are logical arguments against the existence of the self. The evidence Bruce Hood brings to bear actually shows us what a richly endowed, porous, absorptive, responsive, and a subtle brew the self is. The fact that the United States is influenced by the economies of Mexico and the Euro zone is not evidence that the United States does not exist. The fact that the United States has politics that are conflictual and contradictory, does not mean that the United States does not exist.	The sense of self is as important to psychological health as the sense of embodied self is to maintaining physical health. The sense of self is built over layered platforms of biology, culture and situation, and is not fully controlled by, nor co-terminus with, any of its antecedents, because it is a complex emergent state of almost infinite interactions, with multiple origins, and graded peripheries. It is not eternal and enduring, but it is no more fictional than our temporary bodies, trees, books, or planet Earth, which is also impermanent. Our sense of self is not “Atta,” the eternal soul, so the Buddha taught we are “Anatta,” without an eternal soul, but our psychological self is a key attribute of our mental and physical health, personal well being, and social contribution, and can neither be discovered, nor dismissed by the black and white thinking, existence versus non-existence, to which Bruce Hood has subjected it. 	As a psychotherapist who spent a lifetime helping people realize an adaptive, flexible, rich, complex, nuanced, multi-layered, sense of self, I cannot recommend this simple and linear psychology book with its pretension to originality and its inability to discern motile realities.Reviewed by: Paul R.

1,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,3,"This book questions our notion of self and identity, arguing they are shaped far more by other people and environments than we care to admit. Not only that, it takes this notion further….. saying that myriad impulses in the brain are what really control us – impulses which operate in our unconscious or subconscious – rather than any “self” which seems to be in the driving seat. That ‘self’ is just the mouthpiece. A convenient construct that our brains have engineered to pull all the variables together into a cohesive whole.I am surprisingly unperturbed by all of this. I’ve had several experiences of the subconscious which make me amenable to the idea of a cacophony of inner voices – with only one voice reaching consciousness at any one time. The book suggests that we are under the impression that we think consciously, but our thinking is really done for us, before it reaches consciousness. It questions the notion of free will.The author also argues that we are hugely influenced by other people, and by the situations in which we find ourselves. Memories, ostensibly so important to us, can also be very misleading.The sum of these proposals? Our ideas of selfhood are misguided. The notion of “self” is an illusion.But, but, but, but…. I see such strong and individual personalities in the the people around me; even between siblings there are enormous differences. And in myself – mainly via my appalling weaknesses (all those broken new year’s resolutions!), I see a tenacity of ways of being that I am happy enough to call “self”. Self may not be perfect, but it’s good enough for me.This book was enjoyable though. I particularly liked the way it made me question environmental influences and social pressures (people pleasing). I think I had underestimated the influence of these things.The author quotes a lot of other people’s research projects, some of which are well known, but some of which were new to me, and I found interesting. Here are some of my favourite snips (not necessarily relevant to the discussion about self).(view spoiler)[

That is why good nurturing in early childhood is so important.Brains account for 2% of body weight, but they use up to 20% of metabolic energy. It has been estimated that a chess grand-master can burn up to 6,000 to 7,000 calories during a game.We need our big brains in order to be sociable, in order to negotiate society, rather than just for intellectual reasons.Only about one in ten people can be hypnotized easily.Glucose is a vital fluid for the brain.

Those who believe in free will are usually able to give a much better performance than those who believe in fatalism and determinism. The latter undermine motivation.Humans have not evolved to consider facts based on large amounts of data. Rather we operate with heuristics – fast and dirty rules of thumb that generally serve us well.In the US social anxiety is the number one anxiety problem and the third most common mental disorder.

He uses the analogy of a Kanizsa triangle to illustrate the idea that the ""self"" is carved out of the negative space created by social and cultural interactions. It's an interesting analogy but as far as I can tell it doesn't lead anywhere. If there's a better account of this concept somewhere please point me toward it - I'd love to have the dots connected if the connections are there to be made.The self is an illusion? As far as I can tell, this means one of several things:1) We don't have a subjective experience of the world or are not aware of our own existence. As best I can define a ""self"", it becomes a meaningful word when applied to an entity with self-awareness. Thus the self would be an illusion if we do not have subjective experience. This is my best attempt to translate into plain English. But it's nonsense, so, moving on.2) We don't have free will. I'm not sure how it relates to the notion of the self -- even if I don't have free will, I feel as if I do -- but to the extent that we define ourselves as creatures of will, the argument that free will does not exist may translate to the book's thesis. This would make a more interesting book, but doesn't seem to be what Hood means. The book spends a little time on free will, but fails to clearly draw the distinction between this and option 3.3) We have less than perfect control over our thoughts and actions. This is what the meat of the book actually supports. If this is what you mean by ""the self is an illusion"" then I guess I agree with your premise but disagree with your choice of words.But Hood doesn't really tell us what he means. The ""Kanizsa triangle"" analogy is whipped out at the last minute and presented as though it's the culmination of the entire book. There are interesting arguments to be had about the self as an illusion (let's start by defining our terms), but Hood doesn't go there.After discarding the philosophical angle, what's left is a shallow skim of virtually every psychological study that has ever suggested that we may not be 100% in control of our thoughts and actions at all times. And yeah, it's interesting stuff if you don't happen to be already familiar with it."

His writing is easy to read and keeps one engrossed. However, he has simply woven together different studies and research findings with few inputs of his own. This book is a more interesting version of a psychology textbook. Any reader who is already familiar with the major theories of psychology will be familiar with most of the content in this book. The answer to the main question of why the self is an illusion has been narrated with examples of research. Rather, he could have provided more inputs of his own for this issue. Also, too many aspects of the science of the mind have been covered such that the reader feels like he is only taking quick stops at different points without getting a chance to analyze a few things in-depth.To conclude, if you are fascinated by the mind and psychology and are new to concepts involving both, this book will help you get a glimpse of the main areas. But if you want a detailed and profound discussion on anything, this book only provides with little hints to piece together the discussion yourself."

The same old studies and the same old stories - the marshmallow study of emotional intelligence, the stories of brain injuries and illnesses and how they affect people - I've read them all. The very first part about how our brains work was mildly interesting, but soon the author got into the same old rut.

6,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9599138-mark,1,"This book ought to be titled 'The self illusion illusion' as it's an illusion that Hood has addressed the issue of the self illusion.This is such a disappointing book, considering the potential of the subject matter. I hoped for a detailed exposition on 'why there is no you inside your head' (the book subtitle). Maybe some neuroscientific perspective necessarily spliced with the appropriate philosophy, whether its Parfit's, Hume's or even Buddha's view on the absence of a self. What I got was a load of very basic science stories and some unlettered philosophy. The book basically consists of anecdotes, generally about babies (and most of these anecdotes you would have seen better expounded by other popular science authors), disjointedly hoping to show that there is no single, enduring self. This is a LONG WAY from establishing that the self does not exist and that there is no 'you' inside your head. Examination of the self has traditionally been a philosophical issue but there's little philosophy here and where it exists it's incredibly elementary. Hood has missed the chance to engage with the existing philosophy and reconcile it with the current neuroscience and cognitive science. It's true that the anecdotes occasionally mention some philosophical names (much to my ephemeral delight), but they are ultimately nothing more than a name drop before he proceeds to the next disjointed anecdote.Don't waste your time or money unless you want some very fluffy scientific stories about babies."
7,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5136053-marc-nash,3,"The last chapter summarises the whole book in such a clear and concise way, you almost don't have to read all the preceding chapters and you'll still be able to see the argument. The preceding chapters have lots of scientific and anecdotal vignettes, but I feel they are never tied in to the overall argument.As to the argument itself, I started from a basic shared position with the author that the notion of self or ego is nothing but an illusion, but I found his arguments for that unconvincing. He posits that because we gain experience and knowledge through the social transmission as children, plus as adults we show different sides of ourselves in different social situations, therefore our sense of self is entirely constructed through social means and reflecting others around us. I don't buy that at all, yes others can partly shape our sense of self, but they do not determine it entirely. And the contribution of language as both a unique form of self-expression and yet also an illusory way of encountering and explaining the world and our position in it, only merited a brief treatment within the first chapter. Real/unreal or illusion are first and foremost verbal constructs that need defining."

I learnt that we have more than one blind spot in our eyes, they're actually the size of lemons. What people say to you, even if it is only online affects you and makes you feel vulnerable. We have many parts to ourselves, scientists believe we are not our only selves, we are made up of ""l"", ""me"", ""my"", ""mine"", ""your"", ""our"" and ""us"".I actually ended up liking this more than I thought I would.

My second from author Bruce Hood, after his 2009 book SuperSense: Why We Believe in the Unbelievable.I must admit that I liked that one much more than this one, unfortunately...The writing and contents of this book never met the high water mark he established in ""Supersense"", to my disappointment.""The Self Illusion"" is a cursory trek through psychology and social psychology. Hood covers most of the bases here; the neuroanatomy of the brain, facial recognition, social and anti-social behavior, Milgram's experiments, Witman's tumor, free will, left-brain/right-brain splits, the Big Five personality traits, and many more.The writing here was decent. Although this book is right up my alley, I sadly didn't find anything new in here that I had not previously read about in multiple other books. This is my biggest criticism of this book.So, my recommendation would depend on your level of literacy on these topics. If you've heard everything I listed above before, then you probably won't find too much new or interesting in these pages. For those not too familiar with psychology or social psychology, this book would make a great primer.3.5 stars."
10,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1571969-billie-pritchett,4,"I read popular science constantly, so I was largely familiar with the psychological and neurophysiological examples that Bruce Hood gave in his book The Self Illusion, yet I had never thought about these examples in the way that Hood has. Hood has provided a beautiful synthesis of (some) familiar examples in the psychological literature to argue that the idea that human beings have a sense of self is an illusion. He writes that this of course does not mean that it ""does not exist."" By way of analogy, one common illusion that human beings have is that we see everything there is to be seen in our visual field. Strictly speaking, this isn't true. We have a blind spot, which was an area in our eye which literally allows us to see nothing. But what vision does for us is it interprets whatever would have been in the blind spot as similar enough to whatever is next to it, similar enough in shape and color. And so we never realize that there is nothing there that we're not seeing because our mind and visual system has filled in the gap. So, that we see everything in our visual field is a pervasive illusion, but of course that does not mean that it isn't real or mere fantasy.Hood argues that like this blind spot, this illusion of self is an illusion we live by. For instance, I bet now, right now while you're reading this, you are probably experience a sense of self. If I were to ask you to point to where you feel like ""You"" are in your body, I could take a good guess about where you'd point: probably to your forehead, somewhere there, in between your eyes. But of course there is no ""You"" there. This is an illusion, generated by your brain, that tells you that a Little Man or Little Woman sits up there and controls your body's actions. It is kind of mind-blowing when you realize that this sense of self isn't true. And far from being disheartening, it seems to me actually enlivening. It's a reminder that this sense of ego that we have is just a way that human bodies have adapted to process information and interact with other people and the environment. When people realize that this is a kind of fabrication, a necessary illusion we must live with, perhaps we could do a better job getting over ourselves and thinking the Little Man or Little Woman in our noggin is so important."

But for myself, I found both what I consider an excessive number of typos and a writing style that at times felt a bit formulaic, and so can honestly say I only ""liked this book.""What I like most is that the book offers an investigation and deconstruction of the ""self illusion"" from the socially constructed side. There are many books that detail how the sense of self is created from the neuronal level up (for instance, the work of Antonio D'Amasio is excellent for this) but this book takes the approach from the macro-side: how even the barest sense of individual subjectivity must and does arise from the mirroring we receive from others. As the influential zen poem, ""Trust in Mind"" puts it: ""subject is subject because of object; object is object because of subject.""In our culture, which hypervalorizes individuality, we are taught to be blinded by just how our sense of self is constructed by our social relations. In fact, when politicians like Pres. Obama point out that successful bushiness people have built their success upon myriad causes and conditions such as other workers, infrastructure provided by the state etc. they are criticized as being ""anti-business!"" So, an important addition to the library of anyone interested in the science of consciousness as well as yoigis -- buddhist students in particular may find an entry into the buddha's teaching of anatta or ""not-self"" here."

14,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12174361-krishna,4,"Imagine a conference room. As we enter we see a motley crowd of individuals sitting around the table either alone or in small groups of twos and threes talking quietly to each other. A few messengers walk in and out carrying snippets of information from the outside world -- things heard and seen, gossip from the streets. All is quiet at the moment, but pandemonium can break out at any time. A messenger rushes in with some news, and suddenly the groups are galvanized into action. People shout across the table, push and pull at each other, scream in anger or fear. Some rush around the table tearing at their hair and clothes, and screaming at the top of their voice. Others form coalitions and struggle to control the more violent ones. And then a moment later, all is quiet again. As you spend more time in the room, you begin to notice particular individuals. There is the bleary-eyed, disheveled junkie at the bottom of the table, his arms wrapped around himself and rocking back and forth and mumbling quietly. There is the wild-eyed Cassandra, just a step short of panic, ready to fight or fly from danger. There is the green-eye-shaded accountant, disengaged from everyone else, coolly tabulating a list of numbers. The office flirt is walking around hitting on anyone who will give her a chance. There is the linguist at the window, chanting blank verse. There is no one in charge though, and whoever at any moment can shout the loudest, or put together the strongest coalition wins the day. But groups form and dissolve momentarily, and no one has the upper hand for very long. This is the picture of the brain that Bruce Hood paints in the Self Illusion. According to him, the brain is composed of fluidly interacting modules and sub-routines, more or less specializing in particular tasks, that are activated in response to external stimuli. It is a densely interconnected system of parts, with highly complex and indeterminate combinations. There is no essential ""self"" controlling this activity. Rather, what we perceive as the ""self"" is merely a post facto rationalization of the choices made by the interacting modules in the brain. The parts of the brain that regulate the specific functions include the supplementary motor area that controls movements, the Pre Frontal Cortex (PFC) that regulates decision-making, the anterior insula that helps discriminate between self and others, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) responsible for anxiety and the brain's ""alarm system,"" the amygdala that processes emotions, the caudate nucleus (CN) that initiates intentional actions, etc. Malfunctions of modules or connections between modules result in abnormal behaviors, such as Tourette's syndrome (uncontrollable tics and swearing), Cotard's syndrome (belief that the self is dead); autism (mind blindness); total absence of short term memory; obsessions and compulsions, and so on. Sometimes it is imbalance in activity between regions that causes specific behaviors: one current theory says that imbalance between the PFC, the ACC and the CN causes conditions such as Obsessive and Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The structure itself is formed as a result of environmental interactions. The strength of modules is not based on how big they are or how many neurons they have, but on how densely they are interconnected with other parts of the brain. The number of connections a part has is the outcome of early childhood experiences. In the developing infant brain, each neuron forms a huge number of axial connections with other neurons, but simultaneously cuts back these connections in a process called pruning. If two neurons do not fire together, their connection may be pruned back. This indicates how important sensory stimulation is in early childhood. Sense-deprived infants may not develop specific brain capabilities, because axial connections are not formed or are pruned back due to disuse. Feral children who miss the language window may not acquire linguistic abilities later in life, however well they are trained. Hood also extensively discusses social determinants of our brain processes. As evidenced by phenomena such as hypnosis, crowd psychology, social norms and deference to authority, we as members of a social species are uniquely suggestible and subject to peer pressure. Thus, what we think of as ""free will"" is really the outcome of brain processes we do not consciously comprehend, as conditioned by our social networks and culture. Hood's thesis of a fragmentary brain helps explain why some persons display inexplicable behaviors: why rich and famous movie stars should shoplift or solicit prostitutes, why an otherwise thoughtful and wise legislator should send pictures of his penis to women, why a billionaire daredevil should also be a germophobe, or why a monstrous dictator who sent millions to the gas chambers should also be a vegetarian and pet lover. It also explains our own behaviors, why we who manage entire work teams with confidence and wisdom should be driven up the wall by a spouse's casual criticism. In each interaction and social situation, different modules are activated and their complex and unpredictable interactions give rise to our emotional and behavioral responses. Advocates of a coherent, rational and semi-permanent self will be hard pressed to explain these multiple personalities. This book is written in a style accessible to the layperson, but it is backed by extensive research with over 50 pages of notes and close to 500 citations to peer reviewed literature. Some of this research is conducted by the author himself - Hood is an experimental psychologist whose specialty is developmental neuroscience (early childhood)."

I would have liked a deeper exploration of the first issue, with its attendant philosophical implications, but I did enjoy a review of the social psychological research into the latter. It was good to be updated on this field since when I studied psychology and the research, stories and anecdotes were enlightening and entertaining. It reaffirmed my view that psychology has taken up where philosophy left off, and that it provides a more insightful and pleasingly empirical analysis of the human experience."

You Are Not So Smart
 podcast and read it on my Kindle.It reeked of a mechanistic, sterile, matter-of-fact ""you are your brain"" worldview which I must admit I'm tired of and find boring, but I should have expected as much since You Are Not So Smart comes from pretty much the same mental place.I don't find fault with the idea that we don't have an integral self; obviously, just like Bruce Hood thoroughly and with rich supporting bibliography demonstrates in this book, we're largely shaped and influenced by our surroundings, our society and our biological limitations, first and foremost those of our brain. But that doesn't mean that the notion of self is an illusion; rather, it means that the self is not a constant and that it is mutable. In fact, in which case would the self not be an illusion? When would we be in a position to say that the self is a real, concrete, quantifiable thing?It seems to me that Mr. Hood's proposition could have just as easily been called ""The Soul Illusion"", for his assumption of what a self looks like--or should feel like--closely corresponds to our, for better or worse, highly intuitive notion of what a soul is: an immaterial cohesive agent between all of our experiences, thoughts and actions that creates a feeling of identity. In other words, the definition of the ""me"" in ""I am me"". But is that what the self is, what it should be or all it can be? Is it possible to define what our selves are differently? In ""I am me"", who would be the ""I""? Who is the consciousness, like Eckhart Tolle would comment with his ultra-calm voice? Who is it--what is it--that reads this book and goes ""huh, so I'm an illusion""? You might argue that the sense of self and consciousness are two separate things in order to question my qualms with the central point of the book; ""precisely!"", I'd exclaim then, happy that you could intuitively grasp my point.All that said, I'm giving The Self Illusion three stars instead of two because I must admit that it is well-researched, well-written and has plenty of interesting case studies of various psychological and psychiatrical disorders, ""nature vs nurture"", sociological phenomena etc that do a good job of proving that the concept of self, or at least what Mr. Hood understands it to be, is an illusion insofar as it's highly unpredictable and dependent on environmental and social factors. I particularly enjoyed reading about babies and how their brains develop and about conditions such as Tourette's and how miming, laughing and facial expressions work in socialising and the development thereof. All this is interesting and rich from a clinical perspective, so it's worth reading if you're out to come closer to understanding how the human brain works--a task I personally believe to be impossible anyway. But if you're not convinced that the brain is responsible for every little thing a person does, thinks, or thinks of doing, in view of the evidence that, contrary to what Mr. Hood quite often and emphatically repeats in the book, does exist, this book will provide little insight."
18,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7198893-jonathan-karmel,4,"The book Consciousness Explained, by Dan Dennett, set out the theory that there is no “self” directing what a person does. Your brain is the product of genetics and your environment, and it produces sensations, thoughts, and feelings, but the belief that there is a separate “you” that controls what your brain does is an illusion. Like every other aspect of human development, the emergence of the self is epigenetic – an interaction of the genes in the environment. The self emerges out of that journey through the epigenetic landscape, combining the legacy of your genetic inheritance with the influence of the early environment.This book is very similar to Waking Up, by Sam Harris and Why Buddhism is True, by Robert Wright. Sam Harris connects Dennett’s work to the Tibetan Buddhist teachings of Dzogchen, and Robert Wright connects Dennett’s work to the Buddhist concept of anatta (non-existence of one’s self). This book is relating Dennett’s work to findings of social psychologists and behavioral economists such as Daniel Kahneman and Dan Ariely.It is not the case that your self is an essential entity at the core of your existence that holds steady throughout your life. There is no “you” behind your eyeballs (or anywhere else) orchestrating your identity. If you think there’s a “you” inside your head, who is directing the you? If your answer is “nothing,” you are of the mistaken belief that there is a “ghost in the machine.” The concept that you are exercising “free will” is undermined by the fact that the “readiness potential” in your brain can be measured before you take action; in other words, your brain is telling you what to do, not the other way around.Over the course of your life, you have many different “selves.” You change over time, you act differently in different situations and with different people. Your nature is different when you are asleep, “under the influence,” or hypnotized. What makes you laugh? Are the thoughts inside your head “you” or the thoughts you express; what if you have Tourette’s? Your willpower often fails, and you often act impulsively – so who are you, the one attempting to exercise will, or the one acting impulsively? Is the addicted you the self, or is it the one trying to fight the addiction? The insanity defense is based on the concept that the crime wasn’t committed by the person’s “self,” but why not? Why do we act superstitious, even though we tell ourselves that we don’t believe the superstitions? Why are we unable to control obsessive-compulsions that we would prefer not to have? Usually, your left brain and right brain work together, but people who do not have a working corpus collosum have two separate selves, a left brain that controls their right side and a right brain that controls their left side. Do you want your fantasies to be true or not; do you know what your “self” wants? People live entirely different lives on the internet from “real life,” but which is the person’s actual “self”? If you “pretend” to be a certain way to get “likes” and “followers,” why is the “pretend” you not the real you?Your concept of yourself is greatly shaped by your beliefs about how others perceive you. Charles Horton Cooley explained that your identity is the result of seeing yourself the way that others see you (the looking-glass self). Humans generally act based on their beliefs about what others are thinking, and adolescents are especially influenced by what they believe others are thinking about them. Our beliefs about our “self” are often based on our status or based on the possessions that we own rather than anything inside ourselves. We often act as conformists who have a herd mentality or a hive mind and do not want to feel excluded, and the way we would act if we didn’t care what others thought would be completely different. People are influenced by their culture to the extent that “normal” people can easily be convinced to act in an “evil” way; this is the “banality of evil.”You are a product of your genes, your physical form, and your experiences. People with very deprived childhoods (e.g. the orphans of communist Rumania or people raised without vision or without human contact) are permanently and irrevocably affected. You have bundles of sensations, perceptions, thoughts, and then you construct a narrative to make sense of it. Mirror neurons make you feel other people’s pain, and yawning or vomiting can be contagious. Like Neo in the movie The Matrix, you have no direct connection to reality; you just know what your brain tells you. In a sense, we are our memories, but you experience so many sensations that it would be hard to remember anything if you didn’t have a “self” concept to help you figure out what information was relevant to you. Babies, who have not yet developed a “self” concept, do not form long-term memories, because they cannot integrate memories into meaningful stories. To have meaning, memories must be embedded within a “self.” Your memories are also inaccurate and subject to manipulation by others. Your conscious mind is a spin-doctor, not a commander in chief; it weaves a coherent narrative from your thoughts even when your thoughts create cognitive dissonance between your beliefs and new information. We rationalize when information does not fit existing beliefs or we repress or “forget” inconvenient truths.Authors such as Daniel Kahneman and Dan Ariely have explained the many cognitive biases that humans have, and that humans are predictably irrational. Our idea of our self is also based on these same biases and irrational beliefs.Interestingly, the author of this book believes that we should continue to believe the self illusion, not that we should accept reality. The self illusion serves a useful purpose. If you think about the “I” and the “me” that we usually refer to as the self, it provides a focal point to hang experiences together both in the immediate here and now, as well as to join those events over a lifetime. Experiences are fragmented episodes unless they are woven together in a meaningful narrative. The self illusion depends on a lifetime of memories that are constructed as we interpret the world. That interpretation is guided by mechanisms that seek out certain information in the world but also by those around us who help us to make sense of it all. In this way, we are continually shaped by those around us. We also treat others as individual selves. It is faster, more economical, and more efficient to treat others as a self rather than as a collection of brain activities. Just because something doesn’t really exist doesn’t mean that believing that it does is pointless. Fantasy doesn’t really exist but the world would be a much more impoverished place without storytelling. Those who reject the notion of a self in control of destiny, lead sadder, less satisfying lives. Those who embrace the self illusion feel fulfilled and purposeful.I thought this was an interesting book that will change my concept of my “self.”"

As long as the author writes about simple studies he tends to keep it scientific. A lot of well-known studies, most of us already have heard about, are introduced here. I always support people who present real science to the masses.Con:Unfortunately there is some lousy social science in this book too. We can't seem to avoid it. As I keep saying, 9/10 of social science books have these crappy outdated assumptions. The blank slate assumption rears its ugly head again and again even though no good social scientist really ought to believe in such silliness. And of course he uses correlations to prove causations several times over, but only when he tries to prove some blank slate hypothesis. That's horrible social science I really do not expect in a book about such a serious topic. But mostly it's explaining without assuming.Another bad thing here is that he doesn't seem to clearly explain why he is talking about this or that study at any one point. The studies are interesting, but his points are not made clear in large parts of the book. For example, he seems to at times say that the no-self theory depends on there being some blank slate. This makes no logical sense to me at all. He never really explains his thinking on this issue and I'm not sure if he believes in some black slate and therefore assumes it must mean something or if he just got lost in some other line of thinking.Conclusion:I don't believe that the self exists. I do think people should know that the self doesn't seem to exist and seems to be an illusion. No one has ever proven it exists or presented a valid self-theory. But this is not a book I could recommend to readers even though 90% of it is fine enough. If you read it it's not a bad thing. But unless you can think very critically about social science you will be tricked by some correlation proves causation thinking.Edit:The year is 2020. I still to this day recommend this book to readers who don't understand how the mind works. Just saying. I highly recommend this book. I will be rereading it because I feel like my review overlooked some good things in the book."

That was revolutionary. One of those rare best of the best ""aha! here's how that works!"" moments.This book explains it a bit more, for example, that ""self"" (as ""daemon"" or ""server"", just though off this definition) is ""switching"" to ""another"" (relatively, as probably there are no such clear boundaries) daemon depending on social environment, e.g. ""me"" basically is what others think about ""me"".I'm regretting I didn't choose to be a scientist as from my own intuition (and some psychedelics understanding) I was saying years ago that ""we"" don't exist, it is just reactions to to environment. Likewise if we had removed the body, there would be no emotions, no sensory input and as a consequence - no ""self"". (Like probably I had already mentioned with many misses in Sci-Fi where authors think that AI would have ""emotions"" like humans do).From that understanding came several practical things, which those books didn't mention, but I had realized. For example, IF ""self"" demon depends on sensory input, AND main purpose of a replicator is to survive, THEN any statism is ""death"" for ""self"" and dynamism is ""life"". Life is basically a motion. Move and you'll never experience unprofitable emotions for the ""self"". It works in an instant. Conversely, people who form static habits (the ""walking dead"") can't experience life in full and come into various mental problems.Maybe it's all about the most powerful daemon, but I'm not sure, probably not (not what you can read in books about ""will power"", something different and that interests me), as several times I was thinking ""something changed, I can't get what, I just woke up, probably I had traveled to parallel universe, as I remember Obama wasn't elected, where are my kids and lover gone, where I am..."", haha."
21,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5204364-ralph-jacob,3,"Hood does his best to demonstrate the book's central thesis without (over-)overwhelming those uninitiated into the convoluted realm that is neuro-psychology. The self is evidenced to not actually be the autonomously singular entity we all like to believe it is. Rather it is an emergent sum of various brain processes we do not control nor consciously know of. These processes, in turn, are heavily influenced by both nature and nurture--again, factors we have very little control over.Where this whole anecdote-laden cerebral adventure fails me is in cohesion in explaining how this leaves our existence with any real sense and purpose. Hood comes up with centuries' worth of irrefutable proof to show that we have very little to no free-will, that most of our decisions happen in a place we do not control, but that we need to believe in an illusion anyway because it's this illusion of the in-control self which has kept our species surviving through millenia. And while I get the message, it all begs asking the question: Are we then left to just submit to the idea that we are forever at the mercy of this tug-of- war between neuro-network activations? The book does askthis question a number of times but never really answers it.The problem with cohesion may actually say more about the book's publisher than the author himself, but my problem with the book's central proposal (or lack thereof) is likely telling of its intention to be a strictly psychological commentary and never a philosophical one.This still shouldn't undermine the enlightenment (even the awakening) the book offers on the nature of our 'neurally imagined' selves, but what then to do with this new knowledge is an entirely different matter better explored in movies like The Matrix."
22,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34564183-culadasa-yates,4,"Most of us believe that we have an independent, coherent self – an individual inside our head who thinks, watches, wonders, dreams, and makes plans for the future. This sense of our self may seem incredibly real, but a wealth of scientific evidence reveals that it is not what it seems – it is all an illusion.Hood tracks how the self emerges during childhood, during which time we not only learn from others, but learn to become like others. We learn to create a self, and, more importantly, to become different selves in different situations. The self is not one, but many. And no one of these selves is static or stable, but is in a fluid process of constant revision. Each self is constructed anew every time it gets resurrected, never quite the same from one time to the next. Not only is the self constructed rather than being something intrinsic or inherent, but the form it takes in the moment is largely determined by the behavior and attitudes of those around us. We don’t even choose the self we become, it is constructed in reaction to others. Hood does not deny our uniqueness or individuality, but points out that we exaggerate it in our own minds – we are far more alike than we prefer to believe.This is a useful primer for understanding intellectually how the doctrine of no-self can be true, although it does not address the deeper questions of, “if not this, then what?” and “how will knowing this make me happier?” But delusion must first be dispelled before it can be replaced by the wisdom that answers these questions."
23,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10487877-jeremy-hankins,2,"This book is much less about the self and how it's generated than it is about the tricks our minds play on us. As an argument for why we should not trust our intuitions about the nature of the self the book is solid, but there's little here to justify the author's conclusion: that since our intuitions aren't right about the self it's actually an illusion. Nor does he do much to justify his claim that the self is socially generated (a claim I'm generally inclined to agree with) other than give a laundry list of ways in which social interaction is important for development.Hood mentions the complex philosophical debates on the nature of the self but he doesn't do justice to even the well-known arguments on the subject. This is understandable, since he's neurologist not a philosopher, but it is a serious weakness in the stated goal of the book.It would have improved the book to leave out chapter 8, on the impact of the internet on the development of the self. It was mostly hand-waving and angst, worrying that the internet could have negative consequences for society without any concrete dangers or suggestions.Despite these shortcomings, the experimental evidence he covers that cast our reflective notions of self-hood into doubt are important and make salutary reading. This is an age that could use some serious examination of the nature of the self, and while this book doesn't live up to its title, it is a good start."

The hypothesis is that what we feel as ""self"" (Ie., the thing you are referring to when you talk about ""I"" or ""me"") is an illusion arising from your brain arranging all the data it receives into a coherent narrative. Much like the way we feel like we are seeing a continuous, coherent picture of the world with via our eyes but our vision is really a kludgy, imperfect (but sufficiently accurate) model of what's out there. (You can see that when you look at any number of optical illusions)The author takes a very materialistic stance. He doesn't shies away from saying souls don't exist but dismisses the notion that there is some inner me living inside our meatsacks (so to speak). So he doesn't really deny the existence of a self, just that the self is coherent thing that exists separate from the body. There are lots of neat anecdotes from neuroscience and psychology experiments but over all it didn't feel like he was really making his cases. Or maybe I'm just a lazy reader. But it felt like, ""Here are a lot of neat factoids, you figure out how this fits in my thesis"". Lots of pop culture references too. I think I would have liked a more technical book and definitely this needs a ""further reading"" section.But quite recommended if you are interested in the mind. "

Hood explores what it is that we think to be the Self.A telling comment of the book was: ""Note how this leaves us with a glaring paradox – without a sense of self, memories have no meaning, and yet the self is a product of our memories"" (p.83). The Self is comprised of self-organizing neurons creating pattern-seeking structures called the brain. This organ ""protects us from the true nature of the situation. Maybe this is why we do not see the cognitive illusions that create the self. Cognitive dissonance protects us from ruminating over failed goals, positive biases keep us motivated, free will gives us grounds for praise and blame, decision-making gives us the illusion of control"" (p.295).What I would like to read, I think, is some sort of explanation of why it seems that the result of our creation of a Self automatically creates the feeling of separation from our environment (and from each other) - why we feel inside our Self even when our Self is the creation of what is outside of us, of what we mirror. Very curious.And I wonder what an 'environmentalist' is as it relates to the Self? Nonetheless, this book was well written, relating much of what recent research is telling us about us."

He delves into lots of psychological research, most of which any psychology student is intimately familiar with already. Though it provides a lot of information, there are a number of other better books out there on similar subjects. It seemed more like a textbook throwing out information on study after study as opposed to connecting it well in a larger narrative. I also took issue with the end of the book where he discusses the influence of more recent things like social networking and their influences on people, but without any actual research to back up anything he is saying. The entire rest of the book he provides study after study to back up his assertions and then all of a sudden he throws this out there with no real research behind it. Instead it's just the speculation you see in all kinds of newspaper and magazine articles with no real hard science to back it. If you can't get enough of reading stuff like this then it's not a horrible book, but there are better books out there if you know nothing on the subject and if you do know something about the subject you're not going to find anything new here."

I love finding out how people/minds work, and this book was full of thought-provoking theories. I'm not sure I buy into all of them just yet, because I do personally believe in a soul that exists independently of the physical brain (and I'm not ready to relinquish my concept of self!) but I thoroughly enjoyed reading.

He stresses that this is a necessary illusion which has evolved to permit the organization of data from experience without overloading the brain's response mechanisms. We are fortunate to have a self for it allows us to remember, form goals and relate to others, so long as we realize that it is a creation of the brain and not evidence for an eternal soul.

In other words, a summation of what evidence has been gathered from chapter to chapter would've helped tie it all together better. Perhaps this too is an issue with the publisher.

Some of the studies mentioned contains some fascinating stuff, but the author doesn't really make much of his case. Also, the last two chapters of the book spend way to much time explaining, the Internet, the World Wide Web, Facebook, and Twitter.

38,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15394714-luiz,4,"I first heard of Bruce Hood from Maria Poppova, on a brainpickings post, almost a year ago. This was right before going on my second trip to India. In this article, Poppova presented many interesting ideas from this author and recommended The Self Illusion for those interested in understanding the self as an entity derived from a biological phenomenon that is the mind. An electrical fish creates electrical waves to avert predators, we primates use the electrical discharges of our neurological system to create our spirit and thus our self. This idea, despite simple, was very striking on me. I immediately ordered the book, but since it would be shipped from overseas it didn’t make till left to India. Given the impossibility of bringing the book on my trip, I decided to buy other publication available in the local market. Then I stumbled upon to his other book SuperSense which argues how we tend to trick ourselves turning the unbelievable into believable. This reading couldn’t be more appropriate while having a “spiritual” trip through the Indian subcontinent. Religion is undeniable powerful and it take advantages on people’s incapability to accept that their ego is as perishable as their body. People need to believe that through religious transcendence, magic is plausible and death is not a definite event. It is an important social manifestation since it can calm the spirit from its anxieties regarding its origins and its ends. Religion works to split the material phenomena which is the body from its electrical phenomena from where comes the mind, therefore it can trick the ego when it faces despair and death. Hood maintain that everyone is born with a tendency to have this ""Super Sense"" and social institutions, such as religion, profits on that. I still think that any religion mythology is a rich source of insights for human psyche and for how it dealt since our even our ignorant and “enlightened” society still lacks for peace of the soul like the first Neandhertal did. Consequently, it helped me to better understand the spiritual experiences I had not only in this trip but also with my later Ayhuasca experience. Where my divine experience was realizing that there is a much bigger force than me and that I am just a machine as full of grace, blood, meat and bones that will stay alive during an amount of time impossible to totally grasp the origins its origins even with all the clear evidences of the absence of magic and super creator. Besides, the topics discussed are all a vanguard on neuroscience the text is very well written and fluid, making the reading experience more interesting. With this in mind, I started reading the Self Illusion three weeks ago. The book was very helpful to better understand the dynamics that ego creates to justify itSELF and how we are tricked to believe that we transcend our body. Like his previous books, Hood present empirical evidence based on common sense life events of and the last brain science discoveries supported by philosophers (such as Daniel Dennet) and cognitive psychologists (Pinker and Kahnemann).He asserts that THE SELF is not programmed to identify itself. That's why many animals from Birds to Dogs or even we, when little, take some time to understand what is our reflection on mirrors. He also argues about the window of opportunity of brain development, such as a chick is programed to identify its mom to follow to and from to the nest. Identically in the Super Sense, Bruce Hood argues again how babes when born don't have a clear sight, they just want to absorbe as much information as possible, they don't know exactly the shapes of heads of their moms just like chicks don't know who to follow, despite knowing they have to follow. Therefore, the evidence would suggest that like for Noam Chosmky we have built-in traits genetically evolved and inherited to identify the sources of security to better deal with natural selection imposed by the environment. An illusion is not what it seems and for most of us, we consider our self as some essential core of who we are. For example, most us think that we see the world continuously throughout the waking day when in fact we only see a fraction of the world in front of us, and because the brain blanks out our visual experience every time we move our eyes in a process called saccadic suppression, we are effectively blind for at least 2 hrs of the day. Although the brain is just a loom of electric neurons and contradictory impulses, the self makes us whole how the singularity of the self emerges from the cacophony of mind and the mess of social life	he self – this entity at the center of our personal universe – is actually just a story, a “constructed narrative”.Our brains think in stories. The same is true for the self and I use a distinction that William James drew between the self as “I” and “me.” Our consciousness of the self in the here and now is the “I” and most of the time, we experience this as being an integrated and coherent individual – a bit like the character in the story. The self which we tell others about, is autobiographical or the “me”. The neuroscience supports the claim that self is constructed readily confabulate an explanation to reconcile information unconsciously processed with information that was conscious Ramachandran describes patients who are paralyzed but deny they have a problem. These are all extreme clinical cases but the same is true of normal people. Nietzsche said it first: “My hypothesis is the subject as multiplicity,” we really just a collection of “splinters and mosaics”. We have no direct contact with reality because everything we experience is an abstracted version of reality that has been through the processing machinery of our brains to produce experience. If the human condition it is not materialist, then an alternative good explanation must be non-materialist. Show me good evidence for souls and spirits and then I will be forced to change my view about how plausible is the hypothesis on how supernatural entities can inhabit our bodies. In contrast, we know that if you alter the physical state of the brain through a head injury, dementia or drugs, each of these changes our self and, thus, easily to promote the necessary delusions to make god possible.Nietzsche said it first: “My hypothesis is the subject as multiplicity,” we are just a collection of “splinters and mosaics”. As the philosopher Gilbert Ryle pointed out, when it comes to the mind you cannot be both the hunter and the hunted. I think that he is saying that the brain creates both the mind and the experience of mind. An illusion is not what it seems and for most of us, we consider our self as some essential core of who we are. Deconstruction of the Self Illusion is hard to pin down since we consider our self as some essential core of who we are."

The author claims that the self is an illusion that is difficult to shake...probably because, as he also acknowledges, the self is conjured by our interactions with our environment. The mind is wired to make sense of our experience and use memories to predict future states of whatever system we want to focus on. To give a concrete example - a mind wired mostly in comfort and a mind wired mostly in abuse will predict different outcomes upon meeting a stranger and definitely not respond in the same way. The self is created by the brain's machinations which are shaped by the body's experience of reality.Further, reasoning that ""having the quality of existing in a person's mind"" is equal to ""being illusory"" ends in solipsism, and you should never trust solipsists.Even further, picking my nose in private just means that I know there are social repercussions for picking my nose in public, not that I'm a different person and that my sense of self is schizophrenically splinteredStill though, I enjoyed reading this book and thinking through the ideas it presented.

Well, they could if it was slightly less technically demanding than this - which isn't to say Hood's writing is obscure: far from it. But the philosophical and psychological implications of his writing - combined with the empirical evidence for his conclusions - make it a prime candidate for reading on the Kindle, in my opinion. If only I had. Still, worth getting the end if only to discover that I'd probably actually got there before I realised I had, just like I chose the book before 'choosing' it (so-to-speak) and that my understanding of it precedes (by nano-seconds) my knowing or realising that I've understood it.

Incredible eye opening, but not for those who stand on shaky ground with the full implications of such existential explorations. The greatest value of this book is that it does all this without falling into the lazy trap of nihilism. A life without purpose or meaning still has value, even if that self and that value are fictional constructs. As Hood puts it. Just because you understand that a brick is made of tiny particles spread out far enough to make the object mostly empty space, that isn't going to keep you from ducking if someone throws it at your head.Hands down one of the best modern pop science books I have read on the intersection of neural science and philosophy."

It is this internal network that stores information and performs all the operations that we recognize as higher thought processes.p.52 – Our infant attachment patterns appear to influence our emotional attachment to partners later in life. Those infants who develop a normal pattern of wanting their mother and then settling easily back in when they are reunited are more likely to go on to form relatively stable relationships as adults. They find it relatively easy to get close to others and are comfortable being dependent on others and having others depend on them. They do not worry about being abandoned and are comfortable in intimate relationships. In contrast, those who had formed an insecure attachment to their mothers are either too needy and clingy for fear of being abandoned or, if they were avoidant as infants, they typically do not want to get too close to others or allow others to get close to them. p.63 – The mirror neuron system was originally discovered by accident in the laboratories of the Italian neuropsychologist, Giancomo Rizzolatti, in the 1990s. p.65 – Mirror neurons are part of the reason that we enjoy watching movies and plays. When we watch others, we can experience their emotions directly. When we empathize with the emotions of others, we feel their pain and joy. p.83 – Our identity is a sum of our memories, but it turns out that memories are fluid, modified by context and sometimes simply confabulated. This means we cannot trust them. And our sense of self is compromised. Note how this leaves us with a glaring paradox – without a sense of self, memories have no meaning, and yet the self is a product of our memories. p.98 – by 2 years of age, most children easily identify with their own gender and the roles and appearances that they believe are appropriate. Up until 4 years of age, children think that long hair and dresses determine whether you are a boy or girl. By 6 years, children’s gender understanding is more sophisticated and goes over and beyond outward appearances. They know that changing clothes and hair does not change boys into girls and vice versa. They are already demonstrating an understanding of what it means to be essentially a boy or a girl. p.99 – Teachers perpetuate gender stereotypes. In mixed classes, boys are more likely to volunteer answers, receive more attention from teachers, and girls report lower self-esteem than boys, but it’s not because they are less able. According to the 2007 U.K. National Office of Statistics, girls outperform boys at all levels of education from preschool right through to university. p.140 – post hoc, ergo propter hoc, which translates from Latin as “after this, therefore because of this. It is particularly obvious in superstitious behaviors. Superstitions are typically found in situations in which an element of risk exists. Rituals provide the individual with an illusion of control that they are doing something to influence outcomes when in fact they have no control whatsoever. If you remove an individual’s perception of control, then he experiences uncertain situations as stressful, thereby generating anxiety that impairs both the immune system and the capacity to think clearly. Enacting superstitious rituals inoculates us from the negative excesses of stress. This is why you often find superstitious behavior in dangerous occupations. p.152 – Children who thought their performance was all down to hard work not only stuck longer on the third task, but also enjoyed it more. So it’s better to tell your kids that they are hard workers rather than simply smart. The same can be said for free will. When we believe that we are the masters of our own destiny, we behave differently than those who deny the existence of free will and believe everything is determined. p.153 – Workers who believe in free will outperform their colleagues, and this is recognized and rewarded by their supervisors. So, when we believe in free will, we enjoy life more. We like people who are decisive because we believe they are positive and driven, and that makes most of us feel more comfortable than does someone who can’t seem to reach a decision. p.158 – Cognitive dissonance, a term coined by Leon Festinger in 1957, is the process of self-justification whereby we defend our actions and thoughts when they turn out to be wrong or, as in the case of sour grapes, ineffectual. p.160 – Cognitive dissonance protects the self from conflicting stories and is at the heart of why the self illusion is so important, but it also reveals the dangers that a strong sense of self can create. We use it to justify faulty reasoning. Although we do not appreciate it, our decision-making is actually the constellation of many processes vying for attention and in constant conflict. We fail to consider just how much of our decision-making is actually out of our control. p.167 – Not all depression us the same in its origins, but it is statistically more common among the poor and deprived in our society. One theory is that it is not so much that poverty is the root cause but rather the circumstances that having no wealth entails – the inability of individuals to do anything about their lives. The obvious solution is to empower people with choices. Some would argue that this is what wealth really brings – the opportunity to make choices and not be shackled to a life you can’t escape. If nothing changes no matter what you do, you have the basics of despair. The need for control appears to be fairly important for both physical and mental health. "
43,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2612588-candace,3,"This was an interesting survey of the evidence from psychology and neuropsychology for the idea that our much-coveted sense of self is an illusion that our brain creates. Specifically, the author feels that it is our social interactions that most determine our selves (as we can have different selves in different social or work-related settings). Some of the evidence for this kind of went over my autistic spectrum head. I did come to understand a bit better why I was getting beaten up in school every day back in junior high, given how oblivious I was to the strong social and hormonal currents then swirling around me, but if I am honest, as someone who could be viewed as socially retarded, arguments about self as a sheerly social construct are hard for me to wrap my head around. Still it was an interesting book, filled with interesting examples and vignettes. It seemed to meander a bit near the end, but overall, it was a worthwhile read."

What I considered to be the main downside of this book was corrected very shortly afterwards, and the story continued on a very high note.Considerable parts of this were more biochemical than I would normally appreciate, but it did seem as if the author put considerable effort into making things understandable. Similarly, his examples -- though not very different if one has read a number of other self/mind/psychology works -- were as illustrative as one could hope. Overall, I feel that the main value of this work is in the way Mr Hood highlights which functions are instinctive/inherited/uncontrollable even though we are primed to think that we have some control.

He pulls together a vast range of psychological research, much of which I had heard of, but was happy to read an understandable explanation of. A little out of date now, so the latest findings may be missing. Written in a way suitable for a layman, but without seeming too dumbed down (to this layman).I wasn't entirely convinced that my sense of having a self is an illusion created by my brain. I think that is going too far, but what he did convince me of is that many of the ways in which I experience my self are not necessarily 'real'.The narration by the author was good. It felt like sitting in on one of his lectures."

Hood didn't organize his thoughts into a cohesive picture of his thesis. It reads like something closer to a polished outline, all the research is there and it's orderly, but each section feels like its own little island. The research is interesting, and with a little effort you'll understand what he's trying to say, but it's just not up to the level it could have been."

71,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5842461-nathan-hassall,4,"The Self Illusion is a fantastic book which has reaffirmed some of my personal psychology interests, whilst it also provided me with new perspectives on some theories, experiments, and scientific explanations.I wouldn't describe this book as 'groundbreaking' - as Bruce Hood uses many psychology studies which have weaved their way out of the exclusive academic sphere and into the accessible realms of popular knowledge. Examples of this can be found in his references to Pavlov in his famous classical conditioning experiment with salivating dogs, or the more infamous 1961 Miligram Experiment showing the submissiveness of ordinary people when they are under the influence of authority - one way in which Hood tries to explain the atrocities of the Holocaust with many involved merely 'following orders.' I will defend him, as he is not legitimising the behaviour of the Nazis, but explaining how the power of influence is more significant than we believe in our day to day lives. I really wanted to give this book five stars, for it is very well written, comprehensively researched, showed elements of humanity and humour, as well as distressing. Examples include a man whose cancer on his amygdala was responsible for his lack of impulse control, which caused him to swap sick images of children on the internet. Once the cancer was removed, the mans urges to be a peadophile became non-existent. Hood leaves us with the question: ""Who is responsible for his actions, his 'self,' or the cancer?"" Also included in this book is a large amount of referencing, with a comprehensive bibliography should you want to read further. What holds me back from the five stars is the negative emotional feeling this book gave to me. Whereas I am usually a person who enjoys sitting in states of melancholia, I think it serves as a warning to others who might not want something that might change their perspective on life. As they say, 'ignorance is bliss'. I have rated The Self Illusion four stars for the people who read this review and consider purchasing this book, as a 'warning.' If you want to be challenged in the way that you think day-to-day, read this! The end of the book wraps up Hood's overriding argument- that 'selfhood' is a construction of our minds, made up of memories, the environment, and perceptions, and our brains fabricating these into a 'story' in which we perceive our illusion of self. Hood argues that we are different selves in separate scenarios of life, that we do not manipulate our surrounds like we think we do. Rather, our environment manipulates us. It's difficult to argue against Hood when he proposes, with a lot of evidence, that we have different selves: a work self, a home self, a friend self, a lover self- and now, due to our current technological world, an online self. In this argument Hood displays a lot of cynicism, criticising social networking like Twitter and Facebook as promoting negative traits such as narcissism, but he openly admits he is part of the online world of instant gratification and the growing 'Global Village.'If you are interested in psychology, philosophy or science, and want a general look at your'self', the world, and others around you, I highly recommend this book. Having read David Eagleman as well, I find accessible neuroscience fascinating. I thank Bruce Hood for his insights, and I hope to read more of his work in the not-so-distant future, and will recommend this book to my friends that share similar interests."
72,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27195238-menglong-youk,5,"4.5 starsIn the last two weeks, ""The Self Illusion"" took for a ride in free-will roller coaster. I'm kidding. Unlike many self-help books out there reasoning that you have total control of yourself, this book challenges that hypothesis and consider it as an illusion, underscoring our lives under the false belief of our free will. Our decisions are sharpened by our surrounding environment and people around us.A chapter that tightly grabbed my attention the most is ""Caught in the Web"". Like the title suggests, it reveals how our mind and the current social media, including Facebook and Twitter, intertwine to form a new connection which was never before seen. Our lost in the groups in which we are involving can unconsciously shift our personality to semi self-control or out of reach of our control. We take what we and other people appear on social media seriously, and once we enter social media, we feel we didn't exist at all without being online. Simply speaking, we will got trapped in this new technology if we unconsciously use it without considering the consequences.Here are some quotes from the book, which I think they are worth sharing:""One final mirror demonstration may leave you convinced that we are blind to how our brain creates our experience. Take a good hard look at your self in a mirror. Focus your gaze on your left eye and have a good look at it. Now switch and focus your gaze on your right eye. Notice anything odd? If you alternate your focus of gaze from the left eye to the right eye and back again, you cannot see your own eye movements from the left to the right and back again. Your eyes are moving – you just cannot see them move. Ask someone else to do the same thing. Now you can easily see their eyes moving but, like you, they cannot see their own movements in the reflection in the mirror. This is because our brains deliberately wipe out the visual experience of seeing the world every time we move our eyes. You may be surprised to discover that you are effectively blind for about on average two hours on every waking day but you would never know this.""""At the danger of overextending the metaphor, if we were able to see the world during our eye movements, we would become nauseous because it would become unstable and we would experience motion sickness. The world would smear as the visual input stimulated the neurons that process the light. Here, too much information can be a bad thing. So our brain protects us from the true nature of the situation. Maybe this is why we do not see the cognitive illusions that create the self. Cognitive dissonance protects us from ruminating over failed goals, positive biases keep us motivated, free will gives us grounds for praise and blame, decision-making gives us the illusion of control. Without these cognitive illusions, we would not be able to function because we would be overwhelmed by the true complexity of the hidden processes and mechanisms that control us. And that, in the end, is a good thing.""""Instantaneous language translation is just round the corner that will further erode another barrier to communication. These developments are a far cry from the Serengeti savannahs where our ancestors first appeared. One can speculate how changes will impact upon the individual’s identity, but it would seem that in an ever more crowded future, we are going to need a pretty strong sense of self to survive."""
73,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27136274-yussif,5,"Almost immediately when I saw the book I agreed with the title. The author tries to explain his theory in using nearly all the old psychological experiments and using a lot of scientific facets. But here I'll just give you my round of the mill of why I think this is true.Who you are is an illusion. All you are are different sides of different people. When you define yourself, all you are is all sides of the people you have ever met. So what you are actually defining or redefining, or adding new perspectives onto.. It's like you have all these people inside of your head, person A B C D E F G.... inside of you. When you meet someone new, what is actually happening is he is entering your subconscious home. And he is going to live with all these people that are already inside the house. So if there are any complications with this new guy and the people that are already in your house, then they will come out and speak in your stead. It may be one person, and it may be a couple to a couple hundred people if you know that many people speaking in your stead.Sometimes, if you are more aware of your subconscious, you can know who is speaking or who you are imitating at a certain moment.And this comes with practice and time. Some call it ""learning yourself"".Everything else is void. You don't know how some interactions may go. So you enter a fictional fantasy world where things mesh together. Dreams appear. Nothing is random. All the sides of the people you know are fighting for peace. What ""you"" are is fighting for peace. And you may never find it.No two people on earth can be the same. And the only way to experiment this will be cruel and inhumane. And it's actually the only real way to test if genes really play a role into who we are at a subconscious level. I think that if they are devoid of their histories, then still they can't possibly be the same for no other reason than one child being born 0.0002 pounds heavier than the other or with a slight hearing deficiency than another. // can't believe I went there.Anyways, I think the way we tell that we exist is by looking at our differences. That's how we know who we are.I know I kind of went dark in the who summary, so I would like to leave you with this.This is how you can take this information in a wonder approach. Everything you are, all of who you are is bits and pieces of everyone you know. Everyone you love and everyone you care about is literally inside of you. And know that people change. The more time you spend trying to be like your sweet grandmother, the more all the others you think you know inside your head will think they want to be like her too. Until, you meet them again of course. You might wake up a little. Stop being your grandmother, drive carefully!That being said, yes, you are going to inherit everyone dark stuff too. But let's say this: 50% of the people you know are evil, the other 50% is good. Of course you are going to look at more aspects of whatever situation your encountering than just evil and good. But I think that when the choice is like that. You consider how everyone you ever met would feel by carrying out the action, and I just believe good will prevail even if the evil is at 60%."

Using a variety of classic and not-so-classic psychological studies, case histories of patients with uniquely damaged brains, an audit of historical beliefs and his own keen insights, the author slowly, methodically takes that theory apart. What’s left is the notion that “our brain creates the experience of our self as a model—a cohesive integrated character—to make sense of the multitude of experiences that assault our senses throughout a lifetime and leave lasting impressions in our memory.” In other words, “the self is an illusion created by our brain…,” a tool, a construct, that increases the odds of our survival. And rather than actively, faithfully taking in all of the stimuli around us, the brain takes shortcuts to prevent overload, to speed learning and to navigate risk, eventually able to “anticipate the most likely world” without checking with the self first. And, with a brain that’s comfortable operating at a distance from the construct of self, and evolution driving us (by maximizing success) to embrace our social existence—that we are reliant upon others and upon our understanding of others—our brains and bodies tweak the construct of self depending on the external social conditions around us. He uses many examples and studies to bring this to life, but I was struck by the almost throwaway lines related to tickling as an example of the distance between mind and body. Generally speaking, we can’t tickle ourselves. “…you could tickle yourself with a tickling machine when there was a delay inserted between the action of operating the lever and the probe that did the tickling. When the self no longer seems in control, we surrender to the illusion of an external agent. This also explains why schizophrenic patients can tickle themselves: their self-monitoring is believed to be disrupted, and they attribute sensations and experiences generated by their own brains and bodies as coming from somewhere else.” Like that passage, the entire book is stuffed with fascinating insights and often clever writing: “Some of us became evil. Some of us became good. Some of us became bankers.” Some may be put off by the foundational theory, rather fancying instead to be a self in control of a body. I’m mostly fine with being a body in control of a “self,” and knowing that self is shaped by external forces — from those around me to what I had for breakfast. It doesn’t make me feel less distinct or less in control; it actually gives me insights into how to be more of my “self” in the world. Check this book out if the topic appeals. You won’t be disappointed. "
75,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43757795-miriam-st-dtler,2,"The book starts well, but then slowly devolves into a sea of personal anecdotes and opinions until you are left wondering if the author has just finished his Psychology 101 and has to share his discoveries with the world. There is a solid walk through the relevant classic experiments, but where you'd expect the current state of research, we are instead treated to the opinions of outliers with little experimental evidence to back up their claims. Indeed, throughout the book you have to be extremely careful to distinguish between facts and the author's opinions or guesses, as they are all presented in the same manner. Furthermore Mr. Hood seemed to be determined to cover everything to do with the self and thus proceeded to cover almost none of it well: The concept of personality for example, a large area of research in Psychology, is declared invalid in one fell swoop with the description of a single experiment. Disassociate identity disorder is explained as a good and evil split (which strongly disagrees with the current literature and research) and when the author discovers evidence that all patients might not be simply lying he quickly flees into the next chapter without discussing what this means for the existence of a self. Instead we learn all about his online habits and how they make him happy. However not even his core reasoning appears solid. In the experiments he presents very rarely do 100% of participants act one way or the other - does that mean those who don't have a more stable self? If the self is a mirror of our environment in the human brain it must be true for ALL humans, not a little above half. Indeed many of the classical experiments presented have had follow up research done which would throw doubt on Mr. Hood's confident assertions, but we never hear of it. In the end this is less an academic discourse and more a rather one sided presentation of research on the self with some occult conclusions thrown in for good measure. It is still interesting and informative, but I would recommend limiting repetition to the dinner table after a couple of glasses of wine, rather than the classroom. I decidedly would have expected better from an academic and the fact Mr. Hood clearly felt he could smuggle all this past the lay person this dramatically titled book is marketed to, leaves a decidedly unpleasant taste behind. For the audiobook lovers out there: The good news is that if the author can't present a balanced argument, he can read. Don't expect funny voices or dramatic crescendos, but a nice even read at a pace appropriate for the material."
76,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10663319-michael-kenning,4,"I don't think the argument that our selves are illusions has ever been put more concisely; nor has there been a more substantiated deterministic account of our being than this book (in my reading, anyway). One must remain stubborn/human in the face of this book if they remain to believe that everything we do is controlled by our own free will; one should also be reproached if upon its scrutiny we do not consider ourselves a social species. Nothing has been more elucidating, more balanced, nor more influential (for me) than this book—but what does it have to say for the religious? Only that the self doesn't exist, and it is beyond likelihood that with us, our selves deteriorate. I don't think that my reasons for not believing in an afterlife could be made any better than citing this book.The most haunting thing this book reveals is just how much of our behaviour is determined by our environment, but, most of all, by our peers. There's no escaping it: whether we like it or not, the way we act, the way we think, the way we behave is influenced predominantly by our peers. This is not to say that there is no free will; what makes it hard to acquiesce that there is no free will is that we are all predetermined to believe we have free will—and this is not a bad thing. As a philosophic and scientific individual, I don't think there is much free will, if none at all; as an individual in nature, my free will is precisely what guides me.The amount of illusions we perceive in order to maintain our self illusion is striking: our autobiographical memories may largely be false, our interpretations of the physical world influenced by our very cultures, the pliability of my self in different situations; the most haunting thing is that, at the end of the day, I have no idea who I am—and it's invigorating to realise this.We form our self illusions because things make much more sense when we believe there to be a subject of reality. The self is made from component parts of the brain: multiple different natural prostheses which are sculpted and moulded by memes from parents to child. Consider this: randomly generating and deleting spheres within a closed container, generated at random points on a 3-dimensional axis and of random sizes; they will converge predominately in a certain area. Each of these spheres represents a component operation within the locus of the brain. This blob of convergence is what Bruce Hood describes the self as being."
77,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5845484-kelly-enck,5,"I really loved Bruce Hood's book, The Self Illusion. If you want to re-establish the idea of “Self Empowering” this book is for you. The awareness that we call the ""Self"" is an illusion, created by the brain.Our brain created this experience of a separate ""Self"" to handle the billions of pieces of sensory data that we take in every second. When we are brave enough to give up this ego or self, we become liberated from our thoughts, which are in constant protest and judging people, mostly ourselves. The brain created the ""self"" for a very good reason, so that our species could work together to survive. Bruce Hood states that the “self” is really just the SUM of all our experiences and with each new experience the brain becomes, to a degree, a ""new structure"" or architected awareness - healthier or unhealthier, depending on what our brain is exposed to: (Love, Toxins, Depression, Nurture, Neglect, Pesticides, Organic ). This is not a simple review; but the book is rather simple as it explains a rather controversial subject, ""What is the Voice in Our Heads?"" I loved it! To me Hood's theory is empowering! What we expose our brains to can strengthen us, or weaken us, especially as we age. I am now experiencing that voice in my head as only the response to experiences or exposures during the day. I aim for better thoughts, experiences, and healthier environments. The whole of humanity is always headed towards sickness or health, depending on what we expose our brains to. Hormones run our lives, as well as the neural pathways formed from experiences, or toxic exposures. The power is back in our hands to make a healthier world for our species, or shall I say, Man-KIND.In William Blake's poem ""Auguries of Innocence"" he beautifully expresses this by giving us a version of God as ""Everything"" all-inclusive in our human existence. For a playful adventure on this subject--read my book, ""From Hollywood to God"" by Kelly Granite Enck. It's sold on Amazon & Kindle. Bruce Hoods was a great influence on me. I hope to meet him one day. Anything Hood! :) The tail end of Blake's poem strikes me as fitting....William Blake wrote:To see a world in a grain of sand,And a heaven in a wild flower,Hold infinity in the palm of your hand,And eternity in an hour."

I'm not going to lie when it gave me an almost un-human feeling and that while the human brain is complex that certain things we do are primitive survival instincts or due to mob mentality. I don't personally agree with some of the inconclusive studies portrayed in this book but it helped expand my mind. One incongruent thing I noticed was on page 108 they noted in a study that they placed a child in a room with an adult who instructed the child to face away from the adult. The adult then proceeded to wrap a present but then soon ran out of tape. The adult then instructed to child not to turn around an peek at the present while the adult left the room to get more tape. The researchers were in another room watching from a one way mirror to see if the child was able to control itself from peeking. However, in an earlier chapter Hood stated that placing a mirror in front of a cookie jar discouraged the children from taking more than one cookie as instructed due to the fact that they could see themselves breaking the rules and it took away the thought of anonymity. The children in each study were about the same age and over 4 years old. So what I am seeing is that the first study isn't accurate because the mirror from which the researchers were observing from wasn't taken into account as a variable in the experiment. I didn't go outside of the book to do more reading on both experiments but from a readers perspective and being scientist myself I see the first experiment as a fluke and shouldn't have been noted in the book. Furthermore, the study that I see as invalid was conducted by the author of the book which makes me question the authors judgement and perspective. All in all, it was a great book and it did make me think. I would recommend anyone to read it. P.S. If anyone can validate my or his perspective to please so.. I would like to know more."
79,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8152776-kevin,2,"The big idea here is that neuroscience (and psychology) literature is complexifying our traditional ideas of free will - that there is a central 'you' somewhere in the brain making decisions with minimal outside influence. Studies, for instance, are conclusively showing that 'decision centers' of the brain often make decisions before our conscious brain becomes aware of them. What's more: the conscious part of our brain often constructs rationales about why we made decisions when, in truth, we were influenced (to greater or lesser degrees) by hidden variables. While this book goes over that literature pretty well - the author is a very good writer - there is no new information here that one can't get in other books (Gazzaniga's ""Who's in Charge?"" is my favorite). This book also lacks a certain amount of depth, at times making very trivial arguments. (AT the end of one chapter, for instance, the author ponders the idea that, as our attitudes toward ourselves affects decision making, it may be best not to know the information being presented that diminishes belief in free will. First, does that mean the author just made his argument redundant? Second, how does the idea that our beliefs about ourselves influence our decisions reconcile with the idea that we don't have free will to make conscious decisions?) Anyhow, there are other and better books out there on this fascinating subject. This one may be a great first read for the 'lay public' (Gazzaniga's book is more in-depth and cohesive, but at the expense of being a harder read). But other than that, there are better books to read. "

There were some different theories on brain development (even though they were collected study result discovered others I might add) and I enjoyed the explanations.After a while, probably around the whole web-related part I started loosing more and more interest. I usually enjoy the whole networking vs. Human topic, but I found it more and more out of place as the writer kept going on about it. The focus about numbers and followers, well there were too much of it and I don't see the necessity of it all. I also found a lot of the writing becoming too personal. It is okay enough if the writer want use himself as an example, but is it really necessary to document personal thoughts and feelings? How is knowing about his (the writer's) insecurities (and teencrush) give me an understanding of the illusional self?I see a lot of people complaining about typing mistakes, and sure, one might wonder if there's been any proof reading done (when was 5 a natural part of a word?), but I didn't find it ruined the book in any big degree, missing out points and such. All in all, the book was an okay enough read, and I'm glad I read it but I could as well have stopped halfway through, because the last part I didn't find useful at all. The book didn't really come with any groundbreaking conclusion to explain the title, as far as I could tell, but an okay read sharing some interesting theories on the way."

It is filled with a number of citations of studies about human behavior that can be found in much more elaborate detail in many other books. I don't feel as if it is all tied together particularly well. A better book on stringing together numerous studies of human behavior and psychology is The Social Animal by David Brooks. Those criticisms aside, the conclusion of the book is supported by the content in the middle. It is a very interesting conclusion indeed, and gives a new perspective on the self, and the purpose for it. I would have enjoyed the book more if some of the conclusion was hinted at through the book. It is almost as though the book itself is a bundle of individual citations, that magically work together at the end of the book. It is not my belief that the author purposefully made the style of the book match the pattern in which the brain works, though that would be quite clever.My recommendation, if you've read a lot of human behavior and psychology books, just read the first and last chapters. If you have not read a lot those types of book, The Self Illusion will be more enlightening and give you a list of potential authors and studies to look into when you are done."

Hood acts as a fine curator in this book, bringing many studies, experiments and anecdotes to bear on evaluating the reality of the self. His approach (and those he cites) is very hands-on, more psychology than philosophy, hence (possibly?) the dissatisfaction of some the reviewers below. Maybe 'The Self in the World' would have been a better title, as Hood doesn't actually talk much 'illusion' but lots 'world'. When I say he acts as a curator, I mean that you won't read many pages that don't reference some other book, or study, etc. The references take up a good percentage of the book. This isn't a negative in itself of course, there is much to learn here and many people have contributed to the discussion so to speak, which is well presented. The analogy of a compost heap to describe our memories continually being added to (fresh identifiable stuff on the top) and degrading (black compost at the bottom) is one that will stick with me (or will it?). You know it's interesting, of all the books I've read in my life, most of the classics (Hardy, Dickens etc.) I read when I was a lot younger, and I think I could easily re-read them and feel like I've never read them. This feeling would be correct, to all intents and purposes. We believe we persist over time, but as we are our memories, there is little 'me' that actually DOES persist. "

I listened to it whilst cleaning my house, tidying my garage and on the train, but it took a lot longer than the 10hr run-time to get through, because for every fifteen minutes or so of listening I had to pause to digest it's ideas. I read a lot of these neuroscience books and whilst this isn't the most original it's actually the kind that I prefer, focusing on finding interesting ways to explain concepts, amalgamating ideas and drawing conclusions rather than original research. I recommend that everyone learn more about neuroscience, because understanding how the mind works and behaves gives us a greater understanding of ourselves, calms our anxieties and makes us comfortable with our insecurities, which turns us into happier and healthier human-beings. This kind of writing is also fascinating to anyone who writes songs or fiction or is simply concerned with human nature. In this sense this book had some great insights. One line which I found particularly memorable was 'when others fail it is because of some fault in their character, when we fail it is because circumstances have conspired against us'.

85,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6021539-karen,3,"An interesting read, although it seemed to be based on a huge contradiction - that there is no 'self' (the title) but that 'a strong sense of self is going to be essential if we are going to be able to cope with the future' (read the last sentence of the book!) Although presented in a lively, readable and informative way, there was an underlying gloom to this - 'one exists as the unique 'me' only as a construct of the brain' is probably the simplest way of putting it. Whilst this construct is fascinating, complex and capable of some astounding feats, the book does not really get to the bottom of the 'why', indeed in the prologue there is the admission that we are unlikely to ever know how a physical brain system manages to produce non-physical experiences such as the idea of a conscious self, and the why is then open to a wide variety of opinion (philosophical, theological, scientific etc). As this is very much the neuroscientific basis to much of the current atheistic philosophy (Dennett, Dawkins etc) it is essential reading for anyone wanting to explore the arguments in this field, and as a 'general reader' level overview (I'm no scientist) this was excellent."
86,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8066434-donald,4,"Bruce Hood's ""The Self Illusion"" is probably one of the best books I've read that attempts to use recent discoveries in cognitive neuroscience to answer substantial and age-old philosophical questions. Hood's man point, boiled down, is that the age old idea that there is a stable self or ego that that develops yet remains constant is the result of various memories, sensations, and social pressures being cohered together into a narrative that is constantly shifting and changing in the face of new contexts. There is no stable self that remains constant over time only a new configuration of narrative. The book's thesis is pretty easy to understand; what is excellent about this book is that each chapters attempts to come at the issue a different way with a whole list of interesting studies that reveal new things about the human mind & the brain. If you have any interest in neuroscience, experimental psychology, or philosophy of consciousness & self, this book is for you."

He covers most topics relevant to the subject with out going into laborious detail, thus portraying his idea with a depth of knowledge most people will understand (it's a pop-science book not a university standard psych text book). Thus, the book remains entertaining as the concepts are both comprehendible and the arguments supporting them are not succinctly written. The only downside would be that the closing chapters (8&9) felt a bit rushed. Obviously they were the most personal chapters but I felt as though he could have used more science to back up his arguments which he did so well in chapters beforehand. Over all, the book was easy to read, insightful without any laborious arguments which allows the reader to understand Hoods point about the illusion of the self with out any prior knowledge in a most entertaining way indeed!"

And yet, our culture is wired for labels and checkboxes, eager to neatly file people away into categorical cabinets and thrown into furor over the slightest inkling of multiplicity. Take, for instance, Howard Hughes, at once a legendary aviator, movie mogul, tycoon, and socialite, and a reclusive billionaire housebound by his deathly phobia of dirt. He was a fearless aviation pioneer who set and broke countless records, yet he remained terrified of dying from germs. Hughes spent his final days unbathed, dressed in rags, with long sticky hair, curling nails, and the remnants of five hypodermic needles in his arms. He was worth $2 billion."

As someone who reads a fair amount online from authors and unpublished writers and sees a great deal about creating ""complicated characters who are true to life,"" I felt that Hood wasn't telling me anything that I haven't been seeing online. The largest difference, of course, is that he's got evidence for a broad approach and the people I've been reading are talking about craft. It's a good and interesting book on the whole - the section on ""evil"" is one of the better ones here, whereas the section on the internet felt to me like it was more interested in examples and less in conclusions - but I came away much less enthusiastic than I went in."

He does so admirably, with some wit and has so many examples that while at times I began to tire of the litany I immediately saw why he was doing it: the notion of a transcendental self is so pervasive, so automatic, that we need constant reminders that it isn't what we think. This is not a book for those wanting to live their lives in blissful ignorance, this is a book which, with reflection, requires a recalibration of how one deals with the reality in which is lived and the relationships one engages in. When it is firmly understood how the ""I"" is shaped by social pressures, rather than a thing in itself, the repercussions are like an avalanche. "

Whether or not you agree with the central conclusion of this book--that the self is an illusion (and there are times, I admit, in which some of the inferences made are a bit of a stretch)--Hood shows no restraint in demonstrating the full depth of his expertise and knowledge of human psychology throughout, backed up by a substantial number references that cannot be easily ignored.

Bruce Hood explained the construction of self in a more basic language (but no less elegant). It was very helpful for common, less-academic, non-PhD readers like me.The only drawback here was that Bruce Hood didn't conduct any research by himself (but it was forgivable since he put a large number of research done by other scientists from the classic study of Festinger, Milgram or Zimbardo to the contemporary ones, such as done by Dan Ariely or David Eagleman).

Unfortunately a great deal of the interesting stuff is, as so often, based entirely on experiments with students. The tone is all over the place, as if Hood has no idea of who his audience is. Worst of all, though, is the central thesis. The concept of self is an illusion because the brain creates a self from reactions to external events. This is a philosophical point, not a psychological one, and he is entirely unconvincing."

This books I based mainly on the framework of psychology and neuroscience and little to none on philosophy. So make sure you understand that before diving in.  I personally feel that the self is definitely molded from what occurs throughout your life. It's easy to see yourself using different thinking patterns or different views and outlooks depending on the circumstances, which you are raised in.  It did have a few typos, which was annoying.

This book was full of fascinating facts about how the self is constructed by others, our groups and goals and hobbies.

The whole chapter on the internet was a waste and should have been. Left out"

120,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4941456-l-t-hewitt,4,The book appeared to be a list of psychological studies strung together under an attention-seeking title; the only reason Hood told us we have no self seems to be as a publicity stunt with the aim of deceiving its readers into thinking that they are reading a work of philosophy.

However, I did find it a bit disjointed and thought that he didn't quite pull it all together in a definitive way. On the whole though, a worthwhile read."

Considering the subject matter, I found it quite ironic that the writer came off as very self-absorbed and overly sure of themselves, without evidence. Too bad, as the subject definitely has potential."

I liked his central thesis but the heavy use of other material meant the book didn't quite focus on it enough, preferring to jump around a lot."
