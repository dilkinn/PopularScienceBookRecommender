0,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,4,A really good book for anyone interested in the origins of life and the history of archaeology or paleontology. It's gives a good idea of the history for the idea of evolution and how it came to be and how it has been shaped since. The writing is simple and straight forward and it's written for the average reader rather than the academic so anyone who is interested in the evolution and emergence of life can enjoy it. It's not comprehensive but it gives a good idea for anyone not familiar with the field though it focuses on the scientists behind the ideas more than the science. I found the balance between the scientists biographical information and the discussion of the ideas and their impact to be really great though. I think it's pretty hard to get that right with these non fiction books so I enjoyed this one a lot more than most.
1,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a wonderful book about naturalists and their adventures in search for the origin of species. Sean Carroll is an excellent author. He is also a professor of molecular biology, and his previous books have been excellent, too.Most chapters follow a naturalist into the wilds. The first chaptera are about the adventures of Alexander von Humboldt, Charles Darwin, Alfred Wallace, and Henry Bates and their subsequent analyses of findings. When Humboldt visited the United States, he visited the president, Thomas Jefferson and talked about science, not politics!Then come some fascinating chapters about paleontologists, like Charles Walcott who discovered the remarkable Burgess Shale. Roy Chapman Andrews led an expedition into the Gobi desert in Mongolia in the 1920's. While looking for ancient human fossils, he found instead a treasure of dinosaur and mammal fossils.Probably because of Sean Carroll's background, the last chapters are about molecular biology, DNA, and recent discoveries about the time clock embedded in the DNA of all creatures.Sean Carroll's writing is superb. I highly recommend this book!I didn't read this book--I listened to it as an audiobook. Jim Bond was the narrator, and he does a good job narrating this non-fiction book."
2,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1536431-leslie,4,"Sooo.....we did evolve from apes. I knew it! That explains so many things, all the hair in unusual places, the urge to groom my husband, why my youngest hangs on me like a monkey. Carroll includes a quote on the last page of this book, talk is cheap, exploration and discovery is hard. Boy, oh boy is that true! Some people are just born to find stuff. Some people are just premade to tackle decades of dealing with sunburns, throwing up, fire ant bites, fevers, sea-sickness, more throwing up, starvation, bitter cold, gale force winds, spear-holding natives, being buried in sandstorms, and sore bums from riding donkeys. But I don't know, being the first to set foot in unexplored wilderness, places no humans have treaded in thousands of years, if at all, may make it worth it. Just maybe... A great group of mostly men (and a few briefly mentioned women - Mary Leakey), some tiny men (Darwin), some Indiana Jones types (Roy Chapman Andrews), and some nerdy, but cute multiple Nobel Prize winning scientists (Linus Pauling) are included along with several others in this book. I learned a lot of things I didn't know about some the greatest explorers of the last centuries. What trials they went through to make their discoveries. What great determination! After reading this I felt a great urge to marry a determined explorer and let him take the credit for all my discoveries, or maybe take up rock collecting again, or visit the nearest fossil beds, as I live in Idaho and there are a lot of past tense creatures buried around here, not including our current state political leaders....Ahem.Read this book if you are the least bit interested in science, discovering something new, and if you've ever in your life hit a rock with a hammer to find a diamond inside. Just be sure to wear protective glasses if you do that.Trust me I know. "

Now that Richard Dawkins has gone from spokesman for biology to spokesman for atheists, we are left to look for who will take up the previous role played by Dawkins, and before him Stephen Jay Gould. Sean Carroll is the author of two (excellent) previous books on evolution; he is part of the new school called Evo Devo, which is less hip but more substantive than the name suggests. Here, he puts aside (but not far aside) the topic of evolution per se, to talk not so much about biology, as biologists. The 'Remarkable Creatures' of the title are the explorer researchers who had both the sense of adventure to go far afield to see life where it was happening, and also the aptitude for abstraction to formulate or extend theories to explain what they saw. It's the sort of book one reads (or writes) to get a good perspective on how the field has come this far, and what biases and assumptions tripped up your predecessors, the better to see your own, perhaps.Also, of course, the sort of thing that would cast you as a natural spokesman for your field.Not that I'm saying this was Carroll's conscious intention. But it cannot have escaped his attention that even after a century of discussion of Darwin's 'Origin of Species', there is still a lot of basic misunderstanding about evolution and biology among the general public, and not only among those who just don't accept it at all. In order to help fix that, you have to be well known enough to be listened to.Carroll does reveal himself to be an adept story-teller. Each of the chapters in ""Remarkable Creatures""is essentially a short story, about a man who made a major contribution to biology. They are all men, probably because until very recently it was not feasible for a woman to go alone (or nearly so) into the wilderness on a scientific expedition. The chapters relate to each other tangentially (Darwin's story a good preface to Wallace's, Wallace a good preface to Bates, who he had traveled with early in his career, and so forth). Several of them set off into the wilderness, far from civilized areas at that time, for much the same reason that younger reporters go into war zones more recently: it is dangerous, dirty, and physically and emotionally grueling, but all these things mean that few others will do it, and therefore you have a better chance of distinguishing yourself from your peers.Many of them have some point in their life when their decision to stake everything on a gamble of this kind seemed to have been a mistake. I was left wondering how many equally brilliant minds may have gambled and lost, struck down by yellow fever or killed in a shipwreck or having simply guessed wrong as to where the fossil or sample they were in search of lay. We only hear about those who gambled and won.There are clear differences in personality, however, and Carroll does a good job of finding enough anecdotes on each subject to make them come alive as real people, with their own flaws and eccentricities. You come away from the book with an opinion as to which of these people you would want to have as a friend, and not every reader will have the same conclusion. Carroll is to be congratulated for this, as too many histories of science (especially those in textbooks) tell us only about the conclusions of scientists, not how they arrived at them or why they cared.Another thing which comes to mind any time I read a book of this sort is, why are our textbooks so dull? ""Remarkable Creatures"" is no more technical than your typical high school text, and it's a lot more engaging. If I were inclined towards conspiracy theories, I would suspect a plot to keep our kids from learning science, by convincing them that it is boring.The other recurring theme in Carroll's stories, is the length of time it takes for evidence to overturn prior consensus. This is probably for the best, as a scientific field willing to immediately discard everything it had believed at the appearance of the first unexpected claim, would probably not be an improvement (and we do not see here the stories of those who claimed the established consensus was wrong, who turned out to be wrong themselves). However, there is no question that time and again we can see a generational divide, with older scientists still resisting the steady accumulation of facts well after a younger generation has taken to the new view with enthusiasm. As our average lifespan increases, especially among the advanced economies from which scientists are mostly drawn, I wonder if it will become more difficult to overthrow the established viewpoint simply because it takes longer for them all to die off and make way for the new.Unless, of course, they move on to new careers, like being spokesman for atheists. Behold, the new spokesman: Sean B. Carroll. Biology is in good hands."
4,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1610514-nancy-lewis,5,"I'm not sure if the Remarkable Creatures referred to in the title are the microbes, dinosaurs, and hominids discovered by these scientists, or the scientists themselves. I'm going with the latter. I just finished a book written by the scientist in Chapter 10. Also excellent. "
5,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/673557-donna,3,"I liked this book because it was as much about the scientists included as their discoveries. Of course now I want to go pick up more thorough biographies about some of the people that it covers...The very end of the book starts to drag though. After a good overview of Pauling's political activism, things get a bit jargon heavy and we stop getting the same level of personal detail that made the rest of the book so interesting."
6,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2416724-raluca,5,"This book is difficult to classify. It contains biographies, historical accounts, scientific explanations and lots of adventure. Like other reviewers have pointed out, the Remarkable creatures are both those being explored and the explorers themselves. Overall, this was one of the best natural science books I've had the pleasure of enjoying and I recommend reading it together with Between Man and Beast: An Unlikely Explorer, the Evolution Debates, and the African Adventure That Took the Victorian World by Storm for a similar feeling.(P.S. As an avid dinosaur enthusiast, I particularly enjoyed the chapters about the K-T extinction and the discovery of dino fossils - especially the ""birds-are-dinosaurs"" revelation.)"
7,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,4,"I very much enjoyed this author's style and method of presentation of the material. He makes complex subjects accessible for the non-scientist but doesn't dumb the material down so much that it's robbed of its vigor. While I was familiar with a number of the episodes and scientists portrayed, there was plenty that was new to me and I learned quite a bit. Each chapter is a mini-biography for a key researcher or explorer, combined with the major he advances made. What becomes clear is how each new breakthrough owes much to prior discoveries and theories. "
8,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8786335-kimberly,2,It’s a book on the history of the development of evolutionary theory. I expected more development in the book and a more in-depth look at the theory. It’s a good introduction for someone that has no background in the history of evolutionary science. 
9,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40842473-shreya,4,"A very well written book, it takes you on a very long and fun-filled adventure, with all great naturalists and scientists. If you are remotely interested in evolution and how we arrived at this understanding of the history of our planet, it is a great read. I would also highly recommend it to anyone who is pursuing natural science or wants to do so. It shows you the struggle of scientists, how often they felt lost and how often they were lost and yet made great contributions to their field. It brings out the idea of how you can be good at school, bad at it, never receive any formal education, be politically influencial or have no money, and none of it would matter if you are truly passionate about what you wish to do. It is a book full of adventure, emotions and a lot of information about evolution of species, including us."
10,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17700308-jak-krumholtz,4,A collection of interesting stories from evolutionary scientists. Or how a fall during a playful elephant dung-throwing fight resulted in finding 3.5 million year old hominid footprints.
11,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27474888-webby43,5,"Really loved this book, it's a wonderful read about the progress of evolutionary science. Fascinating and well written."
12,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66192029-stella,3,"First half awesome, second half drags a bit."
13,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876945-ryan,4,"Possibly the best of three books of his I have read so far, as the previous ones dealt with the specific mechanisms of evolution and were therefore more technical. The author is passionate about evolutionary biology, and this is perhaps his way of paying homage to the giants of the field, from Darwin and Wallace to the lesser known but more recent paleontologists and scientists that have made significant inroads into our understanding of the timeline of evolution on Earth and the major events that have marked it's long history, leading right up to our own species.Each chapter delves briefly into the lives of one of these famous persona, serving as a sort of biographical sketch, and how their discoveries proved to be significant. They are short, concise and highly readable, but obviously not meant as a detailed biography or treatise on the particular subject concerned. For elaboration, the reader can refer to the end notes and references at the end. By organizing itself in chronological order, the book is a good recap of the major advances in the study of evolution and shows how far we have come in our understanding of the mysteries of how we arrived at the present state of life on Earth. It is thus grand in scope and highly stimulating and exciting reading, even for those with prior knowledge of the key players. Carroll postulates at the end of the book that the next great breakthrough will be the discovery of life on other planets, which is logical given we have already more or less established the timeline of evolution on our own. The high probability of there being extraterrestrial life given the sheer number of potentially habitable planets out there makes it a matter of time before we should find them. However it is also slightly ominous that we have had no contact so far with other intelligent beings given the same. One can perhaps surmise that it is also equally likely that any technologically advanced civilizations out there could well have died off, through internal conflict or other self made cataclysm, before contact with others could be made. Given our own bleak prospects of reaching planetary limits to growth and self destructing in the not too distant future, I give such reasoning quite high credibility."
14,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69348187-xavier,4,"Remarkable Creatures shows us the remarkable journeys that men like Alexander von Humboldt, Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace embarked on to try to solve the “mystery of mysteries” about the origins of species.We meet scientists like John Ostrom, who was able to make the evolutionary connection between birds and dinosaurs via a fossil named Archaeopteryx, an ancient bird that lived alongside the great beasts. Explorer and discoverer Roy Andrews found a plethora of dinosaur bones, including intact dinosaur eggs.Fun Fact: Roy Andrews was famous for always carrying his pistol and wearing his hat while on expeditions. He may have been the inspiration for the character Indiana Jones!Louis and Mary Leakey were the husband/wife team that located hundreds of early Stone Age hand-made tools in Africa, not to mention fossils of the earliest species of Man, Australopithecus. This was unexpected since it was believed at the time that the origins of Man were in Asia, so their discoveries turned the paleoanthropology world upside down.Carroll also introduces us to the scientists who were able to study ancient DNA and provide an age when Man and Ape split from our common ancestor. We also learn about Neanderthals and their relation (or lack thereof) with modern humans.Author Sean B. Carroll is a great writer and makes learning about all these amazing people fun and engaging. There is also plenty of photos to add to the narrative. The biographies and the descriptions of the discoveries are short, but I didn’t mind. This was a great introduction for those who want to meet the big names of the archaeology and anthropology fields and learn a bit about the amazing discoveries they made!"
15,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1940200-stephanie,4,"Science has a reputation for being boring. I’ve made the acquaintance of many a science textbook in my time, and I can say that, in spite of my love for science, that reputation is not unwarranted. Textbook writers could stand to learn a thing or two from Sean B. Carroll, author of Remarkable Creatures: Epic Adventures in the Search for the Origin of Species.In Remarkable Creatures, Carroll tells the stories of many of the men and women that have made great discoveries in the field of evolutionary science. It turns out that these scientists are not the stodgy, grey-haired stereotypes that we’d expect. Henry Wallace Bates lived 11 years alone in the Amazon. Alfred Wallace spent 10 days in a leaky lifeboat after his ship burned and sank. Paleontologist Roy Chapman Andrews may be the real-life inspiration for Indiana Jones, right down to his fear of snakes and his ever-present pistol. Their stories are fascinating, and while I read them, I couldn’t help but learn an awful lot about evolution. Perhaps if science was presented with a little more personality, more people would be interested in studying the sciences, or (if the threat of inhospitable environments and tropical diseases are just too daunting) at least reading about them.The last two chapters leave the field behind and dwell almost exclusively in the laboratory where the science can get a little intense (I had to read those chapters very slowly and more than once), but otherwise, I think this is a book that almost anyone would enjoy.** Unless you aren’t a fan of evolution, but I probably didn’t need to say that, did I?"
16,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/426137-nurul,4,"I've read several of Dr. Carroll's scientific papers. So, standing on science section of a book store and finding a natural history book authored by him was like a tiny adventure for me, a successful one. I couldn't wait to read this book and follow his journey in tracking the pioneers of scientific natural history research in search for all the remarkable lifeforms on earth.From Darwin, Wallace, Eugene Dubois with his 'Java man', back to the ""Cambrian period which marked the early life on earth"" with Charles Walcott, to the CSI work on finding the difference of Neanderthals to modern human by Allan Wilson and others, seemed timeless. In the afterword, Sean Carroll offered the universe as the great challenge for exploration of lifeforms as long as you use the right key by following the right path to seek. I, myself thought that the earth is still challenging, and opening our minds to seek the right question to answer is the key to keep exploring. Just like Roy Chapman Andrews said, ""always there has been an adventure just around the corner-and the world is still full of corners!""Anyway, Roy who explored the Gobi desert in 1925 and found the first dinosaur's eggs and some Cretaceous mammals, was thought to inspire George Lucas on Indiana Jones character. He was also afraid of snakes!"
17,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/130454-donna,4,"In an extremely close, affectionate, life-long marriage, Charles Darwin and his wife Emma were able to tolerate and transcend their philosophical differences. (She was a devout, conservative Christian who believed in the Biblical version of creation.) He entrusted her with the disposition of his writings in the event of his early demise. Louis Leaky, a son of English missionaries in Africa, was initiated into the native Kikuyu society at the age of 11. He received an African name (Wakuruigi, ""Son of the Sparrow Hawk""), constructed a dwelling of his own, and thereafter lived apart from his family. His eventual wife, Mary Leaky, enjoyed relaxing with a cigar at the end of the day.On April 29, 1962, Linus Pauling picketed the White House with a group of protesters opposed to the U.S. resumption of nuclear testing. Then he changed his clothes, went inside, and joined President Kennedy for a dinner honoring him and other American Nobel Prize winners.With details like these, Sean B. Carroll brings to life some of the ""remarkable creatures"" whose discoveries have furthered human understanding of the history of life on earth. A very readable book, Remarkable Creatures does a credible job of putting into context about two hundred years of scientific accomplishments. Highly recommended. "
18,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,4,"Carroll writes a fieldwork-centric, mostly paleontology-centric book on evolution, which is interesting. You sometimes get pretty interesting paleontological popular science (Neil Shubin's Your Inner Fish, which Carroll covers, being a recent example), but they tend to be quite narrow in scope. It's easy to see why: you can't really give a broad overview of the whole of evolutionary biology without tackling more theoretical work. That work may be borne out in the fossil record, but using the fossil record itself to demonstrate broad principles will generally require a whole lot of writing.So what Carroll does is focus on stories: the life of Darwin and his trip to the Galapagos; Wallace's expeditions in South America; Walcott's discovery of the Burgess Shale; the discovery that birds are descendants of dinosaurs and that many dinosaurs were more birdlike than we thought with Archaeopteryx and Deinonychus; Shubin's discovery of Tiktaalik; Louis Leakey's entire life. Most of these stories are heavily edited, perhaps unconsciously, to make the people involved look more significant and generally much nicer than they actually are (Wallace really wasn't that relevant; Leakey was by all accounts a twathead, but you'd never know it from Carroll's retelling), but I guess that's to be expected from a book that sets out to inspire at least as much as to inform."
19,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7820883-susan,3,"Surprisingly engaging read (my track record with nonfiction is not that good -- I tend to pick up books that I read about / heard about somewhere else that has engaging summaries and find them incredibly dull and long winded once I actually start reading them). It's kind of a...dramatized serial biography of people who are involved in studies of evolution. FAST read, which I definitely appreciate. Note that it IS written by a male Caucasian professor though and so the stories are, with very few exceptions, centered around male Caucasian scientists. There are a few lines where it seems like the author was going the lines of ""oh those silly natives don't know what TREASURES they have"", while discussing paleontology that makes me uncomfortable. It is however, a much lesser degree of problematic than Darwin's depiction of natives. So that's good. Shows we've come somewhere since 1800s.Would recommend for people interested in evolution. Note I didn't say scientists because one thing this book does really well is making the research accessible to a generalized audience (I think so, anyway, but I'm a scientist so I'm obviously biased) (but I really do think the author did this particularly well.)."
20,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4215702-jenny-brown,3,"Carroll's earlier book about evolutionary biology, ""Endless Forms Most Beautiful"" was an amazing book that takes the reader me deep inside the science underlying evolution and explained in ways comprehensible to the nonscientist how a limited number of genes go about building the myriad forms our bodies take. Given how great that book was, my expectations were high for this one.Unfortunately, for me at least, this book turns out to be a very lightweight survey of several explorer/scientists whose explorations provided raw material from which theories of evolution were developed. The reading level is suitable for Junior High School students, the science rudimentary, and the stories Carroll tells will already be very familiar to anyone who keeps up with the history of science.That doesn't make it a bad book. It would be a fine introduction for a young person with an interest in science or an adult whose knowledge of pioneers like Darwin was limited to what he'd seen on TV documentaries. But there is little here for the adult reader who keeps up with the history of science. "
21,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7413069-philip,4,"Excellent overview of the search to explain how species evolved, as told through the stories of the individual scientists/explorers - from Humboldt (who I didn't really know anything about other than that they named a Squid and a Current after him) through Pauling and Wilson and the latest genetic advances. Would have been 5 stars except for the last two chapters - DNA/RNA, chemistry, etc - which I found a slog and ended up skimming; but I'm sure other readers probably liked that part best - everyone has their own preferences. For me, the earlier the better - I loved the first section on Humboldt, Darwin, Wallace and Bates, (and it was nice to find out that Darwin wasn't quite the schmuck he appears to be if you only focus on how he screwed over Wallace - long story). The next section on ""the dinosaur guys"" was also excellent - I'm already a huge fan of Andrews, but Walcott was a welcome surprise.Anyway - strongly recommended for anyone who enjoys natural history, and the stories of the natural historians who discovered it all."

It was extraordinarily interesting and informative, exceptionally well written, beautifully researched, marvelously accessible and exciting, and wonderfully cohesive! So many times I found myself shaking my head with awe and wonder at the discoveries made by the scientists profiled in this book. It was just marvelous--I loved it! It made me wish that I had stopped flirting with the idea of majoring in biology, and just gone ahead and done it. Remarkable, indeed!Oh, and Jim Bond's narration of the audiobook was excellent, too! Very well done! I understand there are pictures in this book, which I missed by listening to it rather than reading it, but Wikipedia took care of me when I wanted visuals."
23,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3027890-lynn,4,"Sean Carroll writes a book about exciting advances in evolutionary biology by introducing many of the groundbreaking surprises and people who progressed the profession. Many of the early paleontologists had to keep quiet for fear of profound public disapproval. Darwin suffered through pressure to become a doctor or a theologian which he attempted and rejected only to eventually throw the beliefs of both professions into disarray. Louis and Mary Leaky suggested that humans originated in Africa, upsetting many and Charles Walcott became aware of Precambrian life in the Grand Canyon upsetting the idea the world was created in seven days. I found it all interesting and exciting. "

This author draws up just the right amount of detail and interesting facts around the lives of the men and women who have made the pivotal advances in the sciences of natural history, evolutionary biology, paleontology, anthropology, and evolutionary genetics. I have been taking brief notes on each chapter and once I've finished them I plan on updating this review."

30,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10978428-jim,4," Sean Carroll relates the journeys and adventures of naturalists/scientists starting with Alexander von Humboldt. He had a great influence on the naturalists who followed--in particular, a young Englishman named Charles Darwin, who, at the age of 22, set off on the HMS Beagle for a round-the-world voyage. What Darwin learned on this voyage would shake the foundations of science as it led to his writing his book ""The Origin of Species..."" Another naturalist who was also an explorer was Alfred Russel Wallace who developed the theory of evolution in parallel to Darwin. We also follow a Dutch doctor, Eugene Dubois, to the Dutch East Indies, where he discovered the prehistoric ape-man known as Java Man. Then there's Charles Walcott who found Cambrian life in the Burgess Shale- and Roy Chapman Andrews who found dinosaur eggs in the Gobi desert. And we are with Neil Shubin in the Arctic as he finds ""Tiktaalik""--the fishapod. We also go to Olduvai gorge with the Leakeys to search for our early ancestors in Africa. And, finally, we are in the labs of the present-day where DNA is being extracted from extinct species. It all makes for an exciting story--and a most important one. "
31,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4759690-laura,3,"This book was okay*, I mean I liked it, but as far as it being the best science-y book I have ever read... nah. It was more of a book to read to hear about all the great people who went on those adventures and made discoveries, like Carroll says in the Sources section, he read all of the material so you didn't have to. Thus it was more about the content then the writing that made this book for me. Also, and this might be a little too feminist, but I didn't like how Carroll never focused on one woman discoverer specifically, Mary Nicol/Leakey got a little section but she was sort of just tacked on to Louis Leakey, he never started a chapter talking about a female scientist. Forgive me I am not the most knowledgeable person about the range of scientists and their discoveries, but I am pretty sure he could have found an interesting female scientist to talk about or he could have started the chapter with Mary, I mean she was the one who discovered the Proconsul skull. End rant. Other than that I really did like hearing about all these pioneers and their discoveries so if that sounds like your kind of thing read away!*I did have to read this for a class though so maybe I am a little biased. :-)"

Beginning with Darwin's many blunders, and the inspiration that gave to other naturalists, and ending with the devleopment of the molecular clock, which coincides temporally with my own interest in the topic. As an undergrad at UCSC, I studied anthropology, and the molecular clock was the most fascinating thing to me. It never occurred to me at the time that it was new-ish, it just seemed to make so much sense. Reading this put into historical scientific perspective, knowledge that I have always taken for granted."

Carroll must have spent a LONG time doing the research for this. Some parts were slower going than others, but all of it was fascinating, and Carroll takes time to really build each person's character so you can really imagine what they were like in real life (for those that are no longer with us). So much knowledge we take for granted... crazy to think how far we've come and how far we've yet to go!"

43,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826775-a-reader,4,"""All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered; the point is to discover them"".This book is a chronicle of the greatest adventures in natural history in the last 200 years. The author Sean Carroll, a professor of genetics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, looks at the lives of people who had gone into the wild, with one purpose, to find evidence of evolution. He starts with Darwin and his voyage around the world. Darwin's passion for collecting and for exploring the unknown was remarkable, and helped him endure the loneliness, constant seasickness, discomfort, and dangers of the voyage. Next is Alfred Russell Wallace with his two expeditions. Wallace spent in the Amazon four years and he almost lost his life when the ship that was bringing him in England caught fire and sank along with almost all the specimens he had collected. He was rescued, after ten days in a lifeboat, only to leave again, this time to New Guinea, where he spent eight years collecting. It was there, that he came up with the same idea Darwin did, about the evolution, of species. One of most interesting portraits in the book is the one of Charles Walcott. Despite the fact that he never finished formal education, he developed a passion for fossils and became an expert on trilobites - they are arthropods that went extinct in the Permian. He was the first to explore and survey the rocks and the fossils in the Grand Canyon only with himself, a cook and a mule. The task was enormous, but it didn't deter Walcott to make one of the major discoveries in the field of natural sciences. He found the earliest fossil evidence of life; the simplest form of life, during the Precambrian period. Later, Walcott become director of the U.S. Geological Survey, and a trusted advisor to seven different presidents. He also played and significant role in promoting aviation in the United States, and helped in the creation of a new organisation called NACA which was the civil aviation authority in the US and 50 years later, developed into being NASA. Carroll also talks about Eugene Dubois, who found in Java the missing link between apes and humans. It was a molar skullcap and a thigh bone of what we called today, Homo Erectus. Probably the most exciting portrait is that of Roy Chapman Andrews. He had an intriguing personality; an explorer and adventurer, a spy and gifted scientist. He was captivated by Mongolia and the Gobi desert. With his team he discovered the first nest of dinosaur eggs and several new dinosaur species, including Velocipartor and Tarborsaurus. The book is beautifully written. The description of the adventures and struggles of the scientists to discover and fill the gaps in the natural history and human evolution is captivating, and easily grasps the attention of the reader, especially the younger ones. The photographs, maps and charts are useful supplement in the text. The reading list is extensive and comprehensive, and definitely you should go through it. In total, the book is highly recommended."
44,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Champions of natural historyThis book chronicles the adventures of some of the great paleontologists, evolutionists, and molecular biologists in search for the origin of species. The book is described in three major parts; the first part focuses on the origin of species in general; the second part on particular kinds of animals; and finally the origins of human beings. In part one, the epic voyage of Charles Darwin, Alfred Wallace, and Henry Bates who laid foundations for the theory of natural selection and origin of species is vividly explained with the drama, tragedy and adventurism encountered during their long voyages into the far corners of planet. The second part describes the major expeditions for hunting fossils, and spectacular finds in paleontology that sheds light on the evolution of animal species. The last part dealing with natural history of human beings, track discoveries from the archeological, paleontological, and genetic studies that shed much light on the evolution of man. For a general reader this part is perhaps most interesting and especially chapter 13 entitled ""Neander Valley"" which examines if Neanderthals and humans have any biological connection; the discussion analyses very latest results from archeological, genetic and fossil studies. It is an exciting chapter to read. There are interesting facts to be found in the book; when Darwin arrived in Galapagos Island his personal diary indicate he was unimpressed by the island. Alfred Wallace, another evolutionist who worked at the same time as Darwin made original contributions to the early ideas of natural selection. Henry Bates who had special fascination for butterflies studied adaptation in predator-prey relationship. He found that species of moths and butterflies imitate in certain ways that the predator avoids them. For example a large caterpillar raises its head like a poisonous snake to scare off the predator. It also had black dots and segments to give the appearance of snake. He also found that some parasitic bees and flies mimic the forms of nest-building bees and live in their nests ""all expenses paid."" Recently it has been demonstrated in the case of harmless scarlet king snake which is adapted to look like the poisonous coral snake (Chapter 4). The year 2009 marks the birthday of Charles Darwin and this discussion is a celebration of the ideas and achievements of the greatest naturalist and leader of a scientific revolution. This book is highly recommended. "
45,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/146995-sandie,5,"In Remarkable Creatures, Sean Carroll takes the reader on a lively tour of the discoveries in evolution, biology, genetics, archeology, geology and scientific dating that have revolutionized the thinking about how man appeared on earth and changed over the years. Carroll is a professor of molecular biology and genetics and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at the University of Wisconsin, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences.The book is structured in three areas. The first talks of the beginnings of the theory of evolution with chapters on Darwin and on Alfred Wallace (Amazon explorations) and Henry Walter Bates. The second group of chapters discusses the role of fossils and the lengths and privations taken to obtain them, as well as the conclusions reached from them. The final group of chapters talks about the human evolution from the cradle of life in Africa to the Neanderthal chapter and the scientists such as Leakey who pioneered this work. It ends with the new role that molecular biology is playing with providing more exact dates when various life forms existed and the genetic relationships between various forms.This book is recommended for curious readers who want to know more about how we know what we know. It is an overview of the area and highlights the various scientists who advanced knowledge, providing a look at the human side of their lives as well as the scientific discoveries they made. The privations and enthusiasm these individuals displayed as well as the total focus they had on their life work is an amazing characteristic that all shared. Carroll has done an excellent job in explaining the overall theories of life without drowning in the details, providing enough information for those who want to delve more deeply. "

This book wasn't quite what I expected, but it was really lovely. It's not much about the creatures, but mostly about the discoverers. It's interesting, for all that.  This book features a few of my favorite scientists. That got me all excited about what i love about 'em all over again; I do love me some Walcott(i've got a t-shirt with his picture on it) and Pauling (yay for the home team!).This book highlighted for me the sad, sexist and racist state of affairs in science (well, of everything until recent years, when we have at last begun to take the first steps to more equality). Another story about a white male. Another story about a white male. I learned more about Mary Leakey in this book than in any other (a troublemaker after my own heart, a person who enjoyed nothing more than a cigar and a brandy after a long day in the field), but the little snapshots of her interesting life and wild personality are still overshadowed by her husband and son. Ah, well.Surprisingly, many of the male scientists featured in this book married women who took great interest in their work in general and fieldwork in particular. Mary and Lois are occasionally recognized as a team rather than just Lois, but Mary Walcott's fieldwork and botanical diagrams were ignored in the face of her fancypants husband.Had women lived in a world where they were people, not property, and allowed careers too, imagine how far ahead our science (and cultures) would be!

This book is a collection of all the great paleontological discoveries in history from Charles Darwin in the 1850's to Louis Leakey in the early-mid 1900's. It mainly focuses on where life itself came from, but a large part of it is dedicated to the origin of the modern human. It's not so much about the creatures that were discovered, but the people that discovered them. This book wasn't what I expected, but I really loved it when I had finished.	This book describes the discoveries of each “missing link” between modern life and the start of life. It starts out with 3 scientists who are willing to go to South America to gather data for the theory of evolution. Then it goes to discovering the link from fish to mammals with the “fishapod”, the first fossil found with both fish-like and mammal-like characteristics. Lastly, in the search for the history of humans, Neanderthals were discovered. We also finally figured out that modern humans evolved from apes.	I would recommend this book to anyone interested in paleontology, anthropology, or archeology. If you've always wondered where life came from, more importantly humans, then your questions will be answered in this book. One thing I liked about the book was how it went into detail about each scientist's journey, it wasn't just a whole bunch of facts and statements. The only thing I dislike was that many of the scientists got married to women who took great interest in their work, but they were overshadowed by their husbands. Overall, I think this is an amazing book that will keep you wanting to find out more. "
48,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2307976-even,3,"Enjoyable and interesting, but there is definetly some room for improvement. Carroll provides several brief biological sketches of some of the most important and interesting scientific discoveries in the histroy of evolutionary biology and geology. his focus is really about the process and joy of discovery. He begins broadly with the development of evolutionary theory and the voyage of the Beagle and proceeds foward in time and more narrowly in focus to modern biochemical analyisis of modern humans relationships to ancestral hominids. Although teh accounts are interesting, their brevity is their biggest shortcoming. One barely has time to really get intersted in the story before it is over. For the chapters on some of the more widely known figures familiar with the history of science (Darwin, Wallace, Walcott, and Leaky) a lot of the information has been presented much more thouroughly in other works and the thumbnail sketch Carroll provides doesn't add very much. It would probably be sacrilege to mot these figures from any book describing the history of the life sciences, but they are the weak link.What is far more interesting is Caroll's descriptions of lesser known and more modern scientists. If he could have concentrated more effort on these figures and discoveries it would have been a much more rewarding book. Bearing in mind the chapters on the better known figures, most of the chapters on lesser known figures could probably have been beefed up, but the advantage in exploring less well charted areas is one doesn't have to provide as much detail to be informative and interesting. "
49,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi,4,"A great little overview of some notable biologists and their discoveries. Carroll tempers his wonder with rigor, succinctly but thoroughly explaining a great deal of science alongside the zany adventures of his heroes, with ample citations in appendices. My only critiques are that it was too brief to be completely satisfying for someone familiar with the science (at least in broad strokes), and the occasional moments of dorkiness (Snakes on Plane reference (p. 145)? Seriously?).Notes""I did not want to write a book about miserable bastards"" (p. xvi)After being shocked by his first electric eel and left ""affected for the rest of the day with a violent pain in the knees, and in almost every joint,"" Humboldt proceeded to shock himself and his companion again and again to determine how and when the shocks were issued.

But apparently I didn't realize what I was getting into, because the book isn't about biology so much as it is the history of biology. And, I tell ya--if there's one subject I hate, it's history.The book started out okay (it's kind of interesting to think of what it must have been like to be a 19th-century naturalist, tromping around the jungle and collecting bugs that no one back home has ever seen before), but I finally gave up on page 114, during a chapter where we were talking about . . . uh . . . I'm not sure, exactly. Something about a Roosevelt and national parks and some political lobbying. (e.g., topics in which I'm not even remotely interested.)At the end of the day, it's just not worth reading something I don't enjoy when my time could be better spent on something that entertains me.So, if you'll excuse me,

51,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1203192-kristina,5,"This book was a fascinating window into the history of the scientists behind our current understanding of evolution. I teach high school biology, so I'll admit that the topic is pretty well-suited to my personal interests, but Carroll's writing is familiar enough and his treatment of the personal stories of the scientists and history surrounding the development of their ideas is so well crafted, the book becomes a page-turner. This is a wonderful book for anyone learning about or interested in evolution as it helps to flesh out the real lives of the people on the front lines of discovery and it's an easy enough read for a high school biology student (would make a great required summer read!). I do think it's more about the people behind the ideas that the ideas themselves (a lot of science is covered, but not always exhaustively) and I especially appreciated how vibrant and complex Carroll showed the nature of peer review to be. He doesn't make much of a big deal about it beyond expertly telling the story of scientific debates and developments, but considering that we live in a time when many people are science skeptics, the rigor of the process is something that we all should understand."
52,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1922261-cathy-douglas,4,"A good book that could be better. The first 3/4 or so makes very good reading, with the kind of details about the people involved that keep good popular science books interesting to lay readers. There was a lot of familiar material in these chapters, but I found enough that was new and some lively storytelling to keep me going.Unaccountably, the writing degrades as Dr. Carroll gets closer to our own time and his areas of expertise -- interpreting genetic and other information at the cellular level to expand our understanding of evolution. What Dr. Carroll and others are doing in this area is revolutionary, bringing huge amounts of information to light that could never be gleaned from fossilized bones and leaves. But this part of the book is short, overly generalized, less personal than the other chapters, and written with a lack of clarity. Maybe, knowing as much about the subject as Dr. Carroll does, it's harder for him to get the distance he needs for a book of this scope. Evolution is, after all, a huge subject. I would like to see him write another book in five or ten years that picks up where this one leaves off."
53,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/760700-ray,4,"I was very pleaantly surprised by Sean Carroll's book ""Remarkable Creatures: Epic Adventures In the Search For The Origins of Species"". One forgets (or at least I did) how recent many of the discoveries about life on earth really are. For more than a thousand years, mankind's vision of the development of life, about fossils, the age of man itself were based on legends, superstition, or religious teachings. It was only in the past 150 years or so that great strides were made in our understanding of the earth itself and the species which inhabit it. This book tells the stories of some of the individuals who had the thoughts, the insights, and the vision to see what no one else had been able to see before. Most of us know the story of Darwin and his discoveries and theories on evolution, but that's just one of the stories told in Carroll's book. Included are discoveries of our ancient ancestors, new life forms, and other stories in natural history. The work and discoveries of others may not be as familiar to all readers, but all their stories are interesting and informative. "
54,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,3,"This is a popularization of the history of some of the discoveries relating to evolution. It is written at a simple, just beyond YA, level and is a straightforward, unabashedly ""Whig"" narrative with a biographical emphasis. It has chapters on Alexander Humboldt, Charles Darwin, Alfred Russell Wallace (the co-discoverer of natural selection), Henry Walter Bates (Wallace's friend and the discoverer of Batesian mimicry), Eugene DuBois (the discoverer of ""Java Man"" -- now Homo erectus), Charles Wolcott (discoverer of the Burgess Shale), Roy Chapman Andrews and his expeditions to Mongolia, Luis and Walter Alvarez, John Ostrom (discoverer of Deinonychus), the Leakey family, Linus Pauling (the ""DNA clock""), and John Wilson (mtDNA and the ""African Eve""). Some of these stories are familiar, and others less so; the treatment is what some scholars would describe as ""mythmaking"", but factually accurate enough, and quite enjoyable reading, especially after wading through some of the more rigorous but less inspiring scholarly works. The author does take some liberties with the rules of English grammar."
55,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/821374-nicole,5,"I was given a wonderful glimpse of what has driven great naturalists into the field despite fatigue, disease, and sometimes an utter lack of funds. These people clearly enjoyed taking their field by storm and getting down to serious disputations about their findings. There is nothing like a solid wrangle over a fossil to get the best work done.Besides Darwin, Wallace and Bates early work and their influences the book covers Eugène Dubois's discovery of Java Man; Charles Walcott's discovery of the trilobite bearing Burgess Shale and the several Leakey family members discoveries of hominin fossils in Africa. The end segment covers the work begun by Pauling on molecular clocks and the accuracy of comparing genetic drift's neutral changes in DNA coding sequences of homologous proteins. The controversy & impact of genome based cladistics on classical taxonomy is slightly understated. The book tackles a wide range of material and covers it with a lively involved style of writing."
56,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/684055-jen,5,"Hard to imagine a more readable book on the history of natural science than this one. Every chapter is a story from the last 150 years or so of natural science's explosive development, beginning of course with Darwin. Each story shares a similar archetype, and indeed, the book mostly follows the ""great men"" model of history, although their colleagues and wives are included as well. The discoveries covered include the ""Wallace line"", feathered dinosaurs, the incredible discovery of the story of the dinosaurs' extinction (that one blew me away, for its scientific ingenuity and forensics), the Leakeys' discovery of early man, the controversy after molecular dating was developed, etc etc. Carroll is a very adept storyteller, and this is what's so enjoyable about this book: it reads like a fascinating conversation with a passionate expert. The blurb on the cover compares these tales to detective stories, and I think that's apt."

It is most often just a collection of facts, without any history. Books like this tell us the stories behind those discoveries. It's very hard to forget the adventures of HMS Beagle or how Pauling was responsible for new trends in evolutionary biology. But if you just present the facts, they become uninteresting and science loses its charm. This is the area where this book is so ""remarkable"". It goes into the thought process of the discoverers and scientists and tries to give us a view through their eyes. All that without getting boring or too descriptive. The chapters on Darwin, Wallace and Pauling stand out. The afterword is brilliant and makes you wonder about the vastness of the universe and our place in it.A very engaging read.

Of course, it starts with Darwin, but I pleasantly surprised to find that Mr. Carroll gave as much space and attention to each of the other scientists/naturalists that he addressed. I was also thrilled that he didn't just stick to biology, rather branched out into paleontology, paleoanthropology, and molecular biology, and the scientists that in their own way and with their own contributions furthered our understanding of what happened before.

By the end, I was pretty fascinated with what he was talking about and wanted to check out this book. It sounds like each chapter talks about a different person/scientific discovery, each story with its own cinematic drama. I know, origin of species, but it sounds pretty intersting.

As someone with a zoology degree, I was quite familiar with the story of Darwin and Wallace but was delighted to find some factoids that lent warmth and humanity to both these men. Meanwhile, the section on Linus Pauling made me want to read an entire biography of just him, something I hope Sean Carroll would take as a compliment.

I especially appreciated including the errors and false trails that science followed, such as the widespread belief that humans must have evolved in Asia, or that huge conflict apparent age conflicts between fossil evidence for human evolution and genetic evidence. The book makes for a series of fascinating real life detective stories as again and again evidence comes to light that radically changes our understanding and assumptions of what has come before. "
70,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/746637-sally,4,"Sean B. Carroll is always a graceful writer. It took me a little while to get with it, but his stories of important contributors to the evolutionary understanding of paleontology and paleoanthropology add up to an enjoyable history of the theory of evolution. I was struck particularly by several remarkable self-educated people who made tremendous contributions, especially before the mid-20th century. I wonder how many of them would be able to have an impact in today's more formalized, degree-dependent science establishment? "
71,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/749664-pastallreason,4,"Carroll's latest is well worth reading. In a series of chapters that serve as vignettes, Carroll explores the adventurers in evolutionary science who were, themselves, remarkable creatures. Carroll includes notable scientists from the nearly inevitable Darwin and Wallace, to the work done by Neil Fisher, whose book Your Inner Fish was recently on the best-seller list.Carroll writes both as a scientist and an enthusiast. This book is well worth reading."
72,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1716967-orin,5,"This is a remarkable survey of the individual chapters that make up the history of science in the last 150 years. The author catches the thrill of discovery well. My favorite chapters were those dealing with the events at the K-T boundary and the work of the Alvarez family and with the career of Louis Leakey. (Forty years ago I got to hear Leakey speak twice (!)--He was wonderful. I don't remember what he said exactly, but I'll never forget being in his presence.)"
73,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4256070-jose,4,"I loved these stories of a dying breed of men, the adventurer scientists. This book really does a good job painting a narrative of evolution's ""big"" finds through the personal lives of scientists. I appreciate how the author dug a little deeper and found some very interesting anecdotes about the lives of these people. One thing shines through all of it, they were all overwhelmed by the wonder and beauty of nature. It drove them to uncover some truly remarkable things."
74,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/989797-elizabeth,5,"Loved this book! An excellent exploration of the great discoveries in evolutionary biology since (and including) Darwin. This book if full of adventure and insight, and does an amazing job of explaining complex scientific concepts and discoveries in a super accessible and entertaining way. Recommended for anyone with the slightest interest in natural history, evolution, paleontology, anthropology, genetics, dinosaurs, neanderthals, human origins -- anyone with a curious mind, really!"
75,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2244048-kelly,5,"After reading Bill Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything, I wanted to read more about the discovery of ancient creatures, so I was delighted to find this book in my to-read pile (I picked it up randomly at a Half Price nearly a year ago). It was a fascinating read and more up-to-date than the Bryson book. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in evolution and natural history. "
76,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929080-turi,3,"Sean Carroll does a great job illuminating the discoveries, voyages, and people that contributed to our current understanding of evolutionary theory. From Darwin and Wallace to Leakey and Pauling, Remarkable Creatures goes around the world and across disciplines. There's evolutionary theory, paleoanthropology and molecular biology, all explained clearly, simply and interestingly. "
77,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1387036-bill,4,This easy to read book is a science biography of several people who did pioneer work in advancing our world view of evolution. Each chapter is about a different scientist's contribution to further this biological topic. If you are a creationist this is probably not the book for you. It blows a black hole into that idea. 
78,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1064644-nathan,1,"A jumbled rehash of everything you probably have already heard about paleoanthropology, stingy with any real insight. Carroll assumes a folksy tone meant to appeal to the general reader, but then leaves far too much unexplained, zipping from one story to the next without making connections or showing implications. The thing I liked best about this book was the cover art. "
79,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2943813-melissa-stewart,4,"The author has crafted a compelling set of biographical sketches that show readers the life and work of scientists who have contributed to our understanding of the development of life on Earth. I like the idea behind his section introductions, but I found the italic type hard to read. I'm not sure that the final section was necessary. It seems a bit tangential to me. "
80,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1657155-jenny,5,"This book contains a series of biographical sketches about different scientists and explorers who have advanced our knowledge of evolution and human origins. From the 18th century naturalists who explored the Amazon river basin to modern molecular biologists, Sean Carroll describes both the people and their discoveries. "
81,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5478053-cynthia,0,"Although presented from the point of view of an evolutionist (which I am NOT), it is a great overview of how and where fossils were discovered from Darwin on. The book helps one understand why evolutionists believe what they do. However, read from a creationist perspective, the evidence for creation is everywhere in these discoveries. Fascinating read."
82,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7965448-alp5087,5,Carroll wrote this for the lay person so anyone can pick it up and enjoy. The well written story format makes it a fun natural history book. It takes you on a journey starting before Darwin and up to controversies still being debated in science. The short story format makes it easy to pick up and skip around to certain parts of evolution.
83,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27042780-vishnu-ramasubramanian,5,A beautiful and engaging book. The author has very much succeeded in bringing to life the adventures and spirit of several remarkable people who brought forth significant advances in evolutionary biology. It is also a very personal tale of the evolution of ideas in the study of evolution. The tales are more than inspiring. A must read for biologists.
84,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6803385-michael,4,"Yet another great book from Dr. Carroll. This book specifically focuses on the scientists who are responsible for what we know about species origins. Dr. Carroll is an excellent storyteller and brings excitement to the field of scientific discovery. For anyone who thinks that science is boring, you will not think so after reading this book. "
85,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1022779-sue,4,"Very well written; author tells stories of some of the most dramatic adventures and important discoveries in the last two centuries of natural history. Accounts of Darwin, Leakey, Pauling, and more. It brings to life the pursuit and pleasure of scientific discovery."
86,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1445709-tyas,4,Stories of scientists and adventurers always excite me. Thank you Mbak Nurul for lending me this book :)And the photographs astonished me. What a work to retouch those old pics so that they come out as clear as modern ones!
87,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1742371-ben,3,A great collection of stories covering the highlights of evolution and the people who put the pieces together over the years.And further evidence that people who reject the theory of evolution are deeply deluded.
88,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2063400-rose,4,"I for the most part enjoyed the book. But than again, I find all of this fascinating. My only complaint was that it tended to drag when the author focused on the data and I was concerned that my other bookclub members would become bored."
89,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1119137-vickie-rinn,5,I wasn't sure I would like this book - but my son is a budding paleontologist -- and I trust my friend Heidi's recommendation. Its a very well written book. Even if you have a little interest in evolution. If you have a large interest - even better
90,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1594096-brock,2,"The science in this book was too abbreviated. Apparently the author was attempting to pique the interest of readers unfamiliar with the basics of evolution. Despite this, some stories were interesting."
91,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6485-elizabeth,0,"As seen on Wormbook. Also, nominated for the 2009 National Book Award."
92,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/647596-stacey,4,"Reads like a page-turner even if you know a lot of the territory already. Includes the guy who provided inspiration for Indiana Jones. The real story is a lot more interesting than the movies, and the movies are GREAT! And pictures. Dinosaur FEATHERS. Dinosaur EGGS!"
93,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1446194-caroline,3,"Biographical sketches of scientists and naturalists who made vital contributions to evolutionary science. Carroll has a gift for bringing characters to life; his writing is engaging and informative, making sometimes complicated science accessible to the average reader."
94,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/332083-max,4,"This was fun. The first half was particularly good, though the second half slowed down a bit. Still, it was interesting and educational. Also, I was surprised at how much biologists have learned since I originally learned this stuff in school. "
95,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/157777-evannn,4,"It took me a long time to finish this book, but I'm glad I did. It can get a bit dry at times (or maybe I was just impatient), but it's a wonderful look into the lives and work of some of the most important contributors to our collective knowledge of the natural sciences. Very worthwhile read."
96,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1610052-jocelyn,4,"The foreword starts off a little bombastic, but once you're into the chapters, the tone changes and is easier to read. Each chapter revolves around people involved in developing the theory of evolution, from the people who influenced Darwin to those who are currently working on DNA."
97,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2730767-david-wiggins,3,This is solid retelling of some the most important discoveries in evolution. I recommend it as a must read for those just embarking in evolutionary science and aren't quite ready something more in-depth and data heavy. 
98,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2770066-glynn,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I have read books about many of the people the author is writing about (the Remarkable Creatures of the title) and this book brings their stories together in a really concise and intelligent way, with a bit of whimsy thrown in for good measure. "
99,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7601928-steve,3,I got this book from the library and was apparently unforgettable enough that after about 45 pages in I finally realized I had already taken the book out and read it. Weird. But still contains some great stories on some great biologists
100,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7259446-alexandrea,4,This book was both accessible to the general reader yet detailed enough for the more science-oriented reader. It strikes a good balance and effectively narrates some of the most fascinating evolutionary discoveries. A surprisingly fast read.
101,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,3,"Had I not read his other books first, I would probably have rated this book higher. It is a wonderful story of how science is sought and theories made. As always, Carroll is a wonderful story teller. Anything he writes is worth the read. "
102,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3098807-carol-chapman,5,"A friend recommended this, and I was quite impressed with it. I especially liked the way the book is laid out, following the progress of findings related to species evolution. Much progress has been going on during my adult life that I was not aware of."
103,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5780181-david-moore,5,"There are not enough stars to rate this book.This was a great book reminding us of advances in science, our understanding, and how we got to where we are today.""No great discovery as ever made without a bold guess."" - Isaac Newton""One man with courage is a majority."" - Andrew Jackson"
104,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5707216-erik,3,"The discovery and development of the theory of evolution is interesting. This book focuses on the people more than the science, although you get a good dose of that too. Just skip over the boring parts. "
105,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9795509-kirsten-marie,4,"Excellent popular science readNot mind-blowing writing like ""Age of Wonder"", but great none-the-less! I would recommend it to any interested in getting a foundational understanding of evolutionary discoveries post-Darwin. "
106,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27846689-ed-kohinke-sr,5,"I think this is the best book about science for nonscientists I have ever read. Now I want to read the author's newest book, The Serengeti Rules, and hope more writers like him take up the cause of telling the story of science in similar style to folks like me. "
107,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2492176-tricia,5,"Just started, but very interesting historical information on the development of the theory of evolution. More soon."
108,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2273213-beckydham,2,I think I was expecting something else--more detailed? More of a developed theme? This is a good intro book to all these scientists if you've never read anything else about them.
109,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1031116-roseann,5,"Awesome, informative, a little nerdy, and very well done. Good read!"
110,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/326171-carolyn,3,These are all fascinating stories but this is geared toasted people who don't have a background in anthropology or the sciences so I was already familiar with all of this material.
111,015101485X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2515315-deb-holden,4,Great book about discoveries in Natural History
