0,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"What a wonderfully ""feel-good"" book about science! Michio Kaku is a theoretical physicist, and a well-known author of popular books about physics, especially the future of physics. In this book, he strays a bit from physics, and enters the realms of biology, neuroscience, evolution, and the brain. Kaku admits that he is not an expert in these fields. However, he writes so engagingly, his fast-paced, light-hearted writing style, and fearless exploration of a wide range of topics makes this a very fun book to read.This book explores a wide range of topics, including consciousness, telepathy, telekinesis, memories, enhancing intelligence, dreams, mind-control, artificial intelligence, the mind transcending the framework of the body, and possibilities of an alien mind. Wherever possible, Kaku uses his intimate knowledge of physics to lend credence to his speculations about the future of the mind. Kaku does not try to be overtly humorous, but his prose always seems to be just ""on the verge"" of subtle humor. Since this book is about ""the future"", Kaku peppers his chapters with references to science fiction books and movies. This book should really appeal to science fiction fans, and to anyone interested in understanding what the near and distant future holds for evolution of the mind."
1,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"The future of human mind and artificial intelligenceIn this book, City University of New York Professor Michio Kaku, a well-respected theoretical physicist has discussed our current understanding of human mind and consciousness, and where it is heading in the next few decades. He has followed his life-long interest in biology of mind in this exhaustive literature work after his discussion with leading neurobiologists. Despite the fact that his field of expertise lies in theoretical physics, this book is written with scientific accuracy and solid understanding of the subject.Using MRI scans, biologists can now read thoughts of our brains; a totally paralyzed patient with a microchip inserted into the patient's brain can literally do anything a normal person could do via a computer. In the first part of the book, the author defines consciousness and the various types of consciousness that exists in this world. The second part of the book looks at computers that record electrical signals emanating from brain and decode them into familiar digital language. Thus brain and computer can be directly interfaced (brain-machine interface) to control any object around it. The author discusses with examples to illustrate how new technology has helped scientists to record memories, mind reading, videotaping our dreams and telekinetically control objects around us (mind controlling matter), and perhaps enhance our intelligence. In the third part, the author introduces us into alternate forms of consciousness, observed in dreams; drug-induced state; mental illness; and non-human consciousness of robots and aliens. There is an interesting section (appendix) that summarizes quantum consciousness and describes how consciousness and the laws of physics overlap to make physical reality a coherent whole. This is one of the best sections of the book I have read where the author shares his expertize as a theoretical physicist. This part is lucidly written and I enjoyed reading it.According to the author, consciousness is a process of creating a model of the world using multiple feedback loops in various parameters (spacetime, temperature, pressure and in relation to others) to find friends, food, shelter, and other survival necessities. Level 0 consciousness that exist among plants which doesn't have nervous structure but responds to heat, light and pressure. Level-1 consciousness exists at the lower side of evolution where the central nervous system is primitive (brain structure: brain stem) and reacts only in space but not time (no sense of past or future). Level-2 consciousness that exists among mammalian systems where the nervous system is evolved (brain structure: limbic system) which has a well-defined social structure. Level-3 consciousness exists only in humans where the brain structures consists of prefrontal cortex, and operate in space and time, especially future: Feedback loops evaluate the past and simulate the future. It follows from this that self-awareness is creating a model of the world and simulating the future in which you appear.Another sticky question that is addressed while discussing reality is the concept of free will, does it really exist. The author concludes that it may exist but not the way we think; that we are the masters of our fate. The brain influenced by unconscious factors that predisposes us to make certain choices ahead of time even if we think we made the decision ourselves. The end of the fate is not written yet because the effects of quantum reality and chaos theory preclude strict determinism.I have rated this book five stars since it reads flawlessly. Highly recommended to anyone interested in the future of mind and how artificial intelligence will control our destiny."
2,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369276-james-williams,1,"I can't abide futurism. The best science fiction postulates an imaginary future society with imaginary future technologies and explores the present through a fantastical lens. Futurism, on the other hand, postulates that imaginary future because ""why not?"". Futurism is little more than making extravagant predictions while hand-waving away the very real technical issues that stand between the present and that predicted future. In my field of computer programming, we often tell stories of ""the sufficiently advanced compiler"": a theoretically-possible program that be able to understand what we mean when we write computer programs and not just what we say and will use that understanding to rewrite programs to be faster and more correct than we could ever manage on our own. It should be needless to say that this sufficiently advanced compiler does not really exist, even though the only thing standing in its way is sufficiently clever engineering. It turns out that sufficiently clever engineering is really hard. Similarly, futurism pretends that all of their fantastical technical advances are just a matter of that same kind of sufficiently clever engineering. ""This is theoretically possible, therefore we're guaranteed to figure it out, and I don't need to worry about the how because it's just engineering."" is the song of the futurist -- and once they've established that one or two fantastic technologies are inevitable they can pile advancement on top of advancement on it until you end up with future predictions that are barely distinguished from fairy tales. It is, or (at least) should be, obvious that this book is a work of futurism. It has the word ""future"" in the title and everything. But, I'd hoped that Dr. Kaku's experiences with actual physics would drive him to ground the work in the reasonable if not the possible. Unfortunately, Dr. Kaku is extremely excitable. Excitability certainly has its place in science. I like my popular scientists to exude a sense of and wonder, but I'm also pleased when they can barely keep themselves from jumping up and down because science is just so cool. Unfortunately, Kaku quickly moves from excitement to breathlessness as moves without pause from wonder to wonder that neuroscience is making possible. Well, might make possible. Well, might show is theoretically possible. One day. It's an engineering problem. Let's assume it's real and see what happens next. And so on and so forth. At one level, it's exhausting. He never slows down to let you marvel at the mysteries of the brain or the Herculean efforts that researchers are making in order to unlock them. At another level, it's extremely frustrating as he completely sacrifices the near-term in favor of looking centuries ahead. By focusing solely on the far-future potential (beaming consciousness around the solar system? Really?), he's giving short-shrift to the work-a-day scientists who are relentlessly plugging away at the enigmas that are in front of them today. But then again, I suppose: what should I expect from a theoretical physicist? Dr. Kaku's prowess as a theoretical physicist may also lead into the second most problematic part of this book (aside from my distaste for futurism in general): ""I'm not an expert in this, but..."". The most glaring example of this is when Kaku admits that he does't know what he's talking about but decides to try to define ""consciousness"" anyway. That's the entire second chapter of the book, ""Consciousness - A Physicist's Viewpoint"". Instead of being embarrassed about trying to define something that the actual experts in the field have struggled with, he instead builds large portions of the book on top of this scaffolding. Indeed, he seems quite proud of his definition. He gives it a name, ""the space-time theory of consciousness"" and refers to it by name again and again. I have my doubts about his theory of consciousness. I don't think it's entirely wrong, but I also don't think it's entirely useful. I was also put off by the way he pokes fun at the homunculus argument (which more-or-less posits that there's a ""little person"" in the brain driving our bodies) and then almost immediately names an imaginary ""CEO"" as the consciousness in his definition. I've read the entire book and I can't really tell you the difference between Kaku's CEO and the discredited homunculus. If all you're going to do is reduce the idea down to an ineffable ""CEO"", what's the point? And how can you build so much of your book on this topic? Finally, Dr. Kaku's insistence that so many wonderful things (""reverse-engineering the brain"", making full brain copies, beaming our consciousness to the stars on beams of light, controlling robots with our brain as if they were our bodies, etc.) are only a century out (two centuries out at most) seems perfectly analogous to the claims that useful fusion reactors are only fifty years away -- claims that have been made continuously for over fifty years. A scientist's skepticism should require him to justify these claims with far more than he even attempts. Ultimately, I found this book extremely unsatisfying. The interesting work being done today would make a fascinating book, but Kaku races past them to instead dive into limp science fiction which offers neither the technical rigor of the best ""hard"" sci-fi nor the reflection of our own society offered by ""soft"" sci-fi. I can only recommend it as a reminder to not read non-fiction books with the word ""future"" in the title. They rarely go well. "
3,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9968594-maria,4,"For so many many centuries, the universe and consciousness have been two of the greatest mysteries for many philosophers and scientists. Interestingly, physicists like Francis Crick and Christof Koch among many others have engaged to this fascinating area of research. In ""Future of the Mind"" Michio Kaku, a theoretical physicist, also approaches this subject. What is consciousness? Is it possible to be explained by the laws of Physics? and, with such an advance in technology, what can we expect of this topic on the future? The book is divided in three major parts: Book I (The Mind and the Consciousness), Book II (Mind Over Matter) and Book III (Altered Consciousness) and I will mention a few thoughts on some topics of each book.Book IAs in many books that approach this complex and fascinating subject of neuroscience, ""The future of the mind"" introduces the reader with basic generalizations of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology. Also, some background history beginning with the famous Phineas Gage case that led to the understanding of the important role that the frontal lobe plays on behavior, also the study of Wernicke and Broca's patients to understand language, Joseph Gall's pseudoscience of phrenology and Dr. Penfield's homunculus which is a generalized map of the motor cortex we still find useful today in medical texts. These cases are important because they mark the beginning of the era of Neuroscience. Honestly, I would have loved a bigger chapter that included more neuroscientists such as the Nobel laureate Ramon Ramon y Cajal's work on neurons or the first psychiatrist Dr Meynert, who was Freuds professor at School of Medicine in Vienna leading to one of the most important theories of the mind we've had and which the author does not discuss.Kaku also introduces the reader to the evolutionary history of the brain (reptilian--> mammalian--> human), being the neocortex our highest evolutionary structure involved in higher cognitive functioning. The introductory information given is very accurate but very generalized and you can easily find it in many books related to neuroscience. So, where are we standing today in neuroscience? How are we able to understand how our brain works and what are we still missing? The many useful high technology devices that have been created to understand our brain are thanks to the four forces that govern our universe, some of this machines are: MRI, fMRI, DBS and optogenetics, all of these based on the electromagnetic force except PET scans which is governed by the weak force. It is worth noting that as new technological devices are invented so the analogies regarding our brain functioning, such as the hydraulic model, the telephone model and now the computational theory of the mind.The author does not leave behind and also creates an analogy of subconscious as the CEO obviously representing the prefrontal cortex... Our rational thought, the area that plans and helps you take decisions. Although Kaku doesnt talk about Freuds Theory of Mind, what i did find interesting was his ""space-time theory of consciousness"" defined as:""Consciousness is the process of creating a model of the world using multiple feedback loops in various parameters (e.g., in temperature, space, time, and in relation to others), in order to accomplish a goal (e.g., find mates, food, shelter).""According to this idea animals create their goal based more on environment and space and humans base more this model on relation with time.He gives this theory three levels of consciousness, which mostly applies to the evolutionary structures of our brain. Level I will be that of the reptiles and level II which includes the limbic system essential for relations will be that of mammalian brain. Finally, level III that of the human brain defined as the following:""Human consciousness is a specific form of consciousness that creates a model of the world and the simulates in time, by evaluating the past to simulate the future. This requires mediating and evaluating many feedback loops in order to make a depiction to achieve a goal.""Based on this definition, we use our model or view of the world by analyzing previous experiences and memories of people or events and use all this to predict the future and therefore make the decisions we would consider appropriate for a favorable outcome. If this space-time theory is accurate, Kaku says that it can give us a definition of self awareness:""Self awareness is creating a model of the world and simulating the future in which you appear""Book II. In Mind over Matter, Kaku approaches Telepathy, Telekinesis, Memory and Intelligence. On memory: What do you think of the idea of downloading a memory or perhaps learning a new complex skills (Matrix style) and molding our intelligence with new software? The possibility to create or experience new memories, or sharing it just as we upload our pictures through the web, live a new trip or love experiences, or the memories of loved ones already passed away, will that lead us to lose the difference from our innate self and fake memories??? Would this ever be possible? I do think of the amazing possibilities it could bring for patients suffering from amnesia or also it's exciting to know the use of optogenetics to activate or shut down memories such as in PTSD patients. What has the function of memory provided in our evolutionary process and why are they so important to us? That is of the ability to predict the future and act and take decisions according to these experiences,This is the essential reason of why humans are intelligent. I also applaud Kaku approaching the prion like proteins topic involved in Alzheimer's (tau amyloid proteins) and the CREB genes role in memory formation... quite accurate but I insist, this is another topic which I would have loved he expanded more with detailed information. Sometimes, it did seemed like reading a special-edition science magazine.Book III. Altered Consciousness: Dreams, mind-control, artificial intelligence, altered states of consciousness, reverse engineering in the brain and the alien brain. On the chapter Altered state of consciousness, which I really enjoyed, Kaku approaches OCD, Schizophrenia and Hallucinations with the sufficient neuroscience behind each disorder and talks about where are we placed right now regarding management and the possibilities of how science will approach them in the future. Once again, he gives us a definition of most forms of mental illness based on his space-time theory of consciousness:""Mental illness is largely caused by the disruption of the delicate checks and balances between competing feedback loops that simulate the future (usually because one region of the brain is o reactive or under-active)""Some hospital today make use of DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation), a small probe inserted into a brain and applying electro shocks like a pacemaker, many disorders like depression, Parkinson's and epilepsy or even comma patients are being treated. So far DBS and pharmacotherapy, have been the best way to manage these cases but not the optimal state, sometimes only to ameliorate symptoms. Molecular reductionist approach has also helped understand the neurobiochemistry of many disorders and the main target that can guide new and more specific treatments. Now, the BRAIN initiative is expected to complete a detailed map of the brain at neural level with the possibility to understand the exact pathophisiology behind disorders like Alzheimer, Parkinson's, dementia or bipolar disorders and hopefully, the upcoming technology can give us a better approach to help many of these patients in a successful way. Could you imagine the possibility of a paralyzed patient to move thanks to the use of a microchip inserted to his brain? In summary, the information given by Michio Kaku is accurate and I could probably stop at every topic and discuss many thoughts i have in mind related to neuroscience, from evolution to artificial intelligence, but i should leave you with something to read by yourself. His space-time theory of consciousness is good and useful and he tries to demonstrate its application throughout the book. Also, Kaku uses many analogies and examples with books and movies including Star Trek, Star Wars or Planet of the apes, A space odyssey 2001 and many other fictional characters to place the reader on the topic and it was quite funny to see his geek side, especially if you like them. So, what can we expect in the near future regarding treatments and technology? Is there really alien intelligence out there? Is it possible that Artificial Intelligence could ever develop consciousness and take decisions for us like Hal 9000? Would we continue evolving and give a big step towards the next Homo evolutis or Star Child or have we reached our limitations?Read the book and allow your mind imagine all the possibilities that science could give our human race in the future! A fantastic Voyage! "
4,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2366087-randy,3,"I haven't finished it yet, but I don't need to finish this one to write the review.It's a nice summary of the state of knowledge about the human brain... how it works, how technology is being used to learn more about it and how technology is being used to fix it/control it.The level of technical skill needed to read this book is on a par with any of the popular science shows on the Discovery Channel. That's not a complaint; I like the 30,000 foot view it provides.But the constant surface treatment is a bit monotonic. I thoroughly enjoy hearing Professor Kaku on any program I find him... but the constant stream of summary level info doesn't satiate me. There is a large percentage of commentary about developments which may follow, or ethical conundrums which may present... and no real in-depth discussion of ethical conundrums which already exist.It's a broad category, and I really am enjoying the trip. I do wish there were more _Nature_ and less _Scientific American_.============================= Update, after completing the book.I don't withdraw the earlier criticism. It continued to pall, hearing ""this may happen"" over and over.There were also a couple of places where his logic baffled me a bit. Perhaps it's the reader's stupidity in this case... The passage on encoding consciousness on a laser beam referred to transmission stations on the moon and planets, and the physics of it just didn't make sense to me.Anyhow, it was a diverting read. I'm not sorry I picked it up, and would recommend it to any layman interested in the brain. Just don't be swayed by the celebrity of its author into expecting something deep."

Kaku did a great job tying modern culture into the book, from robots and Skynet, to hard science. However ... more than half the book was filled with ""maybe this could happen,"" ""this might be possible,"" and ""one day, if ...""—which really got old fast.Yes, I should have known better from the title, *The Future of the Mind.* Personally, I'm not a big fan of excessive future-casting, and ""what if's,"" I suppose I should have known better. Still, lots of interesting tidbits: full RTC."
6,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32383826-kristy-k,3,"Interesting, but I have to say I enjoyed Kaku's The Future of Humanity a lot more. This wasn't quite as engaging. "
7,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"Michio Kaku, a theoretical physicist with a love of science fiction and of explaining science to non-scientists as well as of physics, once again takes a big, broad subject area that people are fascinated by, and explores what we know and can do now, what we can expect in the near future, and what the next century or two might bring us.This is a readable, fascinating introduction to what we know about the workings of the human brain, and how the mind emerges from it, as well as the current state and realistic prospects for artificial intelligence.In recent decades we have learned, with new tools many of which emerge from physics, startling details about the deep structure of the brain, what parts correspond to which abilities and behaviors, and how memory is constructed and stored. As we understand more about how our brains and minds really work, the problems of artificial intelligence become clearer. Past periods of optimism about AI were founded largely in a lack of understanding of the complexities involved. Now we have a much greater understanding of what intelligence and consciousness are, and a more realistic prospect of creating the computing power we need to replicate it--in the future. That capacity doesn't exist yet, and we are in the early stages of creating robots with minimal ""intelligence"" and learning ability. The breakthroughs we've made are exciting, though, and the prospects even more so.As our ability to create intelligent machines increases, what will the implications be? Will our machines be our children, or will they be a threat to us? Will we use mechanical surrogates controlled by our own minds to explore distant worlds? Will we achieve immortality through replacement robotic bodies? Will we live our lives wholly inside a computer-generated environment?Kaku also considers the question of intelligent alien life. Why haven't we heard from them? What will happen when we do find intelligent aliens? Aliens advanced enough to make traveling from their worlds to ours would not be just a few centuries ahead of us, technologically; they would be thousands of years ahead of us. Would they even notice us, or would the biggest danger we face from them be the danger the deer face from the developer--having our environment developed into uninhabitability, not out of malice but because we're not important enough to notice.This is an entertaining, educational, and stimulating book. Recommended.I received a free electronic galley from the publisher via NetGalley."
8,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2036385-ivy,1,"Interesting intro to neuroscience for the casual reader. If you're looking for depth and analysis, this is not the book for you. I belong to the latter category, and for me, the shallowness makes it an incredibly frustrating read.Don't get me wrong. I like Michio Kaku. He's a very charismatic speaker. But I just don't like to waste my time on magazine-level introductory knowledge. "
9,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/146952-grumpus,4,"Each Michio Kaku book challenges the limits of my understanding by slowly taking me to the edge of what I know and then pushing me over the precipice. His books always seem to start out slowly by getting me comfortable with what I already know. Next, he pulls the rug out and I’m happily trying to figure out which way is up. The types of things that scientists are working on today make me sad that I probably won’t be around to benefit from them. Some of these “mind” things as well as robotics are going to give humans abilities we only dream of today. However, they will come with a price. Eventually, completely new fields of expertise in bioethics will have to be developed in conjunction with the legal community to handle the gray areas we will soon have the capability to move into. So much to contemplate, so much wonder, so much awe, so many possibilities. I don’t know whether to be excited for humanity or scared."
10,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,3,"Physicist Michio Kaku, an expert in string theory, might not seem the obvious person to take us on a tour of what the subtitle describes as ‘the scientific quest to understand, enhance and empower the mind.’ But Kaku is a very experienced science communicator and though I didn’t feel the same deep connection with, and love for, his subject as comes across in his physics-based books, there is certainly a lot to ponder in this reasonably chunky bit of scientific futurology.Of all the great science popularisers – and I don’t hesitate to put him in that bracket – Kaku is the most deeply immersed in the science fiction tradition. For every example of a scientific idea he has a story to put it into context, which if you like SF, as I do, is a great asset. The only slight problem this makes for is that when Kaku extrapolates a piece of current technology into the future he tends to oversimplify the problems and goes far too far. So, for instance, an experiment where monkeys are led to feel the sense of touch from a remote sensor leads us to Kaku prompting an interviewee to say ‘I think this is the first demonstration that something like the [Star Trek, the Next Generation] holodeck will be possible in the near future.’ This is almost the definition of hyperbole. My suspicion is that physicists make better science fiction writers than futurologists.Throughout the book we visit different aspects of the brain and the mind and how they might in the future be enhanced. This often involves finding out more about current brain conditions and injuries, as these have frequently resulted in discovering more about the workings of this most remarkable organ. Kaku quotes a mind-boggling example of a patient with a split brain. Without the usual connection of the corpus callosum, the left and right sides of the brain can hold different opinions and have different feelings. We hear of a patient whose left brain was atheist and right brain was a religious believer – a quite remarkable state of affairs. The ‘learning through damage and illness’ bit is necessary, but after a while, hearing about all these failings of the brain does get a little wearing.Along the way we experience mind-to-mind communication, mind controlling machines, intelligence enhancement (though strangely with hardly any overlap with Smarter), artificial intelligence, disembodied minds and more. There’s a lot of good material here, but somehow I found reading it a little too much like hard work, rather than the feast of ideas we often get in one of Kaku’s books. Interesting, but not one of his best."
11,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16523736-slim-khezri,5,"Knowledge and education is everything in life!!!! This is one fantastic book. ""The Future of the Mind"" by Michio Kaku introduces inquisitive readers to the exciting science of the human mind. Dr. Kaku is perhaps the preeminent popular scientist of our time with numerous books, television productions and media appearances to his credit. This fascinating book will interest everyone who wants to get up to speed on the rapidly evolving field of brain sciences including what the future might hold for humanity.The book is divided into three sections. `Book I: The Mind and Consciousness' is a brief survey of brain research up to the present day including an overview of how the brain works. `Book II: Mind Over Matter' discusses how science is shedding new light on telepathy, telekinesis, memories and the possibility of enhancing the brain's powers. `Book III: Altered Consciousness' speculates about how humanity's mastery of brain sciences might radically change our destiny on earth and beyond, including allowing us to reach across the universe with our minds.Of course, Dr. Kaku carefully weighs the myriad ethical issues that inevitably come up when scientists talk about tinkering with the human brain. For example, when discussing the possibility of improving human intelligence, Dr. Kaku points to the benefits of enabling workers to rapidly learn new job skills but also warns about the social disparity that might ensue if such powerful technology is distributed only to the few. More than anything else, Dr. Kaku shares his vision and enthusiasm for where science can lead us. Through his demonstrated command of the subject matter, we become excited not only about the shorter-term promise of discovering more effective treatments for mental illnesses; but also about the longer-term possibility of exploring distant stars using our minds. The end result is a highly engaging book that rewards us with its keen intelligence, compassion and sense of wonder.I highly recommend this outstanding book to everyone. I LOVED it!!!!!! "
12,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2209582-ross,1,"Very disappointing. This book is billed as scientific but is simply science fiction nonsense. The book starts out well enough with a review of the current types of brain scans and some commentary of potential future enhancements to these technologies. Then the author launches into wild speculation about telepathy and telekinesis and how these may be possible in the ""very near future."" Since my only interest in the brain is of a purely scientific and practical bent, these speculations were of zero interest to me and I gave up."

Great read for a wide range of those interested in the future of science and the brain!What a fun read this was! Not often do books make me want to hide away from the world, until I can finish it in one read. While working my way through this one, I never did want to put it down, except when coming across an experiment that Michio Kaku touched upon, that I wanted to jump further into online.On that note, the only downside to the book was that so many fun topics were reviewed, that it was necessary to check out some further online or in other books. Michio goes over such a vast range of new experiments and work being done globally, the depth was not there on some topics. However this is to be expected when covering many multiple topics. Michio does well by leaving a suggested reading section, as well as notes as to where to further review many of the topics in full. It was a wise choice of Mr. Kaku to see the one fault with the book (which was inevitable) and leave an answer for it.I really enjoyed how there was the ties with real life projects and experiments, in the way of bringing in movies and books such as Star Trek, Terminator and the Matrix. It really made it easier to make this a fun read, vs an overly dry factual book.I like how Michio went and spoke with the folks running these new projects into the brain, instead of just giving the facts on them. Some of the most interesting parts of the book were the comments some of the folks managing the projects had made when questioned. The background history to how some of the projects of today, came into existence, or how the future of some inventions will truly change our world, made this a fun and informative book, filled with tie ins to books like Carrie or to the famous Jedi Knights.Its a great book for sci-fi lovers, as well as those looking to see what's in store for humans over the next few years. The insight into projects that the heads of the world today, are putting money into, is very informative.Not much further to say, the book itself hits many new projects involved with the human mind, as well as the future and direction of science studies dedicated to making us healthier, smarter, and enhancing us further in all aspects of life. It ties in movies and books and fun facts with futuristic ideas. It gives a good and bad side to how some of the projects can be abused and the morality behind the reasoning, with references to how some projects can be abused by the military.I am looking forward to snagging up a few more of his books, it really made science extremely fun and fascinating. I think he absolutely hits the mark between teaching facts and keeping the readers attention.""...the more I learn about the sheer complexity of the brain, the more amazed I am that something that sits on our shoulders is the most sophisticated object we know about in the universe."" - pg. 327"

Kaku's presentation is effortless and very accessible, like one of his numerous youtube videos.You just cannot help getting infected with his enthusiasm about the science he presents - the science which sheds new light on deemed-esoteric-forever concepts like telepathy, telekinesis and mind reading and that which is on the cusp of performing tasks like memory implants, memory recording, dream videotaping, mental espionage and numerous others.He not only describes the ways scientists design and do these experiments, but also dexterously points to precursors in sci-fi books and movies.The concepts behind atleast 25-30 movies were explained in considerable detail , which for a not-so-avid movie watcher like me felt like a bonanza.Another wonderful aspect of the book is how he theorizes and weighs the numerous ethical issues that should creep up once such brain tinkerings are perfected and become common practice.A highly informative and feel-good book. Hoping to read his other ones."

The book may be geared down slightly too much for layman, though. I'm admittedly no scientist. I find it hard to follow certain recipes or build IKEA furniture. But I did find myself getting anxious throughout the book, peaking ahead, hoping Mr. Kaku would speed things up a bit. Not only does the science feel watered down at times, but the effect is heightened with the author (maybe the editor or publisher's fault) attempting to cater to more of a pop culture crowd. Sometimes its hard not to imagine the Mr. Kaku writing this in the basement of his parents house, friends are over drinking cream soda and discussing if such-and-such from Star Trek or The Matrix or whatever is actually possible.For all the shit i'm talking, I enjoyed the read. The last chapter is pretty wild, too. It introduces quantum theory and applies the mechanics to the function of the brain's neurons. That really got the old bean throbbing and I had trouble sleeping that night."

The book starts with an outline of neuro-anatomy and then shows the kinds of interventions and enhancements that may soon be coming to a brain near you. A fun book with a lot of to think about. The possibilities for use and abuse of these technology is something we may have to grapple with in the near future. A nice heads up for the reader on the future of these technologies. "
18,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17629329-leah,4,"Science, sci-fi or fantasy?As a theoretical physicist, Michio Kaku may not be the obvious choice to tackle the subject of the science of the brain, but he undoubtedly has a gift for writing about complex subjects in an accessible way. In this book he looks at the history of neuroscience, where we are now, and then spends a huge chunk of the book speculating about where the scientists may take us in the future.He starts by describing the physical properties of the brain, explaining how over the last century or so scientists have discovered how the various parts interact with each other. He speculates in an informed way as to why the human brain should have evolved as it has, and defines the main difference between humans and other species as our ability to consider possible futures as a way to inform our decisions.“I call this the “space-time theory of consciousness,” because it emphasizes the idea that animals create a model of the world mainly in relation to space, and to one another, while humans go beyond and create a model of the world in relation to time, both forward and backward.”He then looks at some of the experimentation that is currently taking place, with major pushes from both the EU and the US to discover possible treatments for the growing problem of dementia caused by our ageing populations, together with other kinds of mental illness, which he suggests quite firmly are in the main caused by physical factors.So far, so good. His writing style and enthusiasm for the subject make for an interesting and informative read, though his descriptions of much of the animal experimentation that is going on also left me feeling uncomfortable and conflicted. Although he continually emphasises the aim of treatment for illnesses and brings up the subject of ethics repeatedly, it seemed fairly clear that many of the scientists, Kaku included, are really interested in knowledge for knowledge sake, and don’t always have strong personal ethical constraints in how they pursue it. Frankenstein, it appears, is alive and well, and is being heavily subsidised by our governments. Let us hope he is also being subjected to close scrutiny…although, as Kaku makes clear, much of the research is going on in the name of ‘defence’ – never a field noted for its sensitivity and humanity. ""Dr Nicolelis starts by connecting the motor cortex of rhesus monkeys to mechanical arms. These mechanical arms have sensors on them, which then send signals back to the brain by electrodes connected to the somatosensory cortex (which registers the sense of touch). The monkeys were given a reward after every successful trial; they learned how to use the apparatus within four to nine trials.""But what Kaku seems really interested in is the future, and here he goes into so much wild speculation that I found my credulity creaking at the seams. For a start, every speculation he comes up with seems to have its roots in an episode of Star Trek, which he mentions repeatedly throughout. Like him, I have a love for the series – unlike him, I don’t believe it’s a blueprint for the future. He moves rapidly through the remotely possible – creating a human-like robot such as, for instance, Commander Data – to inserting technology in our brains to allow us to read minds and act as one unit – à la the Borg – and on to one day uploading our consciousness into computers and living a disembodied and eternal life, possibly with holodeck-type avatars acting on our behalf. Uh-huh! (I’m guessing he’s read Frederik Pohl too.) At the point where he speculated that one day we will be able to send our consciousness out into space travelling on laser-beams and with the ability to assemble our own avatars on arrival, I was frankly chuckling. But in a horrified kind of way, because I think he actually means it. Fortunately, given that they’ve been working on robots for over half a century and so far have only achieved a not particularly effective vacuum cleaner, I feel I’m unlikely to live long enough to be forced to live forever as a computer programme. Phew!More worrying than these far-distant speculations is the near-future idea that scientists will soon be able to ‘enhance’ our intelligence. Kaku’s rather casual view of this is that it’ll be OK if those with power and wealth are the first to have their brains enhanced, since a) they probably won’t misuse the advantage this confers (uh-huh! Though the idea of intelligent politicians is a novel and rather appealing idea, I admit…); and b) eventually, as with all things, the technology will soon become available to everyone. He bases this on things like medicine and computers gradually becoming available to all – I wondered if he was unaware or just didn’t care that, in fact, at least a fifth of the world’s population is still living at extreme poverty level without access to adequate health care and education – even in the rich US people still die for want of drugs that are available to the well-off. It all gave the impression that science is recklessly headed on a path without full consideration of where it may lead.""If skills can be implanted into the brain, it would have an immediate impact on the world economic system, since we wouldn’t have to waste so much human capital. (To some degree, the value of a certain skill may be devalued if memories can be uploaded into anyone, but this is compensated for by the fact that the number and quality of skilled workers vastly increase.)""Overall, I found the first half of the book interesting in knowing where the science stands at present, and in reminding me of the need to ensure that scientists are kept firmly under control. The speculative second-half was enjoyable but failed to convince me that most of it was more than the fantasy of sci-fi scriptwriters. And I’m rather glad about that, since it seems that Kaku and his fellow scientists are much more willing to consider the benefits of creating monsters than I am. An entertaining read, but not a wholly convincing one.NB This book was provided for review by the publisher, Penguin Books.www.fictionfanblog.wordpress.com"

Everything you wanted to know about the brain but were afraid to ask.Surprisingly, this is immensely readable and entertaining. I was expecting a larger-than-life tome that cranked out gibberish; that is, gibberish for folks like me who, albeit fascinated with this world, find it hard to walk and talk at the same time.I was entranced by the author's readability and his tantalizing offerings on the potential of the human brain. The future is not ""someday"". It is now, and we are on the cusp of fascinating changes, all powered by the biggest, baddest computer ever known: our brain.Amazing read for anyone wondering ""where the future is at""!"
21,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8660033-aaron-thibeault,4,"*A full executive summary of this book is available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2014/03/11...The main argument: Up until 15 to 20 years ago the instruments and methods used to study the brain were still somewhat primitive. Since this time, however, advances in brain-imaging and brain-probing technology have gone into overdrive—as have the computers needed to make sense of the data coming out of these technologies. The deluge began in the early to mid 1990’s with the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine, and it’s more powerful cousin the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machine, and it hasn’t stopped there. In addition to the MRI and fMRI, we now have a host of advanced imaging and probing technologies from the positron emission topography (PET) scan, to magnetoencephalography (MEG), to near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), to optogenetics, to the Clarity technique, to the transcranial electromagnetic scanner (TES), to deep brain stimulation (DBS) and more. In addition to these new imaging and probing technologies we have also advanced greatly in understanding how genes are expressed in the brain.The result of these new advances is that we have learned more about the brain and how it works in the past 15 years than in all of history put together. And we are beginning to see real-world applications of this new understanding. For example, in the past decade scientists have learned to read the brain’s functioning to the point where they can now read (and recreate) thoughts and even dreams and imaginings directly from the brain; use the brain to directly control computers, and anything computers can control—including prosthetics (and even have these prosthetics send sensations back to the brain); implant and remove simple memories in the brain; create primitive versions of artificial brain structures; and also unravel at least some of the mysteries of mental illness and disease.And this is just the beginning. Scientists continue to refine the scanners and probes that have recently been invented. What’s more, governments are beginning to put up real money to fund major projects designed to help solve the remaining mysteries of the mind. For example, in 2013 both the United States and the European Union announced significant funding for two ambitious projects whose ultimate goal is to give a full map, model and even simulation of the human brain. Specifically, the American government contributed over $3 billion to the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative, while the European powers contributed over $1.5 billion to the Human Brain Project.What this means is that we can look forward to a time when some of the early advancements we’ve made in understanding and manipulating the brain will reach full maturity. A time when we will interact with computers directly with our thoughts (and paraplegics will power exoskeletons directly with theirs); a time when we can share our thoughts, memories, dreams, and imaginings directly with others; a time when we can upload knowledge and skills directly into our brains; a time when we will have a full understanding of mental illness and disease—and the power to cure them.And not only does the future of neuroscience promise these great feats, it also promises to help us develop the coping stone of all technologies: artificial intelligence. Indeed, while artificial intelligence has progressed in leaps and bounds in recent years, it still remains fairly limited. A big part of this has to do with the fact that we have modeled our artificial intelligence systems based on how we think the mind should work, rather than on how it actually works. With our new knowledge of how the mind does work, however, the prospect of creating AI machines with human-level intelligence becomes ever more real.The high point of the book is that Kaku gives a very nice overview of the latest developments in neuroscience, as well as where the field is headed next. The weak point of the book is that Kaku occasionally veers way of topic, and occasionally gets carried away on wild flights of speculative fancy (to give just one example, I wasn’t expecting, and didn’t appreciate, a full chapter of speculation about what alien intelligence—if it exists—might look like). Still, the book certainly contains a lot of very interesting and valuable information about the latest in brain science, and it definitely gets the imagination going.

22,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,3,"Every so often an author makes a stab at, ""what makes humans special from all other animals"". Michio Kaku does his best through defining humans through their ability to simulate the future both in space and time. He uses this definition for human consciousness and specialness and goes about explaining all phenomena arising from the brain. There's almost no topic he doesn't touch, hypnosis, outer-body-experience, abnormal psychology, BMI (brain machine interface), and so on.For each topic, he gives the history, the current state of the art and then some wild speculations about the topic. Each topic is covered widely but he doesn't have a chance to delve into in depth with the exception of the final chapter on Artificial Intelligence. He gives his all on that topic, and he even explains the Kurzweill's Singularity better than Kurzweil does.I learned more about the right/left mind dichotomy in this book than I have from books dedicated to that topic because that kept popping up in most of the different topics he was covering. That part of the story was more interesting to me than the author's special definition of what makes humans special.It's hard not to like an author who seems to know every episode of Star Trek or Twilight Zone and knows how to relate that to what he is writing about. If your anything like me, you probably love it when Michio Kaku appears on the Discovery Channel because he's going to give you a sound bite you will understand and can make your own.Unfortunately, for me, the book is more sound bite than depth, but for some that will be why they like the book more than I do. "
23,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7094406-rohan,4,"The thing I like about Michio Kaku is that unlike other scientists and quantum physicists, he doesn't wander off into his own wonderland while describing some of the most complex concepts. This book is no different. Although, initially going by the title of the book, I thought that a neurologist or a biologist would be better suited author for book on Human Mind, I am glad that didn't put me off and refrain me from starting this book. Human Consciousness, Freewill, mental illnesses, Aliens, Robots, AI and even Skynet (yes from the Terminator) is mentioned in this book. If you are a science lover, then this will ensure that you are always hooked on to it. This is the most fun I have had while reading a science book this year.There are bits and pieces of theoretical physics but book for most part deals with present and future of Neuroscience research and all the mind boggling possibilities that come with it. This one is an enjoyable read."

Michio put all this knowledge together here - the way he puts it is the simplest, easiest and most joyful way, he is brilliant in putting scientific matters this way, I mean the way he used to be. Unlike the others; you don’t have to be fully knowledgeable about sciences to read his books, actually he teaches you how to be a scientist. Thousands of books already discussed those two matters but none of them but it simple like Michio’s way. From the early start in this book joyful and eagerness started, informational provided by the author is very accurate and useful any one can use it later on to complete his campaign with science. Five stars is the normal rating for this book. Thank prof Michio Kaku."

Will robots be smarter than humans? Will robots one day take over the world? Interviewing top scientists in their fields, Michio Kaku explores these questions and many more in The Future of the Mind. Kaku’s ability to explain complex concepts, in easy to understand terms and examples, makes this an easy and enjoyable read.

27,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Kaku puts together an accessible informative discussion of consciousness, the operation of the brain, and the future of technology applied to both. He covers a host of trendy subjects from a physicist’s point of view in his usual conversant upbeat style. My notes on topics of interest follow.“If our brains were simple enough to be understood, we wouldn’t be smart enough to understand them.” Anonymous What is consciousness? Kaku proposes the corporate model. Consciousness is the CEO, the place where the buck stops, the place where issues that cannot be resolved at an unconscious level are sent to be finally resolved. In humans, consciousness is a model the brain creates to plan for the future using past experiences. It is an ongoing simulation of what we might expect. It is characterized by an interplay between the right (intuitive) hemisphere and the left (analytical) hemisphere. Input comes in from many different specialized areas of the brain which deal with things as diverse as emotional control and mathematical ability. Differences in the predominance of activity from one hemisphere or specialized area create differences in personality and capabilities. Extreme over or under-activity of any area can result in mental illness.After presenting his view of consciousness and brain fundamentals Kaku looks at the future. He explores directly linking our brains together through brain-nets. He looks at thought communication for those trapped in their bodies from accident or disease and goes on to examine thought control of prostheses, exoskeletons and robots. Kaku looks at our memories and how new ones can be installed and old ones deleted reshaping our perspectives. He even sees the possibility of a social network that shares memories on the web for downloading and re-experiencing. Why settle for a picture? He moves on to methods for increasing our intelligence however that may be defined. He spends a lot of time on artificial Intelligence, self-awareness and emotions in computers and robots. He foresees a future with robots as pets and assistants of diverse types including companions for emotional support particularly for children for the elderly. Kaku considers the dark side of robots and AI. There is the problem of rogue robots and killer robots controlled by evil doers. But he doesn’t believe that machines will dispose of humans and take over, even though he sees the possibility of AI computer minds linked together in sentient networks. More likely robots and humans will merge as humans fix and improve themselves with technology and the two finally come together as hybrids. Can immortality be achieved through electronic transfer of consciousness? Kaku spends a lot of time exploring this. Is an electronic representation of me stored in computer chips or waves on a laser beam still me? Personally I don’t think so. Even if you could create a perfect copy, it would still be a copy and I would still die. Perhaps this essence is the soul. Given Kaku’s description of free will (see below) if we were both “alive”, despite being exact duplicates, our thinking would still diverge. Going a bit far afield for a book on the mind but not for a physicist, Kaku digs into the Copernican Principle versus the Anthropomorphic Principle. On one side we may be just a meaningless speck in an endless universe or multiverse. On the other side intelligent life springs from a universe so perfectly constructed with forces so delicate balanced that there must be a grand designer. As a popular author trying to maintain readership, Kaku wisely doesn’t choose. Neither does he answer another fundamental question that he raises: Is technology in the hands of the human race the beginning of a new advanced society or the end of all society.Finally he diverges into the Schrödinger cat experiment and its interpretations: Copenhagen – the cat is both dead and alive until the wave is collapsed by an observer, Wigner’s – since there must always be an observer for wave functions to collapse and anything to exist then ultimately there must be God, and Everett’s – the Many Worlds theory in which all outcomes take place and the wave function separates upon each event, it doesn’t collapse. Kaku doesn’t mention what many physicists believe – simply that quantum mechanics is an incomplete theory. He puts this discussion in the appendix addressing what he calls quantum consciousness. It’s his attempt to address the issue of free will and he offers a great answer for a physicist concluding there is free will because of the quantum effects in our neurons, a position put forward by the physicist Roger Penrose. Kaku finally throws in chaos theory for good measure which somehow allows him to maintain his upbeat trajectory declaring that we are in control of our fate."

Kaku describes many a weird brain phenomenon, mental illness, visions of future human intelligence, artificial intelligence, and uses many popular Hollywood movie analogies, which all in all make for captivating reading. Kaku, being a physicist, also entwines quantum physics within this book about the human mind, especially within the appendix. This provides a whole different perspective about something you may only have perceived within the realms of biology, chemistry and psychology. Chapter 13 blew my tiny mind 🤯I have deducted half a star due to a couple of errors which I came across:- In chapter 2’s ‘Where am “I”?’ It was the left hand, not the right hand which drew the banana in the split-brain individual.- In chapter 8’s ‘How Drugs Alter the Mind’, Kaku incorrectly refers to the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline as drugs:‘There are at least three main drugs that stimulate the pleasure centre of the brain: dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline’"
29,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,3,"Uh-huh, I feel split-brained after reading this book. The beginning chapters, with the survey of the recent developments in neuroscience and the physicalist's definition and classification of consciousness, were promising. But then... Well, I can't say I didn't enjoy the entertaining speculations about the possibility of enhancing or altering our mental capabilities via telepathy, telekinesis, uploading memories, or brain boosts, and the possibility that perhaps sometime in the next century we may be able to transmit the consciousness of our brains to surogate bodies throughout our galaxy by placing our entire connectomes onto powerful laser beams. However, I was expecting a more thorough exposition of the concept of consciousness from the physicist's viewpoint. Also, I don't think the book does a good job in explaining and supporting the approach that 'the mind is what the brain does'."
30,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,2,"Judging from the number of his references to sci-fi books and movies, it's obvious that Kaku reads and watches too much sci-fi, and he appears a bit too eager to propose a scientific justification for everything. No fantasy is too outlandish. Telepathy? Yes. Telekinesis? Yes. Memory implantation? Yes. Mind control? Yes. Filming somebody's dream? Yes. Inserting yourself into somebody's dream and controlling it? Why not. Downloading yourself into a computer and saving your ""soul"" on a disk? sure. Et cetera. When discussing artificial intelligence, Kaku mentions that the researchers in the '50s and '60 vastly overestimated the future progress of AI. His own predictions about the above topics are off by a few orders of magnitude, assuming they're even possible. The book redeems itself towards the end when Kaku discusses possible alien intelligence. "

38,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13930279-eugene-pustoshkin,2,"Michio Kaku is a physicist, a charismatic popularizer of science and its future potentials and a leading figure in the string theory. In the previous years I have enjoyed his numerous videos, especially where he described what an 11th dimension means. So, being naturally curious, I purchased his book “The Future of the Mind: The Scientific Quest to Understand, Enhance and Empower the Mind” (2014). To be short, after reading I have mixed feelings about the book. Too often it happens that a person who is very intelligent in one field, say that of natural sciences (physics, quantum mechanics, etc.), demonstrates a very limited and narrow understanding of another field—in this case transdisciplinary consciousness studies. There are 15 chapters in the book, some are with provocative titles such as “Telepathy,” “Telekinesis,” “Altered States of Consciousness,” “The Artificial Mind and Silicon Consciousness” etc. Unfortunately, the titles are sometimes more provocative than of substance. Kaku claims to describe potential futures of the technologies which already have some sort of working prototype. For instance, an exoskeleton, virtual reality, or “telepathic” communication through brain interfaces, or nanotechnologies or genetic modification to treat mental mental disorders.Alas, Kaku’s understanding of mind and consciousness, of various philosophies of consciousness, those schools of thought and experimentation that have developed through centuries (including 21st century) is shallow, if non-existent. He demonstrates no knowledge of psychology, philosophy or contemplative studies of mind. He is locked within a technical mindset, the one that is capable only of a 3rd-person perspective, while not understanding 1st-person and 2nd-person perspectives. One example of it is his misunderstanding of the problem of qualia and the hard problem of consciousness. Basically, he completely misses the point of the psycho-physical problem, the problem of mind and matter relationship, what David Chalmers called the Hard Problem of consciousness. Kaku mistakenly interprets the issue of qualia as a sort of “understanding” of “feelings and subjective sensations,” rather than the very fact of interiority, of presence of subjectivity, of awareness. So, Kaku mistakenly writes: “In the future, a machine most likely will be able to process a sensation, such as the color red, much better than any human. It will be able to describe the physical properties of red and even use it poetically in a sentence better than a human. Does the robot ‘feel’ the color red? The point becomes irrelevant, since the word ‘feel’ is not well defined. At some point, a robot’s description of the color red may exceed a human’s, and the robot may rightly ask: Do humans really understand the color red? Perhaps humans cannot really understand the color red with all the nuances and subtly that a robot can.”Basically, Kaku misinterprets qualia as some sort of “understanding” (whatever that means) rather than interiority, awareness, presence of living consciousness. In his understanding of consciousness as a model of current and future events he demonstrates a purely 3rd-person objective perspective, the perspective that ignores the most obvious fact of existence—our very own alive awareness. This sort of awareness that is unlikely to occur in a robot or AI, no matter how realistic it can be in its exterior appearance. There is no substance of awareness, no first-person perspective, no aliveness of interior presence.In a New York Times book review (March 7, 2014) Adam Frank eloquently writes:“Like the futurist Ray Kurzweil, Kaku believes the most important advances in silicon computing will still serve our needs and not the coming robot overlords (if we do create them). By mapping out the ‘connectome’ — the explicit account of every neural connection in your head — Kaku tells us it should be possible to reverse-engineer each and every person’s brain. Reconstruct this connectome in a computer and you will have downloaded yourself into that machine. In this way the future of the mind, your mind in particular, might last as long as there are computers to run your connectome.But are you nothing more than the sum of your brain’s connections? Here’s where Kaku stumbles. It’s been almost 20 years since the philosopher David Chalmers introduced the distinction between ‘easy’ and ‘hard’ problems in the study of consciousness. Easy problems, according to Chalmers, were things like figuring out how the brain cycles through signals from the arm allowing you to pick up an object. Researchers developing the next generation of prosthetics will tell you this ‘easy’ problem remains pretty hard, but as Chalmers rightly pointed out, control of the arm is nothing compared with developing a scientific account of the vividness of our own experience. It’s the internal luminosity — the ‘being’ of our being — that constitutes Chalmers’s hard problem and that eludes Kaku’s engineering-based perspective.The problem is that we still don’t have much in the way of a working model of consciousness. With a physicist’s eye for economy, Kaku tries to provide one through what he calls a “space-time theory.” It’s a model of consciousness with a graded scale of awareness based on the number of feedback loops between environment and organism. Thus, in Kaku’s view, a thermostat has the lowest possible level of consciousness while humans, with our ability to move through space and project ourselves mentally backward and forward in time, represent the highest level currently known.. . . Kaku acknowledges the existence of the hard problem but waves it away. ‘There is no such thing as the Hard Problem,’ he writes.Thus the essential mystery of our lives — the strange sense of presence to which we’re bound till death and that lies at the heart of so much poetry, art and music — is dismissed as a non-problem when it’s exactly the problem we can’t ignore. If we’re to have anything like a final theory of consciousness, we had better be attentive to the complexity of how we experience our being.”Well said. Indeed, dismissing the most essential mystery of our aliveness is a sign of ignorance as regards to consciousness and mind, the very topic of the book. Furthermore, Kaku provides a multilevel model of mind/consciousness based on McLean’s triune brain model. In itself, it is a great model, but if Kaku wants to speak about levels of consciousness and its evolution, he has to also present data from the field of developmental psychology (which he doesn’t). Particularly, it is important to take into account the constructivist schools of developmental theories as explored in the field of adult (vertical) development. When Kaku argues that consciousness is that “process of creating a model of the world using multiple feedback loops in various parameters,” which he calls the “space-time theory of consciousness” to emphasize that while animals create a model of the world mainly in relation to space and to one another, humans are capable to create a model of the world in relation to time (both forward and backward)—when he does so, he misses the point disclosed in a process of studying human development that perception and understanding of time (especially, self-understanding in relation to time) seem to be at least partially a developmental achievement that is not innately existent in human beings.Furthermore, human consciousness itself can grow to an increasingly complex capacity of perspective-taking, as Susanne Cook-Greuter’s research in the theory of ego development in adults shows. This capacity can expand from merely a 1st-person perspective on one’s world experience and one’s own place in the world to a 2nd-person perspective (that includes the perspective of a tribe or referent group) to a 3rd-person perspective (a scientific and objective worldview) to a 4th-person perspective (that sees a plurality of different worldviews or paradigms, developing in time and cultural contexts, as equally important) to more advanced later 4th-person and 5th-person perspectives (which offer self-understanding in terms of vast historical and evolutionary processes—from the Big Bang to the nuances of the present-day historical unfoldings and the way they influence all our understandings, epistemologies, methodologies, and ontologies).There are numerous studies of human consciousness development in infants, children and adults (our consciousness can continue to grow when we are adults, and maturity per se is itself a phenomenon that evolves: to be mature today, in a postmodern world, is different from being mature in a premodern society). In terms of adult development, these studies were done at Harvard and other universities in the United States and Europe. Such scholars as Robert Kegan, Jane Loevinger, Michael Commons, Susanne Cook-Greuter, Don Beck & Chris Cowan should be consulted when one tries to understand the ways human consciousness evolves. Without that knowledge one’s understanding of consciousness is very limited and shallow—this can be said about what Kaku demonstrated in his book.Michio Kaku’s view of consciousness or mind is what Ken Wilber, one of the leading contemporary world thinkers, would call a flatland view. This flatland view is versed in understanding physical and matter-related realities, but is very shallow and inefficient in grasping the complex interior realities of consciousness and culture, of subjectivity and intersubjectivity, of prehension and mutual prehension. Anyone who writes about mind and consciousness may benefit from reading Wilber’s paper “An Integral Theory of Consciousness” (Journal of Consciousness Studies, 1997, 4 (1): 71–92). Wilber proposes that any sufficient understanding of consciousness requires taking into account a transdisciplinary view and 3rd-, 2nd- and 1st-person methodologies. These methodologies disclose phenomena in what Wilber calls four quadrants, or four basic perspectives on consciousness. In short, consciousness is a space of interiority which is embodied in organism and embedded in sociocultural contexts. It is not static, it is dynamic, and it has evolved through millions of years of evolution, and in every individual it continues to evolve and develop, providing vastly different vantage points and worldviews, each of which determines how one conceives reality (a child understand reality differently from an adult, and a sage who reached her highest maturity understands reality differently from a common adult).On a bright side, Kaku’s book is easy to read. In the conclusion and especially in the Appendix titled “Quantum Consciousness?,” where Kaku returns to his home turf, his narrative and questions he raises appeared as quite inspiring to me. So, based on this book, Kaku is a bad source of insight into the nature of mind/consciousness, but he is still an insightful meaning maker in terms of making sense of quantum physics and string theory and their relation to (the physical, exterior aspect of) the universe."
39,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19770032-lou,5,I enjoyed this so much! His writing is so approachable that I’m eager to read more of his books.
40,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7004595-artiom-karsiuk,5,"Michio Kaku is a badass. The age that we live in today is beautiful - there are countless sources of information at your fingertips at all times. But that information is very crude and raw: you have to filter and refine it; find the ""good stuff"" and flush the turds. That means that you can walk into your local book store and on any given day there can be a Ken Ham creationist book on a same shelf as a Neil DeGrasse Tyson book, or you can turn on your TV and find a pile of deepak chopra being given a media platform to debate someone like Richard Dawkins. Unfortunately, there are many pseudoscientists and pop celebrities who decided that now they are people of science and are on a quest of ""educating"" the public. They become news-media darlings and will have a live mic as long as Bullshit Mountain (© Jon Stewart) is fine and dandy.I thank the heavens and the stars for people like Tyson, Dawkins, Nye and Kaku - over the years, they amassed enought acceptance to become the go-to media personalities [almost scientific celebrities] and are using their voice to spread the gospel of true science. And, more importantly, are doing it in layman's terms, so that even the MEs of the World could understand what they're talking about. I may be wrong, but I think it was that crazy german-american with the grey afro that once said ""If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough"". They can and they are, which is a testament to their awesomeness.What Michio Kaku used as his tool of choice to bridge casual ignorance and reach immature people like me with his book, is CINEMA. That's goddamn brilliant. I mean, this book is such a wonderful marriage of science and cinema that at certain moments I was forced to put it down, because somewhere along the way he mentioned a movie with an interesting plot - I just had to watch it. The Matrix, Elysium, Surrogates, Avatar, Total Recall, 2001 and the list goes on: the man certainly ate his share of popcorn and Junior Mints, before he sat down to draft these pages. So if you are one of those curios fellas that wonder ""is this plausible"" while watching Neo master martial arts and become a child of Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris [on steroid-laced crack] at a push of a button, you will enjoy this book. Though... you may want to catch up on your ""To Watch"" list before you start flipping these pages - because spoilers are not only included, but broken down, as well.And as if I haven't nuthugged this book enough already, I want to applaud Michio Kaku for not going 100% Ray Kurzweil on us. By that I mean that this book is not all sunshine and rainbows with a happy-go-lucky high for the future on every single page. No, the author presented a very balanced and sober pros and cons argument for every topic. Sure, the book was written on an optimistic vibe and didn't go too deep down the ""dark rabbit hole"", but I believe that this positive approach was the right thing for this book. He didn't go the all too common ""doom and gloom"" route that the news-media take so often to plant seeds of fear into the masses. Of course, you shouldn't be ignorant and destructive in respect to your future, but at the same time we have enough problems and horrors to worry about TODAY, so I apologize if I'll save my fears of the future for the day after tomorrow.But don't get the wrong impression - this is not just a fun read. If you or the people close to you, suffer from serious physical or psychological trauma, this book may be an excellent source of hope and inspiration. You will be updated on the latest scientific breakthroughs in treating many different illnesses, afflictions and disorders. Some of the developments in modern science that were presented in this book were almost shocking - for example, when Kaku discussed today's advances in prosthetics and robotics, I was sitting there like an idiot shacking my head. If I didn't know better, I'd call bullshit and dismiss this as sci-fi: yet, this is 2014 and this really is our current reality.The one thing this badass book lacked? A badass quote, that I will borrow from Kevin Kelly:
Humans are the reproductive organs of technology.

41,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/379816-john-box,4,"The Future of the Mind is like a rare textbook that is so interesting, informative, and thought-provoking that you’d read it even if you weren’t taking the class.*Beginning with a brief introduction to the human brain – ""the most complex object in the solar system” – it moves on to cover an array of intriguing cognitive-related territory from the state of neuroscience today to the possibilities of tomorrow.Further, Kaku offers in easy to understand language the potential science behind the science fiction of a variety of fascinating prospects like downloading memories, enhancing intelligence, and communicating telepathically.And while the nuts and bolts are a big part of what makes this book worth reading, the following are some of the most compelling questions raised and the simple answers as interpreted by The Kid. (Sometimes I refer to myself as The Kid.)Will we be able to increase our memory? Yes, but it’ll suck because you’ll never forget all the failures and embarrassments and heartaches and hurt and whiskey dicks you’ve suffered and actually devolve into a useless puddle of tears unable to get off your parent’s couch.Will we be able to increase our intelligence? Yes, but do you really wanna spend your time solving complex tensor equations or mastering the mathematics of hyperspatial dimensions?..?..? Didn’t think so, Stupid.Will we be able to download skills into our brain like in The Matrix? Yes, someday you will be able to download the acting ability of Keanu Reeves. Pop quiz, hotshot. Are you gonna win the next leading man Oscar or am I? Or Am I?How about memories? Of course. You’ll be able to download the absolute best memories from anyone you want. It’s just a matter of time before we all have memories of walking hand in hand with Jessica Alba down an idyllic Cancun beach while onlookers gawk at her perfection and gape at us - her schlubby husband.Will they eventually cure Alzheimer’s and mental illness? Sure.Will robots eventually take over and enslave humanity? Possibly. But in that case, just think of them as your kids. It’s the natural order of things for them to take over and harvest our organs for energy so big deal, really.Will we be able to upload our consciousness into a computer? Yes, but in effect we’ll just be copying our personality to a computer, thereby creating an evil twin. Evil mainly because he gets to live forever while the real me dies a mortal death. Also because he never lets me win at Street Fighter 2. Cheating Asshole!Is there intelligent life out there? Of course there is you moron. There are about a billion earthlike stars in the Milky Way and about 100 billion galaxies in the visible universe. Plus, the universe is 13.8 billion years old. As Kaku points out, “it would be more miraculous if another advanced civilization did not exist.”In conclusion, I’m giving The Future of the Mind 5 stars because reading it made me feel smarter than, and superior to, your average Joe because in addition to all of the above, I now know what the Copernican and Anthropic Principles are and can wax poetic about them. But having said that, I now wanna kill myself for using the phrase ‘wax poetic’. So just 4 stars, Michio.*Side note: I’ve only read one book for a class I didn’t take. A Room of One’s Own by Virginia Woolfe. Sadly, it did not get me laid.Bonus quote with a convenient congruence to American MaleWhore in Tokyo: “White lies, in fact, are like a grease that makes society run smoothly.” – Michio Kaku"
42,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5740728-delia,5,"What would it be like to achieve a Vulcan Mind Meld a la Mr. Spock? If there is anyone on the planet who could do that, my wish would be that Dr. Michio Kaku be that person. How I would love to know what he knows! Talk about a transcendant experience! Unfortunately, science isn't quite there. Yet. But that hasn't stopped Dr.Kaku from taking us ""one step beyond"" in his exploration of what the present state of physics suggests might be possible in the not too distant future. If you have a literal mind, this is not a book for you. Dr. Kaku's speciality is theoretical physics not material science so he does what theorists are supposed to do: extrapolate from what we know and have the equipment to measure or observe right now to the furthest edge of possibility. It can be argued that we are only in the very early stages of ""brain science"" but the rate of discovery in the field is progressing exponentially. Almost daily researchers publish new - and often unexpected - findings on how the physical brain functions. We are beginning to be able to see the path of a thought as it travels the neuro-circuits of the physical brain. But thought itself cannot be seen, weighed, or measured in any way. It is invisible and leaves only the faintest temporary imprint for us to observe. Dr. Kaku wrestles with the problem of consciousness in his quest to understand the MIND. Our minds use our brains to record and communicate thought. But is Mind identical with Brain? This is the question that must ultimately be asked and answered. What IS consciousness and where does it come from? Is it dependent on the brain or does it exist in the quantum universe and express itself through conscious creatures in the form of thought? And, if so, does that mean that pure consciousness really does exist and that it has intention and will? Dr. Kaku is one of our planet's most enquiring minds and he'd like to know. So would I. I think I'll stick around and wait to see what he does next."
43,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30569007-jos-lu-s-fernandes,4," I was hoping for a more ""fantastic future"" kind of book, but fortunately that wasn't the case. This is a nice introduction (mainly to the non-scientist or those who don't know much about neurosciences) to the brain, its abilities and consciousness (he even debates a possible alien one and AI). Michio Kaku has great communication skills and a lot of knowledge on his area (I even learned what negative energy really is), but sometimes it becomes obvious in some details he isn't a biologist for those who have already a bit more of knowledge on the area like in chapter 7, when he tries to explain how can less than 23000 genes code a complex brain (and consequently how the human genome codes the entire human body). I love the way how he writes about ethical questions, notwithstanding his lack of originality (although he makes his own comments very clear) and I slightly disagree with him regarding animal intelligence. Finally, I don't recommend his views on the fall of the Roman Empire (he used it to show how we could resist against aliens, but the most likely scenario as he admits is the simple destruction of Mankind by them if they are evil) because they are partially outdated or simply wrong. "
44,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,2,"The future of the mind takes a sweeping and simple view of the latest developments in mind-related matters. One gets a summary of what is going on and could come in a host of loosely related fields, each somewhat connected to the latest brain studies. However, the author is neither an expert, nor a dabbler with great descriptive skills or one with well-honed journalistic/reporting talents. His intention is praiseworthy: educating the layman with little knowledge on this important but difficult subject. The output is patchy. The author’s inadequacies are most obvious whenever he resorts to a popular Hollywood movie to make a point, something that happens dozens of times in the book. With or without movie references, the cursory nature of the discussions often miss salient points that are important even for those new to the subject. The book, with its heavy reliance on the state of the studies in recent years, is also at the risk of being dated quickly, like any newspaper article on a current affair. In fact, some discussions already appear outmoded because of developments like AlphaZero or Crispr.  "
45,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2130032-daniel-r,3,"The invention of the MRI ushered in a new era of brain research that is still ongoing. This book covers the latest research and cutting edge techniques across a wide variety of topics include brain machine interfaces, mental illness, memory, medication, and artificial intelligence. Woven throughout the book is the somewhat unconvincing author's theory of consciousness: an entity that can create a model of the world and simulate its future in it. Unfortunately like many sections of the book, the nitty gritty details and in depth exploration are hand waved around. Of course once we have self replicating robots we can exponentially explore the universe by encoding a human and sending it on a laser beam to reassemble our mind and control a surrogate body on some distant receiving station, since none of that violates the laws of physics. When talking about current research and discoveries the book is very approachable and well written but when looking to the future it suffers from overoptimism ignoring many details."

The illusion of oneself. After all, if corpus callosum is severed, we would react with almost two different, opposing personalities. Enjoyable read. Kudos to the author for taking such a complex ideas and doing justice to these ideas. "
48,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/282252-skye-lucking,3,"I'm giving this 3 stars because I really, really enjoyed 2/3 of the book. The details Kaku gives around neuron pattern mapping and the way it can be used was fascinating! It makes me so excited to live in this time period and jealous of those who will see some of these nascent breakthroughs develop into practical applications. The last 1/3 (including the chapters on AI and the Alien Mind) seemed to be tacked on tangentially to add bulk to the book. It went into great detail about the difficulties involved in getting a computer program to understand human emotion - because humans aren't so great at it either sometimes. This fell into the 'obvious' category for me and I felt it was just filler."

Even if I'm super interested in the topic and the book is well written, I reach a point where I put the book down and just can't make myself pick it back up again. The Future of the Mind was exactly the opposite. I couldn't put this one down and ended up reading it in every spare second. I actually chose to read it over a fiction book I was really enjoying. That has never happened to me before! If you are at all interested in this topic (and the book covers a pretty wide range of brain related research and technologies) I can not recommend this book strongly enough. I will definitely be reading more of Michio Kaku's work."

Genius hits a target no one else can see.” I’ve long enjoyed listening to Michio Kaku speak. In a world where science has sometimes been tainted by celebrity, ego, and political agendas, he’s a refreshingly humble and genuinely curious voice… who also happens to be indisputably brilliant. (This is the first of his books I’ve been able to get a hold of, so please bear that in mind as I give my brief impression—and please understand that I hold Dr. Kaku in the highest respect.)‘Isn’t Michio Kaku a renowned Theoretical Physicist?’ you may ask. Why yes. Yes, he is. One might think he’s making a bit of an overreach here in writing outside of his area of expertise. But the fact that this isn’t his own material he’s compiling and presenting, combined with a few points in which the subject matter DOES hold a valid degree of crossover into the realm of physics, makes for a pleasantly palatable and approachably objective experience—at least in this reader’s opinion. (It’s nice to not have to wonder if the author’s views may be affected in some way by the nebulous blinding of hubris… or the gravitational pull of government grant money. >.> Just saying.)The book is divided into 3 somewhat more manageable parts. Book I: The Mind and the Consciousness, Book II: Mind Over Matter, and Book III: Altered Consciousness.Questions explored include:-What is consciousness?-Is there a difference between the Brain and the  Mind?-Might we one day achieve immortality through technology?-Is alien intelligence a true possibility?-How close are we to creating self-aware A.I.?-Could we eventually ‘download’ skills into our brain?-Do humans actually have ‘free will’?I particularly enjoyed the section on A.I. speculation. From this book, I gathered we aren't nearly as far along as I'd always assumed we were in mimicking sentience. It hadn’t occurred to me that one of the more fundamental problems with elevating artificial intelligence is an inability to teach “common sense.” Evaluating and ranking the value of an object or person can be programmed, but only to a certain extent. And manual input will be required when the A.I. is faced with situations in which various ‘values’ may conflict with each other. (I was reminded of a backstory scene from the movie I Robot,’ in which a robot makes a life-or-death decision based on cold statistical probability and inadvertently leaves the main character scarred—both physically and psychologically.)Overall the information offered in this book is interesting, but pretty basic. Like an amalgamation of things I've already seen on the Discovery Channel or picked up on Reddit. I appreciated that it was so accessible in its presentation, but often longed for a deeper delving into many of the topics. There were also a few points at which the prose took on a bit of a droning cadence—which I found more of a slog than I generally prefer. For what it is, I’m afraid it may have been a bit padded.I also wanted to note that the word 'probably' keeps coming up... a lot. Almost to the point where one could make a drinking game out of it. (Not that I’m making such a suggestion.) >.> I suppose I was just hoping for a little more certainty. Although I do appreciate that trending theories and speculation, regardless of how probable, were not presented as irrefutable fact. Those who appreciate speculative fiction will likely have more patience for this book than those purely looking for irrefutable truth. As a sci-fi enthusiast, I found a majority of the book stimulating.Favorite Quotes:*“It is remarkable that a gigantic, city-size computer is required to simulate a piece of human tissue that weighs three pounds, fits inside your skull, raises your body temperature by only a few degrees, uses twenty watts of power, and needs only a few hamburgers to keep it going.” *“There is a saying among women scientists who attend highly specialized engineering universities, where the girl-to-guy ratio is decidedly in their favor: “The odds are good, but the goods are odd.”*“Dr. Richard Davidson, a neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, concludes, “Your grades in school, your scores on the SAT, mean less for life success than your capacity to co-operate, your ability to regulate your emotions, your capacity to delay your gratification, and your capacity to focus your attention. Those skills are far more important—all the data indicate—for life success than your IQ or your grades.” "
55,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/112553900-raz-pirata,4,"“The brain weighs only three pounds, yet it is the most complex object in the solar system.”Michio Kaku ‘claims’ to be a theoretical physicist. A quick peak at his Wikipedia page also lists him as a futurist and a popularizer of science, professor and author of many books. After reading his latest literary endeavour, The Future of the Mind - The Scientific Quest to Understand, Enhance and Empower the Mind I believe this is all part of an elaborate ruse to hide his true identity as a time travelling super being.How else could one write a book that covers such a complex subject with such ease? How could one investigate the mind from so many different perspectives and make it understandable? This is the work of an advanced mind… from time beyond.“Intelligence seems to be correlated with the complexity with which we can simulate future events.”In The Future of the Mind, Kaku, enlightens his readers on what this ‘golden age of neuroscience’ has discovered while preparing us for the various future shapes our mind may take. By employing a Physicist's perspective on consciousness he lays the foundations for where we are now in our understanding of the brain. Then explores the possibilities of telepathy and telekinesis, sharing the impact of diagnostic technologies that have led to continued discovery of the mind's mechanics and postulates on our altered states of consciousness. Kaku also investigates the future of the mind, alien consciousness, and takes a stab at mind engineering. This is some ‘heady’ work.“Consciousness is the process of creating a model of the world using multiple feedback loops in various parameters in order to accomplish a goal .”Yet, he makes it all seem so simple. He takes a complex subject and makes it seem familiar and friendly. I believe it was Richard Feynman who claimed that true understanding of a subject is demonstrated in the ability to explain it simply, so anyone can understand. Or it is the work of a supreme time travelling physicist named Michio Kaku.The Future of the Mind is a wonderfully easy book to read on a fascinating and complex subject. It entertains, provokes and perhaps even frightens you a little, but by the end you will know a lot more about the mind and what it could look like in the future. A future from which he came back from, sharing with us all these wonderful insights. Live long and prosper.Overall Score: 4.0 / 5In a Sentence: What we know about the mind now, where the mind is headed, and everything else you wondered about the brain in 400 or so pages."

Utilizing CAT and MRI scanners they can now look inside our heads and begin to see what areas of the brain are connected to individual thoughts, feelings, and actions.Michio Kaku is a Professor of Theoretical Physics and cofounder of string field theory. For a scientist who imagines one-dimensional objects, eleven different dimensions, and multiple universes, explaining the mind was probably a piece of cake.Kaku is a scientist who has the rare ability of being able to explain the complexity and beauty of the brain in terms that the average person can understand. Kaku not only explains what we know of how the brain works but he also delves into the past and future. The topics in this book include: how the brain is a showcase for evolution, what is consciousness, are things like telepathy and telekinesis possible, what is the purpose of dreams, what are altered states of consciousness, how are Artificial Intelligence and human intelligence similar and different, will we be able to download ourselves into machines, and how will aliens think.While Kaku has written for the non-scientist, this four hundred page book contains a tremendous of information. It is definitely not a “page turner”. Rather, it is the type of book that you may want to read a chapter (or less) and then take a break to think about what you have just learned, how it pertains to your view of yourself and others, and what new questions it raises. The Future of the Mind was written in 2014 so it does not contain some of the latest discoveries. However, Kaku’s writing manages to imagine future discoveries and issues while he is summarizing past and present knowledge. Trust me, there is more than enough information in this book to keep you thinking for years to come."
57,038553082X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5861984-judyta-szaci-o,5,"Yet again, Michio Kaku has delivered well. I'm still under the charm of his witty style, endlessly providing food for thought. He is not only a populariser - he is a visioner, and crazy enough at that to make me wonder whether I should perhaps tag his book as 'fantasy/sci-fi' instead of 'natural sciences'. Tagging has its limitations; I can't create a category for Kaku alone, even though he certainly deserves it.One thing that did not sit well with me while reading this book was Kaku's tendency to look at humans in distinctly different terms than at the rest of the animals. Other animals do things simply 'by instinct'; humans are directed by 'unconscious calculations made by their brains' (I fail to grasp the difference). On a few occasions, Kaku's way of phrasing indicates that he doesn't see other animals as capable of feeling pain or distress. I believe it's just a careless phrasing, because he contradicts it elsewhere in the book, but that lack of care should not have taken place there. We are not as far removed from the other mammals as Kaku indicates. I think it is important to understand that if we want to take Kaku's advice and start merging with machines and artificially boosting our intelligence.One paragraph made me laugh out loud as I realised that even such a brilliant mind as Kaku's lives in its own bubble. He complains a bit throughout the book that mathematical brilliance does not boost one's income, and his only hope for an artificially improved mind to make some extra money is to assume that it would also include artistic genius 'which could conceivably be used to make a comfortable living'. As a wife of a very talented painter whose works far exceed in quality all the amorphous blobs currently in fashion, I can definitely confirm that artistic genius does not generate income any better than mathematical brilliance! :-)"

Best-selling author, popular science personality on TV, and theoretical physicist Dr. Michio Kaku provides the public with a popular-science treat. What sets Kaku apart is the combination of his prodigious knowledge and innate ability to convey such complex topics in an engaging conversational tone. This captivating 400-page book includes fifteen chapters and is broken out into the following three parts (books): I. The Mind and Consciousness, II. Mind Over Matter, and III. Altered Consciousness. Positives:1.	A treat to read. Popular science at its best. 2.	The fascinating topic of neuroscience in the masterful hands of Dr. Michio Kaku.3.	Kaku is a theoretical physicist but is so well connected in the science community that is able to share great insights from some of the best minds. It’s the future of the mind from the physicist’s perspective. 4.	Great use of popular culture that connects with the audience. Kaku’s mastery of the topic and the ease with which he conveys such complex topics justifies his popularity.5.	The book is logically broken out into three main parts. The first part surveys the history of the brain. The second explores the new technology developed to study the brain; and the third part investigates alternate forms of consciousness.6.	Presents landmark studies in neuroscience that shows how damaging specific parts of the brain causes behavioral problems. Throughout the book, Kaku presents an idea or a concept and follows it up with great examples and references to leading scientists in the field.7.	Love how the book explains the structure of the brain; from the reptilian, mammalian to the cerebral cortex.8.	Explanation of consciousness and the levels of consciousness. “Human consciousness is a specific form of consciousness that creates a model of the world and then simulates it in time, by evaluating the past to simulate the future. This requires mediating and evaluating many feedback loops in order to make a decision to achieve a goal.”9.	The accomplishments of DARPA. So much for government failure. “DARPA has been a key player in a series of inventions that have altered the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, including cell phones, night-vision goggles, telecommunications advances, and weather satellites.” And of course, the precursor to the Internet, Arpanet.10.	How memories are stored. “So far, scientists have identified more than twenty categories of memories that are stored in different parts of the brain, including fruits and vegetables, plants, animals, body parts, colors, numbers, letters, nouns, verbs, proper names, faces, facial expressions, and various emotions and sounds.”11.	Thought provoking questions throughout the book. “Is genius a function of our genes, or is it more a question of personal struggle and achievement?” Einstein as a case study.12.	An interesting look at the nature of dreams. 13.	Debunks popular myths popularized by movies. “On the contrary, people under the influence of sodium pentathol, like those who have imbibed a few too many, are fully capable of lying.”14.	Fascinating look at altered states of consciousness. “Dr. V. S. Ramachandran estimates that 30 to 40 percent of all the temporal lobe epileptics whom he has seen suffer from hyperreligiosity.” 15.	Mental illness. “Scientists from the Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital analyzed sixty thousand people worldwide and found that there was a genetic link between five major mental illnesses: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, major depression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Together they represent a significant fraction of all mentally ill patients.”16.	The intriguing topic of robots and consciousness. Stimulating discussion.17.	The quest to build a brain; the three approaches to the brain. 18.	Is there a more interesting topic than out-of-body and near-death experiences? “Dr. Olaf Blanke and his colleagues in Switzerland may have located the precise place in the brain that generates out-of-body experiences.”19.	So what is aging? “Basically, aging is the buildup of errors, at the genetic and cellular level.” Thank you.20.	Concludes with an interesting section on philosophy and neuroscience. “We are just wetware, running software called the mind, nothing more or less. Our thoughts, desires, hopes, and aspirations can be reduced to electrical impulses circulating in some region of the prefrontal cortex. That is the Copernican Principle applied to the mind.”21.	Excellent supplemental material: suggested reading material, notes and an appendix on the question of quantum consciousness. Negatives:1.	Oversells science. I love Dr. Kaku and his enthusiasm for science, one which I share, but sometimes I wonder if such passion leads him to overvalue what science can reasonably accomplish. Too optimistic. “One day, perhaps sometime in the next century, we will be able to transmit the consciousness of our brains throughout the solar system by placing our entire connectomes onto powerful laser beams.” 2.	Since the book’s focus is on the future; it spends a lot of time in areas of speculation or what many may consider science fiction.3.	A summary of what future technologies of the mind are most likely to occur. 4.	More visual material would have added value. Timelines, graphs, diagrams…5.	What is a soul? What characteristics does a soul possess that would enable you to empirically define it let alone define how it works?In summary, this book exemplifies why I love science so much. Dr. Kaku inspires us to dream while keeping our feet on the ground. This is what a popular-science book should be all about. Dr. Kaku shares what we currently know and speculates what is in store for the future of the mind. Perhaps too optimistic but this book is about inspiring young minds to pursue one of the greatest quests in all of science. I highly recommend it!Further recommendations: “Physics of the Future” by the same author, “How to Create a Mind” and “The Singularity is Near” by Ray Kurzwell, “Who’s in Charge?” by Michael S.

I completed this book entirely reading (except some part) on Public bus and with less comfort though.While reading or after completing the book, this book will make you rethink upon the so called God and your place in this universe and other many things which are of period debate..After reading this book I'd like to divide the book into different parts:Divisions of the bookI'd basically divide the book into three parts:1The part where author takes the processes of the brains and the mechanisms (This seemed too techincal for me. Many of the ideas bounced over my head. Nonetheless, I got the essence of the text. This part is basically covered in the first half or so of the book.2. The Philosophical (yet Scientific) and the futuristic partThe author being from the physics background and being one of the pioneers of the String theory has tried to incorporate the scientific validity of the futuristic possibilities. This is basically covered in the last half part of the book (this is where I found the book most interesting). It'd make you to question upon the common sense, ""common sense is not common after all"".Suggested reading for:1) Computer enthusiasts who planned and are aspired to work in the arena of AI (this would not disappoint you).2) Must for people who are in the field of biology (best suited for readers in brain related field)3)For those wanderers and truth seekers who plan to expand their horizon using this knowledge and know the mysteries of the brain.No doubt that Michio Kaku is a Genius who have the profound knowledge in the various fields. Yet another marvelous book from Kaku!"
