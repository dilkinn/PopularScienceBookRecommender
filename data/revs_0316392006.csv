For example, as a kid in the United States, I grew up learning about the group of rebels who stood up to their British overlords and founded our country. It’s human nature to be curious about where we come from, and origin stories unite people through a common history and shared sense of purpose.But what if all of humanity shared an origin story? What would that story look like? Historian David Christian tries to answer those questions in his new book Origin Story.As the creator of Big History—my favorite course of all time—David is well-suited to write about how we came to be. Big History tells the story of the universe from the big bang to the first signs of life to today’s complex societies. It shows how everything is connected to everything else, weaving together insights and evidence from across disciplines into a single, understandable narrative.Origin Story is essentially the Big History course condensed into a short book. It divides 13.8 billion years of existence into what David calls “thresholds”—moments in history that mark key transition points, like the formation of our solar system and the first appearance of early humans. The chapters about the early thresholds are heavy on physics and chemistry, but it skews more towards biology and anthropology as single cell life evolves into more complex beings.If you haven’t taken Big History, Origin Story introduces you to its concepts in a straightforward, understandable way. David is a very good writer, and he has a way of making complicated subjects fun. If you’re already a Big Historian, Origin Story is a great refresher. It does a fantastic job distilling the latest thinking about the origins of the universe. I learned some things that are simply too new to be included in the course.The book ends with a chapter on where humanity—and the universe—is headed. David is more pessimistic about the future than I am. He gets a little stuck on the current economic and political malaise happening in the West, and I wish he talked more about the role innovation will play in preventing the worst effects of climate change. But he nails the importance of this moment in history: “Things are happening so fast that, like the slow-motion time of a near accident, the details of what we do in the next few decades will have huge consequences for us and for the biosphere on scales of thousands of years. Like it or not, we are now managing an entire biosphere, and we can do it well or badly.”Understanding where humanity comes from is crucial to shaping where we go next. Origin Story is an up-to-date history of everything that will leave you with a greater appreciation of our place in the universe."
1,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3675162-j-l-sutton,3,"David Christian's Origin Story: A Big History of Everything was my first go at 'big history' (13.8 billion years of it). Christian looked at threshold events the way futurists look at trends and singularities. These thresholds were like transitional mile markers differentiating one order (perhaps by a near extinction event) from the next. Christian looked at the numerous 'Goldilocks' conditions which allowed life to exist as it does today. Christian also brought origins myths into this history, especially at the beginning of his book. However, while big history is, probably by necessity, non-personal, I would have found it more compelling to have explored more mythology in Christian's final chapter of future history. Interesting read!"
2,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,3,"Big History is becoming a familiar concept. Since it was launched in the 1990s by the Dutchman Fred Spier and in Australia by David Christian himself, it has taken on a life of its own. Christian first summed up his way of looking at history ""on a large scale"" in 2004 in his Maps of Time: An Introduction to Big History, which was an impressive book, though not without issues. Since then, variants and additions have been published by himself, but also by many others. Big History also has become a separate discipline within the academic world, with its own institutes and journals (not to confound with ‘Global History’). And the movement was especially impacted by the enthusiasm with which Bill Gates and his Foundation endorsed this approach, which resulted, among other things, into a comprehensive package of didactic material that historians and others can use in education.The great merit of Big History is that human history is fitted into that of the universe, an extreme bird's eye view that allows to see the broad lines and thus distinguish the important from the secondary. David Christian does this in this book with much more efficiency than in his first ones. The relative place of man in the universe is constantly emphasized, while at the same time highlighting the enormous impact of human activity on the own planet. The book is much more didactic and therefore more accessible than ‘Maps of Time’ (although there are certainly tough passages, with a lot of jargon).But over the years Big History has also received a lot of criticism. As said before, the extreme bird's eye view has its advantages, but it ignores the ultra-contingent character of historical evolutions. Christian tries to compensate for this by constantly underlining the complex convergence of coincidence and necessity, highlighting the importance of emergent phenomena and unexpected feedback loops. But, of course, a glimpse into the history of the universe from such a great distance inevitably gets a certain deterministic undertone, as if everything went as it should have gone.A second major criticism of Big History is that the emphasis is a little too much on the physics-cosmological approach: a lot of time is spent on sketching the origin and development of the universe, of our solar system, of life on earth and so on , and that is clearly at the expense of human history. In this book, for example, mankind only appears halfway through, so that human history is limited to a few rough lines of evolution. The criticism is correct, of course, but - as said - it is precisely the merit of Big History that it places human history in that broader context. Still, the extensive use of theories from the science of physics, chemistry and biology, keep on haunting the Big History-movement.A final criticism is that Big History is implicitly based on a form of belief in progress. David Christian doesn't even make a secret of it. Like many physicists, he expresses his fascination for the impressive process of evolution that our universe has gone through, in an ascending line of increasing complexity. And he immediately emphasizes how fascinating it is that in our age we have obtained a reliable picture of that evolution through science (in contrast to religious and other creation myths). ""Because it is based on a global heritage of thoroughly controlled knowledge and information, and because it is the first genesis of human societies and cultures from all over the world."" Big History exudes the unshakable belief in the cumulative progression of knowledge and insight through science, with a specific emphasis on the connecting and overarching elements. Christian is well aware of how much that positive perspective has faltered in our recent time period, precisely because of the enormous possibilities that man has acquired to intervene in his environment, even to annihilate that environment. Hence the very moral tone in the epilogue, with a call to change tack, but also with a strong belief in technological possibilities.I can recommend this book, although it has some technical-scientific chapters, and you have to deal with the caveats I mentioned above. But Christian has managed to summarize his take on ""universal"" history in a very engaging way, and also made an effort to deal with some of the criticisms on Big History. I'm still not fully convinced of the full potential of this approach, but I have to concede it has its merits.

Had the most wonderful sense of the sublime while reading it; I'm tiny and unimportant and my specific life could not matter less. Christian's framing of 21st-century power in terms of cell structures has made me deal better with my anxiety about how fucked the world is, and my fears for humanity in the near future. Excellent writing, about the only topic there is, really. "
4,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8676317-a-man-called-ove,3,"The first thing I have done after finishing the book is to unlike Bill Gates' review (4/5) of it. I also suspect if he reviewed and recommended this not because he personally found it great, but because he wanted others to read it as a good, lucid introductory book on Big History.The first half of the book is a poor cousin of ""Cosmos"" or ""A Short history of Nearly Everything"". It deals with the origin of the universe to the origin of human beings. The book has more information than insights and for this part, the book felt a bit better.Couldnt help comparing the second half, the story of humans, to the magnificient ""Sapiens"" by Harari. Instead of insights you have a lot of children's general history level facts thrown at you here. It was so uninteresting that I skimmed the last chapter. Avoid, unless this is the first book you will be reading on this subject. And my level of disappointment is bcoz I have read some fantastic books on related topics."
5,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5153787-geevee,4,"• Big bang,• Big (and some very small) science,• Big history.David Christian takes his big approach to life, the universe and everything to provide a very readable and interesting book.Origin story will take the reader from billions of years ago up to the information age. He does this in two ways: the first using thresholds to define leaps and...well thresholds in space and evolution; second by accessible and engaging prose.For me the big bang, and how that developed along with its universes, galaxies and solar systems was a riveting story. Couple this with how these things behaved, and how they continue to do so, underpinned by chemistry and physics explained through human understanding of sciences gave me a better grasp of not just how but the what and why.I was more clear too with this big and complex subject thanks to the high-quality writing on how man is able to use his intelligence to map, explore, investigate and then prove the origin story.The history of our own solar system and our planet is clear and easy to digest. As Mr Christian moves through the Earth's phases and changes the reader is given easy to understand information and when needed excellent explanation and helpful analogies.As for humans and the impact we have had on Earth, the last threshold and phase in the book, the story is well told. Oddly it was this point I lost a little interest; perhaps because it is contemporary and not new to me?I chose this book because it was a shiny new one begging me to take it home from my library. I was glad I did - for what is sub-400 pages narrative it takes you on a stellar journey that packs a big punch."

9,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26055396-sense-of-history,3,"David Christian already impressed by his seminal Maps of Time: An Introduction to Big History, published in 2004 (though I also had some issues with it). This was the first time someone tried to present a comprehensive overview of all of history, including that of the universe, in just one volume. I know, I’m ignoring H.G. Wells’ A Short History of the World, but given its publication date (1922), I’ll guess you understand why: our knowledge of the evolution of the universe since then has evolved so tremendously that you can’t take this serious any more, unless as a historical document. Back to David Christian. In this book Christian offers a remake of his ‘Maps of Time’, but in a more accessible way, and updated with the latest scientific information and theories. In this review I want to look into these changes a bit more. First of all, there’s a lot of repetitive material, and that’s quite obvious: both Maps of Time and this Origin Story follow the same path, from the beginning of our universe until now, and even taking a short look into the future. Christian carefully sketches the scientific knowledge and theories about the Big Bang and what came after, the beginning of our solar system, the venue of life on earth, and the appearance of homo sapiens. And then we are well over halfway. In the final 100 pages over 5.000 years of history of agrarian societies are taken together, followed by the tremendous evolution human history took from the 18th century onwards till now. Especially in that last chapter Christian works in a more coarse-grained way than in his first book, at the expense of historic detail, which is a pity. But in the last book, now under review, Christian has ordered his material in a more didactic way, focussing on 8 thresholds and thus stressing the importance of these giant leaps throughout history. Given the time-lapse between the publication of both books (14 years) it is but logic that Christian has updated his view with the latest scientific knowledge concerning the early development of the universe. For instance, the theory on multiverses is included, and again and again Christian refers to the Goldilocks-principle at every stage in his threshold-overview, reflecting the success of Paul Davies’ book The Goldilocks Enigma: Why is the Universe Just Right for Life?. Especially his chapter on the start of life on earth has been reworked with a lot of new material; it has become the most technical part of the book, with a lot of difficult jargon. But what struck me most, was that even more than in his first book Christian stresses the processes of information and energy: almost all evolutions, every leap in complexity, is explained in terms of a much higher efficiency in gaining and using information, and in exploiting or extracting more energy. There are no footnotes in this book, but I have the impression Christian has absorbed a lot of new material in this area, and has rewritten the chapters on human history in the last centuries to put the climate change-threat more in perspective. With the naming of the final threshold as ‘Anthropocene’ the author clearly is sailing on that current too. In this chapter, more than ever, the stress is put on the giant leap the use of fossil-fuels has made possible, but also the threats this now poses for our future. It’s almost inevitable then, that in his epilogue he focuses completely on the urgent challenge that climate change is going to be, whilst in Maps of Time he also included outlooks on artificial intelligence and other important evolutions. This makes me think that Christian wrote this new, shorter version of his Maps of Time, with a clear agenda in mind. So, in some ways this book is more accessible and much more didactic, but unfortunately it is also more limited, especially in the part on human history, and it is more engaged. Christian has turned his ""universal"" history even more into a program to take the human future in our own hands. In that way, this book is not just a history book, but an engaging piece of writing."
10,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/883451-susan-in-nc,5,"I want to read more good nonfiction, and came across this intriguing title - it fit the bill nicely, giving me a new cautiously optimistic outlook and taking my mind off of the dreadful news headlines for a bit.First of all, I really enjoyed the dry humor and interesting observations of the author. He uses the term Goldilocks to refer to the just right evolutionary conditions planet Earth possessed which allowed life to develop. The following passage is typical of his engaging style, in which he discusses these ‘evolutionary ups and downs’: “These changes did not take the smooth, stately forms that Darwin and his generation expected of evolution. Instead, the history of big life was an unpredictable and dangerous roller coaster ride… Like the cliché about the life of a soldier, evolution in the Phanerozoic meant long periods of boredom punctuated by moments of terror and life-threatening violence. The violence is most apparent in periods of mass extinctions.”Or these observations on agrarian civilizations: “Viewed ecologically states and their rulers represent a new step in the food chain, a new trophic level. We have seen how energy from sunlight enters the biosphere through photosynthesis and travels from plants to herbivores to carnivores. And we have seen how most of that energy is wasted at each trophic level, in a sort of garbage tax.… Rulers and nobles and officials begin to squeeze wealth in the labor and produce of peasants, who in turn got their energy in food for farming.… Thinking about such processes in ecological terms reminds us that wealth never really consist of things; it consists of control over the energy flows that make, move, mine, and transform things. Wealth is a sort of compressed sunlight, just as matter is really congealed energy.”See? Different and intriguing, yet accessible. And I admit, when I read the above statement about nobles squeezing peasants, I thought of my favorite scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail where King Arthur (Graham Chapman) is treated to a lecture on human rights from a peasant! I found Christian’s Big History ideas a fascinating, clear-eyed, intelligent way of getting a big picture of where humans have been and where we may be going; maybe not always a rosy picture, but an impressive and important way to organize our history thus far. I love how beautifully he weaves together so many disciplines and narratives! So much of current news coverage is breathless and cataclysmic and, I feel, takes our eyes and minds off the real, larger issues covered here. I am going to continue to seek out well-written and well-researched non-fiction that helps me grasp the important issues and try and make sense of our world!"
11,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40723765-ron,5,"Scary stuff. Really scary, and important, and informational.This is science that everyone needs to understand. If you follow creationist theories, just skip over the bits on evolution. There is still some good information in here that won't go against your beliefs."
12,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82034260-nikhil,4,"I have a strong impulse to type the opening lyrics of the show Big Bang Theory, but I'll resist. Origin Story delivers exactly what it promises, the history ranging from the manifestation of the universe to the capitalism and global issues we go through today. I must admit that I glossed over a few chapters because I was here mostly for the human part and just a summary of the big bang. With that in mind, I did find reading the book a fairly enriching exercise that explains how humans evolved to develop complex societies and the technology to deeply affect the biosphere of the planet. Swiping through the pages to visualise how we went from agriculture to the atomic bomb is informative, and it also shed a lot of knowledge on archaeology and sociology, so yeah, good read. "
13,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91841408-priyam-roy,5,"Wow - Where to begin? When I first started reading Origin Story, I had absolutely no idea that this book would grow to become one of my favourites. Trust me when I say that it is a nail-biter, I found it excruciatingly challenging to put down! Origin Story takes you on a journey through time, from the beginning of the universe at the Big Bang, to present day, and onwards into some likely scenarios for the future. It's difficult to praise this work without spoiling its contents, but I especially appreciated Mr. David Christian's discretion to explain complex scientific processes in layman's terms. As a POC, one aspect of the book I applaud is the due diligence the author gives to the atrocities committed by Europeans in the name of ""progression"". This book is factual, impartial, and thoroughly informative. I would recommend it to everyone."
14,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92376579-brandy,5,"Multidisciplinary look at the modern origin story of humankind. It begins with the big bang (astrophysics, quantum mechanics, etc.) and talks about star formation and planet formation. Then it goes on to discuss the history of earth and of life on earth (biology, chemistry, geology, etc.), all the way through present times (economics, history, sociology, etc.). It finishes up by looking at possible futures for us and the universe as a whole.I don't normally get as engaged with non-fiction books, but this one was fascinating and truly puts the world and the universe into a different perspective for me. I highly, highly recommend this book."
15,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32188980-tamim-ansary,5,"Christian really puts the ""big"" in ""big history"". Somehow this book achieves both sweep and detail. He gives us the universe as a story of energy and information interacting to generate ever-increasing complexity, and I'm sold. By the time he's done, I'm thinking, ""Yeah: that's a pretty good way to look at it. Hard to think of any aspect of history that doesn't fit into that schema."" As for meticulous, illuminating detail, look at his account of how life forms emerged from non-living matter: wow. I got this book from the library but after I read it I bought it: I wanted to have it around. "

I found the book interesting and engrossing although at times I must admit that I got a bit lost with the science, especially at the time of the creation of stars and planets - but that is probably more down to me than to the author's explanations, never being much of a science buff myself! - 8/10."

22,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19857486-rajesh-goradia,4,"The Origin Story is a great summary of David Christian's Big History Project - a field of study that integrates concepts from diverse silos of knowledge in order to explain the rising complexity in the universe – the pinnacle of which is represented by the human race. Through this story we come to terms with our chance existence, despite the law of entropy which predicts that disorder of a closed system should only increase. Each threshold – where something new emerges – requires more energy and a more improbable set of goldilocks conditions. This book takes us on 13.8 billion year journey through several thresholds - from the big bang, to the creation of the first atoms, to the biological formation of the first cells and DNA, to the evolution of cultural complexity resulting from the industrial revolution. Each step is marked by an increased need for free energy flows and increased fragility because of the more stringent conditions within which their existence is possible. The book highlights the common thread connecting all of us with the universe. We are all made up of congealed energy (atoms) – just like the stars, the planets, the oceans, the animals and the devices we create. We simply represent a more improbable and energy intensive arrangement of particular atoms. Our death may be the end of our story, but not the end of the parts that make us. In the broad narrative of the universe, we may be the most complex creatures, but we occupy an insignificant slice of time in the journey of the universe. Our continued existence is far from certain – in fact it is highly improbable. An asteroid or a volcano could destroy us. We could run out of energy. A biological virus could destroy our civilization. Humanity may evolve into a super race or be destroyed by one. The climate may run amok – like on Venus. The challenges that face us are immense, but so is our ability to find solutions. This book is not simply an attempt to look back at the evolution of the universe and locate our place in it. It is a bold attempt to create a radical sense of shared responsibility among humans in face of unprecedented challenges. It is an attempt to create a common origin story – a story shared by all humans regardless of their race, ethnicity and religion – in a daring effort to unite the human race in its quest for survival."
23,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"Every culture and tradition has had its origin story, its understanding of how the world came to be as they knew it, which formed the basis for their further understanding of how to live, interact with others, get food, make clothes. Our origin stories are the basis of how we understand everything.Now, in the early 21st century, we know far more about the origin of the universe, our sun, our planet, and life on Earth. We live in a society of unparalleled complexity, and in the last two hundred years, we have gained the ability not just to support more human beings, but to improve the daily lives of most humans on the planet, not just an elite 10% or so.What we haven't done yet is integrate this knowledge into a new, shared origin story that helps us cope with this new, complex, and rapidly changing world.Christian intends this as at least a first pass at a modern origin story. In a lively, highly readable or listenable style, he lays out the basics of our new knowledge of the origins of the universe, our planet, and life on Earth, as well as an overview of the evolution of our species and development of our societies, right down to how we made the transition from strictly agrarian societies to today's high-tech, rapidly changing world. And he looks at the challenges as well as the benefits of that transition and our current power to affect our planet.Christian makes the point, as others have in the last few years, that we now have, in essence, the controls for our only habitable planet. We decide what species live and which ones die, and we are playing with the climate controls. If we understand and master those controls in time, we have the potential to give our species the best and most comfortable lives we have ever had.Or we could make the planet uninhabitable for such an energy-consuming culture, and drive ourselves back to the early agrarian or even hunter-gatherer level.Or we could render the planet uninhabitable for our species altogether, and leave Earth to start over again, with other species in a climate unlike any that has existed since the first primates evolved.Despite that potential grim outcome, I found this overall a lively and interesting book, well worth the time I spent listening to it. Recommended.I bought this audiobook."
24,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10687161-andy-klein,2,"This book is much overrated as is the so-called field of Big History. I kept thinking that this total is not the equal of the sum of its parts. This was a combination of Cosmos, A Short History of Nearly Everything, and Sapiens, but not even close to the equal of any of them. It succeeded best in its description of the creation of the universe, the sun, and Earth but went steadily downward as it shifted to sociology to be quite jarring. The book tried to do too much and succeeded in delivering too little. "

After watching a Bill Gates documentary on how he reads, I tried adopting some of his methods with this book and found the result very pleasing. I really tried to understand what I was reading and that paid off throughout the book. I felt that there were some ideas that stuck with me, ideas that I would be using from now on to mold my understanding of the world. I found the ideas of energy flow (and how entropy takes an energy tax) and the parallel between microorganisms and the state eye-opening. As a remark, I recommend this book to anybody as long as they read it thoroughly and really try to grasp the complexity of the ideas within"
31,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89516151-susan,5,"Fascinating! This book condenses the 13.8 billion years of the Universe's history into “thresholds” that eventually lead to the present day and explains the Goldilocks conditions of how we came to be in a way that’s easy to understand and awe-inspiring. It leaves behind a sense of wonder just how uniquely rare we are, and also puts it into perspective just how ephemeral everything is. We are an infinitesimal little dust in the universe, but perhaps for the first time in its 13.8 billion years of transformation, a tiny corner of the universe is able to understand itself and how it came to be. It makes me treasure everything that leads to what we are and what we have today: stars had to align to produce us, literally. It’s simply a miracle! There is also a particularly interesting point weaving throughout the book about entropy and how entropy is collecting complexity tax from everything, and it’s as if entropy is behind the progression from threshold and threshold. It gave me some fresh perspective on the universe. "

At times, it took some careful re-reading of the physics portions of this book but really this book is immensely readable and I found so much of it incredibly fascinating. I think the most important idea to take away from this book is that it really is a miracle that we are here, living the life that we do, because it took a lot of extremely ideal conditions for us to get to this point. I received a digital ARC of this book through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. "

The first half of this book - with its descriptions of of the Big Bang and the beginnings of complex life forms - is excellent. As the story moves closer to the present and begins to speculate about the future, the focus or analysis becomes less clear. "
34,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,4,"Origin Story is historian David Christian's valiant effort to cram the history of the universe into 300 pages.Historians typically trace the beginning of human history to the time some 5,000 years ago when people started committing language to writing. After all, history as practiced in academia is the study of primary and secondary sources, nearly all of them written. And without a written record there is presumably no history. But doesn't it seem shortsighted to limit ourselves to a mere 5,000 years when the human race has walked the Earth for at least 200,000 years and the planet has been in existence for some 4.5 billion? It's not as though our only source of information about the past is what has been written. Geology, archaeology, genetics, and climate science can all shed light on the forces that have shaped human affairs. To understand where we've come from and how we got here, why should we confine ourselves to the silos of academia?Origin Story: a comprehensive approach to the study of the pastThat was the question historian David Christian asked himself thirty years ago. An Oxford-educated American then teaching in Australia, Christian developed a course he called ""Big History."" He enlisted the help of colleagues in other departments to employ the full range of academic tools in exploring the past. In fact, he began at the very beginning, with the Big Bang. With help from astrophysicists, chemists, exobiologists, and other scientists and social scientists, Christian surveyed the full 13.8 billion years in the history of the universe, with a focus on humankind's place in this much wider context. And today, he is recognized as the creator of the emerging field of Big History, an interdisciplinary field that has given rise to the International Big History Association and the Journal of Big History.""An origin story for all modern humans""In Origin Story, Christian's most recent book in the field, he shoehorns into barely more than 300 pages a survey of Big History. As he notes in an Introduction, ""This is an origin story for all modern humans, and it builds on the global traditions of modern science."" The first half of the book encompasses the Big Bang, the formation of stars and galaxies, the creation of the solar system, and the emergence of life on Earth. The human race appears between 200,000 and 300,000 years ago, midway through the book.The eight thresholds of Big HistoryChristian finds all 13.8 billion years of Big History marked by eight Threshholds:Threshold 1: The Big BangThreshold 2: The creation of stars and galaxiesThreshold 3: The Periodic Table expandsThreshold 4: Molecules, moons, planets, and solar systems emergeThreshold 5: Simple life first appears on EarthThreshold 6: Life grows more complex, and eventually humans first walk the EarthThreshold 7: Humans set out on the road to agrarian civilizationThreshold 8: The Anthropocene: the fossil fuel revolutionAs Christian notes, this is a story of ever-growing complexity. At each of these key transition points, ""more complex things appeared."" The eight Thresholds ""highlight major turning points, when already existing things were rearranged or otherwise altered to create something with new, 'emergent' properties.""Christian's writing is strong and clear. But when explaining in detail what transpired at each of these turning points, he makes liberal use of scientific language. It's rough going without a solid, college-level grounding in science. But there's no end of insight in this fresh and provocative approach to the study of the past."
35,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2492661-nancy-ellis,4,"Having read Dr. Christian's previous text on Big History, Maps of Time, as well as having studied his course on Big History produced by The Great Courses (previously known as The Teaching Company), I found this an enjoyable refresher. It is a more condensed version of Big History than the massive Maps of Time and is an excellent introduction to whet the appetite of potential students. Anyone who knows me is aware of my tendency towards OCD behavior in reading, in that I am obsessive about reading a series of books in the order they were written. The study of history is one of my major loves, so Big History satisfies that obsession by taking us back to what we currently believe to be the very beginning of it all: the Big Bang. The story continues as levels of complexity increase (e.g. stars, planets, molecules, etc.), eventually leading to the emergence of mankind. This book includes a large concluding section dealing with the present-day changing of the biosphere by humans and what the future could hold. It's a relief that Dr. Christian is neither a predictor of doom and despair nor a believer that everything is rosy. He presents a fair depiction of the choices we face in the future of life on earth. Having said all that, I must say that I actually preferred his first book with its 600+ pages, because of the wealth of information that is within those pages."
36,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26089999-anu,5,"History bored me as a child. Who wants to know about kings and wars and dates? As I grew older, I realized that knowing how we got to today is a key part of understanding today as well as future. In Origin story, Christian offers a solid, all-encompassing scaffolding for everything we know as a species today. This book touched me deeply in offering a moment of complete AWE at how complex, vast and interconnected everything in the universe is. Magnum opus extraordinaire! The book narrates big history as a sequence of ""threshold moments"", that were crucial turning points in a journey of increasing complexity. I've read other books in this format that dissect specific parts of history (Sapiens for evolution of humanity, Brief History of Time for cosmology etc.) but this book takes a panoramic perspective of all of time. Threshold 1: Big Bang (13.7 billion years ago) Fundamental forces ""come into being"" shortly. 380,000 years later, hydrogen and helium atoms are formed Threshold 2: Stars light up. Gravity coalesces clumps in molecular cloud to ✨Threshold 3: Stars die, making new elements - C, N and O Threshold 4: Earth is born! (4.6 billion years ago) Debris from the sun's birth make its planetsThreshold 5: Life emerges on Earth (4 billion years ago) Prokaryotes->Eukaryotes. Photosynthesis & Respiration create energy bonanzas.Threshold 6: Collective learning (300,000 years ago) Humanity leapfrogs thanks to unique collective learning ability (language, collective co-operation)Threshold 7: Agriculture (11,000 years ago) Farming unleashes a new energy bonanza and helps build complex agrarian societies Threshold 8: Anthropocene (250 years ago) The last 250 years have unleashed more energy needs and stores than the last 200,000 years. Humanity as a species now has universal global impact David Christian is a very meticulous writer, his writing style while not the most entertaining, does not matter much since his content is so darn engaging! Read the book! "
37,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20849833-debjeet,5,"This is one of the most profound books on evolution undoubtedly.Though there is little bit of overlap with sapiens but the breadth and depth of this book covering evolution from cosmological,molecular,microbial,holcene,anthropocene etc perspective is truly outstanding.The interlinking of various concepts and weave into one unifying common goal is the beauty of this author I have read books on evolution like selfish gene,sapiens,guns germs steel, sixth extinction etc but this book tops all this book.If evolution is one of the topic of your interest then one must grab hold of this."
38,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46201060-jente-ottenburghs,3,"Nice book that attempts to cover the entire history of our universe based on the latest scientific findings (a fresh and much needed alternative to the outdated, misguided, mythological origin stories of religions). David Christian introduces some clever concepts, such as the central role of energy and the Goldilocks conditions of thresholds, to weave the story together. Some sections, however, are a bit repetitive and could be focused better. Overall, this is great story that provides a primer for more detailed reading on particular parts of our Big History."

40,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6967184-david-cheshire,5,"I read his ""Maps of Time"", the magisterial text-book of Big History (of which he is one the key inventors) and it inspired me to use it with my U3A History Group. Big History is a unified narrative of the history of everything from the Big Bang through the whole of human history and incorporating the Big Bang and the heat death of the universe; it is fundamentally a history of complexity. This covers that ground in 310 pages of text. Why isn't everybody yelling about this book? It is a masterpiece. He uses homely, familiar metaphors to explain the complex physics and biology behind the origin of the universe, earth and life. He tells it like a drama. He simultaneously tells a second drama, of the people who discovered this stuff, the evidence they marshalled and what it all means. I'm currently up to plate technonics which appararently helped make the earth chemically rich, helping life to emerge. Already I have read my utterly mind-blowing idea of 2019 (I read it on 30 Dec). All structure and complexity in existence relies on exploiting flows of free energy, the type that moves stuff and does things. Meanwhile entropy is continually trying to reduce everything to heat energy which is just, well, heat. Eventually entropy will win. The universe will become just low-level heat with no structure. Some people, David Christian tells us, believe entropy actually likes and encourages life because it burns up free energy into heat energy so much more quickly that non-life. I'm still trying to absorb that statement. Stephen Hawkings' ""Brief History of Time"" used to be book that everyone bought, tried to read and gave up. This is the new must-have, must-read and 100% understandable book of the age. It's a miracle of cool, clear, mind-blowing explanation. You must buy this book. You must read it. This is not a suggestion. It will take you on the ride of a lifetime. "
41,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49023050-sumit-gouthaman,3,"This book is obviously a remarkable effort. It attempts to capture ""Big History"" right from the moment of the Big Bang until the present. Then, it attempts to give a glimpse of the future as the universe tumbles towards its end as we know it.However, the main reason I did not enjoy this (as much as I wanted to), was because this feels too similar to a lot of books I've already read.If you are someone who has already read these books:1. A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson2. Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari3. Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies by Jared Diamond... then you've pretty much read everything that this book covers. Although, I admit, there is some value in a book that brings all of this together in one place.One other minor criticism of the book is that in the chapter covering the Anthropocene (2nd to last chapter), the author wastes a lot of time repeating the same points over and over again. Perhaps the intention is to highlight how important the lessons are, but in practice, the chapter was tedious to read.Other than that, this is a reasonable book to read, if you are unlikely to read the other 3 books I mentioned above.A few interesting quotes from the book:- ""Study the world itself rather than what has been said about the world.""- ""Knowledge is like a sphere; the greater its volume, the larger its contact with the unknown."" - Blaise Pascal- ""Wealth is a sort of compressed sunlight, just as matter is really congealed energy."""
42,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56396157,3,"I have read quite a few histories and even translated a few, especially when it comes to the origin and evolution of the universe. Big Histories or Histories of Everything are in truth nothing new, although it seems they are going through a sort of re-emergence, usually ending with informed guesses on humanity's future.It seems the goal is to put forward the idea of a unified human race (or at least, essential history thereof), the likes of which is depicted and will eventually be established in a 100-300 year Star Trek future (in terms of society, not starfaring technology). It is a lovely idea, albeit one that does not seem very realistic given the state of the world and the fact that some such efforts (such as this book) are being made in what is ostensibly ""the Western World"", like drops in an ocean of radicalization, fragmentation and insularity.Cynical thoughts aside, however, this is a good, solid book. The writer draws from an incredible multitude of scientific disciplines to tell the story of how the universe got this way and how we, as a humanity, got here. I think it may contain a bit too much information for the layman, but the truth is you get a cosmological and world history all in one, so that's a bonus."
43,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79039839-vladimir-stozhkov,5,"I was fascinated by a soaring manner of the author to explain complex concepts in simple terms. The book covers many topics belonging to the humankind's origin story starting with the big bang and ending with future challenges such as scarcity of energy resources and others. I really liked the ideas encompassing subsistence of all complex structures in the universe, entropy taxing, trophic strata of energy consumption, etc. I have never known about such a general view on a composition of the universe and it was great to conceive such an insight.This book will be great for those lacking fundamental knowledge in astronomy, molecular physics, cell biology, anthropology and ancient history. Bizarrely the book elegantly connects all these disciplines, thus creating some sort of a feeling of the wholesome picture of cosmos. The Origin Story can be a great starting point to get interested in the listed disciplines and delve into those topics deeper exploring them in books written by Hawking, Bryson, deGrasse Tyson, Harari and the other popularizers of science."
44,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58331181-janis,5,"I read a recommendation for this book by Bill Gates and was lucky enough to get a copy quickly from the library. It was slow going at first as there was so much scientific information, much of which was not known when I was in school back in the 50s and 60s. However, in spite of the technological challenges, Christian's writing is engaging enough to keep the reader hanging in there. Proudly finished it a day before it is due back and where 44 people have it on their hold lists and are anxiously awaiting their turn. Gates's recommendation was spot on; this is a fantastic read and will leave you thinking about the universe, life, and what's really important as you might never have previously done. To create a world where economic growth is no longer the primary goal of governments, where people can escape the extreme forms of the rat race, where education and science become important and knowledge begins to replace material goods as a source of wealth and well-being, where we are no longer dependent on fossil fuels, and where poverty has been eliminated will rely, as Christian so aptly points out, on the existence of voters who take this quest seriously. Christian does not politicize this, but I will: the current administration seems to be taking us in the exact opposite direction and that's worse than just simple folly. Take the time to read this masterful work - it will be well worth it."

It has briefly covered the broad(very broad indeed) history of our existence. The book has divided the history into few thresholds which had tremendous impacts on life/non-life on Earth. There are inconceivable(at least for me) time durations mentioned in the book. In philosophical terms, it makes me think how meaningless everything is in the context of the Universe, but also the rarety of our existence. The probability of our existence was very low, but we are here. So, we must add meaning to the extremely improbable event. Should we? I'd recommend it for anyone who is interested in having new perspectives to look at the world and also to have a better understanding of today, by peeking into the glimpses of history. "

48,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15022761-jessica-lu,2,"The ""Big History Project"", funded by Bill Gates, is a free online syllabus for high schools. The co-founder of this project, with Bill Gates, is Professor David Christstian, the author of this book. That's why this book is one of the books Bill Gates recommends to read.The cover of the book explains what the book is about: ""A big history of everything from the Big Bang to the first stars, to our solar system, life on earth, dinosaurs, Homo sapiens, agriculture, an ice age, empires, fossil fuels, a moon landing and mass globalization. And what happens next..."".The author is a professor in history and this book is about the ""Big History"" (an up-to-date version of a unified history of humanity). It is a sort of London Underground map of the universe explained with the best modern scientific knowledge pooled from quantum physics, astronomy, thermodynamics, electronics, chemistry, biology, geology, paleontology, archaeology, anthropology, mineralogy, etc...So, as you can see, actually, the book is not so ""history"" at all! There is not much about wars, leaders, states, empires, left alone the artistic, religious or any philosophical traditions. And a lot of information shared in the book is not even the proven facts, but scientific hypothesis... as he quotes someone said ""Knowledge is like a sphere; the greater its volume, the larger its contact with the unknown."" With all its imperfections and uncertainties, it does allow us to stand back far enough to see human history being placed in a much larger story of planet earth and the universe as a whole. And this overview is the essence of this book!It tells the stories about how the universe created complexity stage by stage and how our world was created by powerful forces and circumstances in the distant past. According to the book, there were 8 thresholds in the big history: 1. Big Bang;2. galaxy and stars;3. chemical increase; 4. molecular formed solar system; 5. life appeared; 6. bipedalism (walking on two legs);7. agriculture;8. anthropocene (the idea that humans should transform and ""improve"" the world.)Big history shows us the nature of our complexity, fragility and the danger we are facing. It also reminds us our power with collective learning. We now have a quest set by United Nation, rethink the economic growth and consumption patterns. We also are willing to be just the world's custodians... There is hope in the end of the book and finishes in positive tone.I, being more interested in people's history, got really bored in reading the chapters before human appeared... so I slowly plowed through and the second half of the book was much more enjoyable. Anyway, I do appreciate some new concepts/views from the book:- Life started as photosynthesis first and then balanced with respiration. Both are the ways to release energy from the sun (transformed through carbon dioxide, water and oxygen).- Energy causes change, information directs change. Life is about a mechanism that interprets information and responds appropriately.- All organisms are equipped with a desire for information, so to survive by responding to the environmental changes. That's why when a human solves a puzzle, the brain gets the same buzz it gets from food and sex. 😝- Sensations, emotions and thoughts together create the inner, subjective world we (and all other large-brained species) experience.- Emotions are decision-makers that have evolved through natural selection to help organisms survive.- Human brains consume much more energy than other species. The discover of fire, so we started cooking, was important. Because it helps in releasing some metabolic energy needed to run larger brains... So, our brains can develop ""languages"" to generate, store and share information. This collective learning can help us tap on more resources for energy as well as deal with relationships to be more socialized.- Agriculture, farming and domesticating animals, is about energy cultivation and resource storage. It transformed human life, societies, histories and our relationships with the world greatly. Technologies and innovations are all about exploiting and distributing resources and energy. Wealth and power are all about control over the resource mobility and energy flows.- Population grew because agriculture prospered. Our productivity, technologies, structures and controlling systems got more complex and need more energy for maintenance.- Complex things usually break down faster than simple things. Increasing complexity is not a triumph over entropy. Paradoxically, the energy that built complex things helps to break down all forms of order and structure.Last but not the least... Although it seems to be a huge, complex, elaborate, beautiful and inspiring story, my rebellious mind wants to challenge the author:1. Why do we have to have a united story, why can't we keep our own unique origin stories?2. Has he ever considered the possibility of another higher civilization or we humans actually came from another planet rather than being created through evolution on earth?3. How about consciousness and its power to create matters? How about the karma effects that move everything in the world?To me, the ""Origin Story"" is not a final note. Far from it, the story not only will be continued, but will be rewritten too, when we learn more... A great read!"

Mainly because he's got a fan thing about the universe and sitting through all seasons of The Universe and the episodes of Cosmos (which is actually pretty awesome, both the ancient ones with Carl Sagan as the new ones presented by Neil Degrasse Tyson) I had my share of things theoretically explained.But I'm glad I read it, because this is one hell of a story and has opened my eyes in a way that other media have neglected to do.Origin Story tells our history, not from the beginning of mankind, but from the beginning of the matter that we're made from. It tells the story how we came to be, the millions of chance factors that ultimately led to our existence and dominance over our environment.I admit, its pretty filled to the nook with science jabber, but if you're already a bit familiar with how our Universe works and of what it consists, (thank you Neil!) it makes for a pretty great story.Its scientific take spiced up with a moral sense of obligation makes me proud to be human and, at the same time, pretty humble because we're nothing more than a hiccup in the long way.Our history is generally told, not from a perspective of one nation or a group of nations, but from the point of our species as a whole. When we developed from one-celled organisms to multicell organisms we weren't choosing sides and that how Christian tells the entire story. How agriculture and later on the discovery of fossil fuel catapulted us into a shaky future where we have to learn to let go instead of push our boundaries.If you're interested in learning a bit more about our planet's history and how our species developed through the ages, definitely pick this book up. Even if you think it might be too scientific for you, just try it. It won't disappoint."

Christian has that knack like Carl Sagan and Neil deGrasse Tyson of making the driest,most esoteric physics and biology fascinating.

""Big History"" is a new field of science, one that tries to tell the story of the universe, planets, life and humanity in a single uniform narrative. I read a lot of books which cover parts of this story from the angle of physics, chemistry or biology, but never in such an interwoven way. David Christian make an interesting story told in easy understandable language which really explains everything.If you liked Bill Brysons story of everything, you love this one."

If you have questions regarding the birth of the universe, the progression of humanity and how it will all end someday, it's all here in a little over 300 pgs. I took my time, it is fairly dense but very readable. A big thank you to the publisher and Goodreads for providing me with this book."
70,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4472316-zulfiya,4,"It was an illuminating read but not because the facts were not known; on the contrary, all the facts are well-established and have been used by different branches of science to explore and explain the universe, but the approach to their presentation was visionary. This is about our history as we all share it in the cosmic sense of the world. I am sure it will infuriate the creationists of all religions, but faith is not entitled to facts while science is based on facts. This is how science works - statements need to be proven multiple types using different verification methods, and it should never be confused with leaps of faith. This approach to our history of cohabitation in the big universe opens up a new feeling of belonging to the unimaginably big world. At the same time, it underscores our uniqueness and our danger as individual species that are dangerous and possess weapons of self-destruction. The author makes it crystal clear that we have already destroyed many relative species and many species on the planet we live on, and we are not only paying the taxes to entropy, but we are entropy per se. At the same time, the ending is not gloomy as there is still hope and a chance to save our lives, out future, and our planet as soon as we act and stop following the fairy tales instead of established facts. At the same time, the other option is also a viable option. Universe is a mindbogglingly HUGE place, and we might not simply make it because in the framework of this universe, we are just a tiny cell of life that might or might not make it. Yet again, let me reiterate, a very necessary and urgent read for many people. "

In the actual age of the universe this of course makes sense, but can make the second third of the book a bit slow. At least for me it took me a lot of time to go through the middle section.Overall enjoyed it and wonderfully written. Great for anyone who wants to look back at everything they didn't pay attention in school, get scared about the future, but also see some hope by understanding we are living at a infinite minimal moment in history."

However, I did really enjoy the first and last few chapters of Origin Story. For example, about how in the beginning, the material about how gravity was one of the key organizing forces that brought us from a universe of very spread out hydrogen and helium towards what we have today. And at the end, the ""good anthropocene"" vs. ""bad anthropocene"" and the necessity to get the good and mitigate the bad. And I liked the premise of Origin Story, to unite the human race around a common origin story in the midst of some of the tribalism and segmentation we are currently experiencing."

78,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58910608-dennis-murphy,4,"Origin Story: A Big History of Everything by David Christian is an ambitious book that does an admirable, if somewhat politicized, job of conveying the story of mankind when contextualized as part of a universal story that began a long, long time ago. The book has a mission: to re-contextualize history as one that is as old as the universe, and one that has no real need or recognition of borders or competing philosophies. I'm sympathetic to his mission, but he drives the point a bit too hard towards the end. I was a huge science nerd prior to hopping over to political science, so not much of this was really all that new to me. Nothing here is obscure, and there were times where I was actively preempting what he was going to talk about next without much effort. I imagine that this will go a great deal farther for people who need an introduction, whereas for me it was a pretty good, but not truly great, foray into familiar territory.85/100"
79,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18810659-kurt-douglass,2,"David Christian succeeds in presenting a ""big history"" of the earth - really the universe - from the big bang to the imagined end of time (whatever that entails). However, I don't think he succeeds in his stated goal of crafting an origin story that the entire world can rally around. The history of our universe is too vast, complicated, and mysterious to condense into a succinct narrative like the origin stories of world's religions. Nor is it as captivating, entertaining, spiritual, or didactic as the creation myths. Sorry, but galaxies forming at a glacial pace over millions of years isn't as spectacular or inspiring as God speaking them into existence in an instant. Christian's book is well researched and organized, but I think it's too academic for the average reader. It's more a biological, anthropological, and geological work than a historical one, so readers of world history may be disappointed or confused - I know I was. My biggest issue with this book is that Christian presents everything as irrefutable, scientific fact when much of it is speculation, guesswork, or his favorite theories. Evolutionary history is constantly being reworked as new discoveries are made and old theories and models are abandoned or updated. Christian acknowledges this from time to time, although it never checks his blithe confidence in his grand narrative. Also, I thought he was far too optimistic about humanity’s progress as a species or about the current state of the world. "
80,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8848293-lindsey,5,"Love the ambition of this book. The brilliant big idea of David Christian's Big History is that it is the relationship of energy, complexity and entropy that defines and determines the story of homo sapiens. That story begins with the big bang, and the trajectory of our species is only understood within the context of an unfolding universe, unleashing the energy that makes possible the fluky Goldilocks lottery ticket that is our planet, the emergence of life, the thin biosphere layering this planet, and the species that emerges and accelerates its own complexity first through collective learning then by tapping into new energy sources. This book will affect you. ""We humans have stumbled into the role of planetary pilots without really knowing what instruments we should be looking at, what buttons we should be pressing, or where we're trying to land. This is new territory for humans, and for the entire biosphere."" And we will require ever more energy to stay ahead of the lurking bad guy in the story, entropy. ""Entropy stands at the finale of all origin stories. It will dissolve away all structures, all shapes, every star and every galaxy and every living cell."" Enjoy!"
81,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1911280-farmwifetwo,3,"I finally quit after about a quarter of the book, I just put it down, forgot about it and the e-library returned it when my 2 weeks were up. Yes, there was more detailed information than what's been on tv, but I have no plans to actually memorize dates and names. Most of the basic information was not new because given a chance I'm one of those who likes to watch the ""real"" science shows (not people running around finding gold or living in Alaska).Therefore, if such things interest you, try it. "
82,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65903752-tejas-sathian,5,"Excellent read - Sapiens with a more sweeping horizon. A simple model for explaining the universe, from its origins until modern civilization: entropy is a tendency that structures fight against, but complex things are hard to maintain and eventually entropy wins; life/society involves harnessing flows of energy to combat entropy and perpetuate.Idea of nothing? Vedas - neither non existence nor existence, leads to ideas of quantum physics that nothing is ever definitively empty.Energy: potential for things to happen. Free (structured) and heat (unstructured). Laws of thermodynamics: 1) energy is conserved 2) things tend toward entropy. Complex objects pay bigger entropy tax and collapse sooner.Big Bang: formation of hydrogen and helium, cooling period. Gravity provides activation energy to overcome electromagnetic repulsion -> protons fuse into helium, energy is released, opposes gravitational compression -> star birth. Star death? Core collapse supernovas release heavy elements; neutron stars / quasars / Black holes / pulsars.Planets and moons form: accretion of elements into forms (violent in case of rocky objects)Life ~ information (rules which limit possibilities). Life fights against entropy - complex adaptive systems. Conditions for life: location in galaxy, right low temperatures, liquids, chemical diversity. Early life : earth as a system. Processes of plate tectonics and life (photosynthesis) regulating climate - thermostats. Prokaryotes (single cells), followed by emergence of eukaryotes (multi cell, able to use oxygen and pass down genes less randomly). Transition from single to multi cell life. Plants, fungi, animals - increased information processing in animals. Waves of extinctions / radiations - driven by changes in earth systems. More complex life needs to process more information —> development of more complex systems (memory, learning) —> concentration of processing areas into brains. Extinction events (KT asteroid) led to proliferation of mammal life (mammals were mostly small so more survived the asteroid impact).Animals pay a brain tax to entropy - brains are expensive to run - but worth it to enable more socialization in larger groups. Language: the butterfly wings that unleashed a tornado. Enables collective learning over time. Evidence of increasing sophistication in hunting / gathering techniques over time. Expansion of humans across world —> destruction of megafauna —> more use of fire.Agriculture: promoting useful species, keeping out non useful ones, form of symbiosis that changes both sides. Harnessing more flows of energy to human purposes (eg using oxen instead of manual labor). Generic but also cultural changes transmitted quickly. Why farming? Abundance —> permanent settlements —> rising populations (more children) to help with cultivation —> higher demand and need for more production from finite land —> reluctant push into farming (early farming life harder than late foraging). Farming communities —> surpluses (diff from foragers - expand into new areas rather than accumulate). Surplus production —> inequality, specialization of labor (not everyone needs to farm, other roles become important), forced extraction of wealth / labor (slavery), hierarchies. Formation of states: power structures capable of exerting control over extensive areas, mobilizing wealth from farming communities and cities (via networks of local lords); best ways to get more wealth are to over exert population and to wage war to take resources. Wealth as ability to channel energy flows (ecological perspective) - energy flows up trophic levels and some is lost; elites as top layer. States ~ organisms, use photosynthetic energy flows, regulated via internal gradients (coercion) - Hobbes perspective of sovereign as artificial man.Agrarian era led to energy bonanza but majority paid in complexity taxes to entropy - only small elite benefited in standard of living. Next threshold: Columbian exchange, first unification of earth since Pangaea (nöosphere), collective learning on planetary scale. Potosi silver —> pesos (first global ccy) —> arbitrage of costs/demand across diff world zones -> trade with Asia. Huge new flows of information channeled through Europe magnified by printing press. Cash nexus : commerce evolved via arbitrage, governments needed to borrow wealth from merchants, merchants harnessed energy flows but couldn’t use coercion so had to innovate.New energy mega innovations: all energy harnessed thus far from sunlight in recent times; population expansion exhausted land and available sources. Next step - energy from sun packed in since early earth eras. Coal, oil; electricity - new way of distributing power (~ ATP / proton pumps).Anthropocene in 3 acts: 1) mid 19th century, fossil fuel led transformation of world / empires built on this foundation. 2) late 19th century, challenges to Britain, world wars, new destructive uses of tech. 3) great acceleration post war into globalization.Governments: In early era just family ties, in agrarian era just mobilizing resources from peasants, in modern era more specialized labor —> more interdependence of people —> greater need for govt involvement in life. War —> need for info about people for conscription —> involvement of more people in business of government —> democracy & nationalism give people stake in government.Fossil revolution bigger than agrarian revolution : agrarian left little surplus energy after paying complexity taxes. Fossil fuel era has improved average human standard of living even after accounting for population growth, complexity taxes."

84,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92381934-jao-bautista,4,"If the evolution of the universe, which kicked off 13.4 billion years ago, were to be put in a 12-month calendar, the humans arrived approximately 100 minutes ago. That’s how late we are to the party.  For Feb’s #1bookamonth I take interest in History. OF EVERYTHING. Yeah, yeah, we’ve all had the high school subject on The Big Bang, and Chemistry and Physics on the reactions and waves and particles, and Biology about the how single-celled organisms evolved, and dinosaurs, and Anthropology, and religion, etcetera, etcetera. But myopic knowledge is precisely the weakness of that “high school” compartmentalized view of the universe, the earth, the life. So, what if you have, yes, still a multidisciplinary approach to our history but in a well-woven tapestry of a single story. Then perhaps you don’t just gain knowledge but instead arrive at an extraordinary understanding of how all these “high school” parts moved together as one, which, in fact, are still moving together as one – allowing for that overwhelming awe and appreciation of life and how incredibly fascinating a dot we are.That’s what author David Christian brings into Origin Story. Being the co-founder of The Big History Project, Christian, uses all the available sciences to make sense of everything: “Today, we humans can tell the story of [our journey] better than before. We can determine with remarkable accuracy what lurks out there, billions of light-years from Earth, as well as what’s going on billions of years ago. We can do this because we have so many more pieces of the jigsaw puzzle of knowledge, which makes it easier to figure out what the whole picture may look like. This is an astonishing, and very recent, achievement.” He compared this perspective to looking at maps, several maps, linking maps, and even putting one map on top of the other. The story of these maps being joined together is the grandest story one could ever imagine. And that’s the thrill of reading this book about a modern origin story – connecting the dots of scientific evidences from across disciplines! Connecting the dots in the book is divided into “thresholds” or significant milestones that marked key transition points from the beginning of the universe to the formation of the solar system to emergence and evolution of life:The connections that exist between the Big Bang energy and the formation of our bones and muscles, connections between atmospheric oxygen level and the movement of tectonic plates underwater (which broke apart Pangaea), the connections between the law of entropy and plants being more nutritious, the connections between big volcanic eruptions and the appearance of the first small organisms, the connections between photosynthesis and humans having a brain, the connections between disorder in the universe and the emergency of legs, the connections between a series of mass extinctions and multicellularity, the connections between environment and the birth of consciousness. And while there is a lot of astrophysics and chemistry and biology and anthropology in connecting the dots, it’s made fun because the dots are accompanied by rich metaphors, colorful personifications, and even funny analogies. At one point he even said that the early evolution of microorganisms was like an overcrowded tourist market where a lousy travelling cell can easily fall into the trap of a swindling pickpocket competing cell. I’m now at 50% in this 300-page non-fic and I like this bit from the current section on the emergence of life in land: “Life had evolved in water for 3 billion years […] Colonizing land was extremely difficult. […] How could organisms reproduce out of water? How could they protect eggs or infants from the terrible fate of dessication. For large organisms, gravity was a problem. They needed bracing from girders of bone or wood if they were to stand up. Once standing, they needed an elaborate plumbing through which liquids could be circulated against gravity to every cell in their bodies. Plants circulated liquids through roots and internal channels, exploiting water’s ability to clamber upward through narrow passages using capillary action. Animals developed special pumps (aka hearts) to circulate liquids and nutrients and remove toxins.” I like how the writing sometimes starts with 10—the big picture—then he lays out elements 1 to 9, then connects the dots between them. This book is about the origin of the universe and its astronomy, and how it paved the way for the origin of the stars and our solar system and how its chemistry paved the way to the origin of our Earth, and how its biology paved the way to the origin of life, and how its anthropology paved the way to the origin of human beings, and how our current systems of economics and philosophies give us a glimpse of where we are headed. Why are we the only ones? Why did life emerge? Why do we seek meaning? These are the big questions we tend to ask. You’ll get some answers to the Whys through the Hows.  As I read through this big story of creation, I cannot help but look at my own process of the creation of The Work I do. I couldn’t help but smile at the thought that it took 200 thousand years of continuously evolving trials and errors before humans (finally) got our current homo sapiens species right and arrive at the party. That’s certainly a different way of looking at the role of failure, don’t you think? #OriginStory#DavidChristian"

For the lay person such as myself, the book provides a really accessible and new perspective in how to consider our existence and the broader context of the universe.

89,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29680013-flora,5,"If anyone's feeling sorry for themselves, try reading up on The Origin Story by David Christian.For those who are remotely interested in world history, perhaps they have come across Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari, which covers the history of humans, as named. However, that's not the full story - not even the marginal story. The Origin Story, then, gives a more comprehensive view of the universe. I have yet to cross any book that covers all disciplines, including: physics, cosmology, astronomy, chemistry, cell biology, geology, microbiology, biochemistry, bioinformatics, history etc.The book tells the history of the world according to the timeline of major events. In accordance to this, the chapters are divided into 9 major thresholds identified by Christian as follows:Threshold #1: Big bang creates the universe (~13.8 billion years ago)Threshold #2: The glow of the first stars (~13.2 billion years ago)Threshold #3: New elements form via dying large stars (Ongoing)Threshold #4: Sun & solar system forms (4.5 billion years ago)Threshold #5: Earliest life forms on Earth (3.8 billion years ago)Threshold #6: First evidence of Homo sapiens (200,000 years ago)Threshold #7: Agriculture revolution (10,000 years ago)Threshold #8: Fossil fuel revolution (200 years ago)Threshold #9 (?): Sustainable, ordered world? (100 years later?)As seen above, the book tackles some of the greatest questions mankind has asked and are worried about. For this reason, Christian does a tremendous job in highlighting the key points that are essential to get a comprehensive understanding of the universe without confusing the heck out of the general, non-science readers.The final chapter, of course, throws out wild ideas about our future: where are we going as a species, especially when it's clear from the timeline that we are going at an exponential speed? Will entropy ultimately breakdown everything? Are we far ahead enough to dodge our own ends that have ended many species before us? What about the fate of the universe?Here is where each question loop into the next and we can only sit and speculate as each pops out. The answer to all of the above is: there are no definite answers. There are too many unknown variables that can lead to infinite, foreseeable possibilities. Or even if there are a handful of things scientists are sure about, such as the ending of our sun, there are unlikely anything we can do to oppose it.It might sound like the book comes to a dark end, but it really isn't.My personal take on the book is to get a grasp of how the universe really operates and how it came to what is seen today. Most importantly, Christian's work highlights the remarkable progress of humankind and, paradoxically, humankind's trivial existence on a grand scale. It is an excellent and philosophical way for us to step back and realize no matter how frustrated, powerful, in control, lost we are about life, humankind thus far is nothing except a minuscule glimmer in the universe.All in all, The Origin Story is a true and concise encyclopedia worth coming back to again and again. And certainly, a work worth teaching to young children for them to get an accurate, comprehensive perspective of the world they live in.full review: https://westofthesunblog.wordpress.co..."
90,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12112515-jefferson,4,"Bracing Micro and Macro Views from a Mountain Top After reading Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant (1885), which focuses mostly on Grant’s experience and understanding of the Civil War, I decided to try a different kind of history, one that casts a wider and more objective view than the history of an individual or a war or a country or an era or a world: David Christian’s Origin Story: A Big History of Everything (2018). Christian teaches history via a series of “thresholds,” critical turning points in the “Big History of Everything,” starting with the Big Bang (13.8 billion years ago), the first stars (13.2 billion years ago), new elements (13.2 billion years ago), and our sun (4.5 billion years ago); working forwards through life on earth (3.8 billion years ago), the first large organisms (600 million years ago), the mass extinction of the dinosaurs (65 million years ago), Homo erectus (2 million years ago), Homo sapiens (200,000 years ago), the first farming (10,000 years ago), the first agrarian civilizations and cities (5,000 years ago), and the Fossil-fuels revolution (200 years ago); and concluding with a look at the future, the death of the sun (4.5 billion years from now) and the darkening of the universe (gazillions of years from now). The last part, speculating on what is likely to happen if we continue our current trend of unsustainable growth, overuse of energy resources, and global warming and the chances of our being able to adopt a more stable and cooperative approach to growth, energy, and the biosphere, etc., is necessary reading. The book as a whole is bracing in its micro and macro visions, for it reminds us of how miraculous life is (dependent on a set of “Goldilocks conditions” or rare perfect chances), how similar and related all organisms are (no matter how different they may superficially seem), and how tiny we and our earth and sun and galaxy are in the larger scheme of things.Throughout, Christian explains complicated concepts simply and engagingly. We learn about how atoms are made, how molecules bond, how prokaryotes and eukaryotes differ, how photosynthesis made an oxygen boom later reined in by respiration, the role played by the molten core of the earth in plate tectonics and the surface temperature of the world, why foraging humans turned to farming and how the biosphere and humanity changed as a result, how erosion cycles carbon back into the earth, what will happen if (when?) the ice of the poles melts, how the fossil fuel revolution came about and how it has changed human civilizations, how stars are born and live and die, how black holes are formed and behave, and more and more and more. The book relates what scientists currently know about such things and how and when they came to know it and who first came to know it, and so on. Sometimes Christian’s view “from a mountaintop instead of from the ground” can almost seem almost too detached when relating things like slavery and the exploitation of indigenous people, but overall it really makes you appreciate the miracle of living on our earth in the universe. Jamie Jackson’s reading of the audiobook is fine."
91,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80750585-claudia,4,"This was a hard book to get started with - not because it wasn't well-written (it really is) but in the depths of the newly formed universe after the Big Bang, all the activity is on the sub-atomic scale and electrons jumping the atomic ship for another atom gets - well, boring. Forcing the original atom to bond with another atom with an open electron position which starts the whole chemistry of very small into the very large.Mr. Christian does have an amusing way of describing things that would make the complex more accessible to the general public. The one I like best was the difference between free energy - a pack of prowling cats working together (order) - and heat energy - a drunken traffic cop (chaos).At each level, Mr. Christian starts with the small and builds upon that - the atomic particles that merge and merge again eventually leading to larger and larger clumps of gas that lead to stars, galaxies and beyond. Then back at the smaller level - the bonds yielding solid clumps that aggregate into asteroids, planetoids, moons and planets.Focusing on the Earth has it begins to cool, the development of the magnetic field as the core begins to spin. The gas released which eventually became our atmosphere even as it underwent several changes. The moving of mantle plates making and unmaking continents. Water and the oceans. The first chemicals that came together yielding the one-celled organisms. Development of specialization leading to genes, energy utilization (photosynthesis) and more. More complexity of organisms - bacteria, viruses, algae, plants, animals and then humans.The entire book seems to be about the flow of energy be it across the infinitesimal gradient between proton and electron or the energy stored in food, skills, resources and knowledge demanded by specialists in human society [foragers to farmers up through levels to rulers]. Basically, the Anthropocene Age - which is the age of humans - is one of violence. The inventions of fossil-fuel technologies to assist in humanity's energy needs in turn, promoted the overwriting of native culture and life by European invasion and mistaken 'superiority'. Rivalries in economic and political markets lead to devastating battles that drag other parts of the world into brutal warfare. Recently, the Anthropocene Age is also about transformation - biosphere, government, society. Fewer living below the subsistence level. Biodiversity dying at incredible rates. The inequality gap widening between the 'wealthy' and non-elite. It is interesting that the first warnings of climate change came in 1898 and was considered a position development as it would stave off an ice age.The last chapter is about the future of the Anthropocene Age - whether we will crash into possible extinction or continue taking advantage of opportunity and determination, closing in on mythic utopia. Entropy was part of the beginning of the universe and it is waiting at the end of the story. Everything - every part of every atom - in the universe will dissolve into nothing. All entropy has to do is wait."
92,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77242071-david-cook,4,"I first heard about this book from a list of books recommended by Bill Gates. I thought well Bill Gates is a smart guy so I took his recommendation serious and read the book. At first I thought it would be a bit like Bill Bryson's ""A Short History of Nearly Everything."" Well it is only in the sense that it distills a ton of information and since into a readable and understandable format for the technologically challenged. A great read. What follows is Bill Gates commentary on the book. ""We all have an origin story. In some societies, they manifest as creation myths. In others, they look more like history textbooks. For example, as a kid in the United States, I grew up learning about the group of rebels who stood up to their British overlords and founded our country. It’s human nature to be curious about where we come from, and origin stories unite people through a common history and shared sense of purpose.But what if all of humanity shared an origin story? What would that story look like? Historian David Christian tries to answer those questions in his new book Origin Story.As the creator of Big History—my favorite course of all time—David is well-suited to write about how we came to be. Big History tells the story of the universe from the big bang to the first signs of life to today’s complex societies. It shows how everything is connected to everything else, weaving together insights and evidence from across disciplines into a single, understandable narrative.Origin Story is essentially the Big History course condensed into a short book. It divides 13.8 billion years of existence into what David calls “thresholds”—moments in history that mark key transition points, like the formation of our solar system and the first appearance of early humans. The chapters about the early thresholds are heavy on physics and chemistry, but it skews more towards biology and anthropology as single cell life evolves into more complex beings.If you haven’t taken Big History, Origin Story introduces you to its concepts in a straightforward, understandable way. David is a very good writer, and he has a way of making complicated subjects fun. If you’re already a Big Historian, Origin Story is a great refresher. It does a fantastic job distilling the latest thinking about the origins of the universe. I learned some things that are simply too new to be included in the course.The book ends with a chapter on where humanity—and the universe—is headed. David is more pessimistic about the future than I am. He gets a little stuck on the current economic and political malaise happening in the West, and I wish he talked more about the role innovation will play in preventing the worst effects of climate change. But he nails the importance of this moment in history: “Things are happening so fast that, like the slow-motion time of a near accident, the details of what we do in the next few decades will have huge consequences for us and for the biosphere on scales of thousands of years. Like it or not, we are now managing an entire biosphere, and we can do it well or badly.”Understanding where humanity comes from is crucial to shaping where we go next. Origin Story is an up-to-date history of everything that will leave you with a greater appreciation of our place in the universe.""Favorite Quotes:""The first states were a new phenomenon in human history. They all assumed the right to mobilize wealth from farming communities, towns, and cities in return for some degree of protection. As the English political theorist Thomas Hobbes wrote in Leviathan (1651), the right to distribute resources “belongeth in all kinds of Common-wealth, to the Soveraign power. For where there is no Common-wealth, there is… a perpetual warre of every man against his neighbor.” Traditional elites owed their power, in part, to the intrinsic weakness and isolation of traditional farming communities.” ""But there can be no common peace and prosperity without common historical ideas.… With nothing but narrow, selfish, and conflicting nationalist traditions, races and peoples are bound to drift towards conflict and destruction.”"
93,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37912141-willy-xiao,4,"This book introduced me to the topic of Big History.Striking to me, unlike many of say Carl Sagan's or Stephen Hawking's grand history / theory books, this subject (it IS a subject taught in schools) focuses less on the science of the origin story, but more on the fact that it IS an origin story. It weaves everything from the big bang to the development of the internet together and makes it a single, digestable narrative. It aspires to replace factional origin stories from religions across human history that emerged when humans were less connected.Here are a couple of important themes through the book:- As best we know, increasing entropy is a fundamental fact of existence and it will eventually consume the universe.- The existence of seemingly more complex structures (higher-order atoms to planets to cells to eukaryotes to humans to agrarian societies to cities) are actually incredible machines of increasing entropy: overall, humans are MORE EFFICIENT at breaking down structure into entropy than primordial soup (which really makes you philosophically consider what ""sustainability"" really means).- At each ""level"" of structure and complexity (big bang, atoms, planets etc.,), there are goldilocks conditions that allowed it to develop.- The core differentiator of humans over other structures is our ability to do ""collective learning"" because of language and information-sharing.Though I'm sure it's different for others, I found the beginning half of the book (pre-human) to be rather dry, though I appreciated certain narrative elements of it. For example, the introduction of the book beautifully creates a solidarity between humans now and those of 40,000 years ago attempting to tell origin stories. And there are passages that personify neutrons and protons.As an origin story, it has strong explanatory power, but it's weak on answering questions of purpose and morality of humanity: even if it's true, can this origin story *drive* humans? Can it provide meaning to the day-to-day grind of existence and labor in the same way that other origin stories can?Because the key insight of this topic is again less the technical details (it's not arguing that this story is CORRECT), but more of the narrative (the fact of weaving this big-bang and entropy origin story together): I would've loved to see more beautiful stories rather than technical - more of Carl Sagan's ""Pale Blue Dot"" type of feeling and less of Carl Sagan's ""Model-Dependent Realism"" type of analysis."
94,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11898448-bev-simpson,5,"A most interesting read. David Christian takes us gracefully through what is called Big History, defined as ""the attempt to understand, in a unified way, the history of Cosmos, Earth, Life and Humanity."" Big History is a project funded by Bill Gates with Christian who is a professor of History at Macquarie and an elegant and interesting writer. Big History, in my understanding, is basically what is known about just about everything from the earliest days of the Cosmos, though early humans and their societies, Homo Sapiens and our evolution and impact on the earth, through to today and the possible futures that may lie ahead. Christian describes it as a unified history of humanity. He is an excellent story-teller, with a very good sense of where to go deeper, and where to let things lie. For example, I now understand entropy much better than I ever have before – it's likely there will be a blog in the coming days on entropy, organizations and leadership.What seems most fascinating is the idea, expressed in the early pages of the book, of a unifying knowledge, that all of humanity shares an emerging global origin story, that there can be no peace on earth unless we see ourselves as a human society, as a global village, all with a place in the universe, and not a series of tribes ready to go to war with each other, that our nationalistic pride will undo us as a human species if we aren’t able to build a strong sense of togetherness, that we have a common story in progress and we, as a human species, will dictate how the story progresses or ends.David Christian explores 8 different thresholds or moments of significant transition, each of which has increased the complexity of the story and introduced new emergent properties. As a student of complexity and complex adaptive systems, I was most intrigued by this approach. He writes ""Even harder to grasp is the staggering increase in the complexity of modern societies, the way every detail of your life is enmeshed in networks involving millions of other people who supply food and employment, healthcare, education, electricity, the fuel for your car, the clothes you wear. Each of these chains of interconnection may include thousands or millions of other humans linked together in networks of fabulous complexity."""
95,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24870603-jan,3,"For a long time I've been interested in the contrast between small history and big history. The interactions of a large number of individuals, all living their individual lives in a networked society, somehow lead to the rise and fall of civilizations. There's a detailed description in terms of motives and actions at the level of individuals (and another, even more reductionist one at the level of neurons or even molecules), and a broad, holistic one at an emergent level of the history of war and peace, the story of nations. The former is very unpredictable, but can be considered as quite random at the emergent level, at which more order and certain patterns can be found. The patterns do not resemble the laws of nature, as many 19th century historians thought, but the laws of complex systems. Big history is a complex system, like an organism, or a colony of eusocial insects. In fact all life on earth can be considered as a planetary ecosystem or even organism that evolves over time. At this aggregated level, the level of this book, different kinds of description become possible and useful, such as that life evolves to use information to increasingly and more efficiently use energy gradients to power a metabolic process that creates more diverse and complex forms to manifest itself on a wider and wider scale, possibly into the galaxy and the rest of the universe in the far future.Origin Story is about cosmology, physics, chemistry, biology and history. It defines 8 thresholds, or big steps, that the universe has taken in its evolution. From the Big Bang to stars, planets and molecules, life, the biosphere, the agricultural and industrial revolutions to the anthropocene and knowledge and technology. That's history on its largest scale. For people unfamiliar with such an approach this book is a very good starter. On the other hand, people who are familiar with it won't find much that is new.The ideas of Teilhard de Chardin are easily recognized in the book (although he's not mentioned by name). He was one of the first to take this big history perspective and coined the term noosphere: a sphere of cultural evolution, of knowledge and understanding or global mind on top of the geosphere and the biosphere. Teilhard's ideas have been much reviled by reductionist orthodoxy, but are making a well-deserved comeback."
96,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71017893-luanne-feik,4,"Based on the Big History Project developed by the author, David Christian, and Bill Gates, the most stimulating book I've read in a long time. Instead of viewing all academic disciplines as separate areas of study, Big History was designed to fit science and the humanities together into a coherent story. In the 13th century, St. Thomas Aquinas introduced a similar concept, when he described the role of a university. Unlike Christian, however, St. Thomas included theology in the mix.Readers will note how difficult it is to explain the origin of the universe without God. The author, like Stephen Hawking, Charles Darwin, and other scientists, struggles with the task. Christian explains why ""(M)odern science can find no direct evidence for a god."" No experiment can replicate a finding of god. Of course not. There can be only one God, not a series of recreated gods. Hawking claims ""what existed before the universe is like looking for a starting point on the surface of a tennis ball."" Darwin became frustrated when he explained evolution began with ""four or five cells floating in a warm pool somewhere,"" and one student asked where the cells came from?Christian uses the big bang as the origin of his story. No one need believe God plopped every readymade star, planet, beast, plant, and early human into the universe He created. Far more likely, and logical, the creative and imaginative God initiated the universe-forming big bang that Christian credits Belgian Catholic priest, Georges Lemaitre, for theorizing in the early 1930s. After the big bang, no one has created something from nothing. Christian quotes the Aboriginal saying, ""nothing is entirely nothing,"" and continues ""You can never say for sure that a particular region of space is empty...."" What Christian does extremely well is divide history into what he calls ""Goldilocks conditions"" with just the right factors, like that of Baby Bear's porridge, for transitions to, or thresholds of, new complex evolutionary changes. Reading about 13.8 billion years of history in 305 pages is, at times, difficult but never boring. The book' s glossary of words from ""absorption lines"" to ""world zone"" provides non-scientists with help understanding ""genome,"" ""quark,"" and other scientific terms."
97,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83179136-catherine-puma,4,"This much-needed premise is well structured and executed in a thoughtful conversational style that makes the resulting book a lovely read. Because David Christian proposes a refreshing framework for discussing human history within a geological context, his introductory chapter is the most crucial section to read. Christian lays out his plan and clearly states how he has chosen to move through time while touching upon key inflection points. While the Executive Summary prepares readers to understand the road map for his books' journey, Christian's quality writing and the interesting facts we encounter along the way are elements which make this journey an enjoyable one. Starting with the Big Bang, as all things do, ""Origin Story"" discusses what we know about how our universe, solar system, planet, and early forms of life developed. The narrative gets a little more detailed while explaining how human societies expanded in coordination as harnessing energy through agricultural practices allowed faster dissemination of information. There is a bit of a speed through of human history between early agriculture and the World Wars/Industrial Revolution, which is why I say this is a 4.5/5 kind of read, but I understand that a project of this scale obviously isn't going to be able to cover everything. The speculative pondering of what the future might bring was interesting. More importantly, hypotheses about the future do not take up more than a chapter in this book, so the main focus of the narrative is still on describing what we do know about our world's history. What I appreciated most about this work was its interweaving of disciplines to create a more holistic view of where we have come from and why our world is the way it is today. This includes content from: geology, physics, history, biology, sociology, anthropology, politics, and economics. While I knew much of the facts that are mentioned, the new viewpoint from which they are discussed makes this book unique. I would recommend this to scientists, researchers, historians, policymakers, natural resource managers, entrepreneurs, members of the United Nations, and the general public alike. Definitely for all those seeking to understand our past in order to create a better future for us all. "
98,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116100711-samuele-bergamini,2,"Simplification, pattern-recognition. Some of the things humans seem to like most. This book, like all-knowing religious gurus, should therefore be appealing to the lot of us, at least in theory. It analyzes history and breaks it down into simple narrative blocks that should - still in theory - be helpful for making sense of ourselves and push us toward better futures.But simplification and pattern recognition are always, because of their own nature, accompanied by cognitive bias, generalizations and logical fallacies. I get it, being impartial is hard. But in my view, this book suffers from way too many of those cognitive biases. The author seems to intentionally (?) omit opposing data whilst reinforcing convenient evidence in order to suit his agenda. Instead of analyzing history, it feels like the book is viewing history through specific lenses, and constantly making a case for itself; it doesn't analyze bottom up, but rather, top down, attempting to make sense of things starting from preconceived notions. It does so specifically in the latter part of the book, where anthropological and sociological examinations take over and scientific discourse diminishes, that's where the book falls prey to political and philosophical ideologies. The first part was mildly interesting, though it doesn't in my opinion cover the history of the universe as well as, let's say, other similar books such as: ""Universal"" by Cox and Forshaw.But I generally have no problem with the science presented in this book, that albeit a bit boring, is sufficiently precise (origin of cosmos and life, Climate change...). I critique this book badly for the mere fact that it presents itself like a bible of ethics, of what humans ARE (and there's no questioning), what they SHOULD BE (and there is no questioning). It ""teaches"" right and wrong under the pretext of historical analysis; and I suppose it is self evident to recognize where such analysis lacks. The book kicks off with the presentation of a very solid ethical ""mission"": that is, in my opinion, the first mistake any careful analyzer of history should avoid.An otherwise good book, especially for who has never read any other book on the topic."

Reading this book was a bit of a lark in that I have a natural aversion to science. It’s not that I don’t like science, or that science doesn’t like me, but rather, my brain is singularly incapable of understanding all but the most superficial elements of it. Because the publisher described Christian’s book as “A captivating history of the [entire] universe - from before the dawn of time through the far reaches of the distant future,” I was fairly confident it HAD to be superficial. Sadly, there was far more detail than I was looking for, but nonetheless, the book was pleasantly engaging. The book begins at the beginning of time—-an admittedly human construct—-initially describing The Big Bang, and then proceeding to the present where (when) the earth’s human inhabitants are rapidly changing the biosphere in ways that may doom mankind. (NOTE: As I continue to plow through Will Durant’s 11 volume History of Civilization, it was refreshing to read an expansive history largely devoid of battles, artists, murder, religion, intrigue, and lust.) The author describes the latest theories of the cosmos, including the creation of matter and the miracle of life. And by miracle, I don’t mean the product of wizardry, but rather the sheer odds against a speck in the universe having conditions that both induced and sustained what we know as carbon-based life forms. Of course, there is no big reveal about why the universe happened to be: he doesn’t even speculate about that. But the author does describe the relatively short history of life on earth, and describes how an even briefer existence of human life is leading to a potentially dire eventuality. But the fun is in reading about how everything came about, a tapestry of physics, astrobiology, archaeology, molecular biology, economics, ecology, chemistry, societal history, and other disciplines. Students of science will surely understand far more of this book than did I, but I can honestly say that my ignorance did not keep me from enjoying it."
100,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3511968-jordan,5,"I love this book, and the weaving together so many different sciences to understand the story of existence from the big bang until now. I'm impressed and inspired, and would recommend this to anyone. It's a beautiful integration and gives us a few of what it means to be human and inherit a 13.7 billion year history.The only things I didn't like are:(1) Painting entropy as the villain... it seems strange to a tell a story of unrelenting increases of complexity and keep trying to fit it into entropy. Yes, when you cut off a part of the universe and put it into a box for some time, disorder increases. But it seems like people forget that they cut off part of the universe to put it in a box, and pretend that somehow this is an objective measure that doesn't include the researcher. The whole story of Big History is one in which if you look at any larger time scales, when left to its own devices, the universe produces novel forms of complexity, order and ""emergent properties"" as Christian says.(2) Similarly the last bit suddenly switched to a PSA on climate change which felt strange given how part of the book talks about how drastically different climates have been over 4.5 billion years, and how different thermostats continuously evolve (although of course they usually go through very long and very rough periods of mass extinction). I think we should invest in renewable energy and protect reefs and many other things, but I think we have to be clear that we're choosing to do that because we value the Earth and biodiversity and the climate we have now, not because there's some standard that the Earth has... if anything, this book shows how dramatically wild the changes have been on this planet over so many years, and our entire species is such a tiny blip on the screen of Earth's history, timewise, and this 10,000 years of climate stability an even smaller blip.Pardon the rant, the book is amazing and inspiring, it's just that I just read the last chapter and a half and I felt they went afield and lost the ""Origin Story"" that the rest of the book so beautiful outlines."

Chance then rearranged things randomly from the possibilities that remained. This is how it all works.

I bought and read it primarily because I was interested in how Christian's narrative on the future might have changed since his lecture series was recorded, specifically with respect to the impact of artificial intelligence on the next 100 years of human life. And I wasn't entirely let down - he at least mentions the looming influences of genomics, materials science, and information processing technologies on the human future, but only in brief, and, at least in my opinion, without a clear grasp of how these technologies can cause fundamental change. I suppose an intense analysis of the future of humanity is not what everyone comes looking for when they pick up a book titled ""Origin Story"", but I was hoping that Christian might take a look at some of the arguments posed by Harari, Tegmark, Bolstrom, and the like, in the context of Big History and the telling of the human origin story. Besides a kind of lackluster review of future scenarios (which was not really all that lackluster, just compared to my expectations), the book was excellent. There have been a few updates, especially to the dates of the human story, since the publication of his lecture series, which demonstrates how much progress the fields of anthropology and paleontology have achieved in just the past decade+. Origin Story is obviously far more concise than the Great Courses lectures, and much information gets left out, particularly in his telling of the history of early civilizations, which I found one of the most interesting elements of the lecture series. That said, I'd still recommend both works, and I plan to dig into ""Maps of Time"" as well in the near future. "

Emergence of agriculture - accelerate the change	8. Modern revolution The story goes:	• From cosmos to chaos, entropy (disorder or simplicity) increases (distribution of energy evens out over time)	• The amount of available energy (which is the uneven distribution of it) to do the work, or free energy, diminishes on a universe level	• Without the energy, order diminishes (like a room of a teenager)	• How the upper level of complexity increase then?	• Locally, the differentials of energy increase.

Origin Story reads in very much the same way. As entertaining as it was informative, I found myself introspecting a lot more while reading this book than I did with Sapiens. The best part about reading this book was observing the change of perspective of my self-reflections over the course of the story. I did not think the book would be as philosophical as it turned out to be and that was a welcome surprise. Starting out by tracing our origin story to 13.8 billion years ago does tend to make one feel quite insignificant. Trying to fathom the physics of our collective beginning while humbling, is somehow so well surmised by: ""In the beginning, there was nothing, which exploded."" Faced with this startling insignificance, I couldn't help but feel as if there was little reason or meaning to my existence. After all, even if I live to 100 years old, my life in the universe would be just a quick burst of energy much like that one spark from a lighter than never ends up igniting a flame.And yet the very fact that this spark of energy can ponder about the meaning of life is a wonder in itself. Indeed the motivation to search for meaning has its roots in primitive survival instincts. Seeking certain outcomes (procreation) and avoiding others (death) could be the very beginnings of meaning. Our existential search for meaning is just the natural progression from ""What is the meaning of this great white shark cruising behind me?"".By the end of the book, rather than feeling hopeless about my place in the history of our universe, I felt quite the opposite. Our origin story takes some interesting turns and as it will turn out, we have a much bigger role to play in history of the universe than we may think."

That being said it is unusual to come across a book such as David Christian's which it is difficult to criticise in any way. Indeed, my only quibble is that the title 'Origin Story' did not prepare me for the all-encompassing tour of the universe and all it contains on which I would embark. 'Big History' starts with the 'Big Bang', moves on to the creation of galaxies of stars, explains the creation of planets and in particular earth; then we learn about the early geology of earth, and the tectonic plates that the continents and oceans rest on. The first life - single-celled organisms - is described and how these gave birth to multi-celled organisms, and then on through evolution to homo sapiens and our place in the universe.Of course, I have over-summarised the contents and readers hoping to come up close to DNA, for example, will not be disappointed, nor will those hoping to understand how we moved from foragers to agrarians to city dwellers. What makes this book special is not so much the contents - fascinating as those are - as the wonderfully lucid explanations of such a wide-ranging list of topics; Christian is as much at home talking about the birth of elements in the dying gyrations of stars as he is describing the developments of human civilisation. Of course, the nature of the book demands close reading - nobody ever said that Quantum theory was easy to follow - but is an effort rewarded by fascinating glimpses of intriguing phenomena that may lead a reader to delve more deeply in more specialised books.This is a book that can profitably read by anyone and I heartily recommend it."
106,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24334740-april,5,"That animation that starts inside an atom and then zooms out to molecules, cells, organisms, streets, the globe, etc. until the Milky Way seems as small as an atom? That's what this book feels like, with both size and time. There's nothing especially new about the information itself, but rather the way the information is scaled and synthesized into an overall narrative.The integration of just about every discipline-- astrophysics, chemistry, biology, economics, sociology, anthropology, history, and so many more-- into an overall narrative of the universe, the world, and humans provides a perspective rarely gleaned even for people with a working knowledge of each. Christian uses the language of one to describe and consider another, connecting things that don't intuitively work the same way.It truly is an origin story that stretches into the future, but it purposefully strays from capital-m Meaning for the vast majority of the text. If a reader expects an origin story to provide that, it may come incidentally with an idea of how each person fits into the grand scheme of everything, but it does not obviously impart social, moral, or theological wisdom. Instead, in the final chapter, it proposes possible outcomes for secular global decision making that is both rational and moral.Rather than providing a lot of new knowledge, this book provided me a new perspective and framework for the knowledge. This is an accessible read for just about anyone, as the technical discussions remain relatively superficial throughout. This is definitely breadth over depth, which isn't always my preference, but is a necessary respite or foundation."
107,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,5,"David Christian should be christened the father of Big History. In this book, he shows what a perfect Big History book should be.Unlike many other popular big history books, Origin Story simply focuses on how we got to today from the big bang moment based on all the knowledge from various, vastly different fields that exists today. This is a remarkably well-written book, with almost no word wasted. At every point, Prof Christian has novel takes on the usual scientific concepts to generate completely new level of understanding, particularly from the viewpoint of fathoming our reality and its evolution. These aha moments, that repeatedly spring from nowhere, would make the book a must-read even for those that have read dozens of good popular science books. Yet, the book is about anything but.As the title says, the book is a story from our origin to now. Professor spends no more time than needed on explaining the theories as he moves along on the story of various evolutions. The story is well laid out and explanations are never onerous. Once again, this is a book on our evolution and not about any theories or scientists. This means, there is little effort wasted on theories that have been discarded or are not necessary. This is a refreshing change compared to almost all the other books out there that spend far too much time on the scientific personalities, the process of discoveries, various counter-theories, including theories that proved wrong or inadequate. For example, this book does not feel the need to elaborate on mythical origin stories and prove why they were wrong, or on lives (or key moments) of any Einsteins or Darwins. Rather, the book provides a definitive tale of how we got here from the moment when it all started. The author is fully aware that existing knowledge repertoire on which this account is based will be updated over time, and along with it our Big History narrative, but that does not distract him into seeding needless doubts. Big History is a great invention: under its guise, humanity creates a comprehensive scientific account of our evolution without worrying about where the underlying knowledge comes from. This book shows the best way of writing such a history."
108,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24847694-timo,3,"I think the author has the right idea; in fact, this is the very project I'm working on (storyofexistence.com).However, and perhaps this is a result of his ""big history"" focus, he still thinks humanity can become one tribe. That we'll all believe and follow the same stories, hold the same values, practice the same rituals. But in his very story is the key to why this cannot happen.Humans are the only species that has transcended the biological designation of species. Variation has created different forms of humans, and they believe and live differently from the past, others in the present, and others yet to come. Humanism, of which the author seems to be a proponent, fell in love with the idea that we can live without difference, division. Undifferentiated. But we are finite beings. We evolved in small, finite ways. To tell me that I must love all is to render the concept of love meaningless.Additionally, the author anchors his entire story to the progress of power/energy. As though this is what matters, human discovery, consumption and management of energy. This is the story he wants humans to look to? What about purpose and meaning and love? In his zeal to go big, he loses sight of the small. The one. The only measurement that matters. All perspective is singular, and meaning only resides in the one. Energy consumption is not a compelling reason to live.That said...this book will become a part of the cannon for my own project, as it gives a fairly interesting 30,000 foot view of the species."
109,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85650519-cristian-cuna,4,"The book relates a high-level history, not only of the human species but of the entire universe. It features the human need of having an origin story and why the past & existing ones no longer meet all the required criteria.The beginning of the story, is the beginning of the universe itself, the Big Bang, describing the period reaching from the immediate moments to the immediate millions of years, describing the formation of stars and other space bodies.Then, the next chapter consists of the planet Earth's creation and the events that led to its current state. Following this, a description of all the mechanism that keep the living parameters under control is detailed. The appearance of life and it's evolution comes next, the booking focusing on major turning points in terms of life structure and external events that influenced it. The evolution of life culminates with the arrival of the human species and its development is followed from the small settlements of maximum 150 persons to today's cities. Personally, I found this part the most intersecting one as David Christian presents how the need of energy led to various inventions and how they impacted the human lifestyle and the planet as a whole.The following chapter consists of an analysis of the environmental impact of the human species, the damage that has been caused and how the modern world tries to fix it. Then, the last piece of the story is represented by the future and what it has reserved for humans, for the planet Earth, and for the entire universe."
110,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5853504-will-staton,4,"Misplaced for a few months, and so there was quite a gap between my reading of the first 70% of the book and the final 30%. Nevertheless, the narrative arch was well told and sticks in my mind. Christian steps as far back as possible to give an eagle-eyed view of universal evolution and how we - humanity - are but a small - and from the universe's perspective, meaningless - part of it. Nevertheless, we must tell our origin story, we always have, and Christian tells an epic, eloquent, and evidence-based story that roots our narrative in our current understanding of the universe while acknowledging how our limited understanding may - perhaps will - cause our origin story to change again as we learn more, just as it has changed from a myth of creation to a scientific explanation of an evolving cosmos. In zooming out so far to focus on the evolutionary epic, Christian is forced to reengage with the micro-level details to inform the story, and in doing so he is able to explain how humanity fits neatly into this narrative, biologically, chemically, etc and how though we are able to shape the contours of our world and our future, we are ultimately subject to the indifferent laws that govern the universe and within whose confines we operate, our abilities more a projection of our self-importance than an ability to bend these laws. Overall a very thoughtful and informative read that forces the reader to step back and think on the biggest picture imaginable and at a scale that is often unimaginable. Well worth it. "
111,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47306300-jim-heninger,4,"Thank you David Christian! Up until now, my knowledge of the scientific history of the world and the universe has been based on grade school text books - and countless hours doing, no sorry, “helping” my kids with their science and social homework. Whereas my view and understanding of these subjects has been broad, it has also been disjointed through a kaleidoscope of sources directed at grade schooler mentality.I imagine the other extreme way of researching this topic might have been a post secondary look at texts written for university students bent on cramming for final exams - mixed in with formulae and complexity and way too much math. How refreshing to have David Christian who has organized the subject into a reading length of a novel - interesting enough to keep my attention - long enough to provide meaningful understanding, and most importantly appropriately thorough — creating a refreshing perspective of the big picture of world, universe and mankind. The book is appropriately secular, not touching much on religious or spiritual aspects of the universe/world/human big picture - and so I feel that there is a large missing piece to the puzzle therein to be considered and studied elsewhere by the reader. Don’t get me wrong - Since decision making for mankind and the world for better or worse will hinge on spiritual beliefs of the masses - a big picture understanding of what drives the human soul demands further consideration - but better left to other texts. 600 pages was just enough. "
112,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31584402-mbogo-j,4,"David Christian set a lofty task for himself; to write a big history of everything. He did a good job at bringing together the current intellectual ""consensus"" on our origin story, all the way from year 0 to the current periods of the early 21st century. Anyone looking for the zeitgeist on the origin story will do themselves some good by reading this book.Unfortunately for the span covered, some penalty had to be paid and it was detail. The book was mostly an overview, high level brush strokes that showed us the origin sketch but was bereft of detail to paint the origin picture. I cannot blame David for this because that is the only way he could produce a readable book rather than a behemoth that will be neatly packed at some back corner in the library.I will also call him out on the failure to warn the readers that most of the story touted as the origin especially before the Sumerian Civilization is very speculative. David wrote it as if it was an incontestable fact when most of these stories are a matter of fashion. If this book had been written a few years back the Miller- Urey hypothesis would have been the primary story of how organisms came to be, recently it has lost ground to the hydrothermal vents hypothesis that now the latter is being fronted as our new ""origin"" story. Who knows what will be in fashion in the coming decade? David should have warned his readers. Still it was a good book and a good starter to anyone interested in the origin story."
113,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1002150-jamie,0,"This book wasn't on my radar, but showed up as an Audible Daily Deal, so I decided to give it a try. Despite its subtitle, the book is not that big in size, but nearly infinite in scope, beginning with the birth of the universe and sweeping through what scientists believe will be its presumed death, a period that covers hundreds of billions of years. This dash through the cosmos slows briefly to examine the evolution of life on earth and the development of civilization.Christian borrows the notion of projecting the history of the universe on a calendar--in this case, 13 billion years of history projected onto a 13 year calendar. Much of the book is a rehash of what's covered in Cosmos and A Short History of Nearly Everything. However, Christian brings up up-to-date on many topics. For instance, when I took AP biology in high school (way back in the mid-1980s) the topmost level of classification was the ""kingdom."" I learned in this book that is no longer the case: ""Domain"" has succeeded kingdom for the top spot, with three domains of life defined by scientists today.There is a focus on the economics of energy with respect to life that I found fascinating. It was an angle to history and biology that I had never seen presented before and it rears its head throughout the boo.While I didn't think Christian's examples and illustrations were as illuminating or humorous as Sagan's or Bryson's, I found the book to be a good, quick layperson's refresher on the current state of modern cosmology and our place in it."
114,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5027617-jeffrey-howard,4,"A fantastic overview of the physical sciences. Compelling in the way Cosmos is, reminiscent of the awe reflected by Carl Sagan in ""The Pale Blue Dot."" Considering myself underinformed about many of the natural sciences, much of the astrophysics and biochemistry will require repetition before I can retain it. Regardless, David Christian provides an excellent story of the universe's origins, bringing us all the way up to our current ecological crisis. We are on a dire trajectory. The book has caused me to make some significant lifestyle changes (which I wasn't expecting to when I picked up this book). Each of us is complicit in this great extinction of life (complex energy flows). I appreciate that I have a new framework for understanding the word, seeing life as energy flows and complex information in constant wrestles against entropy. Which, honestly, are mere scientific terms for the narratives we find in the humanities, specifically within myth and classic literature. (I was tickled when Christian began the book with a quote from Joseph Campbell, and again delighted when he later returned to Campbell.)Narratives are in our nature, even as complex energy flows. I recommend this to anybody looking to become more scientifically literate without becoming lost in the weeds: a welcome gift for many of my friends in the humanities and social sciences who have been siloed off from the ""hard"" sciences. "
115,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/331426-lindsey,3,"I wanted more from this book. I should have known when I was getting into when I approached it, because it really does cover the ""big history"" of our world. I thrive on details, see, and the details I got were not enough to make me fly through this book. I hesitate to say that I found it dry, but as someone who struggles to wrap her brain around certain scientific principles, it was... a lot of science. Atoms and energy and chemicals and lots of numbers.The content seemed front-heavy, and it rushed through humanity's contributions through history, but I think this was deliberate. After all, we're quite young in our universe.Every once in a while a brilliant quote would stand out and I found myself highlighting passages for future research. Certain things have never occurred to me. The smell of forest fires will never be detected on other planets in our solar system because ""they lack the high oxygen levels and the woody fuel sources needed for the propagation of fire."" It's such a small thing, but imagine never smelling woodsmoke!And the following quote is a pretty decent explanation of why I'm an agonistic: ""If a god is powerful enough to design a universe, that god must surely be more complex than the universe, so assuming a creator god means explaining a fantastically complex universe by imagining something even more complex that just... created it."""
116,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7290312-sumit,4,"This book has an ambitious scope, aiming to cover 46 billion years of history, from the big bang to the near future. Unfortunately, it is inconsistent in narrative coherence, with some sections gripping the reader with a fascinating story of science or history, and others reading like lists of related facts and discoveries. That said, I feel I learned a great deal from this book - sometimes as big picture ideas about the development of modern society, sometimes as minor facts or trivia. I was most captivated by the description of how society moved from foraging to agrarian to modern systems of trade, following remarkably similar patterns in different regions, with some succeeding (often violently) over others by virtue of advantages/discoveries that were often mere chance, or more a product of environmental necessity than inherent superiority (unlike, say, certain more racist takes on European dominance that are surprisingly popular amongst Americans). I also found the discussion of the big bang and expanding universe theory to be better than most lay versions I've seen; it answered some questions I've had about why the other theories were discarded. Overall, It's a book I'd recommend, though I'll caution there are times it drags on - the audiobook is a good option, in that it will keep going even when the going gets dull, which it regularly does."
117,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23021370-gregory,3,"As much as I really wanted to like this book, I left a little underwhelmed. In the author's defense, an inherent difficulty in writing about ""big history"" is the sheer vastness of the scope of your subject. It can therefore be difficult to go into depth in certain areas without filling up multiple volumes. Still, the author does a great job of laying out the basics of cosmology, cell biology, and the beginnings of the human species in a way that is lucid and informative to someone who has no familiarity with these subjects. However, if this not your first book on these subjects, you may find the author's discussions a bit elementary.I did appreciate the author's perspective of history in the context of entropy and enjoyed his analogy of an ""entropy tax"". Understanding how complexity is able to evolve even in the context of the 2nd law of thermodynamics is something that every educated person ought to have at least a cursory grasp of.Unfortunately, the author does not hold a high view of modern human society and can come off a bit misanthropic at times. I appreciated his perspective but did not agree with it, but I cannot deny that I came away from reading this book pondering some deep questions.Overall, I recommend this book to anyone looking to gain a basic level of science education over a broad swath of subjects."
118,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84077430-eugene-evenwel,5,"I genuinely feel grateful for having this book, published so recently (2018), cross my path so early after it’s release. It’s a remarkable history of everything divided into eight fundamental thresholds:Threshold 1—Origins of Big Bang CosmologyThreshold 2—The First Stars and GalaxiesThreshold 3—Making Chemical ElementsThreshold 4—The Earth and the Solar SystemThreshold 5—LifeThreshold 6—What Makes Humans Different?Threshold 7—AgricultureThreshold 8—The Modern RevolutionThe term “Big History” is coined, discussing a vast range of events panning from the very first moments after the big bang, right up until last Thursday. This book also inspired me to take The Big History Project Course (https://www.bighistoryproject.com/home), a joint effort between teachers, scholars, scientists, and their supporters to bring a multi-disciplinary approach to knowledge to lifelong learners around the world.Reading this book left me feeling incredibly fortunate to be here at all, and a greater appreciation of our place in the universe. Understanding where humanity comes from is crucial to shaping where we go next. I came one step closer to understanding the power of information passed on to this very point in time, and the universal scientific knowledge contributed by the 1000s of scientists over the generations."
119,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84350478-michael-brenyo,3,"The book is way too ambitious and as a result, it falls way short of its goals. It states in the beginning that this is an attempt to create a unified ""origin story"" for humankind that is modern and attractive. But, it ends up being a dry (although interesting) slog through the history of the universe up to the present point. I feel like the author is reaching too far by drawing comparisons that are only surface level. For example, he makes repeated reference to how cells survive and that human society is just like a cell in how it operates and lives. Maybe this was an attempt to make the information more palatable? I thought it was just pointless. In addition, the author can't answer the really big questions (like, why is any of this happening anyway?), which is specifically why religion exists in the first place. Instead of trying to supersede religion, I think the author and its readers need to understand that religion is not a scientific explanation of the universe, which is what this book is. It relates ideas, feelings, philosophy, and all the other squishy stuff that goes into being human. Science can not answer the big why, but religion can. I appreciate the amount of effort that went into writing this though. I just wouldn't recommend it as anything other than a cursory look at the history of the universe and our place in it."
120,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26463699-matt-stevens,5,"Audible Audiobook. A very fantastic, interesting history of how we got to here. Its really interesting reading this book just a month after I finished Origin by Dan Brown because it has the same big premise - life vs. entropy or life because of entropy. Entropy is basically that in the universe, things break down and energy is released. Life is the opposite of that, life conserves energy and creates things. The theory in this book, and in Origin is that Life actually makes entropy more efficient by bringing energy together so that when it does break down, it is more effective. To push it to intellectual final dimension, humans are ""created"" by the universe in order build Death Stars and turn the planets into Alderaan like wastelands. Its a theory I'm not yet ready to embrace. I don't think we need an entropy tax to simply believe that units that have a natural propensity to recreate themselves - and also has a natural propensity to make slight alterations to themselves (genetic mutations) need any additional reasons to come into existent or evolve. The ability to copy ourselves creates the eventual evolution.All that said, its an enjoyable book. It pushed me to think differently and that's fantastic. "
121,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8171625-seth,2,"The author seeks to tell a story from the beginning of the universe to the end of the universe. It is interesting that he finishes the book by saying that it is very likely in the not too distant future we will have a totally different view of most of what he talked about in this book. It makes me wonder what is the point of writing a book that will be completely irrelevant in not too many years. I did find it interesting to have a fairly short book summing up the current beliefs about the history of the universe and humankind. I thought he made some interesting points. It was fascinating how many ""Goldilocks""conditions have occurred to get us to the point we are now. It really makes you wonder if maybe there was someone causing some of these Goldilocks conditions. Another aspect of the book that I was not too fond of was the strong political nature of the ending. The author states as fact and really pushes the climate change argument though interestingly enough he doesn't seem to have many great ideas as to how we can practically fix it. His belief that strong governmental interference is the answer to mankind's problems ironically, considering he is a historian, seems to ignore all of history."
122,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1409618-mattr76,5,"This is an awesome book, presenting a human origin story of epic proportions, invoking current knowledge from a multitude of disciplines, including cosmology, astrophysics, chemistry, biology, anthropology, sociology, and economics. Covering such a staggering scope—all of space and time—in a relatively short volume, Christian manages to avoid shallow renderings of these subjects by constructing a compelling narrative on the solid themes of thresholds of complexity, energy, and entropy. At each turn in our origin story, Christian explores how the physical laws exploit energy gradients to organize matter into increasingly complex structures, all the while “paying an entropy tax” in return. This line of thinking gets really interesting when discussing life, which at the cellular level maintains itself with electrical charge gradients, and does so at a precisely calibrated rate, and further when comparing the entire biosphere of Earth to such a cell. And now, as we begin the Anthropocene, when humans are beginning have a significant impact on the biosphere, it is critical that we calibrate our energy flows for sustainability. I found this perspective, the entire Earth as an organism, to be fascinating, a mental shift well worth ruminating."
123,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7494007-aaron,5,"This is a good book and I recommend it. If you’ve read Sapiens, you’ll recognize the style: when you zoom out of the trivial century-to-century history, where we think that tweets determine what’s going to happen to our civilization, then you’ll see a picture that’s more deterministic, stable and inexorable: Entropy rages against all things, from suns to sons, and all things rage back, from light to life.Take Sagan’s cosmic calendar and expand it to a chronological book and you’ll have this book. That’s a good thing. It’s important to meditate on how you literally are the center of the universe, how you are made of starstuff, and how you represent a sampling of the most complex things in the universe. What Sagan and other scientists often fail to mention, however, is that we have a lot of life yet to live in this universe. If you lived ten times our universe’s live- 130 billion years- then you would still have another 1000 lives to go. Everything- inflation, the formation of stars and galaxies, of life, humans, civilization... you. EVERYTHING so far is just a prelude. This book is just a prologue worth reading."
124,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5338819-ed-bernard,4,"“Big History” is similar to the kind of thought that scientists like Stephen Jay Gould used to engage in – multi-disciplinary, wide ranging, going very deep into the past to explain the present. As in, to explain the current state of humanity, we need to go back to the Big Bang. Whoa. Actually, it’s incredibly cool … but, for me, having read one impressive Big History book already (Walter Alvarez’ A Most Improbable Journey), this doesn’t really add much. Alvarez was a geologist and his view is anchored in the importance of geology (basically, humans in various populations would be very different if not for the geology in which they emerged), while Christian creates historical mile markers around leaps in complexity. But the concept is the same, and this book is great … but a bit redundant for me, and I was a little disappointed – not so much in this book itself, but by the realization that if you’ve read one “big history,” you’ve read them all. I hope that’s not actually true, and I might try another at some point, but still a little disappointing and dragged a bit for me by the end.Grade: B"

The first half is mostly a rehash of concepts from introductory natural science classes with a little history of science peppered in.In addition to the material on, for instance, valence shells, entropy, ATP chemiosmosis, plate tectonics, or stellar redshift being a retread if you have a science degree, there is rehashing of material from other science popularizers, such as Carl Sagan, Daniel Dennett, et al. This makes the first half of the book feel even more redundant for those who have experienced popular science media. If you haven't taken a lot of science classes, Origin Story might be a good crash course in the big concepts from each of the major disciplines. And perhaps the book gets more interesting in the second half, which is focused on human history and pre-history. But the first half the book is too tedious to finish for me."

Theology has a way of captivating participants, effecting action and eliciting sacrifice and commitment that modern researchers would love to emulate. Science and religion both employ tools to explain the world and help us understand our place in the cosmos. But science often lacks the narrative and the pathos that religions often rely on.This book is a noble attempt to create a holy narrative for science, connecting modern human history to the cosmos and our current understanding of the world around us. We are part of a seamless story stretching from the big bang to the creation of the internet. Framing our existence within the universal tension between energy and entropy is beautiful and provides tremendous insight into our own evolution and our future. Christian is an engaging author, well anchored in the science and history he is describing. But the narrative does not hold together entirely. Its shortcomings give the book a unique authority, however, demonstrating the limits of what objective scientific reason can provide.Read more at https://znovels.blogspot.com/2019/10/..."

One insight I enjoyed is that the author identified several ""thresholds"", where complexity increased significantly. An example is that when agrarian civilizations were formed, towns evolved into cities, and states emerged that controlled even larger populations. Another interesting insight was that rather than talking about money or power, the author described managing and harvesting the flow of energy. So, for example, agrarian societies were able to manage much larger flows of energy, because by actively cultivating highly productive plants, they could harvest much more energy, and create surpluses that could then be used to support ""specialization"" (think kings, princes, tax collectors, priests, etc.) For me, the weakest part of the book was the end, where the author (briefly) discusses the present as well as the near and further out future, as I didn't find his thoughts to be particularly insightful.

Even though this isn’t my groove, as mentioned I did finish this book and there are certainly some items in here that made me hit the rewind button so I could make sure I heard it clearly. I think the way it’s written gets you through the entire history of the universe in a nice orderly fashion. Since it does describe the Big Bang theory it does pit into question a religious beginning to the universe. But if you bought this book your mind is probably made up already. I enjoyed the opening timeline and conversion from billions of years to years and months. It really does make you think about how crazy our existence is, and may never have been A little tip for anyone who will be digesting this via an audio book. The reader is very slow and deliberate. I listened at 1.5 speed and it was still easy to grasp, with not to much of a chipmunk vibe. If I hadn’t found the speed button I don’t think I would have finished this book. "

This is ""Big History"" that explains the origins of the universe till the present day. David Christian explains everything in terms of only two things - ""Information"" and ""Energy"". And makes a lot of sense. I have never seen Organic and Inorganic chemistry explained so simply before! Few books in this world give you the feeling that you understand the world a bit better when you finish them. This is one of them! This books makes you go beyond national and lingustic borders and understand humanity's history in a way that makes sense. Information is the key to spread of knowledge and that is traced from its early origins to the present day Internet. We also see how Energy is understood and powers all living things, not just human. However, humans seem to have unleashed it in exponential proportions just in the last 100 years or so in a long history of a few hundred thousand years in human existence. Most of all, you get a sense of humility knowing we are all but a spec in the history of the Universe!"

Reading is kind of dry and would be much better with at least some charts/images (and it is indeed based on the very visual https://www.bighistoryproject.com, meant for younger audiences I think). Topics are not covered in much depth, but that is not surprising for a book that tries to cover the history of the universe. What I hoped for was some kind of narrative that connects history at all scales - the author tries introducing some concepts like entropy tax but it doesn't really do it for me. The book ends with a environmentalist call for decisiveness in dealing with the world's limited resources. It's a good cause but the rest of the book doesn't really bring the reader to the inevitability of that conclusion.Among somewhat similar books, I liked Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything and Harari's Sapiens way better.

Not the first book I read on the subject, especially reading after the Sapiens series, turned it into more of a refresher, but a good book nevertheless. David Christian a historian, more known for his Big History Project (Google it out, quite interesting!!), breaks the entire journey from the origins of the universe to the current human civilisation and beyond into Thresholds: a perfect set of Goldilock conditions for transition from one threshold to another. In how it differs from Sapiens/ Guns, Germs and Steel are the first 3-4 parts where Christian succinctly talks about the creation of universe to the solar system with a clarity reminiscent of Neil Tyson’s book on Astrophysics. He then shifts focus on evolution of life on Earth and human civilisation briefly broaching upon all major milestones as we know in our history. A good, informative read and a must read if you haven’t read much on the subject before.#52BooksIn2018 #1ToGo"

I have read a couple but I find it still intriguing to read how different authors take different spin on the same topic. I really liked the approach of Complexity thresholds which were crossed in order for the new structures to be created. There is a quite extensive section on young Earth which really fascinated me and made me interested in geology. I have read multiple books on evolution but none of them paid so much attention to the evolution of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells in young earth and its impact on environment. I believe that now I understand ice ages better and I have a greater feeling of belonging to the biosphere than before.I am not English native speaker but I am used to read books in English but this book made me venture into the dictionary quite often.

I was neither ignorant of science nor erudite. Reading Origin Story helped me flesh out a lot of what I already sort-of understood. I plowed through the millions of years of development after the big bang. The six mass extinctions gave me a whole new perspective on the future of Earth as we know it. I was thankful for the final chapter on the ""Anthropocene Era"". This is the chapter everybody who gives a damn should read. It is not political, it is not optimistic or pessimistic, it is neither pro-religion or anti-religion. It is an excellent exposition on how our natural progression to the next mass extinction ( a religious person might like to see it as Armageddon) has been radically affected by man's ability to alter the biosphere. Whatever your opinion about the creation and destruction of the universe, this book has some wonderful scientific observations to deepen your understanding. "

There are too many variables that we do not know and can not control. It’s but human arrogance to stay relevant and try to stay alive. Universe ultimately goes to entropy. The concepts of cooperation needed to attain certain goals to maintain the biosphere are going to be antithetical to greed and self - centered, self - preserving hierarchical nature of humans.But, I agree that as humans our priorities should shift from the rat race to: reflection, enlightenment, as well as stewardship and coexistence on planet earth. Focus on less wastage, less wanting, less accumulation and greed. What constitutes “progress,” as it stands at present, may not be the way to go to preserve our status quo in the universe. But, are humans accustomed to such luxuries as smart phones and computers, air travel willing to forego them for simplicity and less energy consuming alternatives?"
135,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23234680-bob-mackin,4,"An ambitious book that traces the universe from the moment of the big bang to its eventual heat death. To accomplish this in a reasonably short book, he focuses on what he calls ""threshold events"": the big bang; stars beginning to glow; elements beyond hydrogen and helium form in the stars; our solar system forms; the earliest life on earth; the first large organisms on earth; an asteroid wipes out the dinosaurs; the hominin lineage splits from the chimp lineage; homo erectus; homo sapiens; end of the last ice age, earliest signs of farming; first evidence of cities, states, and agrarian civilizations; the Roman and Han empires; world zones begin to be linked together; fossil fuels revolution begins; the great acceleration; (?) a sustainable world order; the sun dies; the universe fades into darkness.Christian, a university professor who specializes in this topic, takes a disciplinary approach to this and does a good job with it. I thought the last few chapters were the weakest, as they are by necessity speculative."
136,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3285213-craig-amason,3,"As the title implies, this is an incredibly ambitious book. It is primarily a ""big history"" of the natural universe. Christian does an admirable job of combining a chronological approach with a hierarchical arrangement: he introduces the universe through the Big Bang, then carries the reader through the development of galaxies, systems, planets, etc. Of course, he spends most of the book focused on our planet and the evolution of human beings. The writing is good and not as dry as it could be given the broad scope and the topic. My difficulties with the book have nothing to do with the writing but my own limitations of understanding physics. For the life of me, I still can't wrap my head around the concept of the entire mass of the universe existing in a space the size of a raindrop, nor can I fathom the nanosecond explosion of all of that confined mass into the ever-expanding universe we observe now. I am by no means a creationist, but the current scientific explanations of the origins of the universe are no less mysterious to me.Most of the discussion of the beginning of the universe still sounds far too theoretical and speculative, much the same way Christian describes the final section of the book where he discusses scenarios about the future of humanity in the context of the planet, solar system, galaxy, and universe(s). Again, my limitations are showing. Christian isn't breaking any new ground here, but he does a good job of pulling together a mountain of information into one narrative. As long as this book is, it would take me several readings (or listenings) to fully appreciate everything that Christian offers the reader. "

I noticed I was more interested in the human side just about 30,000 years ago, which was about 1/3 of the book in. But, the beginning is comprehensive as well, touching the universe and its molecule nature. One interesting idea I picked up from the book is to attribute European enlightenment to finding the new continent. Here's the exact quote. ""The tsunami of new information shook up education, science, and even religion throughout Europe, because this was the region through which new information on flowed first and fastest"". I heard about Jordan Peterson crediting the cause of European innovation to the Christian value of discovering the ultimate truth. That's probably far fetched. David's interpretation feels more natural to me.I would have given 4 up until 19th century, but towards the recent history, his argument became a little more political and dull. It turned somewhat negative too. We should stop growing and focus on fixing inequality and the environment. I found that not so original and very typical of academia. The book was interesting, but the punchline wasn't there at the end.Also, if you like this book, I will suggest reading ""Energy"" and ""The Secret of Our Success"". They both have a similar approach to David, yet dive more deeply into energy and anthropology point of view."
138,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4714284-daniel,4,"A very good scientific history of the Origin of everything. It uses energy and information energy as its primary means of explaining the universe from the Big Bang to now. It u starts at a cosmic scope and then scales down to planetary and even microscopic level all while exploring the advancement of life. All this is explained by energy efficiency and complexity and the requirement to pay its ""entropy/garbage tax"" as systems gain more access to energy and become more efficient in its use. I enjoyed this. Its a well written scientific novel without going to far into the weeds. It explains where it all started to all now succinctly without every getting too technical. Its use of energy as its primary mover is new to move though I'm sure its fairly excepted view by most modern scientist. By making me look at the world via energy instead of through the different scales, it helps me understand the underlying systems a bit more.  "

While I’d read books on the origins of the universe, on the origins of early life, on early society, and the development of modern societies, this book ties it all together in an entertaining and compelling.The later chapters which explore human civilization gave me an interesting perspective on the role of governance as societies grow and become more specialized. While knew learning history was interesting, it’s works like this that help me to remember that it can be useful and relevant.This is a book about history, science, at the intersection between the two, and reads alternately as a thriller and speculative fiction. While it’s hard to cover “everything” in 300 page book , Christian has done a pretty good job, and the notes provide many avenues for exploration of areas that you want to go deeper."

A major theme is the use of free, useful energy and how it has shaped the physical world and the importance how humans, have harnessed energy in the last 5000 years. He lays out a compelling argument about the use of energy per capita and how it can't continue to accelerate at the pace seen since humans unleashed the power of fossil fuels. He lays out a premise that the use of fossil fuel energy can possibly serve as an activation energy for more efficient uses in the future. In the final chapter Christian is optimistic about human's ability to share information to solve the problems facing such as global warming and loss of bio-diversity.

In this time and age, humankind should not be denied an origin story which is based on scientific knowledge. In this book, David Christian has organized the real story of our origin into various time-points known as thresholds. When Goldilock conditions exist, these thresholds herald the beginning of a critical phase of our origin story. He starts off by telling the story of the Big Bang, and how, out of nothing, complexity emerged. This direction of creation, from nothingness to a complex ordered system, seems to go against the arrow of the second law of thermodynamics, from order to disorder, from low entropy to high entropy. He later explains how the law of entropy is not transgressed by the emergence of complexity, as the latter has to pay an entropy tax in the form of input of energy. The more complex an entity is, the more energy it requires to support it. Energy is transformed from useful low entropy energy (e.g. photon) to high entropy energy (e.g. heat/ infra-red), life being the intermediate beneficiary of such entropy increase. The more complexity arises, the more energy is being taxed, and hence entropy is helped along in its task of breaking down order! This book covers the topics of creation of stars, life, humans and modern human life, the Anthropocene age. It ends with a dire message that, unless humanity takes steps to reverse the loss of biodiversity and to limit the damage to our climate, humanity will face dire consequences."

The book reviews a history of the universe and earth from birth to now. The early parts of how the universe got itself organized I have read other places, also about the start of the earth and life emerging. The part about how humans moved from hunter/gatherers to farmers to city & farming economies was interesting. Our enery consumption has dramatically increased because we can produce and harness it. The last epoch they label the Anthropocene, the epoch of when humans as a single species began to impact the whole planet. The questions he leaves one with is will the good or the bad parts win out? We as a species have difficult choices to make but we have demonstrated over our history the ability tio respond with ingenuity, lets hope & pray that's so this time."

Honestly, I don't understand many concepts in the book. However, it is a great read to even know where to begin understanding things. The book starts in the beginning, the second before the big bang, when the entire universe was so dense it could be ""contained in a dot smaller than the one at the end of this sentence"". Then he moves through 13.8 billion years, sometimes at a brisk pace. The journey of moving from Physics to Chemistry to Biology to History in a single narrative of about 300 pages in remarkable. It showcases that life is a miracle which bloomed over a really long period due to certain Goldilocks conditions. By the end, you can appreciate that you are lucky enough to be reading this book."

It gave me a glimpse of how the universe was formed, the earth was formed, life developed, humans emerged, societies developed and what the future holds for us.This was a great accessible story for us non scientists who would get bogged down in more in depth coverage of Big History.I got the book from the library. It probably would have been better if I purchased it so that I could highlight it and mark it up. It was a slower read for me because of the subject matter and my lack of a science background. The library due date did keep me reading it though. Complex subject matters like those the book addresses aren't as easy to read as a mystery so it takes longer.I highly recommend it."

Give the book a chance to allow the author to make all of the connections, to make his point. Towards the end there are some interest insights, especially those connecting energy use. I did feel like there were a lot of statements made masquerading as pure fact when in fact most of the information, especially when dealing with ancient civilizations, are our best guesses. I give it 4 stars because it is an important book that points out what we need to do as humans in the next stage of our species.

I particularly liked the first third of the book (starting with the history and physics of the universe, going beyond the common knowledge of the Big Bang, and also delving into the details of how and why the simplest forms of life could evolve from it.) I feel like my greater knowledge of science and the world is definitely more complete, and, being the type of learner that likes to start with the very basics before understanding complexities, this book definitely helped me! However, once the book started talking about human evolution, it became less interesting to me (maybe because I’ve studied this subject a lot more...). Overall a good book, and very informative, but pretty dense to read (despite the book not being that long) and took me too long to get through it. "
147,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32654424-sreeraag-mohan,4,"Since the beginning of time, humans have constantly endeavoured to gain insight into their origin story, the story behind who they are, what is their purpose and what do the changing tides and winds signify. Our religious texts all start off with an origin story, often ascribing a superhuman the role of Creator, the artist behind all of the curiously wonderful processes that happen within us and around us.Big History is yet another endeavour in this direction, and the founder of the field, David Christian, tries to draft a modern origin story in his book, Origin Story: A Big History of Everything. With the abundance of scientific and empirical knowledge now available, Christian's task of condensing billions of years of events into a three-hundred page paperback is arduous, and he does so with aplomb. "

As usual, there is little evidence as to how life started and how then man originated but the idea of any type of intelligent creator is totally discounted as impossible. The history of man is followed by a Quest for a Utopia for all mankind. The emphasis in this Quest is for increased welfare as opposed to promoting increased knowledge and training of the individual to make the poor unfortunate individuals more valuable and productive to themselves and society. Any society that promotes robbing the hard working, productive individuals to make the life of the lazy, nonproductive individual better is doomed to failure. That also includes penalizing productive nations to constantly pay for the bad decisions of backward archaic societies. "

However the authors oversimplification of science was too jarring for me. Having studied thermodynamics (a subject he leans on heavily), I had to really try and understand his personification of various principles - but the examples were too shallow to deserve thought. I would have also liked a stronger touch on religion, economy, and polity in a book that seeks to unify all in one origin story. That said, the author does achieve his goal somewhat as he puts a nice little bow on his narrative of history by finding common patterns and principles (though sometimes forced)"
150,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1450643-amanda,3,"This was an interesting book, but not much I hadn't already read somewhere else. It follows the history of humanity, starting all the way back with the big bang and the start of our current universe. From there he discusses the beginning of life and evolution up until present day, and then the history of human civilizations from a big picture standpoint. A good overview if this is your first foray into the subject. Just a warning that the writing can be dry, if informative. One unique thing he does is discuss events and evolutions in terms of energy flows and ""taxes"" that must be paid to entropy. It can feel a bit odd sometimes, but is a unique way to think about things. In short, nothing revolutionary, but an okay read."

I'm reasonably well versed in physics, math and chemistry, but sorely lacking in biology, history and social sciences, so it was quite a learning experience. I enjoyed how the book ties every era to the energy extracted from the what's stored in the earth and what's captured from solar radiation, and how the earth made use of and wasted that energy. But at times it got a bit tedious and repetitive. Overall, I got a new, broader perspective on the history of the earth and how the geosphere and biosphere evolved, and of all the millions of ""moving parts"" tugging it to and fro. I think the title is an excellent description of the book."

David Christian’s ‘Origin Story’ is a concoction of the already known facts, yet the flow of the chapters kept me engaged till the end. In the first half of the book, David explained the astronomical events using concepts of physics and thermodynamics in laymen’s term which is worthy of applaud. In some aspects, it lacked insights when compared to ‘Sapiens by Harari’, especially in the last chapter. Also, I would have found it more compelling to have explored the origin, cultures and fate of ancient human civilizations (e.g. Mesopotamia, Indus-Valley, Mayan, and Greek etc.). Nonetheless, it is a remarkable effort and a fantastic book to read. "

It splits history from the big bang in 8 different thresholds that are passed (plus one threshold for the future). At each point, the author describes why this threshold is significant, what are the main conditions that triggered it.Personally, the main insight I got is from threshold 5, which is about the evolution of life on earth, which shows the large impact of life on the ecosystem. I found the take on ""human post agriculture"" (which is the last quarter of the book), not very insightful when compared to Guns, Germed and Steel. Of course, this is not the point of the book, but since it's not a very useful part, it could have been shorter IMO."

Reducing the origin of the universe from 13.6 billion years to 13-day scale was very interesting to get a sense of the scale. Discussion of the progress of human societies and adding adequate details as supported facts was a good approach too. The author takes us to the origin of governments, international bodies, and touches about the topics of origin of democracy supported by nationalism. I like to dwell on the topics of Big History / Origin Story, and this was a worthy book."

It was really interesting and I loved the stuff about space etc. The section on human evolution was a bit tough for me because there was a lot of technical language used that I’m not used to, and the analogy about entropy being a tax got kinda old by the end, but overall it was an enjoyable read. There were bits at the end that I thought were a bit idealist and unrealistic but I liked the note it was left on. Thought there was gonna be more about the future and what we might evolve to be, similar to discussions in Homo Deus, but there wasn’t which was a bit of a bummer.

It attempts to explain the origins of all of these in a fairly concise volume. It is a combination of scientific and historical writing, but it does not get too mixed up with technical details. There is enough science to explain how and why, but it is written in a way that it is comprehensible to the non-expert. Very readable. Could you learn more from other works? Yes, but this is a good one-stop shop to start the story (if you want to explore further). The end of the book attempts to explain where we might go as a species/universe (spoiler alert...it is going to end at some point anyway). Worth a read at least once. "

Evolution from A to now, with some troubling projections about the future. It's science but not so technical a liberal arts major like me can't follow it. Stays away from religion, sticking to facts not belief (a concept currently in disfavor, it would seem). I would recommend it as a comprehensive but not overly technical history of, well, everything about where we've been and where we're going. And, by the way, climate change seems to be a real thing, and in the context of how evolution of plants and species -- humans included -- are affected by weather and how that affects our ability to continue to grow, seems to be something we should quit pretending doesn't exist."

Henrich helps clarify the distinction to be made between what might be called endogeny -- e.g. the formation of stars or the evolution of single cells into multi-celled entities, or the elaboration of the animal kingdom by physical speciation -- and exogeny, meaning the development of powerful, earth-transforming technologies by the collection of species once known as Homo Faber: Maker Man.

At first was a heavy read considering the author started from the most basics of an Origin story you can think of, from chemistry, physics and it’s evolution of more than 13 billion years. Too much to wrap my head around. But as the book progresses it takes you to an amazing journey of humanity and its relationship with nature and its environment. Loved to read about the beginning of farming and how the appetite for energy helped the world moved forward by leaps and bounds. He highlights the genesis of coal, electricity and fossil fuels uses as sources of energy. The author also try his best to predict what can be expected in our near and distant future.

But in the last 1/3, when the author gets to agrarian civilizations, everything gets too high level and perfunctory and it becomes hard to maintain interest as nothing he discusses is strongly anchored to specific examples. From that point on nothing he says will be particularly surprising to anyone with even a cursory understanding of our last 5000 years of history. If you can get it out of the library or borrow it then I would say it’s worth reading for the first seven or eight chapters, but if you sit the rest of the book out you’re not missing much insight. "

It held one major insight for me - the concept that all human society, civilization, customs, culture, can be traced back to energy. Consciousness requires a mind, which requires life, which requires biochemistry, which requires physics, which is matter and energy. The concept of an entropy tax, of increasing complexity demanding an offset in wasted effort, is pretty fundamentally different from how I’m used to seeing the world.The book’s readable to the layperson, and though it doesn’t break massive ground with any radical new theories, it is a wild way to consider our species and its relationship to the biosphere."

For those interested in science, astronomy, and evolution, there probably isn't a lot here that is totally new or that you haven't read before. It's kind of a survey of a lot of different topics. What's new is that it's put together as a ""shared history"", or origin story, of the entire human race. The argument is that, if we all understand our shared origin story, this should lead to more peace and cooperation in solving the world's large problems. I sure hope he's right.I'd recommend this book to anyone who's generally curious about the world, and I suspect that after reading it people will be led to delve deeper into some of the topics that interest them.

The book begins with creation of universe or to say of multiverse, takes on with creation of living and non living and their close interaction, the chaos of entropy and finally the ultimate destiny of all. Though there is an attempt to maintain the interweaving of nature and technology, the universe and entities , the intricacies get lost sometimes in the middle of the book and becomes a history textbook for some areas which does not go well with overall flavour and spirit of the writing. Nonetheless an immensely informative and captivating book... Highly recommended."
164,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15408497-mark,5,"Most important book I've read this year. This tour through 'big history' (a movement supported by Bill Gates and many other prominent thinkers) takes a systemic, cross-disciplinary look at how we got here from the moment of the universe's creation to live to homo sapiens to our decisive turning-point century happening now. Using new science (updated with latest discoveries in the last decades and correcting things I learned as a kid at school), this science-based ""origin story"" is engaging, insightful, and important for every person to read from middle school to old ages. Stick with the story - it'll blow your mind & its right on target."
165,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16005017-adelle,4,"This book does exactly what it says on the cover, condenses down the major historical elements of our known history and presents them in an easy to understand format. I really enjoyed the take Christian took on this, it was so well researched and put together. I did find some of the science lingo a bit troubling at times, but it's all explained so anyone with some basic understanding can follow the story along. Personally, I preferred to switch between an audiobook of this and the physical copy. While I did enjoy this, reading it for too long caused me to zone out a little, so switching to the audio book kept me happily engaged. "
166,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63240697-gu-mundur,4,"Having read quite a lot of books recently on astrophysics, particle physics and human history I still full enjoyed reading through this one also. What I liked most is the organized structure to the story. This is the forst book that walkes through the full evolution of the universe, from big bang to the cold end of everything. David explains in clear and understandable way how human societies have evolved from energy to particles to atoms to molecules to simple lifeforms to complex lifeforms to simple societies to complex societies. Nice to have it all in one go. Well written but occasioannaly felt a little dry. Lacked some spark of humor."
167,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30927692-jonathan-s-harbour,3,"Very informative book, learned a lot of interesting (and useless) facts about life, the universe, and everything. This was a 5-star book until i got near the end where it became a sermon about global warming. Which throws the entire book into question. Did i just read a genuine origin story or a propaganda piece? I'm irritated that i even have to ask the question. I want to know about ancient history, paleontology, anthropology, and got schooled about climate change by the end. -2 stars for ruining a fascinating book. The author could have given a Baptist sermon at the end and it would have been just as appropriate."
168,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51920759-vinicius-carvalho,5,"This book is a great way to summarize a ""history of everything"" in a somewhat short and well organized story. I found positive the lack of depth of the many distinct subjects as it enables the lay reader to understand a little of each while getting a better understanding of how things evolved from the Big Bang until now.The author discuss some of the challenges we face today as a species with such huge influence in the biosphere and the future of life on earth. Previously the author wrote Big History: The Big Bang, Life on Earth, and the Rise of Humanity, which seems to be an extended version of this book. I plan to read/listen to it in the future. "
169,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51418600-scott,4,"I read this book because Bill Gates recommended it. It's good - I recommend it too! I love the factual description of how our world came to be, with useful time scales associated with thresholds of complexity. I really am not convinced about how he depicts entropy, in terms of an entropy tax, but I love the way he relates our society to the increasing complexity of cellular life. I rate books that I recommend to others as 4 stars. If I expect to re-read them, I rate them 5 stars, and I wasn't quite at that level with this book - there are too many other great books out there to read - but this is very very compelling."
170,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23015423-reza-omrani,5,"The Big Bang theory and cosmology, geology and life evolution, and human history all are subjects of my interest, but sounded very independent subjects to me prior to this book. This book masterfully weaves these subjects together to portrait a unified cosmos story which is pretty compelling. Although, I had seen most of the raw materials in this book and even further before, I learned a lot from the way author connected these materials together and gave a big picture of the evolution of the cosmos: the constant struggle for more free energy to increase the complexity of the systems and the entropy tax needed to be paid. Looking this way, I could understand the real jump Fossil fuels created, and the need to contain their destructive effect on the environment (biosphere)."
171,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44102948-dean,5,"This book made me truly fall in love with the universe. Many times during the past 2 weeks of reading this book did I read a sentence, reread it, and reread it again, before putting the book down for a moment and thinking, ""That is absolutely fascinating"". Atoms, elements, molecules, stars, moons, planets, earth, life, evolution- Christian ties all these together into one origin story for the 21st Century. I particularly enjoyed the sense of humility running through the book and Christian's acknowledgement in the final chapter that 100 years from now our beliefs about how the universe works may be entirely different those today. Great introductory book!! 5 stars"
172,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102128637-prashant-goyal,5,"The book covers - spoiler alert - everything. From origin of universe, protons, electrons to stars, galaxies, planets, moons and all the minerals to the beginning and ending of life on earth, Geologoy, biology and history of humans since about 7 million years ago.The book revolves around certains themes and certain ideas like entropy tax and layers of complexity one after another. The language is lucid and concepts are easy too understand.As it is the story of origin and everything, author tells some ultra short anectodes. So I would definitely recommend to read this one, you will be golden."
173,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56275065-denise-k,5,"As a huge fan and teacher of the Big History Project, I was very interested in this book and excited to begin reading it. I was not disappointed! David Christian does an absolutely wonderful job of taking us through each threshold of complexity and doing it in an engaging way. While I enjoyed the entire book, the last chapter was especially good, and there were some quotes that just really stood out to me. I want to also say that I am a very religious person, and I love science. I think the two marry wonderfully well together! Even though this book is written in a secular point of view, I believe it is a must read for truth seekers of all types. "
174,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10409052-adina-dobre,4,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I felt the story telling was appropriately paced and just incredibly informative. I constantly found myself wanting to share fun facts I’d gathered from the book with those around me. Why did I skimp out on the 5th star? The author started *so* many sentences with the word “indeed.” I saw it twice on one page early on and it was fairly distracting each time it came up. Additionally, there were many times when a word other than bonanza was appropriate to describe an event. Surely, these things shouldn’t be noticeable. Either way, I’ve recommended this book to everyone who will listen. "
175,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10893882-octavian,3,"There is a lot of useful and interesting data. As a person that partially ignored physics and chemistry during school classes I found difficult to comprehend all the explanations and figures. Author did a great job, he tried to fit as much as possible data, studies, references into this book, but it made it difficult to read and follow. I learned though some new things, never knew about the Carbon and Oxygen wars that happened while the Universe and Earth stabilised. Astrophysics would reach such an amazing level when we can find an understanding on why the Universe expansion keeps accelerating. Overall a good read but it was damned boring at times."
176,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57098031-dan-weigel,4,"Follows a similar trajectory to Sapiens, but with more scientific depth in the early history of the universe at the expense of later details in human history. I found the organization by threshold interesting, and he did a nice job of helping the reader understand relative dates of events. I preferred Harari's writing style, but there is a lot of great information here presented in a very objective manner. The final chapter about the future of humanity/Earth/the universe was also worthwhile, and presented ideas about the next steps for humanity. Overall I would recommend, especially if you enjoyed Sapiens, and/or are interested in a science-heavy big history."
177,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42508863-kevin-egan,4,"Very well written. A very good and concise idea of things going way back.Hope is and progress are very clear in the last chapters. Not very clear his posture on religion but the GOD behind the scenes is not present.Guys who don't believe in the delicacy and the need to take care of our home should really read this book.A great book to have many discussions afterwards. And that said, what an amazing place we live it. You will look at the beauty of creation with other eyes and you will see you place well in it."
178,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40334778-cj-dufficy,4,"Wonderfull read, hugely informative and thought provoking as each threshold is passed. Very engaging and explanatory uses of analogy and metaphor and scaling facts to comprehensible and digestible concepts right from the start. I would have liked some self-doubt about the ethics promoted. How more ethical over enormous timescales is engineering our planet versus not engineering our planet? For this reason it becomes less forceful in my opinion and less useful to the many people who will read it and essentially agree with the author as I indeed do. Nevertheless I enjoyed this book immensely."
179,0316392006,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58276974-jose-miguel-porto,3,"Origin is the story of how everything begins and how we humans became to are where we are. We are the first species capable of changing its environment and are at a point where we can either destroy it (entropy wins) or opt for a sustainable future. Origin begins with the story of how the universe was created and how energy is limited in the universe. Focusing on energy, Christian describes how energy has transformed our world and humanity by creating certain order and added complexity on each stage, and acting against entropy (a destructive force of structured energy)."
