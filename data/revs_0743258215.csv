0,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5096743-suzanne,4,"This book brought back some of the more fascinating things I learned in my upper division/graduate classes on group theory. It is approachable, yet I'm sure challenging to those without a mathematics background. I love thinking about the way-too-short lives of those brilliant mathematicians who invented group theory - the political and social environments at the time were rough, and what they accomplished was amazing. And symmetry is applicable to so many areas - it is a fascinating topic."
1,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6922605-greg,4,"This is a book about a genius. Livio quotes George Bernard Shaw early and appropriately to describe Abel and Galois: “The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.” (3) It is a very, very true statement.Livio traces the development in mathematics over the broad strokes of history. It is a history of brilliant minds solving progressively more difficult algebraic equations. With the quintic equations, however, no solution could be found for over 300 years. Abel and Galois came at the problem from a completely different line of thinking, and their revolution which has come to manifest itself in modern group theory changed the way we understand the world. Ultimately, they came to define the properties of a group as:1.	Closure – “The offspring of any two members combined by the operation must itself be a member.”2.	Associativity – “when combining (by the operation) three ordered members, you may combine any two of the first, and the result is the same, unaffected by the way they are bracketed.”3.	Identity element – “The group has to contain an identity element such that when combined with any member, it leaves the member unchanged.”4.	Inverse – “For every member in the group there must exist an inverse. When a member is combined with its inverse, it gives the identity element.” (46)Livio goes on to explore the line of thinking further. At times he’s a bit breathless: “So, how did Galois prove his inventive propositions? Even just the essence of Galois’s proof is somewhat technical, but it provides such a unique window into his unsurpassed creativity that it is definitely worth the effort required to penetrate it. Following the logical steps of the proof is like having walked through the labyrinth of Mozart’s mind while he composed one of his symphonies.” (169)“Before Galois, equations were always classified only by their degree: quadratic, cubic, quantic, and so on. Galois discovered that symmetry was a more important characteristic. Classifying equations by their degree is analogous to grouping the wooden building blocks in a toy box according to their sizes. Galois’s classification by symmetry properties is equivalent to the realization that the shape of the blocks – round, square, or triangular – is more fundamental.” (170)Livio completes his overview by talking about the modern uses of this mathematical approach. To me the most interesting is that of Einstein: “Suspicious at first…Einstein slowly began to grasp the incredible power of symmetry. If the laws of nature are to remain unchanged for moving observers, not only do the equations describing these laws need to obey Lorentz covariance, the laws themselves may actually be deduced from the requirement of symmetry. This profound realization has literally reversed theological process that Einstein (and many of the physicists who followed him) employed to formulate the laws of nature.” (204)Livio quotes Owen Meredith (pseudonym of Edward Robert Bulwer-Lytton, earl of Lytton) ultimately in describing how important thinkers like Abel and Galois are in our world. “Genius does what it must, and Talent does what it can.” (263) He finishes with a quick analysis of how these mathematicians are able to be so innovative. “Psychologists John Dacey and Kathleen Lennon emphasize tolerance of ambiguity – the ability to think, operate, and remain open-minded in situations where the rules are unclear, where there are no guidelines, or where the usual support systems have collapsed. Indeed, without the competence to function where there are no rules, Picasso would have never invented cubism and Galois would not have come up with group theory. Tolerance of ambiguity is a necessary condition for creativity.” (265) This conclusion is applicable to all of us."

There was plenty in it that I didn't understand, but it didn't take away from the point of the book. Any mathematician who gets killed in a duel over a girl at age 20 after spending a year in prison for revolutionary activities is worth reading about...especially if he made a discovery that revolutionized mathematics."

5,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12501281-nguy-n,4,"This book is a comprehensive introduction to a very hard problem of mathematics : finding the general solution for a general equation, along with the story of two genius Niels Hendrik Abel and especially Evarist Galois. In my opinion, the author has spent much time to collect the documents related to Galois's life, so that he has described Galois's story truthfully in a very scientific way. That makes sense for the other books on Galois or the same topics always tried to describes Galois's story as much fictonal as possible. The language of symmetry is also a major topic of this book, and Mario Livio has developed them as the vertical axis of the whole story. So that physics came in, with applications of group theory in the unifying question for the universe. In some last pages, the appearance of the applications of symmetry in biology and sex(which I do think that it is not appropriate) reduce the value of this book, and it made me unable to appreciate the book more."
6,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/979362-natan,4,"I have a BA in physics, and even though this book is not a physics book, I learned just how much I didn't learn in my degree and how awful my teachers were. Livio obviously doesn't go into equations and mathematical derivations, but instead explains the reasoning behind them and how different branches of physics are actually connected (something they don't bother teaching you)."
7,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72575413-valeriu,5,"An insightful and emotional narration of the life of two misfortunate geniuses, Henrik Abel and Évariste Galois, both of whom tackled the pressing math puzzle of their time: how to find the solution of the general fifth order polynomial equation. It's hard to imagine that 200 years ago, the Norwegian well-fare state was non-existent and a brilliant mind like Abel was left to die sick and poor. On the other hand, growing up in the aftermath of the French revolution, Galois was a maverick who took on the establishment, both in mathematics and in politics, and in the process made a revolution of his own, by leaving and indelible mark on group theory and opening entire fields of study in algebra before his 21st birthday."
8,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"This has got to be the geekiest book I've read in a long time. It's all about math, for goodness sake. How do you stay awake through a book on math? Well, the duel, and the murder mystery, and the tragic poverty, and the backstabbing, and the mental illness all helped.Because it's not really a book about math, it's a book about mathematicians. Very different subject, really. There is the baffling tale, which I'm still not certain if I believe, that in 1500's Venice, mathematicians would face off to see who could solve the most fifth-degree equations in the least time. Crowds showed up to watch this, and to make wagers on the outcome. I say we dress Lee and Phil in high Renaissance garb and make them do this in public.Then there is Niels Henrik Abel, who live a poverty-stricken life, narrowly missing numerous opportunities to find a position that would provide him enough of an income to allow him to marry his long-suffering fiancee. Unfortunately, his results were ahead of their time, and therefore misunderstood (or simply not understood), and he ended up dying of ""consumption"" (tuberculosis) at the age of 25. His deathbed wish to a friend was to see that his fiancee was taken care of; his friend married her.The main figure is Evariste Galois, who the author has clearly become fascinated with. The fellow was a French revolutionary, put on trial as a teenager for having threatened the life of the King in public, who died under mysterious circumstances (involving a duel with an unknown opponent) at age 20. He apparently knew he would lose the duel; he spent the night before furiously scribbling out a few letters to his friends, and above all fleshing out his mathematical legacy, which was to become the foundation of group theory.From there, we move on to group theory, seeing how the methods of inverting or turning a pair of trousers can be mathematically identical to certain manipulations of Venn diagrams, and the marriage taboos of the Kariera, a tribe of Australian Aboriginals. Those wacky mathematicians. Livio is good at finding examples of abstract math that are goofy enough to keep the reader's interest.In fact, though, the writing of a book on symmetry in mathematics was obviously hijacked midway through by the writer's interest in Galois; the last chapter is ""Requiem for a Romantic Genius"". Which is either a shame or a relief, depending on your opinion. It worked for me."
9,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5416028-jake-berlin,3,"while this book has much more of a uniting scientific idea than the other livio i read (“brilliant blunders”), it’s actually much more scattered. is it a “big idea” book, or a biography of galois? why are there random throwaway chapters on evolution and music? there are absolutely some interesting ideas here - i would very much like to read a top-notch book about symmetry - but it mostly fails as a work of popular science writing."
10,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/657179-sarah,1,"Whoever wrote the copy for the jacket of this book should get a raise. The jacket makes you think the book will be really interesting, and instead it's more of a history of how certain mathematical equations finally were solved, the people who solved them, and how symmetry became an important part of mathematics. The first half of the book was VERY slow, and it wasn't until the author started actually talking about the ""key"" mathematicians and their life stories that it became interesting. Perhaps a good read for people interested in the history of the quadratic equation, etc., but not anywhere near as fascinatingly gripping as the cover would have you believe."
11,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/378991-amanda,3,"This book was a gift and I did not understand what I was about to read when I started it. It was not what I expected - a discussion of symmetry in nature. Instead, it was a history of symmetry, which heavy emphasis on the lives and theories of the mathematicians who perfected the theory. Written for a general audience, I struggled through some of the more challenging parts, but ""click"" of comprehension occurred when I resumed this book as it began a discussion on super string theory. Having just finished The Little Book of String Theory, I was prepared for the presentation of the material and the information seemed to fall into place. I love it when that happens."
12,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1939991-michael,2,"This book was a mixed bag.The history of math parts were really interesting.The exposition of Galois theory left a lot to be desired. It might be too complex for a lay book, but there's a lot about symmetry and physics that's presented at the level of ""trust me, it works this way""!The evolutionary bio bits were even worse. I bet Ian Stewart's book on symmetry is better, but I'm all symmetried out for now. "
13,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2899477-bryan-higgs,4,"This was the first book I read about symmetry and its related mathematical topic, group theory, and it is excellent. This book takes the same approach as many other similar books, focusing on the history (tragic in the case of Galois and Abel) and personalities, rather than the details of the mathematics. This is a delightful read!Highly recommended!"
14,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5951980-ian-durham,5,"A truly remarkable book. It manages to convey the beauty of the mathematics while simultaneously telling a compelling story. One of the best books I've ever read. Honestly, my words just don't do it justice. I highly, highly recommend this book to anyone even if math isn't necessarily your cup of tea."
15,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/354969-bill,2,The author is at pains to avoid actually presenting any of the mathematics. The subject is good. The storytelling is reasonably paced. But Livio just refuses to show us any of the actual subject matter. It is maddening.
16,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3780769-bill-h,4,"I really enjoyed reading this -- it's a bit scattershot, but in the way you can have a wide-ranging conversation with some stranger at a party and feel that the evening was well spent. "
17,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10825293-charles-pearce,3,Slow and dry at first. But it really picked up. It was a biography of the guy who came up with set theory. Now the physicists use it to explain the natural world.
18,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/935902-melissa,5,"I enjoyed this book, and the glimpse of how many are involved in discovering a new equation. "
19,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3210962-mirko,4,Interesting book about mathematics.
20,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8172661-jeff-clark,3,"A slow build up, chapters 1-3. The chapter on Galois’s life, 5, is an excellent pamphlet sized biography of an extraordinary and tragic genius. It is the heart of this book and where the authors passion clearly lies. The chapters that bookend are good, one on Abel, another tragic mathematician and the second on groups (mathematical sense) in general. Chapters 7 & 8 are not in tone or content nearly as good as the 4, 5, & 6. The final chapter is not a fitting coda and attempts to tackle way too much in too little space. Rarely has a single section of a book been so good while the rest not. The Galois chapter is easily 5 stars. The rest is good to meh. If the author wrote a full fledged biography of Galois I would buy it and read it in a heartbeat. "
21,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15105612-jsrott,4,"3.5 stars. The book does a wonderful job in the beginning with the history of group theory and the biographies of its major contributors, but then gets a little bogged down when it attempts to delve into the applications in physics, chemistry, biology, and the social sciences. It can be excused given the high degree of abstraction that group theory quickly moves into, but it does subtract from the enjoyability of the book."
22,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52200704-lew,4,"Interesting book, and mini-biographies of the all stars of mathematics over the years.The subject matter is a bit over my head, but the writing is very good, the explanations understandable at a basic level, and the subjects interesting. And now I know and have a basic understanding of mathematical symmetry and how it and group theory have been applied to physics to reach the current theories that I have run into periodially."
23,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99916812-jeffy-joseph,4,"It piqued my interest in Group Theory. I have added it to my to-learn list. This book is primarily a history book focusing on the development of group theory. The life story of mathematicians Abel and Galois, the pioneers who contributed to the development of field, forms a major chunk of the book. The unfortunate lives of these geniuses who died young had a cathartic effect on me. Its one of the best books that I read in 2016."
24,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13682640-bo,3,"I enjoyed this one for the most part, particularly the biographical sections on Abel and Galois. I ended up skimming or skipping sections in the beginning where it went into detail about symmetry, and later about applications of Group Theory to various fields of study. I read this mostly for the biographical sections, which were thorough but brief, due to the early deaths of both Abel and Galois."
25,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26207090-ray-savarda,4,"good but not great. Sort of light on the mathematics details, but a wide overview of the work on solving equations of various types that led to the discovery of the symmetries that led to the foundation of Group theory. Good discussions of the trials and contributions of galois, abel and others. "
26,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5922032-matthew-graham,3,"Good for the history of group theory until the 1960s but then rather rushes through developments since then, hinting at ""amazing insights into the structure of finite groups and ... several of the most fascinating objects in the mathematical firmament"" but providing no further detail. I would rather have had more on this than who killed Evariste Galois."
27,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16451985-joseph,3,"I enjoyed the first few chapters of this book quite a bit; but in later chapters, when the author began to discuss topics far outside of his realm of expertise, I didn't find the information presented to be credible. Also, I feel that the description of Galois as ""romantic,"" which is repeated many times, is inaccurate."
28,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7918888-michael,4,"Some parts were hard to track with, but overall it had a lot of interesting stuff. The tragic mathematicians were interesting. I wonder how many other little known stories like that exist. The stuff on symmetry was pretty cool. I wouldn't mind reading more on that. It's a bit dated now that the LHC has produced results that don't confirm supersymmetry and string theory."
29,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18207034-siddharth-shankar,5,The best thing i like about this one is the concept of symmetry and how it was thought by Galois. What a mathematical genius to discover a breakthrough in maths just the night before his death. What a tragic life story. Its both moving and conceptually and information wise brilliant book. With Fermat's last theorem this is one of the best maths book.
30,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4955993-anne-marie,3,"It was interesting to be assigned a book for a math class, and this book has some truly fascinating information about math's relationship with other domains such as art, music, biology, etc. But Mario Livio is not a particularly talented writer, which makes this book kind of ""meh."""
31,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87126937-read-by-fred,3,I enjoyed the history portion of it and the discovery of group theory (poor Galois). It was an okay read though I was hoping for more math; some of the analogies Livio used could have been better in my opinion.
32,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68414017-james,5,"A truly fascinating read on symmetry, lucid especially for those with some background on group theory. "
33,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1938918-lauren,4,Lots of math. I admit I skimmed a few of the more advanced math bits. But the story of unappreciated genius was both good and sad. 
34,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41158491-diana-gornea,4,Liked it for the biographic passages of mathematicians' lives
35,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52339370-georg-hohbach,4,Interesting book on the vast subject of symmetry. 
36,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/263436-geraldine,1,I did not finish this book because it seems to be pure mathematics that is way above me.
37,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71595-robert,3,Focuses heavily on biographical aspects.
38,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9914220-david,5,"Central to this book are the figures of Niels Henrik Abel (1802-29) and Évariste Galois (1811-32). These two young men tackled the curious problem of finding a solution to the quintic, a general equation of fifth degree. Arithmetic solutions to linear equations, and the quadratic could be reduced to arithmetic operations and extraction of roots, and so could many other equations involving cubes and fourth powers, but the quintic stubbornly refused to yield to such solutions. The two central characters laid the ground work which not only demonstrated why the quintic could not be tackled by such methods, but gave mathematics a new toolbox with which to tackle the problems posed by developments in physics which were already beginning to emerge with the work of Maxwell in electromagnetism and the curious results of experiments with light and wave theory which would culminate in the theories of Einstein and the birth of quantum physics. There is an interesting quote from Bertrand Russell on page 250. ""Physics is mathematical not because we know so much about the physical world, but because we know so little; it is only its mathematical properties that we can discover."" In light of how group theory and its applications in older investigations came before the discoveries in physics which needed the insights of group theory to organize the new theories of physics, it could be argued that our modes of thinking are the limiting factor in how we can understand things like the concept of space-time. One might also argue that the human brain develops new ways of thinking to apprehend external phenomena. The ability to prove that the quintic was insoluble did lead to many new avenues of thought in mathematics and physics. We now call the mathematical realm of group theory by the name of Modern Algebra, and I had to go running back to my college textbook on the subject by Neal McCoy from 1960. Truthfully, at the time of studying the subject, it made about as much sense as a bag of doorknobs to me. For some reason, we jumped over algorithms in bases other than 10 and other areas so that we could concentrate on permutations. We never completed the text and the course ended well before we got to systems of linear equations, which I see now was a serious shortcoming to the course and my math education. I think I can go back to my old textbook with a fresh start on why this aspect of mathematics is so important to the history of the subject and such a powerful tool in the realm of mathematical reasoning."
39,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,4,"I thought it was pretty good, if a bit odd at times. It didn't seem to get to the point until chapter 6 or so. The book itself is split into Nine chapters followed by ten appendices and notes on the text. Initially, the first two chapters talk about symmetry in different ways. For instance, human beings tend to find things that are symmetrical in some way to be more aesthetically pleasing to the eye. The book talks about such things as M.C. Escher etchings and drawings, musical pieces composed by J.S. Bach and Mozart, Latin Squares, Roulette, and the Pauli Exclusion Principle.So then it gets into the Ancient Babylonians and how they discovered a technique to solve a quadratic equation. This isn't improved on until sometime in the Middle Ages on the cusp of the Renaissance when a series of unfortunate events happen to a number of greedy and self serving mathematicians. The Cubic is solved and some people find solutions independently, but some go and steal the technique I guess. This raises bitter feelings and resentment in terms of priority and University Positions. So with that, people moved on to a general solution of an equation have a 4th power, a quartic. Not sure if that spelling is right, but oh well. So they had at it for many years and this was all happening when Abel and Galois came into the picture.Abel's biography is included and it is sad. I guess that is what happens when people don't appreciate genius. He dies young, but leaves some fantastic mathematics behind him. The same can be said of Galois. He got too caught up in politics back in the day and endangered himself. At least in my opinion. Chapter six leads to groups. It talks about the 15-puzzle, the Rubik's Cube and a discussion on geometries that ignore the Parallel Postulate. Chapter seven discusses symmetry in nature. No more needs to be said. Chapter eight talks about such things as why men find women with hourglass figures to be attractive and other things. Chapter nine summarizes the input of Galois and Abel to modern mathematics.All in all it was pretty good. It seemed to take some time to build up to a point, and that is my only problem with it. The language is accessible, and it doesn't get into heavy mathematics. Four out of five."
40,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12606069-david-blinn,0,"Mario Livio's book on the invention and application of Group Theory along with its inventors is a clear and illuminating look into a branch of mathematics about which I was always curious but had never had the opportunity to look at before. As an example, I have previously read the Wikipedia page for Diophantine equations many times prior to reading this book, but had never completely grasped exactly the category of equations this term described. In reading Mr. Livio's description of them, within two sentences, I had a very clear understanding of what they were.Above all else in this book, Mr. Livio's deep passion for this group theory is very clear and helps to provide this book with an amazing energy and momentum for a topic that in lesser hands might have come across as very dry and antiseptic. The middle chapters in particular, in which Mr. Livio explains the theoretical underpinnings for group theory and dives into its history as related to the quintic equation, and in which he relates the tragic stories of the young mathematicians Abel and Galois who provided the definitive answer on the quintic and in the process spawned a whole new branch of mathematics move at such a pace that I couldn't put the book down. This is really an amazing feat, because I never liked math growing up, and I've never had such an experience reading a book about mathematics before. Livio's reverence for Galois and his achievements feel very genuine and touching.I found the closing chapters that discuss the applications of group theory within physics (and to a lesser extent, the arts) slower and less interesting than the earlier ones, but all in all, I preferred this book to his work on the Golden Ratio."
41,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21256356-jocelyn,3,"Another day, another dense book on mathematics, science, and what-have-you. The Equation That Couldn't Be Solved feels a bit unorganized, but what is is a decent read. The concepts are abstract and generally hard to grasp, but I found myself enjoying Livio's brief biographies of Galois and Abel more than the mathematical parts of the book themselves.I would say that this isn't really for anyone without a decent mathematical background, but anyone considering reading the book is probably at least halfway interested in mathematics. I think the concepts that it presents are interesting, if only Livio didn't constantly switch between expecting me to know everything about quintic equations to explaining with very simple analogies what group theory is, over and over again. It's not as dense as some other nonfiction texts, for sure, but it's not exactly a walk in the park, either.I feel that I have gained some knowledge and familiarity with symmetry as a scientific concept and a general background of its history and ties with mathematics, but the disjointedness and repetition of some of Livio's ideas threw me off. It's a good read for anyone who would like to learn about the history of and development of a mathematical concept, but not much use for everyone else."
42,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12512-anand-gopal,3,"The equation in the title refers to the quintic, a fifth-degree polynomial. Livio traces the history of attempts to solve this equation (and lower-order equations), culminating in Evariste Galois brilliant proof and remarkable life. Galois was an committed Republican in mid-19th century revolutionary Frace and spent time in prison for his political activities. He was killed just months after his 20th birthday, possibly in a duel over a woman. Livio's unpacking of Galois's life and proofs make for a compelling read, but unfortunately this only covers half the book. As the subtitle says, the book is more generally concerned with symmetry. When he deals with symmetry as a mathematical-physical property he does well; however, when he ventures into art and psychology (parroting crudely reductionist equations that purport to explain beauty, for example) he's out of his element and sorely so. And with clunky writing and lengthy detours into quantum mechanics and supersymmetry that seem forced, this book only gets 3 stars. "
43,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1936590-bill-weaver,5,"This is a fascinating book on symmetry written by an astro-physicist, Mario Livio. I fell in love with symmetry when I was in graduate school studying chemistry. I loved the concepts of reflection, rotation and inversion on simple molecules and how one could determine energy levels with these operations. As I moved from molecules I started to notice symmetry in Rachel's exquisite homemade quilts, in nature, in Bach's music, in art and architecture. So far this book is not about using symmetry in science but in introducing the concepts in the everyday world. I have learned that a palindrome has a form of symmetry. I am also learning about translational symmetry in art and music. What can I say, other than better living through mathematical conceptsI am reading this book on my new Sony ereader. For the most part it is like reading a book in a traditional format. The only problem that I have with it is I can not enlarge the pictures to get a full appreciation for the examples given. "
44,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16177673-chelsea-m,3,"I have long been fascinated by the life story of Galois, but I wasn't able to understand group theory, and could not fully appreciate his genius. I chose this book in hopes of solving this problem.It certainly wasn't bad, but it was written at a lower level than I would have liked. I had to read through explanations of terms and ideas that I was already familiar with, which was frustrating, and while I liked the variety of topics that the book explored, the author often didn't discuss each topic as deeply as I liked. Too often, the author simply stated the mathematical and scientific ideas without explanations or proofs. It left me a little unconvinced of their value. The wide range of topics also made the book ""all over the place"", like a collection of articles that have little in common with each other.This book would be good place to start for bright young readers who have recently become interested in mathematics and/or science. I myself found it useful as an introduction to famous ideas to explore further."
45,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1667021-may-ling,0,"Livio takes a subject that one would think was exceptionally dull, i.e. Symmetry/Group theory, and brings the historical perspective that makes suitable for those who are not math geeks. He expertly gives the generalities of mathematical theory, so that Laymen can follow along. I really wish more teachers would assign historical works to help students better understand that while math has generally been advanced one person at a time, that it is not unattainable or even not useful at the higher levels. I found the descriptions of the personalties that lie behind so many of the equations I use in the every day to be enjoyable and not at all what I expected. I also found his use of examples for the applications of the theory to be incredibly helpful in understanding the significance of the work. I greatly enjoyed the application of group theory to sociology, music, physics and anthropology."
46,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4809742-benjamin,4,"I really liked this book. The historical tidbits were great; learning how self-important Cauchy was was especially fun. Unfortunately, Livio falls into the frequent popular-science trap of presenting horribly contrived analogies for some mathematical or scientific concept. Much worse is his example of the Play-Doh deformation group. It is not clear to me how one would define this in such a way that it is actually a group. For example, he needs to guarantee that no deformation sends two different starting shapes to the same ending shape.my favorite quote: ""Consider then what happens to a flat object, such as a compact disc, when it is spinning very rapidly. Since the circumference rotates faster than the interior, it would contract more. This would distort and warp the shape of the disk."""
47,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63003009-simranjeet-lamba,4,"For a person like me who likes mathematics, I found the book pretty interesting. I'll be very frank and confess that I did not understand 15-20% of the book. this isn't the mistake of the author. he has beautifully described each concept with examples from daily life. before reading this book , I hadn't even heard of a thing like symmetry. the central idea of the book is never lost. want to give special praise for chapters 4 and 5 which describe the lives of the 2 mathematicians related to the quintic. absolutely beautiful! no less than a love story cum emotional drama. could definitely take out some time from my day to glance through those 2 chapters again. if you are somewhat inclined to mathematics, give it a read. if not then it's alright. already ordered another book of the same author named is God a mathematician. hope it is more generalised and easy to comprehend!"
48,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3259969-seth,3,"I mostly enjoyed this book, but like others have said, it's a mixed bag, with the book sort of going all over the place. I liked the digressions into the biographies of Galois and Abel, but by the time the book got to the last chapters, it was just too much of ""and here's another example of symmetry!"" for two pages, and then ""here's another example of symmetry!"" for another two pages. That said, I enjoyed large chunks of the book. A bit less breadth and a bit more depth would perhaps have been better. My favorite part of the book is the way the author relates the circumstances of Galois' and Abel's lives to their research and how it was received at the time. Makes grad school look not so bad. At least you don't die in a duel."
49,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8463644-ed-terrell,5,"Livio takes us on historical journey in the development of mathematics. Starting with Babylonia and moving gracefully into the Middle Ages of Europe, he traces the lives of characters and the societies as they uncover the hidden treasures and develop the mathematical tools we use today. In the post Napoleon Europe, he takes special care and interest in the child prodigies Abel and Galois. Especially Galois. The heated revolutionary was killed at twenty in a duel but not before he put to paper ideas and thoughts that would change the world. This history of the development of ideas allows the reader to sit along side the greatest thinkers and to share the excitement of their discoveries, providing glimpses of the secret symmetry that operates behind the scenes in our tick-tock universe."
50,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9233935-paul,3,"Although this book has its good points, parts of it are rather weak. In particular, the first two chapters, presumably used to motivate the rest of the book, are of poor quality, which may dissuade some readers.The author does well when he recounts history and biography, as in the middle chapters, but he has difficulty explaining things, mostly because he avoids details and elaboration. Topics that I wish he had spent pages on, he skims over in a mere paragraph. Topics he spends pages on deserve entire chapters.I feel like I'm watching TV, while someone else holds the remote and constantly flips through the channels. Any time I spot something interesting, he moves over to the next channel before I get any real enjoyment out of it."
51,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1622804-jim,4,"The two big ideas in current mathematics, symmetry and group theory, are bound up in this book, with the drama of Abel's classic proof of the insolvability of fifth-order equations. Mixed in are wide-ranging ideas about the aesthetics of symmetry that have little or no relation to the mathematical topics Livio covers so beautifully, but the long detours are made palatable by the wealth of interesting details he summons up. Best, he makes a coherent narrative of the continuum of concepts that have threaded through all of 20-century mathematics and physics; that alone makes this small volume indispensible."
52,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/153472-snowfire,3,"Solid if short biography of Galois and some other figures involved in the development of Group Theory. Galois was an interesting dude who makes all mathematicians over the age of 22 jealous for not developing their own field of mathematics by then and then not dying in a duel.The good news, if you are a general audience, is that the mathematics content is light and easily digestible. The bad news is that if you want something deeper, well, take Group Theory. Livio doesn't go TOO deep into the subject, which, being a Math major, I think is too bad, though I understand."
53,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1118264-william,4,"The book gave a good historical overview to group theory and the quintic equation, and that was interesting to me (though I would have liked to see a bit more of the mathematics behind them). I wasn't so enthralled with the application of symmetry to biology and evolutionary traits, as that doesn't really excite me, but I did like the discussions about relativity and theoretical physics. The book has, however, made me want to dig out my old college Abstract Algebra book and see what group-theoretical findings it contains."
54,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3201558-cyrusmoqtaderi,4,"A nice look into the intriguing world of symmetry and it's application in mathematics. The two ""main characters"" Galois and Abel are intensely interesting people and the bios of each provide a nice mid-book pause from the rest of the mathematically-based investigation into symmetry and group theory.Not a deeply mathematical book by any means, but I'm also not a mathematician, so I found this beneficial to my enjoyment."
55,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8525797-mark,2,"I liked the subject matter and I enjoyed the life stories of Abel and Galois...The book, however, wasn't that well-written. I found it ""easy to put down""/""hard to read"" even though the mathematical treatment was generally too superficial for my taste. I also found the author to be annoyingly Italio-centric. He may be right, but I tired of learning that--surprise, surprise--the work on EVERY major problem in mathematics was pioneered by an Italian who has been ignored by history."
56,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1424073-so-hakim,3,"A bit uneven. Some talk about the concept of symmetry, its history, and its examples, but somehow seems not tightly wrapped.On the positive side there are nice biographies. I personally like the treatment of Abel and Galois. There is also historical overview including Renaissance Italy's Cardano and Tartaglia, but that's about it."
57,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7271433-tania,4,"Always enjoy a Mario Livio book. Many areas in which symmetry permeates are discussed; my favorite being the mathematical aspect of symmetry and how the language of symmetry, namely group theory, was born. Loved the well researched historical background on group theory and the background stories about the geniuses who developed it. Great read! "
58,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30541335-jimmy-ele,5,"This is a masterwork. It touches on the aspects of symmetry in Mathematics and takes it further into physics, art, and poetry. Tragic mathematicians are deftly painted under a loving hand. Highly recommended book, an instant favorite, especially for it's outpouring of ideas and subjects which have guided me to ever more abstract vistas of research and thought."
59,0743258215,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18125-ryan,4,"pretty well written historical account of two influential mathematicians whose work paved the way for a lot of modern algebra and group theory in mathematics...they both died before they were 25, but were hugely influential.
