0,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/123533-nikolus,2,"After reading the first couple of essays, I was disappointed; I thought it would be more information-heavy, educational, with fewer jokes about how ""I'm a scientist, pop culture is weird to me"". I love RS's lectures online. He's obviously brilliant and entertaining, I just wish he had packed more about neurology, neurochemistry, etc. in this piece. "
1,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,5,"This is another great book of what nature via nurture really means, driving many coffin nails through genetic determinism, including practitioners of Pop Evolutionary Psychology (with capital letters, as a philosophical mindset) who remain more genetic determinists than they let on while claiming to preach ""nature via nurture.""Sapolsky is the real deal on ""nature via nurture"" - indeed, it should be noted that, with the exception of a totally genetically determined thing like Huntington's disease, he preaches ""nature ONLY via nurture,"" or something along that general line.Beyond that, he gets into the nuts and bolts of what we know today, and don't know, about non-coding areas of our DNA, which are NOT all simply ""junk DNA."" Rather, you have introns and exons for marking where a coding sequence of DNA starts and stops, and even more importantly, you have regulatory, or modulating, sections of DNA, which may tell a coding section only to switch on when there are more than 12 hours of daylight per day, which could be used to trigger mating behavior.Here are some important page by page notes:23 ""More than 95 percent of DNA is non-coding. Sure, a lot of that is the junk-packing material DNA [a lot of which may be ""quarantined"" remnants of viral DNA, similar to what Norton Utilities does on your PC when necessary], but your average gene comes with a huge instruction manual about how to operate it, and the operator is often environmental.""23-24 ""The startling second fact is that when you examine variability in DNA sequences among individuals, the non-coding regions of DNA are considerably more variable than are the regions that code for genes."" Sapolsky admits much of this is due to junk DNA areas, but that much of the variability is attributable to regulatory area. Obviously, this has huge impacts on the nurture side of things.42-44 Good discussion of imprinted genes, which differ from Mendelian biology in that only one is active, usually the one that comes from the parent of the same sex as a child. (Note: this does NOT mean these genes are limited in placement to our sex chromosomes.) The result? These imprinting genes battle for placental and fetal growth, as male and female genes have different ""urges"" for the placental and fetal rates of growth, due to male-vs-female differences in mammalian breeding strategy. Placental tumors can result if only the paternal gene is active, lack of placental implantation in the uterus when only the maternal gene is active.61 Offspring of attractive males, in many species studies, survive less often than average.63. In a study with ducks, with attractive males, it actually appears that the female invests more energy in the egg, laying a larger egg when impregnated by an attractive male. (The egg size is under female control.)Both of these should put some question to old stereotypes about peacock tails being signs of fitness and so increasing mating, etc. At the least, they should caution us to look for more nuanced explanations.83ff Limbic and autonomic nervous responses come on- and offline at different rates to one another. In relation to the frontal cortex, this may help explain why intermittent rewards can actually be more psychologically reinforcing than regular ones.177. In many species, females in some way manipulate alpha-male type males into fighting over them, to go off and mate with more ""nice guy"" types.184. Why our desire for revenge? It stems out of game theory, from games such as Prisoners' Dilemma, etc., which show the value of ""tit for tat altruism"" - if the game is played more than once, especially if one knows a ""cheater"" will be back in the mix again.But, in a one-time game, especially where a competitor is informed he/she cannot inform players of future rounds about a cheater, including not being able to inform them through the action of punishing a cheater, then revenge as our self-appointed judge and executioner's pound of flesh seems a natural action, even if we the ""cheated"" have to expend yet more energy to make the cheater pay.Hence our actions in today's civilized society, namely such as flipping people off for cutting us off in traffic, etc."

3,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,4,"Monkeyluv is a collection of essays (previously published elsewhere) grouped around 3 broad themes:Genes and their influence on behavior.This is the old nature/nurture debate. Are we the way we are because of our genes or the environment in which we are raised? Scientists figured out some time ago that it’s a combination of both, but identifying the source of specific behaviors is complicated.  Our body’s influence on behavior. It should come as no surprise (except perhaps to extreme mind/body dualists) that brains are physical organs and are influenced by events that take place in the body and influence our bodies in return. Hormones released by the body effect the way we think and act (one of the reasons men are different from women) and fear (a mental phenomenon) causes gooseflesh (or a bottle-brush tail in the case of my cat) are two such examples. The environment’s influence on behavior.The most interesting essay involved the broad differences in cultures that evolved in desert vs. jungle environments and how desert cultures tend to be monotheistic, militaristic, repressive and paternalistic, while jungle cultures are polytheistic and take a more free-wheeling approach to life (more like the tribes of Polynesia as opposed to the Yanomami I suppose). One could conclude that we are the unfortunate recipients of a desert culture that has spread globally (assuming you buy in to the precepts of this cultural anthropological explanation). This is the first book I’ve read by Sapolsky, and I’m wondering how it took me so long to come around to him. He has a lively writing style and the ability to explain complex scientific subjects in an interesting manner to a layperson. He also has something that seems to be altogether lacking in most science writers … a wicked sense of humor. "
4,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4196-bobby,3,"3.5 stars.A collection of essays (18 total) which were published in magazines like Discover, Natural History, The Sciences, etc. by Robert Sapolsky, a biologist at Stanford. The book is divided into three parts: Genes and Who We Are, Our Bodies and Who We Are, and Society and Who We Are, with each having 6 essays. I found the first section just okay (a bit too basic I think) but enjoyed the second and third sections more. Given the broad range of topics—everything from genetic differences between men and women to the effect of stress on brain size to the mating habits of monkeys—there is something here for everyone. Which is also the major weakness of this book; that is, it has breadth at the expense of depth. Although Dr. Sapolsky gives references at the end of each essay, his arguments still feel “light,” as is his writing, for better or worse. So I wouldn’t recommend it for those who are looking for academically rigorous writing but those who enjoy pop science will probably get a kick out of it. Plus, how can you resist this cover? (Not to mention the great backcover photo of the author with a…baboon(I think)) "
5,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/829027-mark,5,"One of the best science writers out there! I found myself chuckling out loud about things like parasitic bacteria. Dr. Sapolsky is great at bringing biology down to earth as well as warding us away from stereotypical ideas that can develop from popular coverage. With his cleverness and cynical humor, he doesn't have to resort to hype to make his topics interesting. "
6,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8083135-john,5,"A wonderfully readable collection of essays on a wide range of topics, from genetics to physiology to society and civilization."
7,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42728401-adrian-sergiusz,5,"Sapolsky in his masterclass educational, entertaining and eye opening way steps back and observes all the weird peculiarities of human behaviour as a scientist and integrates that with his observation of our various cultural practices around the world. In a collection of various essays, he muses about interesting aspects of evolution and it's effect on us as animals. He very excellently observes the importance of understanding what genes are and are not and how they impact the nature of our behaviour together with our environment."
8,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27347361-hina,5,"What was most enjoyable about this book was Sapolsky’s informal and friendly writing style. The essays in the book go into just the right amount of biology and technical information without making the topic seem dry or boring. The book covers a very wide range of topics covering human behaviours, traits, evolution, biology, psychology and many other fields of science to explain what makes humans so quirky. It was a surprisingly fun read and I chuckled out loud quite a few times. "

10,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90975344-eddie-kim,0,"A relatively easy book on human behavior for laymen to read, but no less enlightening in understanding human behavior in the context of primate behavior. Useful insights await those who would open this book."

You answered many of my questions that generally troubled me for years, some of the deepest questions, that nearly anyone wonders and asks himself in life. Big fan!"
12,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41174441-word-muncher,4,"How fantastic that we can know and count on these things. People are clearer and logic, once again, prevails. A really good book for knowing about yourself more and what we should ignore when we are looking for behavioural traits - as we should always do."
13,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62188192-nadiya,5,"A great collection of essays about the influence on our behaviour caused by genes, body and environment. Masterfully written, well-researched with interesting scientific details. "
14,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81136558-munira,5,loved this book! collection of short essays on why we behave the way we do.

18,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32949169-viktor-malieichyk,5,"Not exactly a book, rather a compilation of articles on different topics. From low-level stuff like our genes and their interaction with the environment to some patterns that emerge in human societies. Everyone would find something interesting, and the best part is that every article has a list of literature for further exploration. And apart from that, the book is nicely written and easy to read."
19,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36791828-hiina-shiota,5,"I think that this book was very unique. I liked the way how each of the essays were all organized very well, and how they all talked about the people and animals within these essays. The essays were very clear and understandable as well. I thought that by reading this book, I get to know how animals are related to humans, and why they are acting the same way as humans. Also, by reading these essays, I get to learn more about the animals, and their own actions, such as why they do these actions in front of us. In addition to this, this book was full of interesting ideas of how both animals and humans could be related by their own functions inside the brain. Therefore, I think that this book was very great, and would like to recommend to those who are learning about animal behavior. "
20,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7059290-erma-talamante,4,"I love reading science essays. No really, I do! And I really enjoy when the essay is written well. A little humor on the subject goes a long way here, too. Sapolsky knows his topics. As he states in his footnotes to ""Bugs in the Brain"", he will ""get crazed about some topic, read endlessly on it,"" and ""eventually write something, getting it out of my system, thereby freeing me to fixate on a next topic."" He does his research. And how! Each essay is a mini-study on a different topic, although some do play off of others, each with footnotes for further reading. There is one that is mentioned frequently that I am curious to read, by the same author (Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers), but unfortunately my library only carries it in e-book form. From primates that display a range of human-like emotion and societal behaviour, to the science of mothers who don't; from parasites to PTSD. The science of life is truly amazing and deep, yet Sapolsky manages to keep his writing quick and witty, leaving the reader to laugh frequently while absorbing the depths of life. Never once did I feel like the essays were speaking down to me, from some scientific tower. I have encountered scientific journals that will write in this manner, and I loose interest quickly - not for not understanding the material, but rather from the tone. That was not an issue here, and was full of well-explained stories of life, and what makes it so unlikely!"
21,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1590672-sandy-d,5,"This was a fantastic, educational, funny, well-written book. Sapolsky is a neurolbiologist at Stanford who studies stress hormones and their effect on health. He does field work with baboons in east Africa.In this collection of essays, originally written for magazines like Natural History, Discover, and Men's Health, he writes about our genes and how they interact with our environment. He explains things like why people who think nature always trumps nuture are wrong (or don't know how genes work), depression and PTSD how a susceptibility for that can be inherited (but not always developed), sexual attraction, dreams, cross-cultural religious patterns, Munchausen's by proxy, and more.Since the essays were originally written for popular magazines, they are short and very readable. At the end of every essay, he's added a nice ""further reading"" section that tells you about the research about this issue, more technical works you may want to read, and more.This is the kind of popular science we need to see a LOT more. It doesn't oversimplify the issues, but it doesn't bore the reader.I could go on and gush about every single essay, but I'll stop here and just tell you to read the book if you're at all interested in your biology and your environment and health. Or recent scientific studies on any of these issues."
22,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/379386-jessica,3,"I love this guy (see my review for A Primate's Memoir). And by far the best thing about this book is the insight into theoretical science based in biology: he'll provide a correlation between X and Y, provide strong evidence for causation from X to Y, then step back and provide evidence for causation from Y to X, then evidence for a non-causal correlation, and then he'll finally discuss experiments that have turned everything on its head and argued that Z causes X and Y.However, the majority of the content in this book is repeated in 
The Trouble with Testosterone
 (they also share a shocking amount of turns of phrase). What's more, a fair amount of that content is touched upon in A Primate's Memoir, where it is presented much more indepthly and interestingly.So, you should read these books if you loved A Primate's Memoir, but you should probably wait a few months so that you won't be annoyed reading the same sentence or paragraph over again. And if you only really think you'll read one, definitely make it A Primate's Memoir."
23,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/853341-robert-raymond,5,"Sapolsky is a great science 'popularizer'. Way more witty than Dawkins--of the same caliber as Gould, perhaps. This book is basically a collection of articles published over the last few years in various popular magazines, but they are all tied together. Sapolsky discusses lots of wide ranging and interesting topics and relates them all to gene-environment interactions. I guess the take-away message of this book is that genes are hardly the determinant factors of our behavior and morphology that popular understandings of genetics currently espouse. Genes don't code for specific behaviors, they code for amino acids that build up proteins that allow us REACT to our specific environment in certain ways. The same exact gene can have completely different outcomes when existing in different environments. "
24,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2256347-robert,4,"I found this collection of essays on neurobilogy and primatology to range from great to merely OK; I enjoyed them all, a breezy read,. What will I want to remember? The essay on corpses -- why is it that we will go to great lengths to retrieve a body from a sunken ship if it sunk recently enough, but would consider it desecration to pull up the skeletons from the Titanic? And some day I want to find out more about those 20,000 noses that the Japenese sliced off of Koreans in 1597.The essay on diseases and socio-economic status -- babies dying 100+ years ago because the ""best"" care was complete isolation with no human contact, polio only paralyzes the wealthy (and, of course, so many cases when being poor is a big disadvantage healthwise, even when we don't understand why.) The complex interplay between genes and environment described in Of Mice and (Hu)Men Genes."
25,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/997082-barbara,4,"I discovered Monkeyluv while listening to Radiolab on NPR while driving in the car. There was a hysterically funny interview with author Sapolsky explaining the physical differences that men and women experience when arguing. I had to pull over and write down Sapolsky’s name and the name of the book. When I got home, I found Radiolab and listened to the entire program (Season 2 / Episode 4 - also highly recommended). In the interview and in the book, Sapolsky talks about the differences between the autonomic nervous systems in men and women, and how those differences affect relationships, particularly arguments. His other essays address other areas of human bodies and human behavior. He makes scientific information about fascinating and funny. I highly recommend Monkeyluv for anyone interested in knowing more about their body and their behavior. It’s definitely a good read!"
26,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1003057-myridian,4,"This is a book of essays that have been published elsewhere previously. Sapolsky reminds me of a top. He gets wound up and then it's just fun to watch his mind go. In this book Sapolsky takes a series of subjects and explores them mostly through relatively popular science sources. He then draws conclusions that feel relevant to how we live our lives and think about the world. The one complaint I have is that the topics don't feel obscure enough to me. Perhaps because of my background I'd at heard most of the information before, though some of the conclusions he came to were completely new. I think The cultural desert was my favorite essay in the book mostly because it did discuss something I really hadn't heard before."
27,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3513783-mike,4,"Monkeyluv was an enjoyable collection of essays on evolution, society, biology, psychology, a slew of other -ologys & how try all come together to help give us a better understanding of ourselves. It was an enjoyable read on some extremely fascinating topics. That point leads me to the books largest deficiency: some of the essays are too short. The author did put notes after each essay to expand on the topic & suggest further reading; but sometimes he didn't cover everything I wanted to know more about in the chapter. This was especially the case on the evolution & dissemination of desert & jungle cultures.All in all I recommend this book to anyone with even a passing interest why we are the way we are or just wants to learn more about the fascinating world we live in."
28,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/135485-calafia,5,"Any book that starts out by describing Britney Spears as ""neurobiology's greatest teaching tool for demonstrating that the frontal cortex of the brain does not fully come online until around age thirty"" is a-ok with me. From there, RS gets funny.If you're into brain chemistry or enjoy primates, you should love RS. I loved this book, it brought back my old neuroscience classes and added to what I had learned in them. And of course, it reinforced things I encounter in everyday experiences with both human and non-human primates.The title has been panned by those who missed the tongue in cheek humor, which sort of disappoints me. I guess not everyone gets RS. "
29,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1245146-man-ching,4,"I really liked this book. Sapolsky writes well in a breezy, conversational style that's suited for discussing science with laymen. He makes an effort to expand on scientific findings; rather than focusing on the punchline, he does discuss the methods as well. Not only that, he even brings up contrary findings and dutifully cites the literature in his notes section. I find that it quite a talent to distill rather nuanced and involved details into easily digestible bits. At the same time, the complexity of the issues are obvious, right below the surface. I can't recommend this book enough to anyone interested in biological explanations of behaviors."
30,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1292128-andrew,4,"Dr. Sapolsky's incisive essays suggest a Chuck Klosterman with a Ph.d in neurobiology. Both writers are masters of the ten-page essay, and their concerns--how the big questions of Human Existence (like, religion) are surprisingly refracted in and by the quotidian details of human existence (like, foraging and hunting)--are strikingly similar. Each has a penchant for taking an unexpected analytical tool--say, the film Road House or Munchausen's by Proxy (Road House would be Klosterman, MBP Sapolsky)--to elucidate a more general problem. And when both are on, rarely a page goes by without an ""I'll be damned"" moment. Sapolsky is on for this entire collection."
31,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2391389-marik-casmon,4,"This book, which I got for a buck at Maui Friends of the Library, is a group of essays about the intersection of genetics and sociology, addressing the debate between those who think nature is more important in developing human character and those who think nurture is the boss.When I read science books, I usually choose physics, so this book, essentially biology, is something new for me. I recommend it very highly, as the essays are well-written and clear. More important, they're funny. Sapolsky has a great sense of humor, which is displayed throughout.If science books were all written like this and used in high school, I think we'd have a lot better science education in this country."
32,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3126417-krista,3,"I read this book of essays for my bookclub. I'll add more thoughts after tomorrow's discussion.----------------My bookclub discussed this title last month. Overall members enjoyed Sapolsky's humorous, informal writing style. His essays discuss a variety of topics ranging from the very lighthearted (People Magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People) to the most serious (Munchausen by Proxy syndrome, a horrible phenomenon in which parents harm otherwise healthy children in order to receive medical and emotional attention). At times I wished the analysis went a little deeper, or the humor wasn't quite so flippant, but I enjoyed breezing through the quick studies of human behavior."
33,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/933226-kirsti,4,"A biologist explores questions like ""Why are dreams dreamlike?"" and ""How come most senior citizens aren't avid fans of Rage Against the Machine?"" (The answer to the second one is that, for most of us, the music that was popular when we were about 20 is the music we prefer to listen to for the rest of our lives.)Tucked away in an endnote is something that I thought was the most interesting part of the book. I knew that the first cloned sheep was named Dolly, but I didn't know that she was sickly throughout her life and had to be euthanized. Scientists suspect that she was born with telomeres (DNA endings) that were as old as her mother's--making her ""a sheep in lamb's clothing."""
34,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10422321-caliph,4,"I enjoyed reading this book quite a bit. It is a sharp and entertaining read that summarizes the current thinking about several aspects of human (and primate) behaviour. He does meander, and while this is no rigorous treatment of the subject (and neither is it meant to be) he makes it a point to quote his sources and gives you an extensive to-read-more list at the end of each chapter. If you've watched videos of Sapolsky's Stanford lectures you'll realize that he seems to write pretty much the same way he speaks and his intelligence just shines through. It is a delight to read him as much as it is to listen to him. "
35,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/305795-andrea,5,"Fantastic book that is a collection of articles done by Stanford neuroscientist/surgeon/professor. He writes with humor about nature vs. nurture, our relationships defined by science, and whatnot. But what I love is his writing. Though the thought of reading about science (dna, pysychology, etc) can be intimidating, he writes so that any layman can understand and form personal opinions. Matt and I read this together (me reading aloud), and each time that we stopped, our conversations continued on and on about what we had read. Definitely a must read for everyone. Love his writing so much that I will continue on with another book that he has written. "
36,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91116-noisy-penguin,4,"I grabbed it because I thought the cover was cute. I had no idea it was science essays until I looked at it again. It was actually really interesting. I'm sure he over-generalizes some concepts to make them more accessible to the masses, but I'm okay with that. It's a pop science book for general reading, if I wanted super detailed technical information, I'd go to a textbook or a science journal or something. He does a good job of relating theories to real-world scenarios. And his self-deprecating scientist jokes are great."
37,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/358576-schottsy,4,"From wondering about why we prefer the anticipation of reward more than the reward itself and as well as the biochemical underpinnings of our most basic interactions and emotions. A great read. Also helps clarify that pesky nature/nurture conundrumFavorite point: The vast (prefrontal) cortex creates symphonies an calculus and philosophy, while the atypically numerous interconnections between the brain and limbic system allow for that dreadful human attribute, the ability to think oneself into depression."
38,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/677212-sara,4,"I think I have a little bit of a crush on Robert Sapolsky. Which is kinda weird, considering he's a wild-haired field biologist approximately my dad's age. It's not mating kinda thing, he just makes me laugh so much, and is so smart, it's ridiculous. This collection of articles from mostly pop-science mags is fascinating, entertaining and rapidly consumable. (I ate them mostly on airplanes, etc. when going to visit my mom in San Diego for four days.) Oh, for content - they are mostly about the brain, hormones, and behavior. Psychobiology/physiology stuff."
39,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1313252-larisa,4,"I loved this book! Sapolsky is able to effectively filter and translate scientific findings and publications into a language everyone can understand and even enjoy. And if the reader's curiosity is sufficiently sparked, Sapolsky also kindly provides references at the end of each essay for further exploration on the various subjects.His style of writing is not only engaging but personal. Often ideas presented in the book are related to his own experiences and perceptions, and he is not above occasionally poking fun at himself or his colleagues.Highly recommend!"
40,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/271043-bruce-sanders,4,"Robert Sapolsky is one of the best natural science essayists around. This work does not disappoint. In the first section he does an outstanding job of addressing the nature vs. nurture controversy. He puts to rest the simplistic misunderstandings most people have with regards to this issue. These were my favorite essays in the book, but all of them were informative and written in a readable style. Sapolsky has a fine sense of humor too. You'll come away from this book understanding the world a little better. It's an easy read and well worth it."
41,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1199295-linda,4,"This book is an annotated collection of essays that have been previously published. Sapolsky touches on a variety of aspects of the Human Condition--moods, sexuality, genetics, death, food preferences, and genetics. Several of his essays deal with the ""nature vs nurture"" part of genetics and I found it very interesting.While you may not agree with everything he writes, his writing is lively, entertaining, and informative, and more than once you'll come away seeing things in a way you've never thought of before."

Almost all of them have been previously published in magazines like The New Yorker and Scientific American. Made me feel like I was at a dinner party with a bunch of leftist academics who aren't afraid to question anything. Laughed aloud at least every other essay. Often felt compelled to go to my sig other with Sapolsky's random theories, studies and factoids, which prompted meandering discussions. "

This book is great for someone who's interested in understanding our biology but doesn't want to go read primary sources (ie journal articles). I'd put him up there with Oliver Sacks as one of the great science writers (and speakers). I was inspired to read this after attending a talk he gave. Thankfully my girlfriend loaned me her much loved copy. I look forward to reading more by him, especially Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers."
44,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1453295-john,4,"This is a collection of essays that Sapolsky has written for several magazines on a variety of subjects relating, in general, to the dependence of human behavior on our evolutionary history, genetics, and environment. The essays are engaging and quick to read and one could probably finish a couple each night before bed. Sapolsky also wrote a touching account of his time in Africa studying baboons, A Primate's Memoir, which I also recommend."
45,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2072674-aj-payne,4,"This was another essay compilation book by my favorite scientist author. I think this one (especially in the first several essays) was much more scientific than his other essay compilation book. I can't say I liked this one more or less than the other, but some of the essays were really great. I especially liked the one on Munchausen's by proxy since that illness really interests me.I recommend to anyone who is interested in genetics, or human nature from a brain point of view!"
46,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5900232-heather-browning,5,"Very entertaining. A simple and accessible collection of essays on many aspects of human biology - genetics, physiology, psychology, sociology. As a biologist, I still learned some new things, but the humour, concise writing style and lack of excessive jargon or technical language mean this book would be great for anyone. It ranged from touching (such as the piece on Munchausen's syndrome by proxy) to witty (loved finding out why we are more averse to novelty as we age)."
47,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3108522-mia,3,"Very curious and interesting biological facts about being human written in short essays entitled things like: ""Why Dreams are Dreamlike"" or ""Genetic war between men and women"" and ""Stress and your shrinking brain""The information is new and curious. The writing style did not fully capture me. It can be a bit cheeky at times which seems somehow in congruent with subject matter."
48,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1820830-mohamed,4,"Sapolsky is both informative and engaging, replicating his Radiolab style on the page, which leads me to think he must be an electrifying lecturer in person. Some of the information in in this book wasn't news to me but even that was presented in such a way as to provoke more thought and a thirst for more information. Having said that it was a bit scattered, and unfocussed."
49,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5437125-nancy-schober,5,It had a really dumbed down explanation of gene expression. So now I finally get it. The Monkeyluv essay and the one about Munchausen by proxy were just heart breaking. I love his writing bcs he'll be all sciency and then say something really human. When he wonders if we are asking the right questions it's like a breath of fresh air. Cool book.
50,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5868210-john-somers,4,"Excellent book on genetics, biology and their effect on behaviour. Particularly liked the sections on Munchasens by proxy syndrome and how viruses and parasites can affect hosts behaviour. First time I've read a book of this type but will definitely be keeping an eye out for books by the same author."
51,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9544145-theresa,3,An amusingly composed collection of essays on the complexities of human and animal life with sensitivity to the relationship between our biological nature and our environmental context. Sapolsky focuses much attention on demolishing the notion that human behavior must be driven either by nature or nurture and illustrates how the two are intricately and inextricably intertwined. Fascinating.
52,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072582-kaethe-douglas,2,"I loved A Primate's Memoir: A Neuroscientist's Unconventional Life Among the Baboons, so I was really looking forward to this. And I was disappointed. Not as engaging, not as charming."
53,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3749108-ohenrypacey,4,"Relatively current behavioral science explained in short, accessible pop science bursts.Sapolsky's essays appear in many major magazines, and are digested here as a coherent gloss of current theories of human behavior. Very much in the vein of Steven Pinker. Thought provoking and a great source of conversation pieces."
54,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83576-liza-p,4,"Although the book itself is pop-science, Sapolsky is a very smart man who writes very intelligent, insightful books! A fun book to read if you know a fair amount about neurosci, and an fun and informative book if you don't."
55,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/376998-amy,3,"Another great book by Robert Sapolsky. It's a compilation of random stories he's written for different science and news magazines, so it lacks somewhat in cohesiveness. But I still learned a lot, and Sapolsky's writing and humor are as good as ever."
56,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/662755-john,5,Monkeyluv is worth reading for some insight into our species. The first half of the book takes on the issue of genes and the nature / nurture debate. The second half of the book involves a series of very interesting essays on the mind / body connection. A quick and accessible read.
57,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1967110-jeanie,3,"These are wonderful, interesting lectures by a funny scientist. This was her book club pick. Unfortunately for me, although I enjoyed each essay as I read it, the information just does not stick with me."
58,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/205426-nick-weeks,4,Read it before it gets torched in a book burning. I read a couple of essay books by Sapolsky a couple of months ago and am just now writing this review so I can't remember which stories were in this one. I'll write a more thorough review later. 
59,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36347-john-ryan,5,"Not as good as ""Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers,"" but still a well-written, funny introduction to endocrinology, genetics, and ""our lives as animals.""

60,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1323536-leah-adams,3,"The author and his wife wrote a fascinating book, ""A Primate's Memoir"", about their study of a baboon troop in the Serengeti.

61,0743260163,http://goodreads.com/user/show/324370-lisa,4,"Not bad -- a bit on the glib side but some interesting stuff scattered throughout. I think I'd have liked to see each essay fleshed out a bit more, and the topics gone into in more depth, but I realize that wasn't the point of the book."
