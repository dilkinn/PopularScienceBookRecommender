1,0060531096,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1433865-robert,1,"I reviewed this once before and a tecnical snafu ate it when I tried to up load it...This book is dreadful: here are the many reasons why:The material is disorganised. The book is ostensibly about extra spatial dimensions. The concepts are introduced in the first few chapters then don't re-appear until the last few chapters. The Standard Model is introduced twice.The explanations are poor and sometimes wrong. The section on the Pauli Principle is riddled with errors and omissions that should embarress a good A-level chemistry student. The section on CP symmetry and CPT symmetry is so bad that I did not recognise these concepts for what they were until several chapters later. These concepts are not actually difficult to explain, even if it is hard to see why they should be true: In CP symmetry, all matter is swapped for it's antimatter equivalent and the directions left and right are reversed. When this is done, no difference can be detected between before and after the swap. This symmetry is known to work for all physical processes except those involving the weak nuclear force. In CPT symmetry, as well as swapping matter for antimatter and left for right, the direction of time is reversed. This symmetry was believed to hold for all circumstances - it could have happened five times since you started reading this review and you would never be able to tell the difference! However, very recent results have suggested that neutrinos and antinuetrinos may have different masses which would mean that CPT symmetry does not apply to them. This isn't a well established result yet, though. So, really, how hard was that to explain? Randall also offers the worst introduction to the fundamental mysteries of quantum mechanics I've ever read (and I've read quite a number).Randall can't write: Additionally to giving bad explanations, Randall also gives us a very bad story at the beginning of each chapter. These stories have no literary merit and do not make understanding the forthcoming material any easier. They are like the dialogues from Godel, Escher, Bach by Hofstadter with all wit, literary merit and purpose removed, except they aren't dialogues, either.Pop song wisdom: Each chapter begins with a quote from a pop song. These are not profound or witty. Many, many years ago I developed the principle, ""Do not get your life wisdom from pop songs."" One could also say, ""Do not quote pop songs at the heads of chapters unless you want to look as if you've never read a book in your life.""Repetition: Using the same unclear explanation over and over again does not make a topic easier to understand. Since it was very difficult to understand Randall's explanations of concepts I am already familiar with repeating them isn't helpful.Bloat: The new ""physics"" Randall wants to explain comes in the final two chapters of a long book which is full of digressions that are irrelevant to the main thrust. Weirdly the author includes every theoretical development of the last 20 years except the only one that has a firm experimental basis (i.e. neutrino oscillation, which I'm not going to explain here). Weirdly, this would have been useful, unlike the ones she does include, because the issue of ""flavour mixing"" comes up at one point. Again it took me some time to realise that this ""flavour mixing"" was something I knew about - neutrino oscillation!Is there anything good about this book? Well, there's an explanation of why one theory of relativity is Special and the other is General that you won't find in many other places. Is that compensation for nearly 500p of tedious, repetitive and extremely speculative barely comprehensible explanations?Stick to the maths, Lisa; you're good at maths."

But I thought it was horrible. The explanations are unreadable. The preface was even less comprehensible. BTW, I have an engineering degree and was the CEO of a scientific research institute for 14 years. I think I am capable of reading a lay book about science. I got nothing from this one."
3,0060531096,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8019667-paul,3,this rating is much more a reflection on me than randall's writing.she wrote about complex theories in quantum physics and string theory in probably the most accessible manner possible. but my brain isnt great at grasping such notions so that is on me.Randall starts each chapter with a parable fairy story to illustrate the ideas discussed in that chapter and finishes with a bulleted synopsis of what she wrote.all in all this is a physics book for non physicists.
4,0060531096,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452722-koen-crolla,4,"People make too much of condescension in science writers; I've seen several reviews now praise Randall for not being condescending or patronising, possibly because Randall herself mentions that she wrote the book because so many others struck her as being patronising or condescending and professional reviewers are usually journalists and journalists are lazy hacks.In actual fact, any work of popular science, particularly in the field of physics, is going to be condescending in places by necessity; the state of modern physics is so far removed from the physics education the modal layperson will have received (my own high school physics education got to Newton and stopped, and because that requires basic calculus I'm told that's more than most people get) that any book written for the general public has to start pretty much from zero or risk losing its readers at least some of the time. And because people who tend to read pop sci will tend to be at least sort of familiar with at least some of the ground covered already, this means at least parts of any decent book will seem unbearably patronising to them. Unlike with high-schoolers or undergrads, you can't make very many assumptions about the background and knowledge of your target audience when you're writing for the general public.And Randall is more patronising than most, to be honest, because she makes an earnest effort to cover more ground than I've seen anyone else attempt, and she insists on repeating herself to an absurd degree. And that's good — in fact, I'd go so far as to say that Warped Passages is the first (modern) pop physics I've read that hasn't left me feeling like the field is now just too esoteric to be viable subject matter for pop sci.(The only thing that bothers me is her irrelevant anecdotes about rock climbing and mountain biking and things, which I'm sure is exactly the sort of thing that appeals to aforementioned professional reviewers. I'm so fucking sick of the rock star physicist image; that is condescending in an undesirable way.)"
5,0060531096,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2201886-mike,4,"A few weeks ago I came across an interesting blurb about Ms. Randall's latest book. Since I was unfamiliar with her or any prior books (one was mentioned in the write up), I did some cursory digging and found that she had written her first book in the mid-2000s. Because I wanted to be ""fair"" before reading the just-published book, I felt obligated to read the earlier one. Now that was a gigantic mistake! (Not the reading, just the ""obligated"" part.)""Warped Passages"" is a superbly written book by a leading physicist for non-physicists. The topic is (mostly) contemporary particle physics but to add the necessary depth and perspective she covers the late 19th century development of the original ""atomic"" models as well as classic physics topics such as: Newton's Laws of Motion, Newton's Law of Gravitation, Electromagnetic Theory, and Maxwell's Equations. From there the book continues with the 20th century revolutions that re-wrote all of the rules: Special Relativity, General Relativity, Quantum Theory (aka Quantum Mechanics) and the Uncertainty Principle.Along with these ""basics"", the discovery of the essential building blocks of the universe are covered. First the ""basic"" items: electrons, photons, protons, neutrons are discussed, then the ""sub-particles"" which were found as ""atom-smashers"" gained power and sensitivity: the weak gauge bosons, the quarks, the neutrino. All-in-all a fairly standard progression from the early days of particle physics right up to the present day (when the Tevatron was finally decommissioned, since the LHC is now really up & running). And of course we haven't touched on the last 30-40 years of models and theories, yet. (But the book does.)So, why am I so positive about this book? I think that Ms. Randall has written some of the best summaries and explanations of the core elements of particle physics for the past half-century. Her coverage of the Standard Model, Symmetry, Supersymmetry, Strings, Branes and dimensionality are probably the best that I have ever read for non-physicists. Not only are the presentations clear and meaningful, but she allows readers to pass over sections that contain important information which does not directly impact the main direction of the book (which is using extra dimensions and branes). I did read all of the sections. I also read all of the 40-odd math notes, which is where she placed anything that might have derailed someone who only cared about the ""gist"" of the topic. Overall, I think the author and editor(s) did a great job in organizing the material for a readership of many interest levels. You can stop reading here and take away my recommendation that you read this excellent book on how the universe may work. Or, you can read the next section where I give a few more details while trying to solve a small conundrum. But, read this book no matter which you decide.Although I have not read any other reviews, I did notice that ""Warped Passages"" has an overall ranking that is lower than I expected. Granted it is written for those that may be more curious than the average bear, but initially I couldn't reconcile the excellent writing with this overall ""judgement"". I'm still not certain, but I have a few guesses.First, the author writes in her own ""voice"" rather than a dispassionate, omnipotent, narrator. She is a physicist and one whose work centers on the current material of this book. As such she describes many first-hand events and impressions; perhaps these are beyond the expectations of some readers.Secondly, and in a similar vein, she created little ""stories"" to illustrate the concepts that are presented in each chapter. For the most part the stories are ""standalones"" (although they use a recurring cast of characters), but in some of the later chapters she deliberately refers back or explains what point or concept the story was designed to explain. Personally, I found these passages redundant, but the author & publisher may have thought that some readers would not be able to connect the dots in these little ""asides"". Other readers may have felt this was annoying or offensive.Thirdly, the author writes in more topical references than another author might, or another reader might prefer. Again, for myself these were neither offensive nor irritating, but not everyone may be as amused as I was by a few little left-leaning comments.Lastly, and I really, really hope that this isn't the reason for any of the low rankings, she details some of the historically unequal treatment of men and women in physics. In the handful of places where she writes about this we see how a specific woman's contribution to a discovery or theory may not be attributed, recognized or rewarded. Does this matter? I think it does. Many people know of ""Madame Curie""; some may know of the woman whose X-ray crystallography made it possible for Watson & Crick to decide on a double-helix structure for DNA, and a few may know about Einstein's first wife and collaborator, but these are only placeholders for the many other women that have been doing ""real science"" throughout history. To put it in perspective, the author is a notable, practicing physicist and this is her book. I think it's perfectly reasonable that she give an example or two of women who made significant, prior contributions to the advancement of physics and were not given the same recognition as men working on the same problems. So, if the misogynists didn't like these comments, tough bunnies!"
6,0060531096,http://goodreads.com/user/show/772202-marilyn,3,"If you love particle physics you'll probably love this book. The first and last fourths of the book were really interesting and mostly about new theories in particle physics.The middle half of the book slogs through a brief history of particle physics, string theory, and multiple dimensions.She employs a few odd tools. Most chapters begin with an Alice in Wonderland like story that is meant to demonstrate the concept to be discussed. Some readers may find it witty and amusing but I found it distracting. It is set off in italics so readers can skip ahead. There were several helpful tools though; one is a bullet list of summary points at the end of most chapters so if you wanted to skip ahead you could review the bullets and move on. Also included is a glossary of terms that I found helpful. Since I read this on a train in twenty minute intervals, I would find myself reading a passage knowing that she had explained a term two chapters ago but couldn't remember how it was relevant to the current chapter and all I had to do was refer to the glossary. She also includes endnotes which elaborate further on certain mathematical details for those curious and more familiar with the calculus involved. Overall, I found the book to be a good broad collection of concepts around multiple dimensions, brane theories, and warped geometry as they relate to particle physics. But I found the writing to be a bit stiff and hard to follow at times. If you're looking for a discussion of the implications or real world applications of the theories she does not go into that level of detail. She does however bring up a good point: based on the models being built, we must not have a clear definition of what a dimension is."
7,0060531096,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,Lisa Randall is one of my favorite scientists. Her research is amazing. I highly recommend this book as well as watching her lectures online. The lectures (some 5 hours in length) help solidify the information in this book. I can't wait to see where this research leads. I have always been excited to learn about dimensions. I hope I live long enough to see the how the work of Randall and others affects our understanding or branes and the forces attached to them. 
8,0060531096,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Is gravity weaker than other three forces? A solution to the hierarchy problem in physicsGravity is the weakest forces of all the four forces of our universe, because, according to the author, it is concentrated in another spatial dimension of the universe, and these extra dimensions could be infinitely large. The summary of this book is as follows: We live in a three-dimensional pocket of higher dimensional space, also called branes. It is like a bead on a wire that can only move along one dimension, a brane may restrict our motion to three dimensions although other dimensions exist around it. The theory of supersymmetry also explains the hierarchy problem by postulating that every fundamental particle has a heavier partner, but the theory currently predicts particle interactions that don't occur in nature. The author predicts that if extra dimensions exist, particles could be separated to prevent unwanted interactions, and that gravity could be concentrated somewhere in an extra dimension. The force's strength becomes exponentially weaker further from the gravity brane. The model consists of a pair of universes, four-dimensional branes (three space and one time), thinly separated by a five-dimensional space called the bulk. The mathematical solutions for this setup suggested that the space between the branes is warped, and objects could grow larger or smaller (less massive or more massive) as they moved back and forth between two branes, a direct result of higher gravitational force. The fifth dimension could be so warped that the number of dimensions you see would depend on where you are in the bulk. In addition, gravity is as strong as the other forces, because it is much stronger on one brane than the other. Therefore our universe is located on a brane where only weak gravitational force is felt. This idea of the author is not new since string theorists, Arkani-Hamed, Divali and Dimopoulos (group A.D.D.) suggested that if one or two of the curled-up extra dimensions of string theory had sizes as big as a tenth of millimeter, then gravity would be similarly diluted and weakened thus explaining the hierarchy problem. There is increasing perception among some leading physicists like Ed Witten that space and time could be illusions, or it is perhaps made of simpler yet undiscovered physical parameters. We are still long way to clearly understand the concept of space and time, but the author's theory may be a step in the direction of advancement. However, one of the major problems of this theory is that it is all talk (theoretical) but no substance (no experimental evidence). We have to wait a little longer after the LHC data is completely analyzed and understood. The book is very well written and easy to understand; the author has explained the relevant physical concepts in a simple and lucid manner; highly recommended. "
9,0060531096,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3052695-jim-good,4,"Most of the book is a set up for the last couple chapters, by giving a history and accounting of the Standard Model of Quantum Mechanics and some baseline information on string theory. The last couple chapters deal with theories of extra dimensions and how they might be perceived and detected. Most extra dimensional theories have finite or small scaled that wrap back on themselves. She puts forth a theory of potentially infinite but warped extra dimensions and how those would manifest. Also much discussion of branes which can trap particles to make them appear as less dimensions than there really are."
10,0060531096,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17296389-cyndie-courtney,3,"I won't begin to pretend that I completely wrapped my mind around everything in this book. It definitely peaked by curiosity and I am intrigued to learn more, but this is no ""particle physics for dummies"". Some fascinating concepts contained within. Definitely helped open my eyes to some of the crazier aspects of our world. "
11,0060531096,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110610415-richard-seltzer,4,"On the plus side, this book will expand your understanding of the concept of ""dimension"". It also has clear explanations of developments in physics in the days of Einstein and the early stages quantum theory. Above all it gives you a sense of physics as a living, growing, very human endeavor -- a constant challenge, a source of one fascinating puzzle after another, requiring creativity and ingenuity to simply imagine all that might be possible. Half the book deals with theories that have not yet been proved -- fascinating ideas that might turn out to reflect the ""real world"" but that regardless of that have a puzzle and artistic appeal.The author is not a reporter or science popularizer, but rather one of the leading theorists. If what she presents is an accurate account of recent developments (and I have no reason to doubt that it is), she deserves a Nobel Prize.Unfortunately, while she seems to try hard to make her book readable and to make the concepts accessible to the non-professional, the narrative becomes increasingly difficult to follow. A typical passage from the second half of the book: ""This meant, paradoxically, that you could use perturbation theory to study the original strongly interacting, ten-dimensional superstring theory. You would not use perturbation theory in the strongly interacting string theory itself, but in a superficailly entirely different theory: weakly itneracting, eleven-dimensional supergravity. This remarkable result, which Paul Townsend of Cambridge University had perviously also observed, meant that despite their different packaging, at low engergies, ten-dimensional superstring theory and eleven-dimensional supergravity were in fact the same theory. Or, as physicists would say, they were dual."" What?????It's like trying to read a book in a language you don't know. Somehow I managed to look at all the words, but I don't feel that I really ""read"" the book. And I could probably look at all those words several more times without understanding any more of it. So I come away impressed at the author's knowledge and accomplishments and creative enthusiasm, but totally frustrated. I simply have no idea what she is talking about. If only I could find a book that unravels the mysteries of this book..."
12,0060531096,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9892350-ollie,1,"I really had my hopes up for Warped Passages after reading Brian Greene’s Hidden Reality. Not because I enjoyed that book so much, but because it so thoroughly confused and frustrated me that I just assumed another book would do a better job of explaining the wonderful world of hidden dimensions.Unfortunately, Lisa Randall’s Warped Passages is no better. Just like Hidden Reality, Warped Passages starts out well enough by explaining some basics about quantum physics but then very quickly snowballs into a mess of jargon and gobbledygook. And Randall tries, she really does, by making the subject a little bit more lighthearted, peppering her chapters with stories, examples, an idiotic non-fiction story involving Athena and Ike (who cares?), and trying show off her music taste by quoting “relatable” lyrics at the beginning of each chapter (she has terrible taste in music, guys), but it all just ends up being frustrating. It just seems ridiculous to use the media of 2-D words on paper (with the occasional drawing) to explain something as complex. An episode of PBS’s NOVA or even comic strips (like Ph.D. Comics) do a better job with much less effort. Warped Passages might be more easy to understand if someone were using this book as a way to study the subject (and reading the chapters over and over again) or if we could actually see the math (instead of just asking us to imagine certain ideas or to trust Randall on a concept over and over and over again), but for the general audience, this is just a very frustrating book. I could not wait for it to end.At the end when Randall is talking about her contributions to the field, she says “It took a while before physicists understood and believed us.” Well then, what chance do the rest of us have?"
13,0060531096,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2653888-karl-nehring,4,"Through the early pages of the book, Dr. Randall's writing style drove me nearly crazy, but as I continued to read, either she started to get her bearings or else I got more used to it. In any event, I found this a fascinating book. Technically it is very challenging -- I am not going to pretend that I truly grasped most of what she was writing about; however, I was able, at least at some level, to follow the story she was telling, and that was a welcome sort of challenge. I enjoyed this book enough to have recently ordered ""Knocking on Heaven's Door,"" her newest tome."
14,0060531096,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6319308-charles,4,"The Standard Model of particle physics is the most successful scientific theory ever produced. It's capable of making predictions that turn out to be incredibly accurate, down to many decimal places. It's produced surprising predictions that turn out to be true. The discovery of the Higgs boson a few years ago cemented in the capstone of its success. But it also has a massive, gaping hole in the middle of it, a flaw that has consumed the efforts of several generations of physicists and continues to represent an impenetrable mystery. Where is gravity? Why is gravity?This book is ten years old now, but still presents an absorbing account of the efforts being made to unravel this mystery in a readable and approachable manner and is an excellent starting point for anyone looking to find out about string theory, supersymmetry and extra dimensions. This is a cluster of theories that can interact in surprising ways, but Randall manages to plot a course through the thicket that makes a degree of sense. As with all popular science books it's hobbled by the requirement to translate purely mathematical concepts into semi-intuitive ideas. This will always present problems, as an intuitive understanding is inherently flawed--if you really want to grasp the nature of these theories you need to do the maths (I'd recommend Leonard Susskind's The Theoretical Minimum: What You Need to Know to Start Doing Physics and its companion on Quantum Mechanics).There are a few problems with the book that might have been improved. As others have noted, she opens with several chapters concerning higher dimensions and how they could fit into what appears to be a strictly three dimensional world, but then veers off into presenting relativity, uncertainty and the Standard Model, only returning to the subject of dimensionality 10 chapters later. Unfortunately there's no way of discussing these subjects properly without shoehorning in all the undergraduate spadework that needs to be covered for anything else to make sense. The book would probably have flowed a bit more elegantly if the introduction to dimensionality were moved later in the work. But since the book is fundamentally about the physics of extra dimensions I can understand the motivation to dive in from the start.Written in 2005, this book presents an excellent overview of the previous couple of decades of work into Physics Beyond the Standard Model. What it really needs is a second edition, perhaps in a couple of years when we have results from the LHC at 13TeV. In many places through the book she talks about the predictions being made and looks forward to the LHC results. It's no secret that many of these predictions have fallen flat. Some variants, like Minimal Supersymmetry, are already dead in the water, with no evidence of the relatively light superpartners they predict. Most of the others are looking very troubled. Where do we go from here? It's not enough to carp from the sidelines, like Smolin, and complain that these theories are all bunk. We need answers and a way to plug up the yawning void sitting at the heart of the Standard Model.The road that science takes is littered with the husks of thousands of dead theories--once-promising ideas that had to be cast aside for better alternatives. There's no doubt that many of the theories presented in Randall's book will join their number. But if ideas are a vector we need to know where it's starting from, and Prof. Randall presents an excellent overview of the state of play in PBSM in the early years of this century. "
15,0060531096,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72945589-illiterate,2,"Randall focuses on the hierarchy problem and the speculative theories that try to solve it, including string theory, branes, extra dimensions."

Holmes, Sr. 1858)Holmes would, I think, have agreed that this book is a provider of such mind-stretching ideas. Here you'll find an excellent discussion of some of the more radical new ideas from the model-building camp of theoretical physics. Taking ideas of higher dimensions and branes borrowed from string theory, Prof. Randall and co-researchers have produced interesting models of physics in which the extra dimensions of string theory are shown to not all necessarily be miniscule curled-up planck-scale regions beyond experimental probing. She demonstrates possibilities for larger additional dimensions the existence of which might be experimentally verified when the Large Hadron Collider swings into action, and alternative possibilities to supersymmetry for unification of the forces of nature.Don't be fooled by the journo's reassuring commentary on the cover. No journalist wants to admit that they can't make head nor tail of a 'pop' science book. Though Randall steers clear of mathematics there are many abstract concepts in this book that are not at all easy to grasp, especially the idea of non-spatial symmetries and symmetry breaking. 'Remarkably clear' is a very relative term here - in that, given the inherent difficulty in explaining these subjects to the uninitiated, yes, she's done a great job; but that doesn't mean it's easy-going or accessible.There's not very much cosmology in this book. It mainly concentrates on spatial geometry, particle physics, quantum field theory and the (possible) relationships between them. Of course the obligatory explanations of relativity, quantum mechanics and the standard model of fundamental particles and forces, all de rigueur for any pop science tract, comprise the first half of the book.Prof. Randall has actually made a very brave move in publishing this work, because her conjectures might be disproved or at least thrown into doubt by the results of LHC experiments (whereas string theory as a general concept will neither be proved nor disproved because the LHC doesn't probe anywhere near the energy scales needed to do so). More power to her elbow for doing so."
20,0060531096,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,4,"This book is an overview of modern particle physics (as of 2005) and a surprisingly deep look at how the universe works at the sub-atomic level. There are no equations or calculations, but you get far more technical detail here than a typical pop science book. While some parts are hard to follow, other parts are astonishingly well written, explaining incredibly complicated physical concepts through wonderful analogies. It's not easy reading, but it's worth the effort, as this book helps you realize that the real world is far weird than anything you'll find in fantasy books.Some of the interesting ideas I got from this book:* One mystery in particle physics is that the force gravity is much, much weaker than all other known forces. There's a great example of this in the book: a tiny magnet can lift up a paper clip, showing that the magnetic forces from a few grams of metal can overcome the force of gravity generated by an entire planet. No one nows why this is. * The fact that gravity is so different than other forces makes it tough to come up with a ""theory of everything"" (ToE). The goal of such a theory is to come up with a set of equations that could predict the outcome of any experiment. I had heard ToE before, but never in such terms—what an audacious goal! For some reason, I can only imagine the search for a ToE to end in failure due to a result similar to Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem. Perhaps the universe, by its very nature, cannot be completely predictable.* One possibility for why gravity is different has to do with extra dimensions. It turns out that no known law of physics limits us to the 3 dimensions we experience (or 4 dimensions if you count time). There may well be more. Gravity might be using most of its energy in those other dimensions and we are only experiencing the weak amount of energy that exists in our dimensions. * The idea of extra dimensions is hard to think about and there are no easy ways to visualize it. This book does a great job of using analogies, such as explaining concepts in 2d and 3d worlds we can reason about and explaining that the same reasoning would apply to higher dimensional worlds too (I loved the analogy of a bug crawling along 2 dimensional plane curled up into a hose). There's also the interesting concept that the number of ""dimensions"" is really just the number of quantities you need to specify to uniquely locate something. E.g., in 3 dimensions, those are x, y, and z coordinates. In 4 dimensions, we might add a time coordinate. In higher dimensions, we're just adding more coordinates; you might not be able to picture it, but you can still reason about it.* It's possible for extra dimensions to exist without them being detectable. The extra dimensions could be exceptionally tiny (plank length), or, if the universe is warped in a certain way, the extra dimensions may be infinite in size, but still not detectable. * The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which you probably learned in high school physics, states that there is a limit to the precision with which you can know certain pairs of physical properties. For example, you can never precisely know both the position and momentum of a given particle at any given moment. This book has a lovely analogy to explain why. Imagine you have a dripping sink in your kitchen and you want to know how often it drips. You get out a stop watch, count for 10 seconds, and calculate 10 drops. So that's 1 drop per second, right? Well, the issue is that your stop watch and your ability to use it isn't perfect; the precision is probably only about ~1 second, so it's possible you're off by about 1 drip, and the rate is actually 11 drips per 10 seconds, which is an error of 10%! One solution is to measure for a longer time period, such as 100 seconds. If you do that and count 100 drops, now you know the answer is either 100 or 101 drops in 100 seconds, which is at most a 1% error. If you measure even longer, you can get the error lower, but you'd have to measure for an infinite amount of time to get the error to 0. * Measuring ever smaller distances requires ever more energy, as you need higher frequency waves to investigate smaller distances (otherwise, the distance is smaller than the wave itself), and creating higher frequency waves requires more energy. If you wanted to measure something at the plank scale, you'd need a massive amount of energy—so much, in fact, that long before you got there, this energy would collapse into a black hole, and then the very information you were looking for would be trapped behind the black hole's event horizon, preventing you from ever seeing it.* We actually expected the Large Hadron Collider to create tiny black holes! Apparently, this was no big deal, as all black holes evaporate over time (turning into Hawking radiation), and these tiny ones would evaporate almost instantly. * A ""brane"" is a bit like a boundary for the universe or a dimension. It's like the crust on bread. Branes are always lower dimensions than whatever they surround (e.g., 2d crust on 3d bread). It is possible that we live on one of these branes—for example, a 3d brane in a universe that has 4 dimensions (or more). Any particles in a brane can never get out of the brane—all physical interactions remain within the brane. So even though our universe might be 4+ dimensions, all our interactions would be have as if there are only 3 dimensions. The one exception to this rule is gravity, which must behave the same way in all dimensions.* One important note is that this book was published before the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) had come online. The LHC has now been running for a few years and scientists have been trying to use the data within it to verify many of the particle physics theories brought up in this book, including the ideas of branes and extra dimensions. So far, there has apparently been zero evidence that any of these theories are right (https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-n...). No new particles have been found; no missing or extra energy; nothing (other than the Higgs Boson, which is actually part of the standard model). Apparently, this is causing a bit of a crisis in the theoretical physics community (https://www.quora.com/I-have-just-rea...). I found many of these concepts to be delightfully mind bending. The world is nothing like what we perceive. Humans used to believe the earth was flat or that the sun revolved around the earth; changing these notions changed everything about the world. I imagine discovering the true nature of matter will change the world profoundly yet again."
21,0060531096,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15254149-gavin-smith,2,"I didn't find this book as irritating as some others around here seem to have found it. I can definitely, however, agree with the most common criticisms. The whole book suffers from a bloat borne of repetition and very odd, distracting analogies. Very, very often the same information is repeated several times, seemingly building to some greater point, only for the chapter to end with a bullet point summary of those same, repeated points. And about those analogies, I cannot recall one of them that actually added any clarity. There were several points during the book that I found myself wondering if I was reading an explanation, a joke, or a pop culture reference. As has been pointed out by several other reviewers, the phrase, ""Feel free to skip this part"" should never appear so many times in any kind of book. In some ways the book is a victim of timing. As it was published some years before the opening of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, there is a certain sense of wheel spinning as theory waits for experimental verification. Perhaps if Warped Passages had been written ten or so years later there may have been more substance and less need for filler.There are some positives, though. I definitely learned some things about theoretical physics. I found Randall's review of scientific progress and theory quite succinct and clear when free of those largely unnecessary analogies. I suppose Warped Passages could possibly make a reasonable jumping on point if you were inclined to really start reading about extra dimensions. I confess that I am not."
22,0060531096,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6157820-matthew,3,"It can be difficult to try and explain abstract theoretical physics concepts with just analogies and no equations, but Randall does a reasonably good job of describing the main points of interest and research in her field. Some of the analogies miss the mark and the attempted conference-style humor throughout, including the little fictional narrative sections at the start of each chapter, is a little awkward, but overall I came away having learned something about string theory, extra dimensions, the hierarchy problem and the ambiguous nature of dimensions themselves.Towards the end of the book, Randall describes her work on two theories, RS1 and RS2. Throughout the middle section of the book, there is a growing emphasis on the urgency of resolving the hierarchy problem, or the question 'why is gravity so weak?' RS1 is presented as a possible solution to that, but then RS2 does not appear to address the question at all, which I found a little odd.Also, the book was written in 2005, and alludes to the 'upcoming' results from the LHC. The LHC has been operational for several years now, so some of the ideas in the book may be obsolete at this stage. "
23,0060531096,http://goodreads.com/user/show/818356-ron,1,"I thought this book, particularly when compared to, say, Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe, continually fell short of its ambitions. It's prose is only adequate and often misestimates the lay reader's level of understanding. I also found it annoying for its frequent injection of self-promotion. I can well understand that Randall might have much to say about being female and a physicist, but there is a kind of thinly-hidden effort to impress us as a kind of uber-babe, a rock climbing, equation slinging woman who has her fair share of beauxs."

27,0060531096,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49575307-rodney-harvill,4,"At one point while I was reading this book (Kindle version), an acquaintance noticed me reading and asked me what I was reading. Knowing that I am a prolific reader, he commented on how normal it was to see me reading and asked me what I was reading. So, I told him that the book was about particle physics, quantum mechanics and string theory. He immediately said, “Enjoy your book!” and walked away. While my characterization of this book to him was somewhat accurate, it was also an over-simplification in the interest of concisely communicating the subject matter of the book. And I enjoyed the book, as Doctor Randall is a talented writer.One of the big questions in physics is why things are the way they are. For example, why do the different fundamental forces (strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force, electromagnetic force and gravity) have radically different strengths and effective ranges? As explained in this book, physicists have already developed theories to unify the first three forces, but bringing gravity into the fold has presented challenges. Not only do proposed formulations have to make mathematical sense, they also need to be experimentally verifiable, usually via particle accelerator experimentation. Interestingly enough, the most promising formulations involve multiple space-time dimensions aside from the four we know (three spatial dimensions and time), and sometimes subsets of dimensions are organized into groupings know as branes. Of course, the idea of extra dimensions prompts various valid questions:•	Where are they?•	How big are they?•	How are they shaped?•	Why can’t we “see” them?In addressing these questions, Doctor Randall discusses various proposed theoretical formulations with different numbers of dimensions and branes, one of which is featured more prominently because she was one of the developers of it. Interestingly enough, some of these formulations, as different as they are in fundamental properties such as the number of dimensions, etc., provide identical physical predictions. Even more strange, some of them are mathematically interchangeable such that one problem might be intractable in one formulation but solvable in another. In such cases, physicists use the formulation that gives them a reasonable chance for an answer. I can’t say that I blame them. That said, Doctor Randall finds such situations exciting and questions whether the interchangeability of formulations is an indication that we don’t have a full understanding of what a dimension is. As for me, my engineer brain finds the same situation a bit troubling. If different formulations provide the same physical predictions, how can we know which one is right?One thing I appreciated about the book was the high-level explanation of the process of experimental verification in particle accelerators. Doctor Randall’s descriptions of how sensitive the accelerators at CERN to outside influences such as the water level in Lake Geneva and the transit of an electric train were absolutely intriguing. As she noted, some of the physical predictions of her own formulations were potentially verifiable in the Large Hadron Collider, which was not yet on-line when she wrote this book. Now that it is on-line, I am curious how they have fared. Perhaps she has written or will write another book about that. I am sure such a book would be quite interesting."
28,0060531096,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15797133-will,3,"""Towards the end of the 1990s, many physicists, myself included, expanded their horizons to include the possibility of branes. We asked ourselves, 'What if there were a higher-dimensional universe in which the particles and forces we know about didn't travel in all dimensions, but are confined to fewer dimensions on a lower-dimensional brane?'Brane scenarios introduced many new possibilities for the global nature of spacetime. If Standard Model particles are confined to a brane, then we are as well, since we and the cosmos that surrounds us are composed of these particles. Furthermore, not all particles have to be on the same brane. There might therefore be entirely new and unfamiliar particles that experience different forces and interactions from the ones we know. The particles and forces we observe might be only a small part of a much larger universe. Two physicists from Cornell, Henry Tye and Zurab Kakushadze, coined the term 'braneworlds' to label such scenarios. Henry told me that he used the term so that he could, in one fell swoop, describe all the many ways in which the universe could include branes without being wedded to any particular possibility.Although the proliferation of potential braneworlds might be frustrating to string theorists trying to derive a single theory of the world, it is also thrilling. These are all real possibilities for the world in which we live, and one of them might truly describe it. And because the rules of particle physics would be somewhat different in a higher-dimensional universe than particle physicists have assumed, extra dimensions introduce new ways of trying to address some of the puzzling features of the Standard Model. Although these ideas are speculative, braneworlds that address problems in particle physics should soon be testable in collider experiments. This means that experiments, rather than our prejudice, could ultimately decide whether these ideas apply to our world."""

Now I am awaiting the validation of the Higgs boson (the so-called ""god"" Particle), which I believe is the only thing that will save me from the mess in which I find myself.Seriously, I am a novice physics junkie, who understands only a little about physics, but loves adding to my inventory of what physicists suspect. I love the intrigue but find the language a little difficult to rapidly read about one of my favorite subjects; however, Ms. Randall's treatise contains a glossary at the end, which (had I read it in hardback I would have found earlier) allowed me to better understand the language of this exciting science. This book's composition is excellent and its content is very easy to follow: at the beginning of each chapter, the author relates fairy tales so the reader may pause to regroup; she further uses every day analogies which give the reader virtual images to demonstrate things no one on this planet can actually see. She uses a garden hose to demonstrate the force and gravity of how particles (or other very small, unseen, items) act in a world physicists mathematically know are there, but cannot produce in actuality.Highly recommended; I will read her other books when Higgs boson acts to save me from this Black hole. Thanks, Ms. Randall."

As I may have stated elsewhere, my goal is to read that B. Greene list so I chose to re-read ""Warped Passages"".This book is not an easy read. It leads up to an explanation of RS1 and RS2, two papers written by Randal and Sundrum describing a theory to solve the Hierarchical Problem. There is a lot of material to cover to even understand what the Hierarchical Problem is and why it is such a big problem, or was..., in the physics community. This material includes special and general relativity, quantum mechanics, and string theory. It also explores the topic of dimensions: what is the meaning of dimension, rolled-up dimensions, a large fifth dimension, 10 dimensions....The book is a little dated having been published before the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) went on line and discovered the Higgs particle or field, the field that gives all matter their mass. But Ms. Randall describes what to expect from the LHC. It was was interesting to compare her ""speculations"" to what has been discovered so far. For example, correct about the Higgs, maybe wrong about KK particles. The big question of coming out of this work is, ""What is the nature of dimension?"""
31,0060531096,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4851109-heng,5,"The most remarkable thing about this book is its accessibility. Lisa Randall can explain a deep concept in a relatively common language so that laypeople can appreciate the beauties of advanced physics. The beginning chapters could be a little draw out especially if one has some knowledge of the topics. However, all the foundations are laid that way for the explanations of the final models that she discovered with colleagues. The analogies and anecdotes along the way make reading the book so much more enjoyable. It is fascinating how physicists have to come up with wild ideas to explain our current world and how their ideas could be proven wrong. Another thing, the book came out in 2005 and many of the models could have been proven or disproven, which I haven't followed up yet. However, the narratives and the historical values of the models themselves are totally worth the reads, even if they are totally wrong. Highly recommend to anybody who wants to get some knowledge on the topic. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have. "

She explains her way to her ground breaking work on developing the Randall-Sundrum and Karch-Randall models for the universe. She describes the exciting possibility of the LHC providing evidence for any of these (or similar) models. It's a book I have wanted to read for a while and I am glad I read it to the end.However, though I found her analogies creative and very useful, they were too repetitive. Repetitions might help in a classroom (or audiobook) but one can always just re-read the previous paragraph, as needed.

Personally I find it understandable with many similar life examples to compare to unimaginable and invisible particle physics. However I got stuck at the same place : Membrance and M-theory.

She did a lot of setting up more than half the book before even getting to the brane models that are the centerpiece of the book. Thus, the reader does get quite a recap of the major developments in the 20th century.C on the author’s writing style, at least on this book, because I haven’t read her other ones. She repeats herself quite often. Her illustrative stories with silly characters were boring and accomplished nothing.

It seemed like we were missing Newtons hand of god in some places.Hadn't history down that generally new advances replace old theories not keep the parts that work but magically offer different solution for what works?I'm giving three stars because the beginning was very good the description of the existing model.Also, correct me if wrong.

An unique writing style with a perfect balance between the technical aspects without going so technical, perfect for non-physicists (as myself).

59,0060531096,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,3,"The full title is ""Warped Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe's Hidden Dimensions"", which makes it sound like pseudo-science claptrap about the Beyond. It's not, actually, it's string theory and brane theory and the other things physicists have worked on since they stopped getting government money for new atom-smashers. So it just sounds like pseudo-science, but it isn't really. Or is it?It should be an easy question to answer. Lisa Randall has been a tenured theoretical physicist at MIT and Harvard, and she's writing a book on theoretical physics. When Richard Dawkins writes about evolutionary theory, or Steven Pinker writes about linguistics, we don't have to wonder if what we're reading is pseudo-science. But when we are discussing whether or not there are actually 11 dimensions in space (plus time), rather than the 3 we are accustomed to, it is disturbingly like discussing how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. There are no, repeat no empirical data to prove this one way or the other. Theory without the test of data, seems to me more like pseudo-science than the real thing.So why read the book? Well, because it was quite a while before many parts of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity were proven, yet physicists could tell beforehand (especially the younger ones) that this Einstein fellow was onto something. It's not as if the theory of 11 dimensions is logically impossible to test, so someday we will know, even if we have to wait for the Europeans to smash atoms together at high enough energy to test (because the atom-smasher we were building up in Waxahachie got canceled).In the meantime, super-smarties like Lisa Randall are trying out the math involved, trying to figure out with pencil and paper (and the occasional supercomputer) what the answers might be. Then she tries to explain to us, using two dimensions (pictures on paper), what a 5 or even 11-dimensional world might be like.To give us an idea of how there might be more dimensions than we realize, she uses the analogy of the inside of a garden hose. If you're an ant, this is reasonably close to three dimensional. If you're a rat, this might as well be one dimensional, because the only question with regard to your movement is whether it is forward or backwards. To an ant on the outside of the garden hose, it's more like two-dimensional, with one of the dimensions curled up.There are actually a lot of garden hoses and sprinklers in this book, plus some ""Alice in Wonderland"" like mini-stories about Athena and Ichabod, who spend their life (actually lives) flitting from three dimensions to many, traveling in time, shrinking down to the Planck dimension and so on. I don't know if all that really helps with understanding the topic, but it does give your brain a break from the heavy lifting.Which isn't all that heavy, really, since she's not showing us the math that is required to understand these theories. Just the idea of what kind of theories exist nowadays for the Theory Formerly Known as String (it's now filled more with (mem)branes than with strings). She lets you know which parts of each chapter you can safely skip if your brain is full, and at the end of each chapter she gives a short bullet list called ""What to Remember"". Which is a fairly exceptional admission on the part of the author that one will not always find it easy to remember statements like, ""You would not use perturbation theory in the strongly interacting string theory itself [you're right, I sure wouldn't], but in a superficially entirely different theory: weakly interacting, eleven-dimensional supergravity [not even my spellchecker understands what that means].""But if you're willing to exert your brain just a bit, Randall will meet you more than halfway, and leaven it with the occasional dose of frivolity. Turn off the TV. Put down the astrology column. Pick up a big freakin' book about physics. There's a world of strings, branes, warped space, and extra dimensions that await you, and in a few years we might even find out it's all science."
