0,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/905728-kent,3,"I think I would give this book 3.5 stars if I could.The book discusses ""12 principles for surviving and thriving at work, home, and school."" The real focus seems feels like how we can use this to improve schools. The 12 rules are:EXERCISE | Rule #1: Exercise boosts brain power.SURVIVAL | Rule #2: The human brain evolved, too.WIRING | Rule #3: Every brain is wired differently.ATTENTION | Rule #4: We don't pay attention to boring things.SHORT-TERM MEMORY | Rule #5: Repeat to remember.LONG-TERM MEMORY | Rule #6: Remember to repeat.SLEEP | Rule #7: Sleep well, think well.STRESS | Rule #8: Stressed brains don't learn the same way as non-stressedSENSORY INTEGRATION | Rule #9: Stimulate more of the senses.VISION | Rule #10: Vision trumps all other senses.GENDER | Rule #11: Male and female brains are different.EXPLORATION | Rule #12: We are powerful and natural explorers.The underlying tone really seems focused on improving education and schools. He covers each of the different principles and backs it up with research.Some sections are better than others. He's not quite as engaging as Dr. Oliver Sacks, but in the overall context of putting things together to form an overall idea of improving education based on how the brain works, it is pretty engaging. He does do a good job of keeping it light and easy to understand. At times this almost gets annoying, but it does make for an easy to read book. A lot of the material I've read elsewhere, but this book does a good job of tying it all together.There is a DVD included (I haven't had a chance to view it yet) and an accompanying web site. If you just want to get the highlights of the 12 principles, checkout the web site. If you want to get the research behind the 12 principles, get the book. The content of the website actually nicely summarizes the 12 principles."
1,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,4,"I kind of loved this book because it give a lot of the ""why"" - the science - behind a lot of best practices. This is the kind of thing that helps me change my behavior - when I know how it works under the hood.The book is broken into a series of ""brain rules"" on different subjects. I'll list main takeaways:ExerciseWe all know it's good for us and it feels good and we should do it. The best quote here was ""Physical activity is cognitive candy."" - also ""A lifetime of exercise results in a sometimes astonishing elevation in cognitive performance, compared with those who are sedentary."" The basic science is that blood flow through your brain is good for it and increases brain activity. Tip: exercise before you need your brain to be at its best.SleepFirst, great to have validation that there really are early birds and night owls. I'm definitely a night owl, despite my kids best efforts. The interesting implications of this for a company are that people are at their best - their most productive - at different times of the day - so building a culture that is flexible and let's people work their hours is key. The science about the history of naps and the fact that the mid-afternoon slump is a real thing was also very interesting. The studies about sleep loss being as cognitively limiting as alcohol were also illuminating. Another study showed sleeping on a problem really does work. But the most interesting thing about the sleep chapter was the section on dreaming and what it might mean. In particular, dreams may at least in large part be a method of neural network training to enforce learning. ""humans appear to replay certain learning experiences at night, during the slow-wave phase."" StressToo much stress is bad for you - our systems weren't designed for constant stress. If you have too much adreline in your system constantly it leads to scarred blood vessels and then eventually a stroke. But a little stress is good - our brains will remember things that we are stressed about better (eg avoid predators on the savannah). But too much (chronic) stress can overwhelms the brain and hurts learning and can even make you depressed. Chronic stress is often the culprit in grief, or high anxiety households. The worst kind of stress is the feeling that you have no control over the problem— you are helpless.Wiring“What you do and learn in life physically changes what your brain looks like— it literally rewires it.”AttentionI’ve said for a long time that humans don’t remember facts, we remember facts couched in emotions. We can easily recall all the strong emotional moments of our lives as if they happened yesterday. Now it’s great to have the science behind this: emotions release dopamine, which greatly aids in memory and information processing. This means that people will relate better to products that bring up positive emotions for them. It also means that an emotional hook to lead into an idea or product will always work as it triggers the emotion in the person.“Emotionally charged events are better remembered—for longer, and with more accuracy—than neutral events.”Another interesting thing mentioned in this chapter is the 10 minute rule. We only have about 10 minutes of attention on something before we start to tune out. As the book says, “This fact suggests a teaching and business imperative: Find a way to get and hold somebody’s attention for 10 minutes, then do it again.” To get an idea to stick you have to give people the mental model for it first - “meaning before details”. Specifically, you need to: “Give the general idea first, before diving into details, and you will see a 40 percent improvement in understanding.” And then you also have to simplify and hammer home concepts and let people digest them - force-feeding too many concepts at once won’t sink in. In terms of paying attention (vs automatic things like riding a bicycle), “Multitasking, when it comes to paying attention, is a myth.” - the brain can only pay attention to one thing at a time. MemoryThere are different types of memory: declarative (I can remember my address and SSN), non declarative (I can remember how to ride a bike), short term, and long term. Short term memory isn’t converted to long term easily: “People usually forget 90 percent of what they learn in a class within 30 days. And the majority of this forgetting occurs within the first few hours after class.”. Keys to doing so are coding in emotion (why word association works), and repetition (“repeat to remember”). Also, thinking about what tree the person will mentally group the information and how to increase entry points or create strong ones. Interestingly, “Memory worked best, it appeared, if the environmental conditions at retrieval mimicked the environmental conditions at encoding.”. This means if you learn something sad you will remember it better if you get sad again. Fascinating. This makes sense, as our brains must group similar patterns it remembers together. To get practical, you can create science, art, language stations to help people remember better.We all know this to be true - our memory isn’t perfect. This is because we remember patterns, not facts or single instances. “Our brains give us only an approximate view of reality, because they mix new knowledge with past memories and store them together as one.”Another tidbit I liked, that fits in the “repeat to remember” bucket: “A great deal of research shows that thinking or talking about an event immediately after it has occurred enhances memory for that event”. Basically the more an idea can be repeated - especially in timed intervals - the more chance it has of being encoded from short term to long term memory. Sensory IntegrationWe remember data from each of our senses, and we learn best if we stimulate multiple senses concurrently. You remember better if you see AND hear something, or even if given words and pictures. Smells or sounds or tastes can trigger additional associations or emotions and help us create positive or negative associations to things we see or do. This is why people who haven’t adopted digital reading say things like “I love the smell of a good book”, this is why smelling fresh roasted coffee is a key part of Starbucks playbook. Smells have the power to bring back memories that are associated with them. VisionVision trumps and overrides all other senses. I loved the story about the wine experts who were fooled by white wine with red dye in it because their eyes said it was red wine. Fascinating to read about the science of how the brain takes in the signals from the eyes, combines both signals, and applies pattern matching to fill in details. This means the brain has creative freedom to insert whatever it wants into our vision. Practical applications: our vision is caught by bold colors, orientations, motion. We remember images better than words because it’s easier to pattern match the image, so use images in presentations. MusicMusic makes us more empathic - we can better recognize the emotions in speech, which helps in social abilities. Making music is 10x better for kids than listening to baby einstein CD’s. Listening to music reduced cortisol and stress. GenderBoys and girls have different brain structures. When under stress, men remember the gist of things better, and women remember details and emotions. These quotes describe it well:“The difference between girls’ and boys’ communication could be described as the addition of a single powerful word. Boys might say, “Do this.” Girls would say, “Let’s do this.”“When girl best friends communicate with each other, they lean in, maintain eye contact, and do a lot of talking. They use their sophisticated verbal talents to cement their relationships. Boys never do this. They rarely face each other directly, preferring either parallel or oblique angles. They make little eye contact, their gaze always casting about the room. They do not use verbal information to cement their relationships. Instead, commotion seems to be the central currency of a little boy’s social economy. Doing things physically together is the glue that cements their relationships.”“In our evolutionary history, having a team that could understand both the gist and details of a given stressful situation helped us conquer the world. Why would the world of business be exempted from that advantage? Having an executive team or work group capable of simultaneously understanding both the emotional forests and the trees of a stressful project, such as a merger, might be a marriage made in business heaven. It could even affect the bottom line.”ExplorationWe learn by doing, by exploring the world. We take pleasure in that exploration. Discovery based learning is best. Medical school offers the best on the job learning - other types of education should do better to model it. Learn and be curious."
2,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1905601-sarah-hanawald,4,"Brain rules is really well organized. It's a very un-boring synthesis of current neuroscience research into very comprehensible terms. I only give it four stars because the author (openly) says that the educational implications of the findings are not clear. Some major take-aways, along with my questions and ruminations:Attention:Emotional arousal helps the brain learn. Number of minutes a person can pay attention to presentation style information (a lecture) is the same as their age, up to 10. After that, it’s 10. So, you need a hook every 10 minutes. In particular, a hook that resonates emotionally. BUT—has to be connected to what you’re teaching.Brains like the gist, or general ideas first and learn better this way. Experts forget that their audience is built up of novices. MemoryEven long-term memory is malleable. New information makes the old long-term memory as though it were all new information. Elaborate encoding means we are more likely to remember new information.Repetition is key. Exactly what intervals are best is unknown.Sleep is so important:Really must not do meetings during nap time. Naps are healthy. We have a biological drive for a nap.Procedural learning improves tremendously when learning and practice are separated by a period of sleep. Example—model a method for solving a math problem that can be simplified. Have student try it. Then, let them sleep on it. The next day, give several problems of that type.sleeping between modeling and problem set triples the likelihood that a student will discover the simpler way to solve the problem.During sleep we close out the outside world and brain works wildly to process input from the day.We imagine the near future much more vividly than the far future. We need to work on this to make people less short sighted.Learned Helplessness is a term we shouldn’t use. It is not kids who ask for help before they try something themselves. It’s those who have been abused at random so much that they feel they have no control over their environment.Our stress responses are designed to solve a problem in a few minutes, not long term (ie-the saber tooth tiger either ate you or you got away.) I don’t know if I believe this, what about drought?One of the greatest predictors of student success in school is the stability of the home life.Gottman and Shapiro studied marriages and found that when the adults had better coping skills and were more stable, the kids physiologically changed. Sorry for the note form on this review."

But I find his writing style incredibly annoying -- full of anecdotes that don't really have a very tight connection to the content of the chapter. Then, midway thru the book, you learn that he finds that 10-minute chunks interspersed with anecdotes helps students pay attention in lecture. I totally accept that for an oral presentation. But in a written text, it's really annoying. I'm used to reading nonfiction that doesn't seem to be talking down to me like I'm 17. "
4,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3990525-crystal-starr-light,4,"Bullet Review:This was a fun little book that talked about the various ""oddities"" of your brain and have some ideas for helping to use your brain the way it was built. I have found I really enjoy learning about the brain, as it is a strange and kinda mysterious organ - this book was no disappointment in that regard (although several topics I had read in different books).Full Review:(NOTE: I wasn't going to do one...and then Amazon asked me to review, and since I did buy on Kindle, I felt, oh, well, why not? So here's a ""full review"", as best as I can muster.)""Brain Rules"" is a fun book exploring the intricacies of the brain - what makes it tick, the way we process information and how it all links back to our ancestors surviving on the plains. John Medina has 12 ""rules"" of the brain, which he explains along with providing perhaps helpful tips to use the brain more fully.I never really realized how much I liked psychology until I started to read books like this. I didn't realize psychology looked so much into how weird our brain is - which is something that has intrigued me since I watched the Illusions episode of Bill Nye as a young adult/teen. Ever since then, I've sought out books, such as this one, to learn more about our brain and how to better utilize it.Fortunately, while this book had some overlap with other psychology texts I've read (including the Myth of Baby Mozart), there was enough new and different material that I didn't feel the book was ""a waste of time"" (or better, just plain repetitive). I think what really makes this book stand out is that it tries to incorporate ways to adapt to how your brain thinks - such as getting more exercise in (treadmill while typing, anyone?) or encouraging children to take music lessons (note: this is different than Baby Mozart, in that children do better when LEARNING to play an instrument, not just listening to Mozart).Medina has a great writing style; it's incredibly informative but not too heavy-laden with psychology and biology language to make the common person stop in frustration.I really enjoyed Brain Rules and would recommend to others who love to learn more about how their brain works and how to adapt to its idiosyncrasies. Further, I would not mind reading Medina's other works."
5,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/678133-susan,5,"This is a fabulous book I wish had been written before I started baby-making 30 years ago! It does confirm for me that I did a lot of things right as a parent, but I would have benefited as a mom from knowing things now clearly related by John Medina on when an infant is learning what much more precisely than I knew from observation and experience alone. the information in this book is priceless for any parent and any person who intends to live life healthily, influence people positively and make a difference in the world. It should be read by anyone in psychology, psychiatry, infant and child development, parenting, and healthy living at any age/stage of life."
6,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/797190-elizabeth,4,"We participated in a research study led by this author last year, so I was curious to read this book. John Medina was an engaging and thought-provoking speaker, and this is an engaging and thought-provoking. It took a while to read because I had to stop and think after each section. It was relevant to teaching in many ways, but also to life in general. "
7,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/662755-john,5,"Finally finished “Brain Rules” by John Medina. Fascinating how simple habits can boost our brain power. Seemingly passive and low impact activities like exercise and sleeping enhance our thinking ability (we’ve all heard this before, but the author provides compelling explanations as to why this is the case).There’s also an interesting discussion on multitasking (apparently it’s true you can do two things at once, just not as well as if you weren’t trying to multitask).A well written and engaging book. I recommend it to everyone from artists to business owners since it reveals some little known facts on how to amplify your productivity and sense of well-being."
8,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,3,"The author, a lecturer, researcher, and molecular biologist, lists twelve major principles that help explain how the brain works: though processes are improved by physical exercise, we pay attention to evolutionarily important things like sex and danger, we need sleep to cogitate properly, repetition is crucial to long-term memory, we learn more through a variety of sensory inputs, gender influences how our brain process certain interactions, and so on. In most of the chapters, he goes on to advocate for the integration of these findings into education, thus revolutionizing the traditional classroom.This book is widely praised for its clear, lucid prose, but I didn’t come away all that impressed. I felt that Medina took up too much space describing various sections of the brain to no real purpose. Does it really help our understanding of how the brain works to visualize axons and brain sections and cells and neurons as, variously, stomped eggs, a scorpion with an egg on its back, or uprooted trees jammed together horizontally? There’s no relation between its physical structure and how it works, so what’s the point? (In the same vein, I was bemused by his habit of describing nearly every scientist he refers to. I simply don’t care whether a man looks youthful or his head is shaped like an egg; indeed, such dwelling on looks turns me off an author.) I also thought that Medina (using tricks based on principles of attention) relied too much on cutesy and misleading attention-grabbers like “we’ll learn that we each have a Jennifer Aniston neuron” (no, we don’t) or “we’ll learn the difference between bicycles and Social Security numbers” (overly playful and not at all accurate). I find deliberately misleading teasers like that to be insulting rather than enticing. Finally and most importantly, most of these principles are extremely basic. (Is it really cutting-edge news that repetition is important when learning, or that we need sleep, or that some people crumple under stress while others rise to the challenge, or that people need to feel safe in order to learn?) Despite that, Medina several times in the book proposes sweeping, pie-in-the-sky “solutions” to education problems based on this research, such as restructuring the school day into short lessons, the same content repeated three times, and thus stretching the school year into the summer to make room for all the information; or offering an early work- or schoolday as well as a later one to accommodate different sleep cycles; or mandating child care and parent classes to everyone. Some of these aren’t bad ideas; it’s just that they aren’t going to happen any time soon. Some reasonable, easily-implemented changes that could provide some benefit would have been better. It is an interesting, if basic, primer on the brain, and it is told lucidly; I just didn’t feel there was much point to it, let alone help for “surviving and thriving,” as the subtitle boasts. "
9,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1298212-michelle,5,"As always, I need to declare my preference for fiction. That said, let me recommend this book. Author and molecular biologist, John Medina, does a great job capturing the reader with brain research, of all things. Clearly a subject that could lull the layperson into a comatose state, Medina follows his own advice in this text. Chapters are not overly long; each reading objective is clearly stated, and he reviews the salient items at the end of each chapter, with three or four bulleted items. To help you understand and remember complex ideas, he shares anecdotes and narratives from his own life, as well as unusual stories from scientific research. One such story illustrated working memory (or storage and retrieval--I can't remember which): A man could remember ridiculously long lists of words after reading them only once, and then recall them with one hundred percent accuracy over twenty years later! These anecdotal interludes, plus the straightforward, simple writing will keep any reader engaged. Additionally, readers will develop a deeper understanding of what the brain 'likes' in terms of maintaining attention, as well as recalling information. A little humor helps to lighten the cerebral load. Highly recommended to teachers, high school age students, and parents. "
10,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/757602-lars-guthrie,5,"My sister and I both work with kids and have our own little book club where we read works that are related to learning, the brain, and child development. While she liked 'Brain Rules,' she critiqued for being 'pop.' I get that, but I really liked the book. We read it after seeing Medina give an enthusiastic and inspiring presentation at the Learning and the Brain Conference several months ago in San Francisco. He's definitely a salesman type with his own shtick, but for me, it works. I was reading an excellent, but all-encompassing book by Fernette and Brock Eide, 'The Mislabeled Child,' at the same time (still on that one) as 'Brain Rules,' and enjoyed having something a bit less weighty that still made me rethink how kids learn. One of the key points Medina made at that conference was a possible way we can screen for good teachers--the concept of Theory of Mind. Medina essentially turned around current examination of that concept, the ability to think about what others are thinking about. Lots of fascinating work is being done with children trying to discover how much an awareness that others have thoughts as well as oneself is innate, rather than learned. Early identification of a Theory of Mind deficit might help children with communicative disorders like those on the autism spectrum.Instead of just looking at children's Theory of Mind, Medina proposes that we look at teachers' ability to understand what others are thinking. He noted that learning is constructed and breakdowns occur when there are 'gaps' caused by faulty understanding of underlying concepts. Teachers cannot assume kids get what they are teaching, and move forward in linear fashion. They must listen to what the kids say, and be able to interpret, evaluate and return to their students' understanding. And they have to do that not with a few students but with an entire classroom. That's an astounding ability. When we think about great teachers, we intuitively recognize that ability. Usually the teachers we remember and admire brought not only an enthusiasm for their subject to the classroom, but empathy. Good teachers respect what their students say, reinforce what is correct about their understanding, and direct them in positive ways to rethink faulty assumptions. Perhaps, Medina says, 'an advanced skill set in Theory of Mind predicts a good teacher.' If that is true, 'existing Theory of Mind tests could be used like Myers-Briggs personality tests to reveal good teachers from bad, or to help people considering careers as teachers.'With that idea, Medina certainly engaged me at the conference, and once again in Rule #3 of his book, 'Every brain is wired differently.' The book is framed as twelve of these 'rules.' Each one of them really got me reviewing and modifying my own understanding of the brain. For example, with his rule ('Rule #5: Repeat to remember') and discussion on short-term memory, Medina makes a discerning distinction between declarative and nondeclarative memories. While we consciously retrieve the former as we recall information such as the names of the presidents, we do not do so when we remember how to ride a bike. I've really been thinking a lot about this motor-skill type of memory and its connection to the reading process, which we want to be automatic and subconscious. As someone who teaches that process, I'm still working on assimilating Medina's thoughts on the 'inefficiency of text.' However proficient you are as a reader, he notes, you still must 'stop and ponder individual textual features.' While it's clear to me that reading is not 'natural' for humans, I am not sure I can completely accept that 'pictures are a more efficient mechanism of information than text.' If that's so, why did Medina bother writing his book?That's an issue I'll have to keep reconsidering, which can't be a bad thing. Whether or not we should follow the 'USA Today' principle ('less text, more pictures'), as Medina suggests, I have no doubt that a multisensory approach to all learning is beneficial.Medina prompts us to think about memory and sensory experience in another surprising way, by noting that elaboration is a good thing. 'More pieces of intellectual baggage to inventory should make learning more difficult,' he writes. However, 'extra cognitive processing...helps the learner to integrate...new material with prior information.' I loved the way Medina encapsulates this concept: 'We know that information is remembered best when it is elaborate, meaningful, and contextual.' My reading of 'Brain Rules' was certainly enhanced by going to Medina's website and watching the short slide shows and videos that supplemented his text (material also available on a CD that accompanies the book). It was also enhanced by more reading, that artificial information-gathering process. In a bit of synchronicity, I read the Eides' observation in 'The Mislabeled Child': 'Because children with poor language output can't effectively elaborate information, they'll have far greater difficulty with many kinds of language-based learning.'Another nice connection I made gets back to the idea of children's innate capacity for learning. Medina points out that babies seem to come equipped with the scientific method: 'Hypothesis testing...is the way babies gather information. They use a series of increasingly self-corrected ideas to figure out how the world works.'Paul Bloom, a scientist at Yale has just completed a wonderful study of babies' 'rich understanding of objects and people' (see his New York Times article: 'The Moral Life of Babies' at http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/09/mag...). He comments, 'Babies might start off smart, because it enables them to get smarter.'Despite criticisms that could be made of Medina's easy-to-read format as superficial, this book really got me thinking and rethinking about learning and teaching, memory, sleeping (which Medina says is an active learning time we need, rather that merely a restorative period), and so much more. It's a useful introduction to recent brain research for beginners, as well as great elaboration on that subject for those with more knowledge.Highly recommended. "
11,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32360-john,3,"A very straightforward read on the latest advance in the understanding of how the brain works. A lot of the chapters draw from some of the accessible trade books on cognitive development. Stories from Deborah Tannen, Oliver Sachs, Howard Gardner, Steven Jay Gould, etc. add stories and examples to Medina's main structure of the book. The book is organized around 12 principles that Medina feels are necessary to a healthy brain (due to what Medina sees as evolutionary factors). The first principle is that physical exercise helps keep our brains active as well. Our ancestors were active and our brains adapted to that environment and still rely on our mobility. The second principle is that our brains evolved to survive our environment and we have thousands of years of outdoor living to overcome to deal with the past hundred years of technology. The third principle is that each of our brains are uniquely wired. It's impossible to develop a standard model of the brain because each one is vastly different.The 4th is that we can only pay attention for about 10 minutes before our attention drifts. Medina focuses on how teachers and presenters need to keep their audience focused through short learning modules.The 5th is that we can improve our short-term memory by cycling through memories several times in a limited time period.The mid-principle explores how our long-term memories work to retain knowledge. The 7th principle examines how we need sleep to allow our brain to think.The 8th principle is that stress is really bad for our thinking.Number 9 (appropriately), is about how we make sense of the world around us using our senses in conjunction with one another, except for Vision, which overrules all other senses. This is principle 10 which says we literally see to believe.Principle 11 is all about gender: men's brains process things in a general sense, while women's brains seem to have better control of details.The last principle is that we explore the world around us. Exploration is how we as a species evolved and how our brain develops from infancy to adulthood. The book has a website at brainrules.net which has a breakdown of the book as well as exercises and resources for each of the rules. "
12,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549698-nathan,4,"A solid attempt at making a practical (useful) book on how the brain works, aimed at everyday people. He focuses on memory and efficiency, and writes in an engaging style. As a long-time researcher in the field he has the science cred, and he explains it well. There's a website (brainrules.net I think) that goes with the book, and when the book is released for real (I got a galley) it'll come with a DVD.My only complaint is that he's insufficiently scientific in the book. I wanted more hard numbers and facts about the trials of his techniques and fewer stories about people. His technique is very much to begin with an anecdote that makes the section real, but I tired of them by midway through the book. And it often seems that the critical parts of his suggestions remain untested and unproven in science.But its flaws don't prevent it from being worth reading. I'm trying to get my boy to focus using the techniques I read here, and I'm hoping I see some small improvements after only two days. Of course, that's just anecdotal ..."
13,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,3,"I read this for a cognitive learning group at work, kind of a self-help meets neuroscience attempt. Some of it was interesting, some of it was stuff most people 'know' but the scientific explanations solidified it, and some seemed a little bit of a stretch. "
14,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/138926-clint,5,"This subject matter is fast-becoming my favorite for non-fiction books. All this new neuroscience that has jumped up in the last twenty years has been overall pretty uplifting. The malleability of the brain, its connection with the body, and its amazing powers of regeneration and lifelong ability to change are overall pretty good news for a world that has kind of let itself slide into a damaging passivity and learned helplessness. This book isn't a business or education book, it's a pop science book, in the best way. The only thing to do with work and school is his suggestions at the end of chapters about how he would implement something or other in offices or schools. Honestly he's kind of a fascist when it comes to his ideal schools, but so what, great intentions.One cool thing I noticed was that in one part he talks about the attention span of the average mind, and how minds need a hook every ten minutes or so in order to stay interested in something, and that's EXACTLY how he writes every section of his book. I guess it worked, because I read this whole thing in bed through a really miserable sickness while my friends were partying their asses off. Oh well. I HAD A PARTY OF THE INTELLECT, BITCHES! *sob*"
15,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793094-lisa,3,"3.5John Medina explains 12 principles that involve the brain or thoughts that can help you in life. The copy I checked out from the library contained a dvd that gave an overview of the book that explained all of Medina's main points.This book is worth reading and its ideas are worth incorporating into your life.Watch this video to see if you might be interested in reading this book:Brain RulesFrom the book:

“If you wanted to create an education environment that was directly opposed to what the brain was good at doing, you probably would design something like a classroom. If you wanted to create a business environment that was directly opposed to what the brain was good at doing, you probably would design something like a cubicle. And if you wanted to change things, you might have to tear down both and start over.” "
16,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27969301-atif-shaikh,5,"The book lays out the core aspects of cognitive science in layman terms and is a fluid and entertaining read. The author keeps it clear from time to time what is established and what is experimental or state of the art in terms of our understanding of cognition. The chapters are very well organized, each focusing on a particular aspect of personal development and life choices. I learned a lot although I already had good understanding of chapters around memory but John's style of writing leads a sticky factor. A must read book for all growth mindset folks regardless of one's prior understanding and knowledge of the subject. Highly recommend it to all.

It's the kind of book you must talk about with others. And often! You lucky people! A lot of reference to the study of injured brains were found in it, so my main take away was this - wear a bike helmet. Every single time."

It's an easy read and takes you through 12 areas of your brain and you will come out the other end, better equipped to use your brain more effectively. In work, we could all do with an update on how to make ourselves a little better and use our brain power more efficiently and this book certainly goes some way to ""upgrade"" our thinking."

From gaining more productivity at work to absorbing more at school, mastering the “brain rules” will help make learning with all your senses become second nature.About the author: John Medina is a professor, research consultant and expert in molecular biology. He founded the Brain Center for Applied Learning Research and the Talaris Research Institute.My highlights:Regular exercise stimulates the body to renew itself and generates hormones to help the brain work.The more you exercise, the healthier and more robust your brain and body will be!You have a natural sleep cycle that is individual to you. Follow it and you’ll feel and think better.What exactly does sleeping do? Simply put, sleeping regenerates our mind and body.When it comes to sleeping patterns, there are three types: larks, owls and hummingbirds.Larks wake up often before 6 a.m. and are the most alert before noon. Some 10 percent of the population are classified as larks. In contrast, owls rarely hit the sack before 3 a.m., being most alert around 6 p.m. Owls too make up about 10 percent of the population.The rest of us are hummingbirds, fluctuating between the other two types. Sometimes we stay up late; sometimes we wake up before the sun rises.Chronic stress is debilitating, making you think poorly and lose memory. Reduce stress where you can.While a little stress can help you take action, too much stress is detrimental to your overall health.Your brain pays attention to stimuli it considers the most important. The rest is just noise.If you want your audience to pay attention to a presentation, for example, keep it under 10 minutes, as otherwise the abundance of information will overload the minds of your audience!Our brains store information if it's meaningful and doesn't interfere with other information.Information needs to be meaningful for our brains to remember it.If you have to memorize a piece of information, make it more meaningful by repeating the information to yourself at spaced intervals.Spaced intervals make your brain realize that the information you’re repeating and it's processing is important. It must be meaningful, your brain thinks, or you wouldn't be recalling it so often. And when your brain attaches meaning to something, it remembers it better.Our senses have evolved to work together. Multisensory environments can help you learn better.We don't learn as well in unisensory situations, in which only one sense is used.The benefits of multisensory experiences might seem counterintuitive. Wouldn’t a brain get overloaded with too much competing information? Yet our brains don't work that way. Research has shown that they prefer heavy lifting! So expose yourself to multisensory learning tools.To better remember facts, combine visuals with information. Our visual sense is the strongest.When people listen to information, they only recall about 10 percent of it after a period of three days. Yet if an image accompanies spoken information, people will remember 65 percent of the information after the same period.This is called the pictorial superiority effect. Final summaryThe human brain is a sophisticated information-transfer system. Optimize your mind by understanding better how it works. Exercise, get enough sleep and avoid chronic stress. Take advantage of multisensory learning and the pictorial superiority effect. In doing so, you’ll maximize your intellectual potential."

23,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2709426-jordan-price,2,"There were parts of this book I loved and parts I hated, so it was really difficult for me to figure out how to rate it. I loved the first chapter so much -- about how exercise makes your thinking sharper -- that I devoted a podcast episode to it. Other chapters were fascinating too, in particular the sleep chapter.However, there was a description of the making of foie gras on page 88 that was a dealbreaker for me. And because it came during the chapter on ""Attention,"" I presume it was a technique the author was employing to break the monotony of a bunch of dry scientific facts with an anecdote the listener would remember.I remembered it all right.So much so that I was enraged for the rest of the book, that the mere thought of the book makes me sick. So if this particular page could be stripped, the book would have rated a five for me. But the author's choice, to relay a deeply disturbing explanation about how animals are tortured for the sake of gluttony, tainted the book for me to the point where I'm going to need to give it a two. (He was using the explanation because it was so disturbing; it disturbed his mother to the point that she can't get it out of her head.)There are other incidents where disturbing animal experiments are described -- but those are experiments for the sake of medicine. The practice of making foie gras is a socially condoned torture for no reason other than the fact that a force-fed goose's liver tastes rich -- how insane that it even happens, that no one has put a stop to it. That we, as a society in general, condone it. And so the author's tactic has worked a bit too well here. I'll remember this book, all right. For the rest of my life.To be clear: I understand that the author does not condone foie gras. What I resent is the fact that I've been manipulated."
24,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7144160-angie,5,"This book is an extremely informative book. I wanted to read a book that would help me discover how and why our brains learn different ways. I didn’t want to read a book that was packed with scientific details that were hard to understand. John Medina combined the scientific details with common experiences and stories to create a revealing book that was enjoyable to read. Each chapter began with a different brain rule. Most of the brain rules that were highlighted in the book were common knowledge, but understanding why and how, make this an interesting book to read. Each chapter has the same layout, which I think makes the reading flow together. He begins with a short story that is related to that particular brain rule. The stories that are told allow the reader to understand how and why his theory works. The story grabs your attention, and then he proceeds to describe how it relates to the given principle. More examples are given to help you make connections with the topic. The scientific reasons are introduced, but not in too much depth that make it hard to read. Each chapter ends with ideas that will help you master that brain rule.  	The solutions and stories that are given in this book offer help for both young and older people. The ideas given to help you achieve are easy to follow and include in your everyday life. If some of the ideas could be integrated into a classroom, I think children could enhance their willingness to learn. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to increase their knowledge about how the brain learns. "
25,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9329641-ted-witt,4,"We expect that findings from scientific research will be quickly translated into everyday practice when it comes to medicine, technology, engineering and marketing. However, when it comes to schools and education, research finds it difficult to cut through the bonds of tradition.In his bestselling book Brain Rules, molecular biologist John Medina suggests that the typical five-period day in high school might be radically restructured if we were to consider how the brain actually works.Medina writes, ""In the school of the future, lessons are divided into 25-minute modules, cyclically repreated throughout the day. Subject A is taught for 25 minutes, constituting the first exposure. Nintey minutes later, the 25-minute content of Subject A is repeated, and then a third time.""In Medina's mind, grade levels become less important. ""Memory is not fixed at the moment of learning, and repition provides the fixative,"" he says, wondering, ""Perhaps learning in the long view should be thought of the same way one thinks of immune booster shots, with critical pieces of information being repeated on a yearly or semi-yearly basis.""For readers, the point is, we now know more about how the brain functions than we ever have before. How we act, plan and work in light of that knowledge needs to be rethought. Our models are inefficient or just plain wrong."
26,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38921221-john-britto,5,"Thanks to author John Medina for taking up such a risk to research and explain the complex thing, according to human brains, of ""how brain works"" to the level that human brain can understand easily. The author, in his book explains 12 things about how our brains functions. This book contains of working science about brains, exemplary of experiment about the brain's function and questions.Here are the 12 things that the author says how the brain functions and fascinating ideas about them.....1) Survival - The human brain evolved too.2) Exercise - Exercise boosts brain power.3) Sleep - Sleep well think well.4) Stress - Stressed brains do not learn the same way the non stressed brains.5) Wired - Every brain is wired differently.6) Attention - People don’t pay attention to boring things.7) Memory - Repeat to remember.8) Sensory integration - Simulate more of the senses at the same time.9) Vision - vision trumps all other senses.10) Music - Study or listen to boost cognition.11) Gender - Male and Female brains are different.12) Exploration - we are powerful and natural explorers.This book is really a good one to read, if you do so, You will know how to make your brain to do amazing things."
27,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6780612-jessica-snell,4,"This one was fascinating. I finally found out why it's possible to faint from shock! Your brain is so glucose-hungry that you can only use a very small percentage of it at a time, for the simple reason that you don't have enough glucose (or enough oxygen to break the glucose down, or the ability to get rid of the by-products of oxygen break-down fast enough) to fuel more than a small percentage. So if you see/learn something shocking, your brain tries to process too much at once, using too large a percentage of your brain, and the brain has to shut off because it doesn't have enough energy to do that much processing! This, and many, many other interesting facts are in this book. It does a good job of explaining what we do know about how the brain works and how very, very much we don't know, and the author has lots of ideas for experiments that should be run so that we can find out more. In the meantime, he has advice for living better lives based on what we do know about how our brains work. Most of them are very elementary (e.g., exercise, get enough rest), but I found it fascinating to learn how neurology supports those common-sense bits of advice."

Helped to understand how human brain functions and how it get affected by the activities we do in our daily lives., such as sufficient amount of sleep and exercise helps healthy brain functioning, where as excessive stress affects the brain functionality in a negative way. I felt interested while getting to know about brain's memory system which has four stages of processing, viz., Encoding, Storing, Retrieving and Forgetting. To make something to be in long-term memory, we need to memorise that often in regular intervals. I enjoyed listening to this book, I would recommend this. Thanks."

Some of this research is pretty popular now but consider that this book is a few years old and it is even more impressive! The author is witty and approachable in his approach to explaining brain science. And he gives concrete examples and suggestions on how we can live our lives according to the way our brains work, rather than against it. I was a huge fan of Brain Rules for Baby so I wanted to go back and read this. I still like For Baby better but I'm such a fan of this author that I'll read just about anything he writes."
30,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16612969-andrea,3,"I'll be honest, this book was a challenge for me to get through. My biggest takeaway was what Dr. Medina had to say about teaching and learning. The brain can really only hold an attention span of about 10 minutes before it starts to wander, so as a teacher you must be aware of this and structure your lessons to keep students engaged. An example would be switching from lecturing for 10 minutes to telling a story or anecdote that relates to the lesson, then going back to the lesson. There is a lot of really great information in the book and I do recommend it."

33,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77641376-robert-baunoch,5,"Ever wondered why your brain doesn’t seem to be working like it did when you were younger while: being a couch potato, doing many things at once poorly, or getting up after another night where you slept just four hours? Let’s be honest, most of us have. What’s happening is not that we are getting older. We are making poor decisions in the choices we make and the rules we decide to follow. What we do is at odds with what our brain requires to work well. Ok. What can we do?Dr. John Medina’s Brain Rules: 12 Principles for Surviving and Thriving at Home, Work, and School helps us to understand how our brain operates, what is required to make it run as it should, and the impacts we have on it when we fail to maintain it well. While Dr. Medina’s impressive biography as educator, scholar, researcher, consultant, writer, and public speaker qualifies him to write about our brains, it is the way he does is that sets him apart from most others.In an era where readers, viewers, and listeners accept as fact almost anything that someone says, Dr. Medina informs us with peer-reviewed information, validated by experts, and published internationally, culling out myth, and highlighting what really is important. Important for us to survive and prosper in our daily lives as individuals, students, workers, and family members. His twelve rules or commandments for how to nurture and use our brains are clear, well explained, and placed iteratively into the context of our daily lives.Along with his book, readers can also visit his website at Brainrules.net where additional content, including videos, podcasts, articles, and a host of other material can be found. Dr. Medinas is a passionate, engaging writer, and for those who elect to listen to the audiobook, a somewhat curmudgeonly speaker who informs, entertains, and yes, provokes us to think about the decisions we make, how we decide to live, and the changes we can make to survive and prosper as human beings. I cannot recommend the book more. Read, listen, or visit his site today to begin your journey to becoming a more effective person."
34,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114098453-bobby-mikel,5,"Brain Rules: 12 Principles for Surviving and Thriving at Work, Home, and School takes the reader on a journey through the functions of the brain through the eyes of a molecular biologist. Throughout the book, Medina gives the reader an up-close look at the processes of the brain. He does this using scientific data, personal anecdotes, and a bit of humor along the way. This is far from a boring textbook delivery, but it does not shy away from various studies and statistical data. Brain Rules gives the reader some “insider tips” into the way the brain functions, how it’s wired, and even theorizes the reasons behind it. Though some of the advice may be viewed as a “common sense” approach, these tips, put into practice, can increase our productivity or even extend our cognitive abilities as we age. These are goals hopefully all of us seek to obtain. Not merely an advice book, Medina does an excellent job explaining the “whys” to some well-established answers, such as why our brains work better when we’re well rested, or why we think differently. Hopefully, in understanding the why behind the what the reader will put more effort into practicing the tips. While explaining the why, Medina does not simply bore the reader with pages and pages of data. (Doing so, would be in contradiction to one of his brain rules.) As he presents the data, he uses many relatable stories to help the reader understand the information. One does not need a degree in molecular biology to proceed on the journey through the brain. The book makes for a very interesting and informative read for anyone who has even a passing interest in the way the mind works. If you are looking for ways to be more productive, communicate better, maintain focus, and/or retain information, I highly encourage you to read Medina’s Brain Rules. "

The writing is interesting and not dry and each chapter ends with a summary and possible practical applications of the information. As a teacher, I found it interesting and thought-provoking. Takeaways include: Exercise is important not only for health, but also for cognition and should be part of everyone's routine (really fascinating chapter on how exercise affects the brain's physical makeup). Sleep is also essential for our brains to function at our best and helps us retain what we have learned. The stress chapter was also very good, detailing how stress damages our ability to learn and remember information. The chapter on how brains are ""wired"" (everyone's is wired differently and constantly changing) was interesting. He had some interesting suggestions for public speaking including the effectiveness of utilizing emotion and images in order for the audience to stay engaged. My interest in the book waned during the last few chapters, but it still made me think a lot about how I teach and what I can do to help students succeed."

Even though the author has written the titles of chapters that way, think of them as Brian Rules. How brain rules us. If you go to see it is all in the brain that we are, what we do, what we think, what we see.The author not just gives details on 12, out of several dozes, ways Brian rules us, but also gives his ideas on how we can exploit it in real world scenario like schools, colleges, businesses and corporate culture. He also gives anecdotes from his own life and observations that he has made over several decades of his life. Which helps to put some of the things, if not all, in perspective.I thoroughly enjoyed the book."
37,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley,4,"As the title suggests, this is a book of guidance about how to get the most out of one’s mental life. Medina goes a mile wide, looking at twelve areas in which one can improve the performance of one’s brain, including: exercise, attention, memory, sleep, stress management, sensory integration, and visual acuity. It also has chapters that explain how evolution and gender affect the way in which one’s brain operates. After an Introduction that sets up the premise of the book, there are twelve chapters. The first chapter explores the well-documented connection between exercise and mental performance, and offers insight into what type of exercise has been shown to be most helpful to the brain. The second chapter pertains to our brain’s evolutionary history. The conscious mind housed in the cortex is but the top floor of a multi-story enterprise, and understanding this has important ramifications for how one gets the most out of one’s brain. Chapter 3 explores the way brains are wired, which turns out to be flexibly and diversely. By flexibly, I mean that brains can be rewired by way of what is called neuroplasticity on the proviso that neurons that fire together wire together. By diversely, I mean that each individual’s brain is a bit different, and these differences can explain how someone gifted in one domain may be an idiot in other aspects of life. The next chapter deals with attention and explains why humans suck at multi-tasking (despite thinking they are the bomb) and why an extended ability to concentrate is essential to success. The next two chapters both deal with memory, but with different types of memory—each having its own unique considerations. The first, chapter five, describes the peculiarities of short-term memory, that part of the memory that can hold a finite amount of data points at the forefront of our minds for a limited period. Chapter six deals with long-term memory, the part that holds vast stockpiles of information for extended periods (sometimes across a lifetime) but with lower fidelity and accuracy than we generally believe. While the rule offered for both forms of memory is simple—i.e. repetition is key—there is much to consider in the details. For starters, there are many other ways to divide up memory other than with respect to the short-term / long-term dichotomy (e.g. procedural v declarative) and differences in the way these types of memory work affect how they are both optimized. The influence of sleep on mental performance is the subject of chapter seven. There is a vast pile of research on this subject, including a number of famous cases of extreme sleep deprivation—some of which are touched upon herein. It’s true that there is a great deal of variation in how people sleep (e.g. morning v non-morning people, and those who can power nap and those who can’t.) However, one thing remains unambiguous and that’s that we need sleep and must have full cycles of it in order to not suffer mental degradation. Chapter 8 is about how stress can kill mental performance. Of course, not all stress is the same. When one feels in control, short bursts of stress can be just the motivator one needs, but when feeling out of control stress can become crippling. Chapters 9 and 10 are both about the senses. The first, nine, explains how one can obtain synergistic outcomes in a multi-sensory environment, and the second focuses on vision—arguably our most dominant sense. Our sensory experience is much more a product of the brain (and much less a pure representation of the outside world) than we tend to believe. Chapter 11 reports on the gender differences that have been discovered with respect to brains. Before anyone lights a torch or sharpens a pitchfork, this isn’t the old “boys do math and girls do language” line. The differences are more nuanced, and it’s not clear in every case that the differences matter—or how. E.g. Men have bigger amygdala (involved in emotional response) and produce serotonin more quickly. While it’s not clear that these differences make a big difference, it’s know that men and women use their amygdala differently in times of stress, men activate the right amygdala and tend to remember more of the gist of events while women trip the left and remember more emotional details. The last chapter is about our human proclivity to explore, but it focuses heavily on infancy and childhood, during which the world is novel and the impulse to explore is at its height. Each chapter ends with a summary box that both restates the rule and offers a few bullet points of key takeaway lessons, which may either be more specific guidance or summary of relevant research findings. There aren’t many functional graphics—by functional I mean as opposed to the ornamental drawings used throughout. I only remember one brain drawing. However, the reason for the dearth of graphics may be that there is a link to a 45 minute video that one can access, and the publisher probably thought that was a much more useful way to impart graphic information. It should also be noted that in the Kindle edition that I have, the references are also on-line. I found this book to be useful. As I mentioned, it’s a broad overview. One can get books that dive more deeply into all of the topics addressed. But this is a nice mix of popular science and self-help. It’s readable, and the summaries and concise statement of rules help make the content stick more effectively.I’d recommend this book for those who are seeking a book that covers a lot of ground, and which offers practical guidance as to how to put scientific discoveries on the brain into use in one’s own life.

38,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5563286-jenn,3,"Not a huge fan of this book. It was OKAY and easy to read but it was too oversimplified. He would list a fact and then fail to explain its significance. I think he did this for brevity as this book is just fact after fact after fact — I think it would have been more successful if he used less information and expanded it more. Additionally, he heavily critiqued the education system but used vague psychological ideas with solutions that would be impossible if you knew the challenges that teachers face in the classroom. "

Review
Of all the books on how to optimize brain power/functionality, this has been my favorite. John Medina's voice is entertaining and engaging. It's no wonder he was teacher of the year at his university. This is illustrated in his way to go full-on Ms. Frizzle and the Magic School Bus while describing the molecular make up of various brain cells.A highly-entertaining read, chalk full of interesting and practical information (listed below).
Summary
Rule #1: Exercise boosts brain power• Our brains were built for walking 20km a day• To improve your thinking skills, move• Exercise gets blood to your brain, brining it glucose for energy and oxygen to soak up the toxic electrons that are left over. It also stimulates the protein that keeps neurons connecting.• Aerobic exercise just twice a week halves your risk of general dementia. It cuts your risk of Alzheimer’s by 60 percent.Rule #2: The human brain evolved, too• We don’t have one brain in our heads; we have three. We started with the “lizard brain” to keep us breathing, then added a brain like a cat’s and then topped those with the thin layer of Jell-O known as the cortex – the third, and powerful, “human” brain.• We took over the Earth by adapting to change itself, after we were forced from the trees to the savannah when climate swings disrupted our food supply.• Going from four legs to two to walk on the savannah freed up energy to develop a complex brain.• Symbolic reasoning is a uniquely human talent. It may have arisen from our need to understand one another’s intentions and motivations, allowing us to coordinate within a group.Rule #3: Every brain is wired differently• What you do and learn in life physically changes what your brain looks like – it literally rewires it.• The various regions of the brain develop at different rates in different people• No two people’s brains sort the same information in the same way in the same place.• We have a great number of ways of being intelligent, many of which don’t show up on IQ tests.Rule #4: We don’t pay attention to boring things• Studies show that a person who is interrupted takes 50% longer to accomplish a task. Not only that, he or she makes up to 50% more errors.• The brain’s attention “spotlight” can focus on only one thing at a time: no multitasking.We are better at seeing patterns and abstracting the meaning of an event than we are at recording detail.• Emotional arousal helps the brain learn.• Emotions get our attention.• Meaning before details. People remember the emotional appeal of commercials rather than every detail. The brain remembers the emotional component of an experience better than any other aspect. Emotional arousal focuses attention on the “gist” of an experience at the expense of peripheral details.• The brain needs a break.• How to keep attention during lectures: (a) Lectures should be in 10 minute segments. (b) Provide the gist, the core concept first. The brain likes hierarchy. (c) Explain the lecture plan at the beginning with liberal repetitions of “where we are” throughout the hour. (d) Bait the hook. At 10 minutes the audiences attention will plummet. (e) Don’t break their train of thought with irrelevant breaks. (f) Trigger an emotion. Fear, laughter, happiness, nostalgia, incredulity, narratives that are crisp and to the point. (g) Make the hook relevant. (h) Deliver the hook between modules. (i) Audiences check out after 10 minutes, but you can keep grabbing them back by telling narratives or creating events rich in emotion.Rule #5: Repeat to remember• The brain has many types of memory systems. One type follows four stages of processing: encoding, storing, retrieving, and forgetting.• Information coming into your brain is immediately split into fragments that are sent to different regions of the cortex for storage.• Most of the events that predict whether something learned also will be remembered occur in the first few seconds of learning, The more elaborately we encode a memory during its initial moments, the stronger it will be.• You can improve your chances of remembering something if you reproduce the environment in which you first put it into your brain.Rule #6: Remember to repeat• Forgetting plays a vital role in our ability to function. Forgetting allows us to prioritize events. Forgetting helped us conquer the Earth.• Most memories disappear within minutes, but those that survive the fragile period strengthen with time• Long-term memories are formed in a two-way conversation between the hippocampus and the cortex, until the hippocampus breaks the connection and the memory is fixed in the cortex – which an take years• Our brains give us only an approximate view of reality, because they mix new knowledge with past memories and store them together as one• The way to make long-term memory more reliable is to incorporate new information gradually and repeat it in timed intervals.Rule #7: Sleep well, think well• The brain is in a constant state of tension between cells and chemicals that try to put you to sleep and cells and chemicals that try to keep you awake.• The neurons of your brain show vigorous rhythmical activity when you’re asleep – perhaps replaying what you learned that day.• People vary in how much sleep they need and when they prefer to get it, but the biological drive for an afternoon nap is universal.• Loss of sleep hurts attention, executive function, working memory, mood, quantitative skills, logical reasoning, and even motor dexterityRule #8: Stressed brains don’t learn the same way• Your body’s defense system – the release of adrenaline and cortisol – is built for an immediate response to a serious but passing danger, such as a saber-toothed tiger. Chronic stress, such a hostility at home, dangerously deregulates a system built only to deal with short-term responses• Under chronic stress, adrenaline creates scars in your blood vessels that can cause a heart attack or stroke, and cortisol damages the cells of the hippocampus, crippling your ability to learn and remember.• Individually, the worst kind of stress is the feeling that you have no control over the problem – you are helpless.• Emotional stress has huge impacts across society, on children’s ability to learn in school and on employees productivity at work.Rule #9: Stimulate more of the senses• Mayers rules for multimedia presentations.• Multimedia principle: Students learn better from words and pictures than from words alone.• Temporal contiguity principle: Students learn better when corresponding words and pictures are presented simultaneously rather than successively.• Spatial continuity principle: Students learn better when corresponding words and pictures are presented near to each other rather than far from each on the page or screen.• Coherence principle; Students learn better when extraneous material is excluded rather than included.• Modality principle: Students learn better from animation and narration than from animation and on-screen text.• We absorb information about an event through our senses, translate it into electrical signals (some for sight, others from sound, etc), disperse those signals to separate parts of the brain, then reconstruct what happened, eventually perceiving the event as a whole.• The brain seems to rely partly on past experience in deciding how to combine these signals, so two people can perceive the same event very differently.• Our senses evolved to work together – vision influencing hearing, for example – which means that we learn best if we stimulate several senses at once• Smells have an unusual power to bring back memories, maybe because smell signals bypass the thalamus and head straight to their destinations, which include that supervisor of emotions known as the amygdala.Rule #10: Vision trumps all other senses• Vision is by far our most dominant sense, taking up half of our brain’s resources.• What we see is only what our brain tells us we see, and it’s not 100% accurate.• The visual analysis we do has many steps. The retina assembles photons into movie-like steams of information. The visual cortex processes these streams, some areas registering motion, others registering color, etc. finally we combine that information back together so we can see.• We learn and remember best through pictures, not through written or spoken words.Rule #11: Male and female brains are different• Men’s and Women’s brains are different structurally and biochemically – men have a bigger amygdala and produce serotonin faster, for example – but we don’t know if those differences have significance.• Men and women respond differently to acute stress: Women active the left hemisphere’s amygdala and remember the emotional details. Men use the right amygdala and get the gist.Rule #12: We are powerful and natural explorers• Babies are the model of how we learn – not by passive reaction to the environment but by active testing through observation, hypothesis, experiment, and conclusion• Specific parts of the brain allow this scientific approach. The right prefrontal cortex looks for errors in our hypothesis (“The saber-toothed tiger is not harmless”), and an adjoining region tells us to change behavior (“Run!”).• We can recognize and imitate behavior because of “mirror neurons” scattered across the brain.• Some parts of our adult brains stay as malleable as a baby’s, so we can create neurons and learn new thing throughout our lives."

I always admired his brain and the way he remembered everything, from the poems he recited when he was a boy to the complex biochemistry oc his profession and dates of historical facts he remembered during a conversation with a co- patient a few hours before he passed away...I was reading the book while wondering how such a complex tool as our brain can suddenly just stop working."

Exercise can improve your brain and possibly keep it active even at old age. It also reviews the history of homo-sapiens and how they had to adapt to their environment - which led to their brains evolving, too. John Medina explains these processes and others thoroughly, and I've learned a lot from this."
58,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115828668-andrew,3,"Interesting book on ways to improve your brain function and other insights of the brain. Think I enjoyed the Genius foods/life books better though.My notes are seen below:Rule 1 - exercise boosts brain powerThe human brain evolved under conditions of almost constant motion. From this, one might predict that the optimal environment for processing information would include motion. That is exactly what one finds. Indeed, the best business meeting would have everyone walking at about 1.8 miles per hour.Exercise positively affected executive function, spatial tasks, reaction times and quantitative skills.So researchers asked: If the sedentary populations become active, will their cognitive scores go up? Yes, it turns out, if the exercise is aerobic. In four months, executive functions vastly improve; longer, and memory scores improve as well.Exercise improves cognition for two reasons:- Exercise increases oxygen flow into the brain, which reduces brain-bound free radicals. One of the most interesting findings of the past few decades is that an increase in oxygen is always accompanied by an uptick in mental sharpness.- Exercise acts directly on the molecular machinery of the brain itself. It increases neurons’ creation, survival, and resistance to damage and stress.Rule 2- human brain evolved, tooThe strongest brains survive, not the strongest bodies. Our ability to solve problems, learn from mistakes, and create alliances with other people helps us survive. We took over the world by learning to cooperate and forming teams with our neighbors.Our ability to understand each other is our chief survival tool. Relationships helped us survive in the jungle and are critical to surviving at work and school today.If someone does not feel safe with a teacher or boss, he or she may not perform as well. If a student feels misunderstood because the teacher cannot connect with the way the student learns, the student may become isolated.Rule 3 - Every brain is wired differentlyYou can either accede to it or ignore it. The current system of education ignores it by having grade structures based on age.Rule 4 - we don’t pay attention to boring thingsWhat we pay attention to is profoundly influenced by memory.We pay attention to things like emotions, threats and sexRegardless of who you are, the brain pays a great deal of attention to these questions: Can I eat it? Will it eat me? Can I mate with it? Will it mate with me? Have I seen it before?The brain is not capable of multi-tasking. We can talk and breathe, but when it comes to higher level tasks, we just can’t do it.Driving while talking on a cell phone is like driving drunk. The brain is a sequential processor and large fractions of a second are consumed every time the brain switches tasks. This is why cell-phone talkers are a half-second slower to hit the brakes and get in more wrecksResearch shows your error rate goes up 50% and it takes you twice as long to do things.When you’re always online you’re always distracted.Rule 5 - repeat to remember The human brain can only hold about seven pieces of information for less than 30 seconds! Memories are so volatile that you have to repeat to remember.Improve your memory by elaborately encoding it during its initial moments. If at a party you need help remembering Mary, it helps to repeat internally more information about her. “Mary is wearing a blue dress and my favorite color is blue.” It may seem counterintuitive at first but study after study shows it improves your memory.Tested this Brain Rule in real classrooms of 3rd graders. They were asked to repeat their multiplication tables in the afternoons. The classrooms in the study did significantly better than the classrooms that did not have the repetitionThe first few seconds of encoding new information is crucial in determining whether something that is initially perceived will be remembered.The more elaborately we encode information at the moment of learning, the stronger the memory. When encoding is elaborate and deep, the memory that forms is much more robust than when encoding is partial and cursory.When you are trying to drive a piece of information into your brain's memory, make sure you understand exactly what that information means. If you are trying to drive information into someone else's brain, make sure they understand what it means.The more repetition cycles a memory experienced, the more likely it is to persist in your mind. The space between repetitions is the critical component for transforming temporary memories into more persistent forms.Spaced learning is greatly superior to massed learning.Learning occurs best when new information is incorporated gradually into the memory store rather than jammed in all at once.Physically, ""student"" neurons need to get the same information from the ""teacher"" neuron within 90 minutes, or its excitement will vanish. The cell will literally reset itself to zero and act as if nothing happened.Forgetting allows us to prioritize events. Events irrelevant to our survival will take up wasteful cognitive space if we assign them the same priority as events critical to our survival. So we don't.In school, every 3rd or 4th day would be reserved for reviewing the facts delivered in the previous 3-4 days.Rule 6 - remember to repeatIt takes years to consolidate a memory. Not minutes, hours, or days but years. What you learn in first grade is not completely formed until your sophomore year in high school.Medina’s dream school is one that repeats what was learned, not at home, but during the school day, 90-120 minutes after the initial learning occurred. Our schools are currently designed so that most real learning has to occur at home.How do you remember better? Repeated exposure to information / in specifically timed intervals / provides the most powerful way to fix memory into the brain.Forgetting allows us to prioritize events. But if you want to remember, remember to repeat.Rule 7 - sleep well, think wellWhen we’re asleep, the brain is not resting at all. It is almost unbelievably active! It’s possible that the reason we need to sleep is so that we can learn.Sleep must be important because we spend 1/3 of our lives doing it! Loss of sleep hurts attention, executive function, working memory, mood, quantitative skills, logical reasoning, and even motor dexterity.Taking a nap might make you more productive. In one study, a 26-minute nap improved NASA pilots’ performance by 34 percent.Rule 8 - stressed brain don’t learn the same wayYour brain is built to deal with stress that lasts about 30 seconds. The brain is not designed for long term stress when you feel like you have no control.Stress damages virtually every kind of cognition that exists. It damages memory and executive function. It can hurt your motor skills. When you are stressed out over a long period of time it disrupts your immune response. You get sicker more often. It disrupts your ability to sleep. You get depressed.The emotional stability of the home is the single greatest predictor of academic success. If you want your kid to get into Harvard, go home and love your spouse.Rule 9 - stimulate more of the sensesSmell is unusually effective at evoking memory. If you're tested on the details of a movie while the smell of popcorn is wafted into the air, you'll remember 10-50% more.The learning link. Those in multisensory environments always do better than those in unisensory environments. They have more recall with better resolution that lasts longer, evident even 20 years later.Rule 10 - vision trumps all other sensesWe are incredible at remembering pictures. Hear a piece of information, and three days later you'll remember 10% of it. Add a picture and you'll remember 65%.Rule 11 - male and female brains are differentMales are more severely afflicted by schizophrenia than females. By more than 2 to 1, women are more likely to get depressed than men.Males exhibit more antisocial behavior. Females have more anxiety. Most alcoholics and drug addicts are male. Most anorexics are female.Rule 12 - we are powerful and natural explorers"
59,0979777704,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1602292-melissa,4,"A fascinating look at the brain and how it works. Most of the ""rules"" are pretty much common sense type of things, but I loved how the author applied it to school and work situations. The pratical application is the value of this book.Here are some of my favorite rules and what I learned from them:Rule #1: Exercise boosts brain power.Not only is exercise beneficial for muscles and endurance, it also helps out with the brain. Even thirty minutes of exercise each day will get your brain going, helping you to remember things better and increasing overall brain health. If you're not exercising, start now!Rule #3: Every brain is wired differently.Even though all of us have a brain, the way your brain works is slightly different than the way my brain works. Never assume that just because you may understand something in a certain way that other people understand it in the exact same way. Everyone's brain is working with the body that it has. Rule #4: We don't pay attention to boring things.This is especially useful to know if you're teaching a class or doing a presentation. The best way to do it is to break up the information and every 15 minutes or so, recap or tie the information into a story, a joke, or something else that people will remember. After 15 minutes or so of information, people stop paying attention. The brain needs some time to absorb the information and a break from continuous information coming at it. Rule #7: Sleep well, think well.Getting a good amount of sleep is great for your brain, not because it's resting, per se, but because it allows the brain to do it's thing—taking all the information that it acquired during the day and analyzing and putting the info away so the brain can access it later. If you're cheating on your sleep, you're cheating on your brain health.Rule #8: Stressed brains don't learn the same way.If you're stressed out, your brain will be stressed out too. The information it acquires will be gathered and used in the ""stressed out"" mode, either for good or bad. Living under stressful conditions will cause the brain to adapt to those conditions, but even when the stressful conditions are no longer there, the brain will continue to act as if those conditions do exist. Fascinating chapter.Rule #11: Male and female brains are different.I read this and went ""No duh!"" This chapter turned out to be really interesting. All brains deal with emotions, but how the brain processes emotions depends on nature, nurture, and gender. Male and female brains respond differently to acute stress—women will remember the emotional details whereas men get the gist, the overall picture. "
