0,0674006771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1447864-joshua-nomen-mutatio,2,"I agree with the basic sentiments of this book which are that human thought and behavior are a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors and shouldn't be glossed over with simplistic ""Nature"" or ""Nurture"" explanations (which is what gives this one star in addition to what otherwise would just be one by its lonesome). HOWEVER, what I take serious issue with is that Lewontin and his ideological compatriot Stephen Jay Gould (and others, less visibly), are hysterical in their fear of people positing a more blunt form of genetic determinism. I simply don't know where these scientists are that disregard environmental factors and think humans=genes. And the scientists and philosophers whom have received the most vicious and ridiculously misrepresentative criticisms from the Gould-Lewontin camp (namely E.O. Wilson, Daniel Dennett, and Steven Pinker) I can say for certain, from personal research, are not guilty of these mistakes (genetic determinism, ultra-adaptionism, ""Darwinian fundamentalism"", etc) in the slightest. I've spent a fair amount of time arguing about these issues with people and will probably add some more details to this review later.For the moment I'll leave a few links to short pieces that support my point of view here:1. An extremely excellent and short essay (adapted from his book Freedom Evolves) about these broadly construed intellectual battles that is well-worth reading: 
The Mythical Threat of Genetic Determinism
 by Daniel Dennett ""Isn't it true that whatever isn't determined by our genes must be determined by our environment? What else is there? There's Nature and there's Nurture. Is there also some X, some further contributor to what we are? There's Chance. Luck. This extra ingredient is important but doesn't have to come from the quantum bowels of our atoms or from some distant star. It is all around us in the causeless coin-flipping of our noisy world, automatically filling in the gaps of specification left unfixed by our genes, and unfixed by salient causes in our environment.""""Is he a dread genetic determinist, or a dread environmental determinist? He is neither, of course, for both these species of bogeyman are as mythical as werewolves. By increasing the information we have about the various causes of the constraints that limit our current opportunities, he has increased our powers to avoid what we want to avoid, prevent what we want to prevent. Knowledge of the roles of our genes, and the genes of the other species around us, is not the enemy of human freedom, but one of its best friends.""2. In response to Gould's absurd, strawman-riddled article ""Darwinian Fundamentalism"":
Evolutionary Psychology: An Exchange
 by Harold Kalant, Werner Kalow, Steven Pinker ""So where’s the controversy? Gould claims his targets invoke selection to explain everything. They don’t. Everyone agrees that aspects of the living world without adaptive complexity—numbers of species, nonfunctional features, trends in the fossil record—often need different kinds of explanations, from genetic drift to wayward asteroids. So yes, we all should be, and are, pluralists. But we should not be indiscriminate pluralists.""""A rejection of Gould’s theory does not put nonadaptive features ""outside the compass of evolutionary psychology""; nor was Gould the first to call attention to them. The original arguments for recognizing nonadaptive features came from the founding document of evolutionary psychology, George Williams’s Adaptation and Natural Selection, long before Gould and Lewontin reiterated them (without attribution) in their ""Spandrels"" paper. Nonadaptive explanations have been commonplace in the field ever since, as Gould must be well aware, for in one column he touted a nonadaptive explanation of the female orgasm taken from another founder of evolutionary psychology, Donald Symons. According to the most popular view in the field, many other important human activities are spandrels, including art, music, religion, science, and dreams. Gould’s accusation is not even close to being accurate.""3. 
Letter to the Editor of The New York Review of Books on Stephen Jay Gould’s ""Darwinian Fundamentalism"" (June 12, 1997) and ""Evolution: The Pleasures of Pluralism"" (June 26, 1997)
John Tooby and Leda CosmidesCenter for Evolutionary Psychology, UCSBJuly 7, 1997""For biologists, the central problem is that Gould’s own exposition of evolutionary biology is so radically and extravagantly at variance with both the actual consensus state of the field and the plain meaning of the primary literature that there is no easy way to communicate the magnitude of the discrepancy in a way that could be believed by those who have not experienced the evidence for themselves.""More on all of this later..."
1,0674006771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107093043-penny,4,"A very interesting and well-written book. It is a concise argument against reductionist interpretations of organisms (whether that be to genetics or to environmental adaptation). He does this in two main ways: the first is that he critiques interpretations that are generally reductionist, starting with guiding metaphor and general conceptions guiding research. One review mentioned that the opponents are illusions; there are, e.g., no genetic determinists in the way Lewontin writes. I didn't read Lewontin in quite this way, though admitted there are some points where he talks like that. He mentions throughout the book that nothing he says in Chs 1-3 is revolutionary; it's information known by *all* biologists. (Note: I am not one, and this was my first book in this general topic.) His point rather seems to be that biologists will tend to stick to a reductionist way of investigation, and just sort of ignore the other stuff while doing their experiments. It's not about biologists having absurdly reductionist views; it's about the field of biology concentrating on methods of research that require reductionist assumptions, e.g., with genetic perturbations. So I don't think that reviewer's criticism is quite on point. I do wish Lewontin had engaged with other scholars more directly though, just to get a better sense of the debate.The second way is to point out ""developmental noise,"" and here is where I wish Lewontin did a bit more. It just seemed a bit of a murky notion throughout the book, and the last chapter was a slight disappointment in that Lewontin basically just said, ""Look we need to study this stuff."" Included in developmental noise are sequences of gene mutations (rather than singular significant mutations), causal impact loops between gene, organism, and environment, and perhaps a couple others that I'm forgetting now. But then he spends some time (in Ch 3) talking about the influence of shape in genetic coding-- is this developmental noise? That seems a little strange, and it also seems a lot different from the others, which involve causal particularities/idiosyncracies in patterns. In any case, this thread of the book weaved in and out the text in a kind of suggestive way, and I wish he had given it some more robust attention at the end. But the writing is superb and concise, which makes the book all the more enjoyable and impressive. It really stimulated my interest in many of these topics. "
2,0674006771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26690394-diegomf,4,"Lewontin expõe de forma didática e acessível três tipos de relações de sistemas vivos: 1) gene e organismo, 2) organismo e ambiente e 3) partes e todos, causas e efeitos. Por fim, se propõe a sintetizar as reflexões e sugerir novas direções no estudo complexo e não mecanicamente reducionista de sistemas vivos.O livro talvez possa ser resumido na seguinte passagem:""Não há nada nos três primeiros capítulos deste livro que não seja bem conhecido por todos os biólogos. todo mundo 'sabe', em algum nível de consciência, que o DNA não se autorreplica, que a informação nas sequências do DNA não é suficiente para especificar nem mesmo uma proteína tridimensional, para não falar de um organismo inteiro, e que o ambiente de um organismo é construído e constantemente alterado pelas atividades vitais do próprio organismo""Mas, prossegue o autor em sua proposta epistemológica de chacoalhar a área, (...) esse conhecimento em princípio não pode incorporar-se à estrutura da explicação biológica, a menos que esteja incorporado ao trabalho efetivo dos biólogos. O progresso da biologia não depende de novas conceitualizações revolucionárias, mas sim da criação de novas metodologias que permitam, na prática, responder a perguntas em um mundo de recursos finitos""O livro foi importante para mim na medida em que me ajudou a caminhar em direção a uma biologia menos gene-centrada e mais relacional, em oposição ao modelo dominante neodarwinista."
3,0674006771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90580746-ben,4,"Recommended reading for any biology student and probably for a great many graduates too. Lewontin makes a great case against mechanistic interpretations of biology, and cautions against the temptation to reductionism. He takes this further to touch on some general questions about the nature of biology, and future directions for study.It's an important point, I think, that much science is conceived of in terms of closed systems with a few major determining influences. He uses the example of the solar system, in which the main bodies and forces are fairly clear to us and few in number. On the other hand, biological systems are very different, as they are (1) governed by many weakly influential forces rather than a few determining forces; and (2) are open systems, where the impact on them from the outside (and their impact on, and shaping of their environment) is fundamental. He notes in the final paragraph, most biologists know on some level that DNA doesn't determine everything about an organism, and so on, as argued convincingly, with good examples, in the first chapters. The need to find ""new methodologies"" to research biological issues, rather than all-encompassing rules and new paradigms, is a very practical and his argument to support this as a major goal of research is thought-provoking. ""The invention of automatic DNA-sequencing machines was a response to a growing demand for sequence, but the availability of such machines and the great ease with which DNA can now be sequenced has meant that the problems on which geneticists work have become those that can be answered from DNA sequences."" Which is a more specific way of phrasing the aphorism that if the only tool you have is a hammer, then every problem looks like a nail. Expanding the toolkit is necessary!Despite being published in 2000, the book seems still very relevant. I think I picked up one example that has been superseded - he says we don't know what determines skin colour; as I recall, it has been found that a large group of genes all contribute a little each to determining skin colour. Otherwise it reads like a very contemporary argument. "
4,0674006771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1622221-kira,5,"So far, this book has been a model of concision, argumentation, minimal style and cultural clued-in-ness. That last thing could have been said better, but you know what I mean. Lewontin is brilliant, renaissance man-style; he's no awkward technician in print, even though his mathematical ideas in evolutionary bio. are reputedly nothing to shake a stick at. Really, this is a scientifically-grounded piece of elegant epistemological and ontological criticism, the best a professional philosopher could expect to write, and it comes from a scientist. The only way this book could be clearer would be to present it in outline form, with premises and conclusions in linear groups. That would impoverish the experience of reading the book, though, since the prose is so good, you tolerate having to put two and two together yourself, which any reader could do, I imagine.Here lies evidence that theory or philosophy can be deep, clear, and modest in its claims without byzantine sentence structure, jargon, or stilted, institutionally-approved tropes designed to ape mathematics. All of which, by implication, I find in contemporary continental and analytic philosophy. Both naturalist philosophers and anti-naturalists could probably benefit from reading this short book. The naturalists will have some real arguments to criticize and (some) anti-naturalists might be surprised by biologist Lewontin's attempt to avoid throwing the baby of humanism out with the pre-Darwinist cultural bathwater."
5,0674006771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,4,"Why the genome project may disappointThis little book contains three lectures given by Lewontin at the Lezioni Italiani in Milan a few years ago. It is technical and aimed at an educated readership. Since there is not enough space here to discuss the entire book, I will concentrate on a brief discussion of the first lecture, ""Gene and Organism.""In this lecture Professor Lewontin outlines the role that genes, environment and chance (""random noise"") play in the development of an organism. As he phrases it on page 20: ""the organism is not specified by its genes, but is a unique outcome of an ontogenetic process that is contingent on the sequence of environments in which it occurs."" This means that you could take the same genetic code and have it unfurl in Hyde Park and get an organism different from one you would get having it unfurl on, say, the Boston commons. Lewontin shows how cuttings from the same plant cultured at different altitudes developed differentially, and in a manner that could not be predicted. The reason they could not be predicted is that there is a significant amount of random variation (""developmental noise"") that occurs as the plant grows. Lewontin gives the further example of a multiplying bacterium on page 37. The bacterium divides in 63 minutes. In another 63 minutes the daughter cells should divide again, giving four bacteria, but actually there is some random variation in how long it takes them to divide, so that one daughter divides in say 55 minutes, the other in an hour and five minutes. And this continues so that the bacteria culture does not increase in pulses, but continuously in random increments. This difference in timing in multi-cellar organisms may result in morphological differences since a catalytic enzyme may arrive too late to, say, grow a side bristle on a fruit fly (an example that Lewontin gives). Lewontin applies this understanding to the development of our brains on page 38. First there are random connections set. ""Those connections that are reinforced from external inputs during neural development are stabilized, while the others decay and disappear."" This process, Lewontin advises us, can lead to differences in cognitive function that are neither strictly genetic nor strictly environmental. They are influenced by random (unpredictable) factors.This understanding is the reason that Lewontin is less than thrilled with the Human Genome Project. He believes, as he makes clear in another book, It Ain't Necessary So: The Dream of the Human Genome and Other Illusions (2000), that we will be disappointed by what can be accomplished simply from sequencing the genetic code, his point being that even though we know the code, the environmental and random factors cannot be known in any precise or predictive sense. It is true that the genome for a chimp will always code for a chimp and never for a rabbit, but whether that chimp is good at math or has unusually aggressive tendencies is something we cannot know from an understanding of the genetic code alone. Chance and environmental factors in development can result in a passive chimp even though its parents are aggressive.Applying this idea to evolution in general, we can see that individual variation is not strictly a result of environmental differences but also of chance differences. Consequently, what we are is not shaped strictly by adaptive pressure (natural selection) but is to some extent the result of purely random processes. At one time in my life I studied chance and random events, and one of the most important things I learned is that the term ""random"" is not clearly defined, except in the sense that something that is random is unpredictable, which is a ""you can't prove a negative"" sort of definition. I also learned that there is considerable doubt as to whether a truly randomizing device actually exists. All real world devices, such as roulette wheels and computer random number algorithms can be shown to have some tiny bias, or to break down at the extremes. (Don't trust the random number generator on your computer when you are generating a very large number of trials: it will begin to repeat, and your Monte Carlo simulation will be flawed.) So what Lewontin calls ""random events"" are actually events that we simply do not know enough about to describe accurately. It may be that with greater ability we will eventually be able to describe or control these events. However, it may also be that at some level such events are the direct result of the probabilistic nature of a quantum event, and therefore in principle unpredictable. I suspect that Lewontin believes something like this.In the second lecture Lewontin makes the point that to a significant degree organisms create their environment, and it is wrong to think of a place (such as the surface of the moon) without organisms as an environment. His dictum is ""...[T]here are no environments without organisms"" (p. 67). In the third lecture Lewontin discusses some of the problems associated with genetic causation and its analysis. There is a fourth chapter in which Lewontin attempts to provide some direction for future studies in biology.I did not understand his assertion on page 81 that ""Only a quasi-religious commitment to the belief that everything in the world has a purpose would lead us to provide a functional explanation for fingerprint ridges or eyebrows or the patches of hair on men's chests."" The hair, I imagine is the result of sexual selection, but surely the fingerprint ridges allow us a better grip, and our eyebrows shade the sunlight as well as providing some small cushioning for our eye sockets. --Dennis Littrell, author of “Understanding Evolution and Ourselves”"

13,0674006771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34159442-andrew,4,"Sober, critical view of the limitations of our understandings of biology. Lewontin makes the case that the relationship between genetics, living organisms, and the environment is reciprocal. Big takeaway was that analytic approaches to the study of biology are limited because (1) ontologies of biological components are difficult to construct (2) there are a number of weakly determining factors that influence the development of a living organism, and (3) cause and effect are not distinct in biological systems.""Over the last three hundred years the analytic model has been immensely successful in explaining nature in such a way as to allow us to manipulate and predict it. It seems abundantly clear to us now that the holistic view of the world obstructs any possibility of a practical understanding of natural phenomena. But the success of the clock model, in contrast to the failure of obscurantist holism, has led to an overly simplified view of the relation of parts to wholes and of causes to effects. Part of the success of naive reductionism and simplistic analysis comes from the opportunistic nature of scientific work. Scientists pursue precisely those problems that yield to their methods… Science as we practice it solves those problems for which its methods and concepts are adequate, and successful scientists soon learn to pose only those problems that are likely to be solved.… Despite the extraordinary successes of analytic and reductionist biology, the most interesting questions remain: the problems of mind and shape. What are the neurophysiology and neuroanatomy of specific stores memories? … The difficulty of the problem is not that we lack some crucial bit of knowledge, but that we do not know how to frame questions. Trapped by the machine model, we have passed through a succession of fashionable metaphors in different technological eras. """
14,0674006771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/588238-aeisele,3,"I really enjoyed this, although I would say that Lewontin is not really that clear a writer sometimes. Yet the overall point of the book is really interesting: that there is a dialectical relationship between organism and environment, i.e. there is coevolution of organism and environment. This means that what is internal to the organism forms the organism's environment, while the environment also forms what is internal to the oragnism, and on and on. This seems, philosophically at least, a much more sensible approach than the reductionist approach (which thinks everything important happens at the level of the gene only), and it seems to take into account the new developments in understand genomes, like DNA redundancy, the complicated process of folding amino acids, etc. Life is so complex it takes a much more pluralistic approach to deal with it, and Lewontin makes a pretty strong case that this is the best biologically."
15,0674006771,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343613-alex,4,"An excellent explanation of how the metaphors employed by biologists in explaining their science have obscured the true reality of the concepts they are trying to communicate. While once necessary, this language has resulted in some fundamental misunderstandings that prevent the public from understanding the inadequacy of the nature versus nurture dichotomy and the complexity of developmental variation. The end result is that the very questions that biologists now pursue have been focused onto very narrow characterizations of the greater questions in which we are interested. Unfortunately, I don't think that the casual reader would enjoy this book. But for anyone with a hint of scientific inkling could likely get through it (especially since it is just over 100 pages long), and learn a good deal on the way."
