0,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743254-michael-connolly,3,"DiscoveryEscherichia coli bacteria was discovered by the German-Austrian pediatrician Theodor Escherich. He found it in baby diapers. Beneficial BacteriaE. coli inhabit the human colon and most strains of E. coli are beneficial, not pathogens. In fact, most of the bacteria in your colon are non-pathogenic. When you take antibiotics to kill pathogenic bacteria, the antibiotics often also kill friendly bacteria, resulting in diarrhea. CadaverineE. coli bacteria in the intestines neutralize acid by producing an alkaline, foul-smelling substance called cadaverine. IronE. coli makes proteins called siderophores that grab iron atoms in the environment and move it inside the E. coli bacterium, where it is held by an iron storage protein until it is needed by the cell. BiofilmBiofilm is an extracellular matrix, largely made up of polysaccharide mucus, that helps the E. coli bacteria to cooperate to promote their group survival. It protects the bacteria from antibiotics, predators, and dehydration. Evolutionary CooperationThe author discusses recent theories of evolution that assert that natural selection favors not just traits that help an individual organism survive, but also traits that help the survival of their close genetic relatives, from its immediate family to its species. An E. coli bacterium will often perform acts that harm itself, but help neighboring E. coli bacteria survive, by improving their shared environment. OxygenThe E. coli bacteria in the gut are called facultative anaerobes, which means that they can live in either the presence or the absence of oxygen. The E. coli bacteria scavenge oxygen in the gut to maintain the colon in an anaerobic state. This makes the colon hospitable for anaerobic microbes. Regulation of Heat-Shock ProteinsE. coli produces proteins called heat-shock proteins that help the bacterium to handle proteins that have been partially denatured (unfolded) by heat. There are two kinds of such helpers: (a) ones that help repair (refold) the damaged proteins, and (b) ones that help destroy the proteins which cannot be repaired. The level of production of these heat-shock proteins is regulated in an interesting way. The messenger RNA for the sigma 32 regulatory protein assumes a functional shape for transcription on the ribosome only when bacterium is hot. After the sigma 32 protein is synthesized, it turns on the transcription of the genes for the heat-shock proteins. There is also a feedback loop where excessive amounts of heat-shock protein will shut down their production. ColicinE. coli produce toxic proteins called colicins that kill neighboring bacteria of other species. The colicins have three mechanisms of action. Some colicins form pores in the membranes of the enemy bacteria, some prevent protein synthesis, and some attack DNA. E. coli also produce other proteins, called immunity proteins, that protect them from harm by their own colicins. Type III Secretion SystemThis is a needle-like structure on the outside membrane of E. coli cells that allows them to inject toxins into the host cell. FlagellaE. coli have complex structures on their outer membranes called flagella that help them move. Flagella evolved from the more primitive structure described above, the Type III secretion system. ProphageA virus that attacks (eats) bacteria is called a bacteriophage (or just phage, for short). If the DNA of the virus integrates into the host chromosome, that DNA segment is called a prophage. It can be passed down to the descendants of the bacterium, and sometimes can cause a viral infection in the descendent bacteria. Many prophages develop mutations that prevent them from ever escaping the host chromosome back into a virus capsid. They are called defective prophages. ShigellaThis form of diarrhea was discovered by Kiyoshi Shiga. Only recently was it discovered that the shigella bacterium is actually a group of strains of E. coli that have developed the ability to move around inside eukaryotic cells. The Shigella bacterium spreads from host cell to cell by loosening the tri-cellular tight junction of intestinal epithelial cells. The Shiga toxin attacks the RNA part of the bacterial ribosomes, halting protein synthesis. Shiga toxin is encoded by a gene in a lambdoid prophage integrated into the bacterial chromosome. These shigella strains also differ from normal E. coli in that they do not have flagella and do not produce cadaverine.E. coli Strain O157:H7The pathogenic O157:H7 strain of E. coli occasionally found in undercooked, contaminated ground beef produces a shiga-like protein toxin that is coded for by a defective prophage gene. Riboswitch SensorsRecently, it has been discovered that the synthesis of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) by E. coli is regulated in a novel way. This regulatory mechanism involves the messenger RNAs that code for coenzyme B12 biosynthesis and transport proteins. When vitamin B12 binds to a nucleotide sequence of such a messenger RNA, the mRNA changes its shape. In this new conformation, the mRNA will no longer bind to the ribosome and so will not be translated into a biosynthesis or transport protein for vitamin B12. Ron Breaker of Yale University gave the name riboswitch to the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA that binds the vitamin molecule. RNA WorldStarting in 1968, a number of scientists have speculated that the earliest life on earth consisted not of DNA and proteins, but rather of RNA only. These RNA molecules acted as both holders of genetic information (like DNA) and as performers of chemical reactions (like proteins). In the 1980s there were discoveries supporting this theory. It was discovered that there are RNA molecules that act as enzymes, that is, they catalyze chemical reactions. They are called ribozymes. More recently, French virologist Patrick Forterre has proposed the theory that the switchover from RNA-based life to DNA-based life happened independently for each of the three domains: archaea, bacteria, and eukaryote. He has further proposed that the DNA of cells was first introduced by DNA viruses. Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO)The author is an advocate of genetic engineering, which started with E. coli, but which has now spread to higher forms of life. He goes into some detail on a particular plant GMO called “Golden Rice”. Golden Rice was developed by Ingo Potrykos of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and Peter Beyer of the University of Freiburg. This rice GMO makes vitamin A, which is needed for vision. Millions of poor children go blind every year, because do not eat enough vitamin A."

2,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"With the trained eyes of a scientist and the soul of poet, eminent science writer Carl Zimmer takes us on an all too brief, yet fascinating, trek into contemporary biology, as seen from the perspective of the bacterium Escherichia coli, in his latest book, ""Microcosm: E. coli and the New Science of Life"". More than a mere recounting of decades of elegant scientific research from the likes of Joshua Lederberg and Salvador Luria, among others, ""Microcosm"" is truly a book about contemporary biology itself, tying in almost every facet of it, from systematics to population genetics and ecology, and even, paleobiology. But it is a book that takes such an in-depth exploration of biology from the unique perspective of a rather most unassuming organism - or at least what readers might think - the bacterium E. coli, whose ubiquitous habitats include the intestinal tracts of humans and other mammals. Indeed, E. coli is truly a wonderful organismal metaphor for describing all of biology in its totality, as evidenced, for example, in one of Zimmer's terse chapters devoted to the evolution of cooperation amongst organisms via mechanisms such as natural selection and kin selection; an elegant experimental analogue to the types of selective pressures operating on other, more complex, organisms, including us. Indeed, ""Microcosm"" ought to be regarded as ""Macrocosm"", since Zimmer has offered an elegant, often poetic, exploration of all of biology, by demonstrating E. coli's scientific relevance to humanity. If there is indeed one important underlying theme to ""Microcosm"", then perhaps it is the prevalence of sex in this single-celled organism, and its importance as a key ingredient in understanding evolution, which was recognized decades ago by a young Joshua Lederberg. Zimmer describes how E. coli has demonstrated the veracity of Darwin's concept of natural selection, via an elegant ""slot machine"" experiment designed by Salvador Luria, and culminating now in the ongoing experiment by microbial ecologist Richard Lenski; Zimmer's engaging account of which is among the most important highlights of this book (Yet as a brief aside, I am surprised Zimmer did not mention that Lenski's research is offering experimental proof of evolutionary stasis, as defined by paleontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould in their theory of punctuated equilibrium; a point emphasized in a relatively recent paper co-authored by Lenski, Eldredge and others.). Zimmer also devotes ample time touching on other aspects of E. coli's evolutionary ecology from a public health perspective, tracing the origins of epidemics caused by toxic strains of this otherwise benign prokaryote. There is also, regrettably, ample discussion too of creationist interest in E. coli as an example of an organism created by an ""Intelligent Designer""; Zimmer notes correctly that creationists were interested in its flagellum years before the bacterial flagellum became important ""proof"" supporting leading Intelligent Design advocate Michael Behe's concept of ""Irreducible Complexity"", and how this ""proof"" was demolished effectively by prominent Intelligent Design critic Ken Miller during the 2005 Kitzmiller vs. Dover Area School District trial. (Reposted from my 2008 Amazon review)"

If the only thing you know about e.coli is that it can chain you to the toilet for a few days you will be very surprised to see all the applications it has been a part of - most of which have nothing to do with being ill. Great discussion of topics as diverse as how studying e.coli paved the way for genome mapping to the intelligent design argument in Dover, PA. Highly recommended!"
4,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59660476-costin-manda,5,"At first I thought this will rehash the same information I've got from books I've read recently: how microorganisms are everywhere and how they live in symbiosis and cooperation with themselves, plants and animals, how the imbalance in the ecosystem is what we normally get to call disease, maybe some epidemics stories and so on. Instead I've got an ode to E. Coli and how studying it for decades has revealed to us in details the way life works. It's Carl Zimmer's multifaceted portrait of a single species of bacteria (although that's a lot of bacteria, if you get to read the book).Well written even if more technical than the average popular science book, Microcosm explains how heredity works, DNA, RNA, proteins, amino acids, bacteria, biofilms, archaea, eukaryotes, viruses, plasmids, mutations, evolution, resistance and so on until it gets to creationists, genetic engineering and exobiology, all while following our scientific history built on the study of this one bacteria, the workhorse of microbiology. In fact, it is so focused on E. Coli, that it snubs most other bacteria, it talks little of epidemics or the microbe ecosystem and instead focuses on how things work. It's like an engineer's view on how life works, or a user's manual for Escherichia coli.I liked the book and I will probably read more from the same author. I mean, if he writes a book per microbe species I could read his books until one of us dies :) I highly recommend it not only for its subject, but also for how it makes clear the inner workings of life and evolution. I would have loved to read this book when I was 12."
5,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8464281-darnell,4,"I've found some of Zimmer's work too introductory, but this one goes into greater detail without losing the clarity and readability. "
6,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7029980-katie-doing-dewey,4,"Microcosm is a history of E. coli but more than that, it’s a history of modern biology. So much of what we do in the lab today depends on these little bacteria that looking at biology through the lens of E. coli lends itself well to discussing almost all of modern microbiology. It also includes a few philosophical musings and, at the other end of the spectrum, some practical insight into the job of a microbiologist.I picked up Microcosm in part because the description compares the book to Lives of a Cell, which I loved. So when they Microcosm turned out to be less elegantly written, less thoughtful, and clunkier in its transitions from philosophy to real world observations… let’s just say this book and I started out on the wrong foot. Fortunately, the rest of the book, while different from what I expected, was still able to mostly win me over.Some of the introductory material was explained very well, with analogies that captured the important information without implying anything inaccurate. Although I can’t be sure, I felt like other parts of intro weren’t explained well enough for someone without a science background to pick up on the important things. However (and this is the part that makes this a 4 star reviews) the more cutting edge information and all of the fun facts later in the book were very well done. I already know something about the basics of E. coli and I still learned all sorts of new things about how they function and about how they contribute to science. I also thought it was brilliant and unusual to include some details of the lab work which involves E. coli. For that reason, I would particularly recommend this to someone considering work in microbiology, since it gives some insights into what that’s like.This review first published on Doing Dewey."
7,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4696922-ushan,4,"E. coli is a bacterium, a member of the domain of life whose most recent common ancestor with us eukaryotes lived perhaps 3 billion years ago. It shares most, though not all, biochemical mechanisms with the rest of Earth life (as Nobel Prize-winning biologist Jacques Monod put it, what is true of E. coli is true of the elephant), but it is quite simple, with 4000 genes to our 30000, so it has served as a model organism for 20th- and 21st-century biology. Biologists have used E. coli to prove that genetic mutations are independent of selection, that genes can turn other genes on and off, that viruses can transfer genes from one species to another. Genetically modified E. coli produce industrial quantities of insulin for diabetics, but there probably wouldn't be as many diabetics without cheap high-fructose corn syrup, which is also produced in industrial quantities from corn starch treated by bacterial enzymes. Nowadays E. coli is used in synthetic biology; an experiment recording the evolution of 12 populations of the bacterium has been going on for the last 21 years, or 45000 generations; significant evolution has been observed. The flagellum of E. coli also figured during the Dover, PA trial that was deciding whether or not intelligent design can be taught in an American public school."
8,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1081475-jessie,5,"It is easy, when reading a book that's about your particular field of intense interest, to close the last page with mixed feelings. Sometimes the books are so in depth that you feel sorry for any poor soul who happened to meander into them. Other times, you can't help but quibble about what was put into (or perhaps left out). So I think I can say it was with rare pleasure that I closed this book with a big goofy grin on my face.I'm a microbiologist-in-training, and to start out with, it's rare to find a book that manages to convey the amazingness of microbes! I think that from now on, when people ask me, with that touch of ""what's wrong with you?"" in their voice why I went into microbiology, I'll refer them to this book. Because frankly, bacteria are cool.Secondly, I'd just like to make it clear that in this book you aren't just getting a bunch of cool little stories - you're getting a lot of cutting edge research. Littered throughout this book are stories by microbiologists give standing room only talks at other universities. There are references to papers that were covered in both of my graduate microbiology classes. There are discussions that are similar to those that came up while I was studying for my general examination. In short, READ IT."
9,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1858131-philip,4,"I just got this book for Christmas and polished it off in a couple of days. I'm not sure that I'm really the typical reader in this case, as I work in the biological sciences and have done some work with E. coli (it's hard to do molecular work these days without it). So comparatively few of the actual facts were new to me. What were new, and what really kept me enthralled, were the experiments that established those facts, the fundamentals of not only microbiology, but genetics, and evolution.In some ways, the book was both too focused and too broad. The focus on E. coli, while inarguably a useful tool, does inevitably result in an incomplete story of any given facet of science. And yet, I sometimes felt like I was rushing through almost the entire field of biology, trying to hit all the main points but never lingering long enough on any of them. It's not a long book, and it could have been longer, I think, though to do so might have risked beating the E. coli theme to death a bit too much.Regardless, I thoroughly this book--it has been a while since a non-fiction book kept sucking me back to read a page here and a page there in down moments throughout the day, or up to 3am."
10,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4073273-roy-klein,5,"This is the second book I've read by Carl Zimmer, and so far he's consistently captivating, mind provoking and thorough. I'm a fan of popular science, and I'm surprised how unfamiliar Zimmer seems to be in the field. I haven't seen book stores carring his books, or his name mentioned in lists, among the likes of Simon Singh. That's a shame, because his work deserves much more recognition than it gets. I'm a product of a fairly shallow educational system that did almost nothing to teach me biology or chemistry. In fact, I believe I've learned more biology by watching Once upon a time: Life, a French animated show about the human body, than I have in the entirety of my school years. I came out of school thinking that biology is a dry and mechanical subject. After reading this book, I'm glad to have been proven wrong. The amazing inner-working of cells pop out of the pages and makes you want to grab a microscope. In fact, the only downside of the book is that it contains no illustrations, and I would've loved to have a few. "
11,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13472185-andrej-karpathy,4,"This is a good exploration of E. coli bacteria / associated topics for a layman, and a pleasant read overall. The book begins with a brief description of historical context under which E. coli bacteria was discovered, but quickly transitions to describe the life of E. coli. An amazing picture of a complicated and intricate molecular machine emerges. The book goes on to describe populations of E. coli, their chemical warfare/symbiosis, different strains, genetics, and (inevitably) evolution. It finishes with synthetic biology and societal considerations regarding our present use of E. coli through genetic engineering. I knew a lot already but I imagine that for someone who does not know much about molecular biology, genetics or evolution this will be a dense but exceptionally rewarding read."

16,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7069868-john,4,"E. Coli, in Carl Zimmer's hands, is a fascinating creature, which by having several features suitable for study, has made it one of the best understood creatures in the world. It is small enough to understand the entire scope of the organism, genetically brief enough to gather a complete genetic sequence of, grows prolifically enough to demonstrate great genetic diversity from even a small initial sample, and lives short enough to evolve strains. Yet, it is complex enough to have extremely sophisticated means of maintaining its own integrity, including maintaining an electrical charge to ward away loads and storing a genetic code longer than it is via an elaborate clamping mechanism that must be undone in a very precise way during reproduction. It also is fantastically diverse, with many strains ordinarily found in our bowels, but some causing terrible illness; some forming biofilms and others weapons. It has a genetic core, but also adapts to its situations with horizontal gene transfer. This understanding of E. Coli, as an experimentally friendly substrate for understanding a wide array of biological phenomena, has lead it to it being adapted as the most common substrate for genetic engineering and synthetic biology. Today, a great number of drugs are synthesized with its aide. Yet, though this new role started with a debate about the appropriateness of this role, this debate quickly fell by the wayside as careers could be made. Here, we see the evolutionary capability of E. Coli playing out socially: in a hostile environment, those who want to use its adaptability themselves adapt.By and large, this book is well-organized, with a more introductory explanation of why we study E. Coli and the historical origins of that study coming up front, a more detailed explanation of those mechanisms and more current developments in the middle, and applications of E. Coli and their social dynamics occurring near the end, with final thoughts about exobiology speculating about E. Coli's potential role in the broader universe. Occasionally, I didn't feel like I knew where something was coming from, and the ordering of some of the material was a little arbitrary. Some sections also went a little long. However, in general, the writing was quite captivating and for the most part one really enjoyed the ride.Overall, it is a very interesting peek into a tiny creature. You will better understand the richness of life even for bacteria, and have an even stronger appreciation for the sophistication and synchrony that must underpin the lifespans of larger creatures such as ourselves."
17,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54481000-fahim-khan,5,"E.coli is always a fascination for a microbiology student. Everyday, when we read our textbooks, it is quite abnormal for us if we don't go through the name of E.coli at least once in the whole time. E.coli is like a friend to us. So, for knowing this friend a little bit deeper, microcosm of Carl Zimmer was my best shot.This book is based on the history, present and future of E.coli and its journey towards greatness. Most of the incredible discovery about bacteria and prokaryotic organisms were done by studying this little fella. This book works like a biography. Like somebody is making you sit tight on the veranda on a load shedding night and telling you his life story. I learnt a great deal from it. I came to know about some new things and new subjects of biology which was quite fantastic.This is one of the best book ever written on any bacteria and writing style is quite amazing!"
18,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91881072-paul-norwood,4,"The book pretty much says exactly what it promises to do, which is talk in detail about E. coli and modern microbiology and genetic work. I really enjoyed Carl Zimmer's book on viruses (a slender thing that I keep on my shelves and refer to from time to time), and this was also good, although more narrative and much less well illustrated. I think he's an effective science writer.I, for one, would have paid extra to have this printed in color with diagrams and organized more like a textbook. I know - not gonna happen for $16 so this is what we get!I am not well-versed in genetics so I should have read more closely at times. At one point the author explains how plasmids work and I thought ""ha! I just read about plasmids somewhere else - I can just skim this section."" WRONG! Plasmids kept coming up again and again, and that was my one time to have it explained. Oh, well... He does explain everything, but he does not go back and explain it again so dabblers beware!"
19,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87142-angela,4,"An extremely well-written peek into the world's most topical microbe, e. coli and its bad-boy cousins. Oh boy, did I learn some things. Primarily that e. coli, along with many bacteria, possess amazing machinery in their flagella. They basically have a driveshaft and a motor. E. coli can self-direct their own mutations, not to mention they can trade genetic codes like so many passing germs. In short, evolution, natural selection, and nature are amazing."
20,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7009422-zay,5,"A must read for anyone that are interested in biology, curious or as an introduction to the micro-world. Carl Zimmer has a wonderful way of describing biological phenomenons so that anyone can understand them. Zimmer keeps the writing light while simultaneously tackling heavy subjects such as evolution and religion. The information is delivered as wonderfully clear pictures with a few poetic strokes as he holds up his plate of E. coli. "

23,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93617562-keith-wheeles,4,"Fascinating, well-written."
24,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1472897-laura,4,"I'm a big fan of Carl Zimmer. His blog, The Loom ( http://www.scienceblogs.com/loom ) is always great for keeping up with scientific developments in words that a layperson can understand, and his other books (I've read Parasite Rex, 
At the Water's Edge
, and 
Soul Made Flesh
) have been quite good. His newest book, on the bacterium E. coli, was also an enjoyable and educational read. I find I get the most out of science writing when it's on a subject outside my expertise. I loved Parasite Rex for this reason, since parasitology is often overlooked in biology classes, despite being completely fascinating. I'm in the middle of training to be a neuroscientist, so as you might imagine, I don't study many bacteria (they have no nervous system). I was fascinated to learn about the complicated genetic circuits that exist in such a simple organism. I knew some basic facts about E. coli from my genetics classes (operons, phages, plasmids, bacterial sex...), but I had never studied the mechanisms by which the germ senses chemicals in its environment and chooses its method of locomotion accordingly. These little bacteria, with only the most rudimentary of sensory organs, manage to locate food sources and move toward them, which is pretty amazing. They also form complicated bacterial ""cities,"" called biofilms, in which they seem capable of cooperation and altruism. All this, without so much as a nucleus! Some pretty impressive little cells.I also loved some of the personal details about scientists that get thrown into the story. People writing ""Hooray!"" in their notebooks when an experiment works, husband-and-wife teams cracking the genetic code of bacteria, experiments in seeing just how long an E. coli colony can live that span multiple generations of researchers. These little touches really make the book seem more real to me, as a scientist. I can almost smell the Luria broth.Some of the later chapters of the book tackle genetic engineering and synthetic biology, controversial scientific issues with E. coli at the heart of their biggest discoveries. While Zimmer covers some of the controversy, I would have enjoyed more discussion on this, and perhaps a little less of the basic genetics that I already knew. I'm a pretty specialized reader, though, and can appreciate how important that background knowledge is if one isn't already a biologist. Overall, I'd say this book makes for enlightening reading for anyone who's already a biology enthusiast, but perhaps might be a hard sell for non-bacteria fans. I still think Parasite Rex is Zimmer's most jaw-droppingly fascinating book, but I'd probably rate this one as his second best. Give it a read, why don't you?"
25,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1220249-oliver,4,"My review for the Sunday Times is now up on their site. Here's how it begins""If you are interested in how living things work down at the cellular level, then this is a good time to be alive. It is not, however, an equally good time to be reading popular-science books. While evolution gets a lot of ink devoted to it, in part because it is fascinating and in part because some people, absurdly, continue to see it as problematic, the molecular processes that evolution shapes go comparatively unsung. Books seeking to explain quarks or superstrings are easy to find, reflecting the belief that physics is more profound the smaller the scale at which it occurs. But a similar approach doesn't hold for biology, and books seeking to explain the building of a cell wall, or the mechanics of replicating a DNA molecule, or the central importance of adenosine triphosphate to everything you will ever do, are hard to come by.""This is one of the reasons why Carl Zimmer's elegant and engaging Microcosm is so welcome. The promise of the title is that highly specific knowledge about the workings of one unobtrusive and unspectacular creature can reveal fundamental things about the world at large, and the promise is fulfilled in more ways than most readers would, I suspect, think possible. It shows quite nicely that, in the right hands, molecular biology is a lot more revealing about life in general than particle physics is about stuff in general.""and ends""In metaphor, though, he comes up with turns of phrase and images that are deep delights. The ways in which the structure of the cell depends on the tempo of different molecular processes give it a “geography of rhythms”; the building of a flagellum, which takes longer than the bacterium's replication, is like building a medieval cathedral, in that “a new microbe inherits a partially built tail and passes it on, still unfinished, to its descendants”. (Another flagellar delight is the way in which Zimmer shows that, far from being a structure that could not evolve stepwise, as proponents of intelligent design would have you believe, this complex corkscrew actually reveals its evolved status clearly down at the molecular and genetic level.) Perhaps the phrase that will resonate with me longest, though, is the one he uses to frame the discussion of E. coli as a workhorse of biotechnology and a proving ground for the more ambitious redesigns of life - “playing nature” - so much richer in its implications than the tediously Faustian “playing God”. If you want to get a clearer idea of the sort of nature that science can now play with, this is the book for you."""
26,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1288738-junx,4,"My introduction to this book was via the Scienceblogs book club. They talked about it at length and I found the discussion incredibly interesting. Particularly the discussion on Richard Lenski's publishing of his research whereby he observed E. coli evolve the ability to consume the citrate medium they found themselves in.The fact that E. coli lives within us, and almost no one takes notice is an amazing fact in and of itself. Though it can be (and is) argued that we would not be here were it not for E. coli.I learned so much regarding how experiments are designed to learn about different aspect of the E. coli genome and how biologists have been teasing apart secrets of life from this tiny organism. While it may be the most intensely studied organism on the planet, next to ourselves, there are still some secrets to be unlocked from the folds of its' proteins.One item I would like to highlight is the creation of a debate that, in reality, does not exist. The followers of ""intelligent design"" claim that biology is in a crisis because the theory of evolution is unreliable. They claim that it cannot explain the appearance of the bacterial flagella, for example. This book dispels, once again, the myth of intelligent design and irreducible complexity, but goes one further; it shows what the true debates within the scientific community really are.Truly a remarkable book, well-written, extensively researched and a true pleasure to read. This final quality is one which I have found few books to accomplish and am thrilled to have discovered yet another."
27,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385097-harry-rutherford,3,"The bacteria Escherichia coli is best known for occasionally causing food poisoning outbreaks, but most strains of it are harmless and indeed a normal part of our gut flora. It's also one of the most-studied life forms on earth because, like fruit flies and white mice, they are used as a standard laboratory research subject. So Zimmer has been able to use E. coli as a way of looking at a whole range of related topics: evolution, cell biology, genetic engineering and so forth.As I would expect from him, he writes clearly and well, and the book is certainly interesting, but I wasn't as excited by it as I expected. The material was broadly familiar: I wouldn't claim to know the subject well — I only know the bits and pieces I've picked up in other popular science books and New Scientist — but there weren't that many wow moments when I learnt something surprising and new. Or perhaps it's just that I'm not too excited by bacteria.I do tend to find microbiology rather hard going. It's not that it's too conceptually difficult, I think, at least at the level it's being presented here; it just doesn't seem to stick in my head. I think it's partially that I can't visualise the action, and partially that there are all these long names for enzymes and proteins and I can't keep track of them.This book is pretty good, but if you haven't read anything by Zimmer, I'd suggest you read Parasite Rex first, because that's one of my favourite science books ever."
28,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27632481-li-l-vishnu,2,"This book has some very fun things to say about natural selection and the movement of genes across species. Particularly the stories about viruses and DNA.Incidentally, I have a hard time with figures like virus spreading genes ""4 quadrillion times each second"" beneath the ocean. And estimating the beginnings of life and so on. Astronomic numbers get thrown around so casually that they really lose their meaning. That part of it comes off vague and fuzzy.The narrative was really formulaic as well. There's no doubt the author loves every detail of this adventure. For me, it it all wound up as a string of results from experiment after experiment. Maybe if it was interspersed with dialogue from the scientists or some poetic visualization of the beings at hand. I felt I could forecast each chapter's future since each experiment's conclusion led into the next. Obviously he couldn't have left gaping holes around. So, I don't know what could have satisfied.Really, though, what am I doing telling a science author how to write? Surely criticism is the cardinal sin of our time. It is a plaque and I can't believe I was tricked into doing this by the Goodreads empty box!At least I know someone else who loved this book, so let's just let them cancel my complaints out. I'm fine with that."
29,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/216284-mark,4,"Carl Zimmer is one of my favorite science writers, precisely because I know how difficult it is to walk the fine line between explaining the intricacies of science and not overwhelming readers with abstruse detail. In general, Zimmer does a fine job of this in Microcosm, in which he explores just how important the humble, ubiquitous bacterium E. Coli has been in everything from understanding how evolution works to how diverse life is to how to produce valuable drugs through genetic engineering.There are a few times, particularly early on in the book, when Zimmer seems to stumble a bit, leaving gaps or dead-ends in his explanations. But the book picks up steam and power as it rolls along, and the chapters in which he describes how bacteria have developed drug resistance, how E. Coli and its whiplike flagellum became the centerpiece of America's most famous Intelligent Design court case and how E. Coli tells us what we have to fear and not fear from genetic engineering, all near the end, are particularly powerful.If nothing else, this book will completely redefine your ideas of how distinct different creatures are from each other, and how much of our own genetic material is made up of DNA we have borrowed or expropriated from other organisms."

Though it’s probably most commonly associated with fecal-borne illness, most strains are harmless.In Microcosm, Carl Zimmer explores both the function of E. coli and its prodigious role in scientific discoveries.

The take away message being that there’s a lot going on biochemically within the lowly E. coli that has a lot to teach us about biological processes and ourselves. There’s quite a bit of good information to be found, though for me the book dragged a bit at times, particularly in the sections in which Zimmer delved into the biochemistry of a particular process.

269,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26228989-elizabeth,2,"A mildly interesting look at the various things we've learned about life through the study of e. coli. This book isn't particularly well-organized or engaging, but it's not a bad foundation for further talks on transgenics and the definition of life."
270,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"E. coli is a rod-shaped bacterium that, if you take a look, you’ll find in your lower intestines, as will every other warm-blooded mammal. It’s been widely studied and this intensive scrutiny has led to significant scientific discoveries in the fields of genetics, medicine, microbiology and biotechnology. Though it’s probably most commonly associated with fecal-borne illness, most strains are harmless.In Microcosm, Carl Zimmer explores both the function of E. coli and its prodigious role in scientific discoveries. The take away message being that there’s a lot going on biochemically within the lowly E. coli that has a lot to teach us about biological processes and ourselves. There’s quite a bit of good information to be found, though for me the book dragged a bit at times, particularly in the sections in which Zimmer delved into the biochemistry of a particular process. "
271,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/819313-arlene,4,"This book can be read on two levels. It is almost a primer on cellular and molecular biology; and if you wade through all the details you will come away with a lot of knowledge on the subject. For those not so scientifically minded there is still a great deal to be learned from this book. The interrelatedness of all life on earth, being the main point here. The author also fleshes out a great argument to use against those who would still deny evolution and embrace creationism. I found it at times fascinating and at other times just too bogged down. It still deserves four stars for the uniqueness of its presentation and the wonderful insights about life that the reader will discover."
272,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/825885-mazola1,4,"A look at life, evolution and death from the point of view of the common gut bateria, e. coli. The natural history of this surprisingly complicated little survivor is sketched, from its beginnings billions of years ago to its central role in today's brave new world of biotechnology. Along the way, Zimmer treats the reader to lessons on how living things adapt to survive and compete with each other, how much all forms of life have in common, the fuzzy line between living and non-living, and some truly difficult bio-ethical issues raised by modern techniques of genetic engineering. While it's readily understandable for a reader with some science background, it might be a bit of a rough read for others. "
273,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4651295-jason-furman,5,"An outstanding book, highly recommended. I loved his Parasite Rex years ago and this is much better than that book -- or at least than my memory of that book. It is an intensive look at E. coli, everything from the details of how we have learned about it, how it functions, how it has evolved, what we understand about it genetics, the role it plays in normal human functioning and human disease, how it is being used to produce new proteins and provide the basis for synthetic life.All along the way you get to feel like you know E. coli (albeit with a bit too much anthropomorphizing at times) and are getting an illuminating window into a number of subjects, some familiar and some unfamiliar. Much more successful than many ""how the tricycle changed the world"" types of books."
274,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24740156-yusef-vazirabad,4,"Although the book is slightly dated as of this writing (2008), Zimmer has quite a way with words. His prose is excellent and keeps everything simple for non-scientists. As a student of the biological sciences, at times he glossed over experimental details that I had to know of due to curiosity, but that is due to my background and is not a fault of the author.Even so, I never fully understood the mechanism of how artificial selection pressure causes hyper-mutation in bacteria, and Zimmer eloquently described it in a way that is comprehensible to all who read it. All in all, a wonderful book that I would recommend to all students of biology, medicine, or just someone who desires to know more about how these organisms keep us alive and make us deathly ill. "
275,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/955795-jennifer,5,"Brilliant! I found out about Carl Zimmer from his collection of Science Tattoos. I began following his blog, The Loom, and found his writing to be interesting and very readable. A colleague of mine and I started talking about him (she had recently gotten a science tattoo!) and she highly recommended Microcosm.A short summary would be either how E. coli changed the world, or it could be how the world changed E. coli. Science, research, disease, ethics, possibilities, consequences, history, space, and more are captured in this book. It's a fantastic book. "
276,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2996674-jeff,3,"This book was a disappointment for me. I found it to be filled with poorly described science and bad analogies. For example, ""... a University of Alabama microbiologist created a superfeeble strain that was a hundred million times weaker than K-12"" is a meaningless sentence with no definition of ""weak"", or comparisons of cell pathways to the internet that, in my opinion, makes no sense and serves no purpose. The author appears to not really understand the science all that well. I don't exactly regret reading it, and I definitely enjoyed parts of it, but I don't think it lived up to the high praise it received, and it wouldn't make my list of 'best in life-sciences'. "
277,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2037363-amy,2,"A breezy and entertaining look at the history and importance of one of the most famous bacteria of all time. The interesting asides, metaphors, and cross-species connections drawn by Microcosm kept the book charming and light, while the brief stops for ""serious"" science made it about as educational as my genetics textbook. The cultural sections were new to me and I loved reading about the furor over E. coli sex, genetic engineering, and chimeras. Unfortunately, the sections on E. coli's biology were mainly a review of AP Bio, so they tended to drag a bit."
278,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3700843-tom,3,"A discussion on the history and contributions of E. Coli. The history is two fold: one the one part is its evolution (including the cross strain and cross species genetic contributions) and the second part is thoat of its discovery, its study, and its use in the study of genetics. I always knew E. Coli was a lot more complicated than its ourward appearance, but this book shed light on a lot of aspects. It does digress some (like the discussion of entropy is not necessary) and some places it seems to anthropomorphise the bacteria (but the latter might just to improve the readability?)."
279,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/728874-andrea,5,"As someone who never got into biology in school, this was an excellent look into just how fascinating the field can be. Who knew that E. coli led such varied and fascinating lives? Zimmer writes clearly enough for any non-scientists to follow along and be thrilled by the discoveries he chronicles. The book is also an excellent guide to how evolution works and clears up many misconceptions people have about the theory."
280,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/369112-melody,4,"Zimmer writes clearly and well. I've been reading his blog for some time and was glad to pick this up when it came out. It's a huge subject, and Zimmer does a fine job of giving enough information about many facets of the science happening around E. coli without swamping one in data. He's engaging and obviously passionate about his subject. I learned a lot about genetic engineering from this book. Highly recommended."
281,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/142028-raphael-rosen,4,"My favorite part of this book was its structure. I loved how Carl Zimmer used E. coli as a lens to examine many aspects of life. I thought that, in general, this was a good way to create a science narrative: focus on one organism, and then use that organism to explore larger issues.My least favorite part of this book was the consistently short sentence lengths. I would have appreciated more variety. Otherwise, it's a good read."
282,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,2,"The life and times of E. coli. If you want a genetic breakdown and history of E. coli, one of the most closely studied organisms on the planet, this will provide that, but it's about as much fun as reading a textbook.Almost made it to chapter four before I gave up due to complete boredom.Fun fact: Thomas Escherich, a German pediatrician, discovered E. coli in 1885, but named it Bacterium coli communis. In 1918, it was renamed in his honor: Escherichia coli."
283,037542430X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1844522-christopher-mcilroy,5,"Like its subject, this book packs compendious content efficiently within its confines. As Zimmer demonstrates, E coli is far more than a danger lurking in some undercooked hamburger meat. It's a fantastically complex organism whose antecedents reach back to the dawn of life. It has become a favorite subject for those studying evolution, life's processes, and biotechnology. A fascinating, illuminating book, engagingly written."
